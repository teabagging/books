Every chapter is devoted to a vegetable. The first two pages provide important information like what to look for in a ripe (fill in the vegetable) and when its growing season is. The recipes follow. He provides such novel ways of preparation and offers great suggestions for spicing them. My hubby has actually gotten to like veggies he never enjoyed previous to my purchasing this book. It is a great \\"go to\\" book to add to your cooking collection."},{"Title":"Vegetables Every Day: The Definitive Guide to Buying and Cooking Today's Produce With over 350 Recipes","review":"After hearing an interview with Jack Bishop on NPR, my wife and I were intrigued enough to order the book. Four of the five recipes we've tried thus far have been outstanding, to the point where we're building entire meals based on them. For instance, we both like broccoli, but didn't know the best way to cook it. Now we do. I've never liked green beans, but we tried Bishop's recipe for roasting them, and I'm suddenly hooked! In short, if you've been wanting to bring more vegetables into your diet, buy this book!"},{"Title":"Vegetables Every Day: The Definitive Guide to Buying and Cooking Today's Produce With over 350 Recipes","review":"First, I would like to note that I am an experienced cook with an advanced knowledge of vegetables so please keep that in mind while reading my review. Someone with less experience in the kitchen will definitely get even more out of this book than I did.Good news: Jack Bishop brings with him the credibility of being a part of the Cook's Illustrated staff. To those unfamiliar with their work this means that the recipes are diligently tested over and over to achieve optimum cooking technique and flavoring. Furthermore, I was impressed with the variety of vegetables this book contained. The expected veggies are include in addition to the more unusual such as malanga, boniato, sorrel, salsify, etc... which altogether add up to over 60 different vegetables. Each vegetables 'chapter' begins with a description of the veggies origin, flavor, availability and how to select, store, prepare and cook it. This is followed by several recipes. Some of my favorites include: \\"Roasted Asparagus with Peanut Sauce, Stir-Fried Asparagus with Basil and Spicy Orange Sauce, Broccoli with Spicy Balsamic Dressing and Black Olives, Braised Brussel Sprouts with Mustard Cream Sauce, Sauteed Chayote with Fresh Corn, Chile and Oregano, Soy Braised Collards with Five-Spice Powder, Corn and Mushroom Saute, Cucumber-Watermelon Salsa, Grilled Eggplant Salad with Thai Flavors, Green Beans and Corn with Tomato-Herb Vinaigrette, Jicama and Carrot Salad with Ginger-Sesame Vinaigrette, Shredded Kohlrabi with Butter and Parmesan, Mexican Mushroom Soup with Chiles, Tomatoes and Cilantro, Grilled Plantains with Citrus Glaze, Roasted Radishes with Soy and Sesame Seeds, Taro Soup and Butternut Squash Soup with Cider and Cardamom\\". As you can see there is much to love!And now for the bad news: I had three problems with this book that prevented me from rating it five stars. But first I want to be clear that I am not saying any recipe is bad. It is just that...1. I found some of the recipes way to basic, therefore wasted space. On the other hand, for those new to cooking (or unfamiliar with the \\"Best Recipe Series\\" these will be great staples and very valuable. Examples would be: \\"Baked Potatoes, Roasted Red Peppers, Grilled Artichokes, Steamed Artichokes, Grilled Zucchini, etc... However, I was really looking for recipes that went beyond the ordinary and presented veggies in new and exciting ways.There were also several well known recipes included, even though they are well done, they are common. Examples would be: \\"Potato Salad, Ratatouille, Basic Guacamole, Carrot Salad, Brussel Sprouts with Bacon, etc... again great in composition but not useful to an established cook (see my introductory note).2. I found some of the recipe ideas to be a little repetitive. For instance there are several recipes for vegetables with a \\"Mustard Cream Sauce\\" that only vary slightly. Also the recipe for \\"Curried Carrot Soup\\" and \\"Curried Parsnip Soup\\" to be very similar.3. Lastly my biggest disappointment was the photography, or rather the lack thereof. Other than a few small single-hued sketches the book is devoid of any pictures. This is by no means a reflection of Jack Bishops culinary abilities, rather an err in design. As you may know we eat with our eyes first and boy am I hungry. Or maybe I am just being too demanding??? :)All told this is an EXCELLENT book. And despite my particular disappointments there is NOT a bad recipe to be found in this delicious ode to the flavorful world of vegetables."},{"Title":"Vegetables Every Day: The Definitive Guide to Buying and Cooking Today's Produce With over 350 Recipes","review":"The book is not just a simple compilation of recipes, but also includes information on how to buy and store each vegetable. The book also discusses the various cooking methods (poaching, steaming, braising, grilling, broiling, etc.) and how they affect the flavor.Even if you don't use a single recipe in this book, you will still benefit from the basic preparation instructions given for each vegetable.This book will also give you the information you need to try out the produce that you've previously bypassed in the store because you had no idea how to pick it out or prepare it."},{"Title":"Vegetables Every Day: The Definitive Guide to Buying and Cooking Today's Produce With over 350 Recipes","review":"\`Vegetables Every Day' is by Jack Bishop, a very intelligent craftsman of cookbooks similar to James Peterson, Molly Katzen, Rose Levy Beranbaum, and Pam Anderson. Each is skillful at creating very useful reference books on various aspects of cooking. And, it should be no surprise that both Bishop and Pam Anderson are current or past senior staffers at \`Cooks Illustrated' magazine.It is a great treat to have two of these skillful authors both do excellent books on vegetables, and to have the two books done from two so different points of view that one will feel no pangs of waste by owning both. Bishop's book is certainly the more accessible of the two, as the material is presented in a very straightforwardly encyclopedic presentation. There are uniform articles on 66 different vegetables, a veritable celebration of the variety of vegetables available through part or all of the year round. Among these 66, there are the old favorites such as broccoli, carrots, celery, mushrooms, potatoes, tomatoes, and onions. Alongside these there are new favorites brought to our attention by hours of watching Mario Batali, Bobby Flay, and Jaime Oliver such as Artichokes, Broccoli Rabe, Cardoons, Celery Root, Dandelion Greens, Fava Beans, Fennel, Soybeans, Turnips, and Zucchini. At the far end of familiarity are Boniato, Burdock, Calabaza, Chayote, Jerusalem Artichokes, Kohlrabi, Malanga, Sorrel, Taro, and Yuca. These are the veggies which should be approached with one of my favorite Alton Brown \`Good Eats' moments when he recommends that you walk into your megamart with fresh eyes on the lookout for unfamiliar products and investigate what can be done with these little gems.Bishop is not only intent on providing things to do with newly available produce, he is intent on making cooking all vegetables, especially the old standards with a new set of recipes to make them more interesting and to make cooking them more fun. One excellent case in point is asparagus that everyone either boils or steams and dresses with some creamy sauce. Since everyone already knows how to do this, Bishop doesn't bother to give recipes for these. Rather, his nine asparagus recipes include three roasting methods, a grilling recipe, two sautee recipes, a recipe with Chinese noodles, a recipe with a vinaigrette, and an asparagus frittata.Every article, regardless of how many recipes may be given, has the same seven (7) paragraphs in the introductory article. The first paragraph simply introduces you to the vegetable and gives you a general idea of the appeal and usability of the vegetable. The next paragraph on availability gives the best season for the produce and whether or not the vegetable is currently available year round in American markets. The third paragraph on selection gives us criteria for whether we want to pick up today's selection of a species or let it alone. The paragraph on storage is especially useful, as there is probably very little wisdom handed down from your Eastern European grandma on storing tomatillos, taro, or jicama or from your Mexican mom on dealing with arugula, bok choy, or burdock. The basic preparation paragraph can be simple for leafy greens or very complicated for artichokes. The very short section on best cooking methods is primarily useful for totally unfamiliar vegetables. A very useful last entry gives recipes on other vegetables in which the titular ingredient appears.One may not think there is anything controversial about vegetables, but you may be surprised, especially if you read Bishop's and Peterson's books side by side. On the matter of asparagus, Bishop prefers thin to medium thickness stalks and prefers not to peel them. Peterson prefers medium to thick stalks and strongly recommends peeling the stalks. To a certain extent, this is a matter of personal preference, but much of this difference comes from the fact that Peterson is a former restaurant chef / owner while there is no record in Bishop's biographical information that he ever worked in a restaurant kitchen. If time is less important than money, then Peterson's position is definitely the better. If time is at a premium, Bishop's position may be preferable. On almost all other issues, the two authors agree.One corollary of Bishop's objective in preparing this book is that this is not a reference for the most commonly prepared recipes. But, this is not universally true. While the traditional steaming or poaching methods for asparagus is absent, classic mashed potatoes and the traditional Greek salad with tomatoes are here. Bishop is certainly on the side of the gourmet when it comes to discussing tomatoes. He is in love with fresh homegrown tomatoes in July and August, but recommends canned \`maters all other times of the year.One of the most enjoyable discoveries in Bishop's book is to find ways to treat certain vegetables in totally unexpected ways. Two cases are shallots and garlic. Both are most commonly thought of as herbs to enliven dishes where some other vegetable or protein is the main ingredient, but if you are willing to pay the price, shallots make a great main ingredient, not really much different in cost from, for example cippolini or wild mushrooms.In choosing between Bishop and Peterson, I find that Bishop is much better for the average cook who does not spend a lot of time reading cookbooks. The organization is much better for finding a good recipe for the veg that happened to be on special today. Peterson's book is much more oriented toward the foodie and the professional. It is organized more by method than by ingredient and it is much better at presenting instructions on difficult techniques such as cleaning an artichoke. Peterson has the one thing I miss the most in Bishop's book, which are good pictures of vegetables. Neither comes with the lyrics of Frank Zappa's \`Ask Any Vegetable'.Very highly recommended as a vegetarian and general cook's reference for recipes and buying advice."},{"Title":"Vegetables Every Day: The Definitive Guide to Buying and Cooking Today's Produce With over 350 Recipes","review":"This author was interviewed on National Public Radio awhile back, which motivated me to buy it. We eat a lot of veggies in our home, so I was very interested. Although many of the recipes are very basic, and I have better recipes myself, the background info he gives is invaluable! He tells you when the item is in season, where to find it, how it should look when you buy it, etc. He also discusses veggies that I would never have thought to look for, so he does a good job of expanding your horizons. A great cook book!"},{"Title":"Vegetables Every Day: The Definitive Guide to Buying and Cooking Today's Produce With over 350 Recipes","review":"I ordered this book because I want to make vegetables a central part of my meals. However, almost all of the recipes in this book are for vegetables as a side dish.If you want an \\"encyclopedia\\" of vegetables, with information on how to choose them, basic preparation and cooking, and which spices/herbs go best, then Vegetables Every Day is an excellent choice. But if you want a book full of recipes with vegetables as a main dish, then look elsewhere."},{"Title":"Vegetables Every Day: The Definitive Guide to Buying and Cooking Today's Produce With over 350 Recipes","review":"I don't know that I have much to add to the previous 23 reviews, but I cannot say enough positive things about \\"Vegetables Every Day.\\" I own 30-40 cookbooks and after five years of ownership this one remains by far the one I use most often -- multiple times every week.This cookbook is simply without peer for its incredible breadth of vegetable side-dish recipes; its ease of preparation, with minimal exotic, hard-to-find and hard-to-afford ingredients; and its healthful preparations that really highlight (rather than masking) the vegetables involved. Bishop is no fat-phobe, even calling occasionally for a tablespoon or two of butter, but these certainly aren't recipes where health takes a back seat to taste.Most importantly, though, this book succeeds by making EVERY vegetable lovable. I can't tell you how many vegetables I used to *think* I hated, before I tried them as prepared by Bishop. Beets, turnips, parsnips, cauliflower, kale -- he makes all not only palatable but wholly enjoyable. I can't recall ever having had a misfire with any recipe in this book, and by now I've probably made about two-thirds of them.I work in PR and have joked to friends (while proselytizing on behalf of Jack Bishop) that someday when I leave my current job I will go do PR on behalf of \\"Vegetables Every Day.\\" If you are a home cook who uses cookbooks, do yourself a favor and add this one to your collection."},{"Title":"Vegetables Every Day: The Definitive Guide to Buying and Cooking Today's Produce With over 350 Recipes","review":"I'm a reasonably decent home chef who's trying to expand his vegetable repetoire, and I love this book!The genius is the organization - by vegetable! Each chapter explains how to buy the vegetable, then gives you a half-dozen ways to prepare it. If you've ever felt lost or overwhelmed in the produce aisle (Can humans really eat kale? What can I do with jicama?), this book is for you. Or if you're just in a hurry (I need a side dish, and there's still broccoli in the fridge), turn to &quot;B&quot; and flip through a half-dozen recipes.I stopped using Deborah Madison's &quot;Vegetarian Cooking for Everyone&quot; after I got this book. Jack Bishop's approach is straightforward, easy to follow, and the recipes taste great the first time."},{"Title":"Vegetables Every Day: The Definitive Guide to Buying and Cooking Today's Produce With over 350 Recipes","review":"Jack Bishop, together with the rest of the Cook's Illustrated crew, can be seen each Saturday on most PBS affiliate stations in the marvelous tv show &quot; America's Test Kitchen&quot;. He has spent a lot of time in Italy (and obviously in the kitchen too) and is an expert on vegetable cooking in general and Italian cooking in particular. It should come as no surprise then that he is the author of this and several othe excellent cookbooks on Italian and vegetable (including Iialian- vegetarian) cooking.Mr. Bishop has a marvelous way of presenting recipes that are simple yet utterly delicious. His approach to cooking is thoroughly modern in terms of technique, even innovative at times, especially when simplyiying recipes for the modern kitchen. But in terms of flavor, he never strays from the classic and the authentic. There is nothing quirky in his carefully selected recipe offerings and taste is never sacrificed. As one reviewer noted when reviewing his &quot;Italian Vegetarian Cooking&quot; (an earlier cookbook), he doesn't take classic meat dishes and turn them vegetatarian (always a mistake) but instead offers delicious vegetable dishes that are part of the vast heritage of great Italian cooking. These dishes are well able to stand on their own as they've often had to do in Italy's frequent lean times, when meat has been scarce and expensive.The current book is a more encyclopedic vegetable guide and cookbook, but by no means a &quot;vegetarian &quot;one. Virtually every vegetable available in makets in North America today, including not only the well known ones, but also burdock, malanga, boniato, taro, yucca,cardoons and others are covered.The one puzzling aspect about this book however is that it doesn't cover all of the southern and cajun specialties like speckled butter beans, purple hull peas, lady cream peas, and butter peas; not to mention cucuzza (a three foot long squash introduced to cajun/creole cooking by Sicilian immigrants to Louisina) or cushaw (a gourd like winter squash also used by cajuns and creoles). Even everyday lima beans (as in succotash) receive no mention, though fava beans do. This is in spite of the fact that he offers southern approaches to cooking (ham hocks and all) in recipes for several different vegetables.While it's a puzzle, it doesn't detract from what is in this book, which is every thing else. If your a farmers market foody and want to make the most of what's out there or just love your vegetables don't hesitate to buy this book. A good southern and/or cajun cookbook should cover the rest.I also would just as strongly recommend &quot;The Best Recipe: Vegetables&quot; cookbook by the editors of Cook's Illustrated. Mr. Bishop is one of those editors and his influence is evident on every page. This too is an excellent cookbook. While it doesn' cover the full range of exotic vegetables that &quot;Vegetables Everyday&quot; does, it usually offers more (and more varied) recipes for the ones it does cover."},{"Title":"Vegetables Every Day: The Definitive Guide to Buying and Cooking Today's Produce With over 350 Recipes","review":"This unique cookbook, organized by vegetable, is invaluable. I keep it on my counter so when I open the refrigerator to prepare a meal and find only radishes, mushrooms, and/or celery in the vegetable bin, I can turn to that vegetable and find a delicious way to prepare it. I consult it when I want to know how to store a vegetable. I consult it when I've found a new-to-me vegetable in a recipe and have no clue how to select one in the grocery store. I've found many recipes that have become favorites. I couldn't believe how delicious asparagus is roasted. And it's the same with mushrooms; roasting concentrates their flavor amazingly; you'll never think of plain button mushrooms as boring again. I've served them to guests for appetizers; they always love them. And who would think to braise radishes?? It's a GREAT way to use those radishes that have been in the fridge for too long. There are lots of gems in this cookbook. It's one of my TOP FIVE COOKBOOKS that sit out on the counter and get used again and again. No glossy photos, just plain good advice on every page.Update 2010: Believe it or not, seven years later I stand by this review. This book has never left the top of my kitchen counter and I turn to it regularly. I'm just sayin ... :-)"},{"Title":"Vegetables Every Day: The Definitive Guide to Buying and Cooking Today's Produce With over 350 Recipes","review":"I also heard Jack Bishop on NPR and finally bought the book over a year later. I wish I had bought it immediately -- it has been a great investment, especially considering all of the vegetables I HAVEN'T had to throw out. For someone who isn't the most motivated cook (like me), the alphabetical organization is perfect. Got some broccoli in the fridge? Just look under &quot;B&quot; and you will find excellent, easy broccoli recipes with ingredients you have at home.

Incredibly easy to use, and gorgeous to boot. I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Vegetables Every Day: The Definitive Guide to Buying and Cooking Today's Produce With over 350 Recipes","review":"Lots of good recipes here and probably the best vegetable cookbook I've got.I am very happy that it deals with side-dishes rather than fiddly intimidating vegetarian tour de forces.If anything I would like to see even simpler preparations included. I know from experience a range of easily prepared yet inspiring vegetables on the table every night is delightful. The ideas for this however are not at all simple to obtain.I am quite happy about the lack of pretty pictures. So much information is needed that there simply isn't room, and this book educates about substance rather than presentation.But why only 4 stars?Well I don't think a 5 star vegetable cookbook has been written yet.In the past vegetable recipes have been a haphazard affair with some happy discoveries, but a failure to be really systematic.So what is needed is a systematic re-examination of vegetables from the ground up, yet incorporating the happy discoveries of previous cooks with modern health and creativity added. Jack's book doesn't quite get there and would really need to be doubled in size to achieve this task.The style of the majority of recipes involves the development of flavours with olive oil and browning techniques, but there are many other techniques I would enjoy seeing more fully developed, such as creative variations, hot or cold salads, oil-less recipes, use of a full palette of spices, and health discoveries such as dressings with flax seed oil."},{"Title":"Vegetables Every Day: The Definitive Guide to Buying and Cooking Today's Produce With over 350 Recipes","review":"This is my \\"go to\\" book when ever I have a vegatable I'm not sure how to prepare.

I initially got it because Jack is with Cooks Illustrated and just about everything CI does turns out. I met him at a cookbook signing years ago and he's a very nice and modest person who knows what he's talking about.Whenever I need a recipe for a specific vegetable, I first go to this book. It's easy to find a recipe because it's organized alphabetically by the veggie you're looking for. You don't have to check the index. I just had broccolini in a restaurant and liked it, so I found some in the store I go to and tried a recipe for it in Jack's book. It was broccolini with garlic and olive oil and chicken stock. It was wonderful. The garlic was so good, I ate that first. I was scraping the pan for each morsel of garlic that was left behind, and the broccolini was really good. I can hardly wait to make it again.Everything I have tried has been outstanding. It's hard to find a recipe for baby pattypan squash and his recipe is great. I've also tried the zucchini with parmesan cheese (the real stuff) where you broil the zucchini with the cheese on top. So good.There is nothing humdrum about these recipes. I am so glad I got this book and will be trying the arugula recipes soon. It's so much fun to discover a new yummy recipe. You will be pleased with each dish you make.

Each week when I get my box of veggies, I read those chapters and plan out what to cook all week - it's really fun.Although I would say that the recipes are hit-and-miss with my taste (none of them are bad, just a little boring), I'm learning tons about all the different ways to cook veggies.

It was a decade of greed, true enough, but also because of the messages the era of Reagan 'sublimininably' sent, in retrospect, it became a era of conservatives rallying to a divine purpose which nearest kinship was Nazi-ism, Fascism, Hitlerism...the Chosen Few was drafted to the top, as Tom Wolfe indicated,'Masters of the Universe'. It was Allan Bloom making a case for the return of classical, traditional education in the universities, it was Ben Stein (who, I hear recently is giving away money on a Comedy Channel gameshow) reflecting on how Hollywood created culture through the eyes of people who never, ever had to worry about being able to pay a telephone or a light bill, it was the appearance of AIDS and how the blindsidedness of many, many folks made it more deadly to millions of people, it was PJ O'Rourke and Eric Bogosian's biting satire, it was William Bennett's conservatism.

The amnesia of the protagonist presents an interesting twist, and gives Noon enough challenge to be worthy of writing about.As I've grown older, I've questioned the premise, and the writing style is no longer fluid to me, but like junk food, it is still fun to indulge in at times, and never fails to bring me back to my youth."},{"Title":"The Man Called Noon","review":"Many times in Louis L'Amour's novels and short stories characters are given the chance to start anew, to make a conscious choice. In THE MAN CALLED NOON this chance becomes the chief mystery of the book. The protagonist awakens from a sniper attack to find his memory gone. Fleeing to save his life, he finds conflicting evidence of who and what he was--or could be. Assisted by another outlaw, he takes on the name of Jonas and goes to an outlaw's hideout. The hideout is a once-legitimate ranch inherited by Fan Davidage. Jonas decides to help her out of her predicament. But it is not that simple. He discovers a hidden cabin of the hired killer, Ruble Noon, and the evidence points to Jonas. Further, he is haunted by the memory of being hired to kill four men and one woman. Does he return to his previous life, thereby saving Fan Davidage but losing her to the stigma of being a hired killer, or does he begin his life anew and risk being unable to save Fan? &quot;Then make a decision to start over,&quot; she said. &quot;No matter what you have been, you can always become something else.&quot; &quot;Is it that simple? Is a man ruled by his own free will, or is he composite of all his experiences, his education and heredity? I may not know what I am, but my flesh and blood do know, and they react the way they have been conditioned to react. My conscious mind was born only a a few days ago, but the habit patterns built into my muscles have forgotten nothing.&quot; Jonas finds he cannot abandon Fan to the outlaws, nor put aside his abilities as a gunfighter. Further, there is a fortune in gold hidden somewhere on the ranch, and other enemies ally with the outlaws to find it. Somehow Jonas must save Fan and the ranch, recover the lost gold--and find a way to live with what he is."},{"Title":"The Man Called Noon","review":"Louis L'Amour is the worlds greatest western author.Each ofhis novels is a marvelous adventure with the most descriptivetext.

Did he return to El Paso, Texas or did he decide to go off into another direction? Did he continue being a gunslinger or can one ever change from such a background? The questions go on and on.

The book goes into enough detail to give the reader a basic sense of how, when, and where to use the Kubotan, but doesn't really take it further. The pictures are a bit dated and do not show enough detail. I used the book as a primer before taking a class on this device and found it very helpful."},{"Title":"Official Kubotan techniques","review":"This booklet teaches the reader the official Kubotan techniques. The Kubotan is a 5 inch long sylinderical object, some inches in diameter you can use for pain compliance techniques. There are a handful of techniques, with some applications to certain real life situations (mostly applicable for police and correctional officers).The booklet has 56 pages, but the techniques do not start until page 20. Every technique is presented with several photographs, but these pictures are not very clear, not even the close ups. The techniques are instructed in captions, and while the text is somewhat clumsy, you can understand what the authors are saying. Overall, by the appearance of the booklet, you would guess it was printed in the 70's.The Kubotan does have some merit as a pain compliance instrument for police officers and the like, but in my opinion, the self defence techniques are not very realistic. There are some self defence techniques that will probably work (like defence against a bear hug), but they require that you have the Kubotan in your hand, or can get it in your hands while being held and/or thrown by the attacker. Since there are very good and realistic techniques for such situations that require no weapons at all, I much rather would use those techniques. The defences against kicks and punches are ludicrous.Overall, this book has some merit for police officers, correctional officers and the like. You don't even need the official Kubotan instrument, as you can use these techniques with a pen or similar object. However, the booklet is severely overpriced."},{"Title":"Official Kubotan techniques","review":"I am not a police or corrections officer, but if I were, I would be more satisfied with this book.

For example, how to use the kubotan to enforce compliance in a detainee being taken to court.On the other hand, I'm a civilian, interested in non-lethal self defense. The book didn't offer nearly as much for my use. Besides that, the first 20 pages or so are advertising for the authors' kubotan training programs, directed to police or corrections officers.

Chris Lindsay writes with wit and daring in a deceptively comic vein. The seemingly goofy, trivial protagonistJohnny Confusion masks the author's serious and substantial exposition of human cruelty: a relentless display of alternatingly random and reasoned suffering. Lindsay might be demonstrating, in a manic and modern way,Freud's sober notion that there is no such thing as nonsense: the characters in this story are illustrating, through their outlandish and barbaric behavior, that although there appears to be no moral dimension to humanactivity, a decidedly and tragically ethical system underlies each psychological impulse. The hero and villains of this tallest tale, the roles of protagonist and antagonist, seem to exchange places as Lindsay winds a convoluted, stream-of-consciousness narrative with profound theoretical implications. Ironically, in contrast to the work's title, this text might be considered a perversely formulated cautionary tale, an instruction guide to the etiquette of kindness."},{"Title":"Let Me Tell You About Jerks","review":"Well I am sure i am not jerk, this is what people say about me, so as i m not jerk, therefor, i have the liberty and privilage to read the book and found it amazingly interesting and informative. well u know it is hard to comment who is jerk and not but at least we all know and find many jerks in our life and this book is sure gona help all of us to know them more deeply and it is even better if u have to work with some jerks like i am doing right now, the reading of this book help a lot to deal with them.i strongly recommend all to read this book at least once in life to prepare yourself to deal with jerks which are common to find."},{"Title":"Let Me Tell You About Jerks","review":"This book is a very good look into the jerks of the world.

The main character in the book, Johnny Confusion, points the finger at the jerks of the world, but at the same time, he ironically points the finger back at himself.Chris Lindsay approaches this challenging issue, but in a lighthearted manner. If at first you don't see yourself, read it again....and try not to be a jerk about it.An enjoyable and refreshing read."},{"Title":"Let Me Tell You About Jerks","review":"Jerks...we all know them, and much to our consternation we just can't seem to get rid of them.

When Aristotle was convinced of something, he would go on and on and on until, finally, the audience was left speechless and convinced he was right. Chris Lindsay convinces us that Jerks do exist and lays out the fool-proof arguments. It's funny and true (unless you're a jerk)."},{"Title":"Let Me Tell You About Jerks","review":"The absurdity of \\"Let Me Tell You About Jerks\\" is due in part to the realization that the silliness speaks the irrepressable truth we all silently observe regarding our own superior race. The Jerks are out there - and are, to quote Mr. Wells, \\"slowly but surely drawing their plans against us.\\" Chris Lindsay has deftly catalogued the most well known statures of Jerkdom and penned their secrets for all the world to beware. Ranging from family to relationships, the Jerks are revealed. This brilliant piece of literature challenges readers to explore their own possible connections with Jerks, or, more unfortunately, Jerk DNA. Being the author of such a socially scandalous piece of writing, Mr. Lindsay has recently been accused of being a Jerk himself. This is a tactless, tasteless, and rude charge against a Non-Jerk composed from a mass of Jerks in denial. Christopher Lindsay, aside from possessing considerable amounts of shoehorns which he individually names and cares for, has assured me he is not a Jerk."},{"Title":"Let Me Tell You About Jerks","review":"This book is a challenging read but worth the effort as we go inside the mind of Johnny Confusion and his view of a world populated by jerks.

Only negative is shipping took longer than I expected it to. Still, the book was in fantastic condition for the price!"},{"Title":"Satan In Goray","review":"This novel is based on the historical occurrence of the appearance of the false messiah Sabbath Zevi and the mass following he generated .While the bare facts of the delusion may be true , I believe that the fleshing out of the characters, their thoughts and behaviour are a misrepresentation .'Satan in Goray' is set in the mid Seventeenth Century , and yet strongly reflects the Twentieth , especially drawing on I.B. Singer's life and milieu .It would be useful to read his autobiographical 'Love in Exile' together with the novelto see that Isaac Bashevis Singer had an axe to grind .Singer's parents were pious , learned Jews , and young Isaac defected from theessence of his forbears' religion , as did many of his peers , while retainingthe peripheral cultural artifacts and images which preoccupied his writings.This loss of faith prejudiced him and thus in 'Satan in Goray' he depicts hisancestors as superstitious , foolish to the degree of lunacy , cruel and violent , filthy and uncouth, as well as emotionally and sexually out of control . The wisdom , kindness and beauty of his heritage are not shown in the novel which is a caricature of the worst character traits in man .I refuse to believe the people of the shtetl were anything like that ! The few wise scholars in the book are just mentioned as such but do not flourish nor triumph .They appear as absolutely impotent and irrelevant .In the battle between good and evil , the evil is not defeated , it just collapses .The sect self destructs when Shabbatai converts to Islam .Singer plugs his vegetarianism in a bloody depiction of ritual slaughter as a filthy orgy of violence . He depicts Jewish parenting as ruthlessly cruel beyond plain child abuse . Rechele's upbringing is just unbelievably nightmarishly cruel ! Jewish parenting is not like that !Some may take pride in the award of a Nobel prize to Singer , but perhaps the Nobelcommittee was being ideological, by rewarding and promoting the denigration of Jewry as well as the rejection of core Jewish values .The novel is definitely not realistic fiction but grotesque fantasy and I suppose that , ifit is written as a work of art in that genre of horror fiction then as a work of art , whatever art is , it might be acceptable to some. The Shabbetai Tzvi phenomenon in the novel may also be read as metaphor for modern &quot;messianic&quot; movements e.g. Bolshevism or Stalinism which were part of Singer's milieu as described in his autobiography , and these certainly did take hold in a violent excessive fashion ."},{"Title":"Satan In Goray","review":"Consider that I.B. Singer wrote Satan in Goray at the age of 26 or so, and the impressiveness of this work becomes all the more clear. Few people of that age, or any age could evoke an historical era with such force or create a fractured narrative of such power. The world of religious conflict, superstition, and messianiac hysteria is Singer's main interest, subjects he would pursue for the rest of his life. Satan in Goray is a strong beginning, a prophetic book (written in the early 1930's) of a trapped people on the edge of a disaster.The book takes place as the Jews of Gory attempt to recover from the Chelmelnicki massacres of the 1640's (the worst disaster for the Jews between the Crusades and the Holocaust). The Jews of Poland believe that, as Christian would say, the End Times are here, and expect the messiah to arrive. Shabbati Shevi appears on the scene, claiming to be the messiah. Many Jews fall under his sway, but the Rabbi of Goray resists and this further wracks the town. As these political and social disasters are played out, a young orphan, Rechele, who is insane, becomes the center of interest of the town, as she is unmarried. When a holy man, Itche Mates, arrives in Goray, he marries the unfortuate Rechele, who proceeds to be posessed by Satan and do things that make Linda Blair in the Excorsist look amateur.The novel itself has some problems; it's birth as a serial leaves it episodic. One has the sense of threads stopping and starting without reason, and there really is not what could be called a plot. However, Singer's rich language, his pinpoint descriptions of people, places, and religious factions are stunning. Reading his work is an education.Satan in Goray is a look into the hearts of Polish Jews right before World War II. The sense of helpless claustrophobia is appalling, the whiff of death overwhelming here. Satan was not just in Goray, and Singer knew it."},{"Title":"Satan In Goray","review":"&quot;Satan in Goray&quot; is the first novel written by I.B.Singer and is characterized by its deep emotional and psychological content. Written at a time of troubles for the Jewish community in Eastern Europe, more specifically in Poland, it draws a parallel between the messianic disaster of Sabbatai Zevi and revolutionary ecstasies. In 1666, 18 years after the infamous Chmelniski massacres, a messianic movement developed in Eastern Europe, under the leadership of Sabbatai Zevi who proclaimed himself to be the long-awaited Messiah. The uncertainties and despair felt by the Jewish community, a deep-rooted belief in national redemption, and lack of strong traditional rabbinical leadership, all contributed to the initial success of messianism. The story takes place in a remote town by the name of Goray, and main character, a feeble-minded young woman by the name of Rechelle, personifies the forces of evil (messianism) taking root amongst the population and leading to the downfall of its members, bringing total chaos. I.B.Singer's story is an epic description of the struggle between the forces of evil and good, of reason and emotion, of traditional conservative Judaism and messianism. The narrative is strong, realistic, impulsive, almost suffocating; it truly depicts the spirit of collective hysteria."},{"Title":"Satan In Goray","review":"In 17th Century Poland, a small, beleagured Jewish community falls under the sway of a charismatic would-be messiah and begins to descend into anarchy. Singer relates his simple but powerful tale in stately, &quot;epic&quot; prose perfectly suited to his theme"},{"Title":"Satan In Goray","review":"When times are desperate as they have been in many eras and many places, people tend to resort to desperate measures. They cast their lot with prophets, dreamers, and seers who foretell a bright future--the coming of the millenium, it is often called----when all problems shall be solved, the rough made plain, the poor made rich, and sick shall be healed. Movements develop. They may die away in time or they may thrive and create great civilizations. Western civilization, after all, is based on one such movement. We generally refer to these movements as \\"cults\\", unless of course they are successful. In many, but not all, millenial movements, people anticipate the immanent arrival of the New Age so strongly that they throw away their possessions and engage in dissolute behavior: singing, dancing, drinking, engaging in previously-forbidden sex, and so on. Sometimes the \\"pure\\" remove themselves to isolated spots to await the end of the world or the Great Change, in extreme cases, they may even commit suicide. Anthropologists have studied many such groups or religions; others are found in history books or newspapers. Our times are not devoid of such groups: remember Jonestown, remember the Branch Davidians, remember that group that committed suicide in California. China (the Taiping), Brazil (Antonio Conselheiro),, Papua New Guinea (the cargo cults), Africa (many studies), Burma, Europe---the list is nearly endless. The Jews have not been immune either. In the 1660s the famous \\"false Messiah\\" arose in Turkey, claiming to be ready to lead the Jews to Judgement Day and a new era. Throughout eastern Europe hope sprang up, especially in the Polish-Ukrainian regions devasted by the murderous Bogdan Chmielnitski not long before.Written as a novel, with lively, colorful characters, Singer describes perfectly the course of such a millenial movement in Goray, an isolated Polish village. Whether you are interested in literature or anthropology, this is a description you cannot afford to miss. We follow the rise and fall of a local cult leader, a prophetess, and the feverish hopes of the Jews, longing for deliverance from \\"singing King Alpha's song in a strange land\\". Amidst strange marriages, the breaking of all the strict laws of kashrut, and the wild visions of prophecy, Goray's hopes soar and crash. If you think that the rise of post-Holocaust, post-pogrom Israel is just politics and has nothing to do with any sort of millenarianism, then you should read this wonderful book and reconsider. Powerful language, dark, dreadful images full of demons and damnation only possible from a master like Singer show the strength of the ancient dream of Israel. The tragedy is, of course, that in modern times the dream was realized at somebody else's expense. Reading Abdelrahman Munif's \\"Cities of Salt\\", in conjunction with Singer's book would not be a bad idea. It illustrates the world on which such dreams impacted. SATAN IN GORAY is a wonderful book of literature, anthropology, and history from which great understanding may flow. The world needs this understanding."},{"Title":"Satan In Goray","review":"this book presents a story dating back to the 17th century in Poland.....yet change the dates and names and it is eerily reminiscent of modern times and the religious conflicts surrounding the Messiah....a good read for anyone interested in the messiah from a different point of view and written in the first person concept....it was recommended to me from someone in my weekly bible studies class....I have enjoyed the story...."},{"Title":"Satan In Goray","review":"The only reason why I'm writing this review is that I want to publish my opinion that Isaac Singer never wrote \\"magical realism.\\" I understand magical realism to be the introduction of magical events into a narrative whereby the magical is an objective part of reality that the characters see and are influenced by. I always thought that Isaac Singer only introduced the magical into certain of his character's minds - the magical never exists outside their own thoughts and perceptions. The great thing about Isaac Singer is that he writes about how private obsessions regarding magic and spirits and morality effect a character's life. That is exactly what Satan in Goray is about - the obsession and downfall of a young lady influenced by a medieval messianic Jewish movement. In that context I think Isaac Singer was an extremely compassionate, perceptive and intelligent author who understood better than anyone(probably owing to the fact both his father and grandfather were rabbis) how people mistake superstition for religion."},{"Title":"Satan In Goray","review":"Isaac Bashevis Singer was one of the greatest and wisest writers of the 20th century. He chose to write in Yiddish, then to all appearances a vanishing language, since so many of its speakers were murdered by the Nazis, while the new state of Israel adopted a form of Hebrew. He won the Nobel Prize in 1978, yet he is anything but elitist: his novels are compelling reading and accessible to anyone who enjoys standard historical fiction.\\"Satan in Goray\\" was his first novel: it has all the freshness of early work but is in not in any respect less than masterly. I love its abrupt, poetic, aphoristic style, although Singer himself came to consider it too showy and later wrote more plainly. As in all his books set in old Jewish Eastern Europe, the main themes are the beauty and radiance of Judaism, and the unfathomable mystery of human perversity and self-destructiveness. His Jews lead double lives, half in the blemished, sullen, frustrating actual world, and half in the consoling Realm of Imagination they call Erez Yisro'el, the Land of Israel.The Rabbi of Goray, at odds with his own household, is dismayed by the state of Polish Jews: tired of the clear waters of righteous deeds and Awe before God, they care only for fasting and asceticism, the Kabbalah, visions and marvels. So they are more than ready when the cult of the False Messiah, Shabbetai Zvi, sweeps across the Jewish world like a plague. The obstinate and the envious take up the cause of the new Messiah, and very soon the Rabbi finds himself almost alone in opposing them.But then the Rabbi is crippled during a storm and forced to flee. The community falls prey to hysteria, hallucination and demons that can be as psychological or as literal as you please. Longing for a happiness beyond human limitation, they bring about their own destruction. I discovered Singer as a teenager in rural New Zealand and I read his books insatiably one after another, immersed for weeks at a time in the unknown world of Judaism. Yet this story could not be more universal, and it teaches you more about what Emily Dickinson called \\"freckled human nature\\" than a stack of thick psychology textbooks."},{"Title":"Satan In Goray","review":"Singer may be the only winner of the Nobel Prize to write in a language considered dead. Nonetheless, his crisp prose and enticing style make it a worthwhile read to anyone who is interested in the subject or just in exploring a great novel.In the 17th Century, European Jewish civilization almost collapsed. Social norms fell apart as people abandoned their homes and their farms in something that can only be described as a mass psychosis.

One day, she sees an ad for Mrs. DuPrey's School of Beauty and Charm and thinks that it might help her improve her appearance and develop confidence. The only problem is that she doesn't have the money for it, and her parents won't give her any. She decides that she needs to look for odd jobs in the neighborhood to help raise the money that she needs. By coincidence, old Mr. Murdock's granddaughter has recently moved into the old family house, which is huge and reputed to be haunted. In spite of the creepiness of the old place, Cassie finds a job there, helping Miss Murdock with cleaning and unpacking. Miss Murdock's father made his money in cosmetics, and Miss Murdock employs a secretary named Victoria Presser, who used to be a model. Cassie admires Vicky for her beauty and elegance and looks forward to picking up some beauty tips from her. She also makes friends with Jason, a new boy in town, who also works for Miss Murdock, helping the gardener fix up the grounds. However, it isn't long before Cassie, Jason, and Cassie's younger brother, Danny, begin noticing that there is something odd about the old Murdock house. Danny is the first to notice that there is an octagonal window in the wall of the house, but none of the rooms has a window in that shape. Sometimes, lights can be seen through this window at night. Also, Cassie finds what looks like lab equipment among Miss Murdock's boxes. Is Miss Murdock involved in something illegal? Does it have something to do with the burglaries that have been occurring around town? Why is the grumpy old gardener sneaking around? Just what is in that hidden room?This is a good mystery for tween girls, who can identify with Cassie's worries about being beautiful and popular. The moral of the story is that appearances are deceiving, and in the end, Cassie reconsiders what beauty really is and develops more confidence by appreciating the good qualities she already has."},{"Title":"Lectures on rhetoric and belles lettres","review":"This is an antique classical course.

He describes a saga of how his family, with his people, found ways to survive in a new world that was thrust upon them.Those who like this book should definitely read Deloria's \\"The World We Used to Live In.\\""},{"Title":"Singing For A Spirit","review":"This is an important book, and a must-read I'd love to see in all American classrooms one day.Tipi Sapa and Saswe were important figures in the history of the First People, and this book continues some of the important themes and history touched on in Bury My Heart."},{"Title":"Explaining Hitler: The Search for the Origins of His Evil","review":"Book is very interesting, important, and good reading. However, Hitler is considered an evil, not only by the Jews, but by other peoples, especially by the Poles. Even, if one accepts the thesis that the Holocaust was the unique (the Jews were killed because they were just Jews), from the perspective of the anslaved (although not systematically physically exterminated) nation as the Poles under the Nazi occupation, Hitler was the most terrible criminal in the humankind history. The Poles also deserve the explanation of Hitler's orders. In their case this explanation seems to be easier - Hitler was a successor to Geghis Khan, to Napoleon, and perhaps to Alexander the Great, all were conquerors of the world. Hitler in this sense was not different from them (especially Genghis Khan) in using force to conquere and to enslave. In his plan there was the place for inferior races (like Poles as Russians as providers of labor for German Reich), and there was no need and therefore no place for the Jews. Hitler as an empire-builder is neglegted in this book. I understand very well the feeling of the Jewish people (I did a lot of reading of Aushwitz, visited Jerusalem Holocaust's museum, and Washington, too. I talked to my Jewish friends about it. However, millions of Poles were killed during German occupation, either resisting it (like my father) or killed because they tresspased the German so-called laws (i.e. listening to foreign radio broadcast), or simply being in the wrong place at the wrong time (on a street when it was so-called &quot;lapanka&quot; or a capturing bystandars in retailiation for real or imagined act of terrorism by Polish underground. Killing the innocent it was the rule of German occupation. We, the Poles, also deserve the explantion. And, moreover, that killings were done by ordinary German soldiers. So the book by Goldhaben Hitler's Willing Executioners : Ordinary Germans and the Holocaust is more relevant for other people and nations.As the additional reading I recommend Richard Lucas, The Forgotten Holocaust: The Poles under German Occupation: 1939-1945.In sum: I find this book worth of reading, but to selective in the scope of explanation (to Jewish-focused).Of course, my review proves that I am not native speaker of English and that I am a Pole.

The author devotes one chapter to each theory previously advanced: Hitler as abused child, as sexual pervert, as frustrated artist, as learning disabled, as product of the times, etc. There are no pictures, no maps, no illustrations. The style is pretentious and smarmy. Skip this one!"},{"Title":"Explaining Hitler: The Search for the Origins of His Evil","review":"Certainly the author did his research homework very well and is an excellent writer. I grow a bit impatient with the 'explainers' explaining explanations by the author to the point of expletives. Parts of the book fascinate me - this is great research and being out on the trail in Germany and Austria to see towns, villages, and roads firsthand and making archive visits - then I lose traction when the author condemns some mysterious explainers' explanations. So I debate about continuing to read it clear through, or piecemeal through. I have the paperbook edition, which is loathsome to try to read at my age and eyesight. It seems at times with the paragraphs as though I'm an outsider walking into a conversation - wondering what the point is with the sarcasm - cynical joke that doesn't seem to track with a cold reader. I think the discourse is directed towards those in academia. Maybe.Admire the research and intelligence of the author, but this is a hard read. Could be clarified and edited a lot better. Buy a hardcover, not a paperback."},{"Title":"Explaining Hitler: The Search for the Origins of His Evil","review":"I enjoyed this book tremendously and think you should buy it, although there was one part (or lack of one part) that annoyed me. Let me explain. As I read I noticed two effects of Rosenbaum's book. One is that I went from a dry academic knowing of &quot;Hitler's evil&quot; to a deeper more authentic realization that he was a violent brute. The other is that I wondered why all the fuss about him comes from since a.) he's just a thug and doesn't deserve the perverse dignity of this book or &quot;Hitler studies&quot; in general and b.) a lot of world leaders cause holocausts so why is Hitler any different? The point of the book is that he is in some way, but I don't think so--he's just a banal person and not really that worthy of all the handwringing Rosenbaum documents. Which brings me to the part I think he left out. Towards the end I started wondering, when is he going to talk about Hitler's soldier years? He never does. Turns out, this book is supposedly about the sea! rch for Hitler's formative period, **and it completely leaves out the period traditionally known as the formative years**! I was shocked to see only two references to WW1. I thought, isn't it kind of obvious where the root of his evil came from? He had sociopathic tendencies already, his parents die on him, his artistic dreams are crushed, he spends four years in the trenches. Just the war alone is enough to explain him: Siegfried Sassoon went mad in the English trenches, and he still had his parents, a wealthy lifestyle, and his poetry to sustain him. Is it any wonder Hitler was a bad guy? I wondered why Rosenbaum didn't talk about that. Furthermore, none of the people he interviews really seem interested in finding the cause of his evil. They are more into his wartime meaning and his aftermath of meaning, which makes me think they know on some level it was just the accretion of a lot of bad experiences. But I shouldn't overemphasize this. I can just read a biography of Hitle! r for more on that. This is an excellent book overall."},{"Title":"Explaining Hitler: The Search for the Origins of His Evil","review":"I went into this book expecting a good, readable analysis of Hitler &quot;explainers&quot; and their explanations, with an approach more journalistic than historical (I wasn't disappointed; it is all of these things and more). I didn't expect to find material that was news to me ... but I did and it was the best part of the book. That is, the story of the Munich journalists who waged a war of words with Hitler before he came to power and sought to sound the warning that Hitler and his followers were not a legitimate political party but a gang of thugs and murderers. Of course, their warnings failed and most of these brave souls paid with their lives once Hitler assumed power.Also fascinating is the section on Claude Lanzmann, who despite the marvelous accomplishment of the movie &quot;Shoah,&quot; proves to have clay feet; he's an intellectual bully.A very rewarding, challenging and stimulating book on Hitler and the Holocaust."},{"Title":"Explaining Hitler: The Search for the Origins of His Evil","review":"This book is simply excellent. Rather than write a biography of Hitler, which has already been done hundreds of times, Rosenbaum set out to write about the historians that have written about Hitler and the Third Reich. He also includes in the book details about his journey to Austria, which is quite a nice story in itself. Particuarly well written are his chapters on Holocaust denier and discredited historian David Irving and the controversial, but legitimate, Daniel Goldhagen. Rosenbaum interviewed several historians on the question of \\"Why?\\" Hitler did what he did, and in the process revealed many interesting insights, such as the fact Alan Bullock now seems to almost disown his own book, Hitler: A Study in Tyrrany and no longer agree with the conclusions he reached a few decades ago. This book is an important work in the historiography of Hitler and the Third Reich."},{"Title":"Explaining Hitler: The Search for the Origins of His Evil","review":"Rosenbaum's synthesis of current argument about &quot;the nature of Adolf Hitler&quot; makes a good introduction to the field. Like all good journalists, he seems to come away from each meeting (the book is structured as a series of interviews with historians, elucidated by informed asides by Rosenbaum)with some telling give-away, some unguarded response he has managed to provoke, which suggests a special insight. Trouble is, these &quot;insights&quot; are into the minds of the historians, rather than into the mind of Adolf Hitler himself -- and long before the end of the book, the reader is aware that Goldbaum is too wily a commentator to be going to risk any attempt at really explaining, as the subtitle has it, &quot;The Origins of His Evil.&quot;The book is admirable in many ways, not least in that it marshals the main positions within &quot;Hitler psychohistory&quot; in a very readable fashion. But it is a fine piece of journalism, rather than a work of scholarship, and unlikely to provoke as much thought -- or stir up as many hornets -- as (for example) Daniel Goldhagen's flawed but extraordinarily illuminating &quot;Hitler's Willing Executioners.&quot;You won't find any explanation for the origin of Hitler's evil here, unfortunately. In fact, this book is oddly bloodless and shadowless. But Goldbaum's fine intelligence is evident in every line."},{"Title":"Explaining Hitler: The Search for the Origins of His Evil","review":"Rosenbaum Explaining Hitler could properly be renamed Explaining Evil. It is a brilliant expose into the way that contemporary righters, historians and authors have sought to explain what some think is unexplainable. As important, the book presents a fine spring board for further reading on the subject.What one comes away with is that there is no single way to explain Hitler, and that it is only when one infuses the multitude of explanations that any meaningful answer comes forward. Rosenbaum leaves out no possible explanation. Even those that are highly controversial. For instance in his chapter on Steiner he explores the concept that the Jews themselves could have been responsible for some of the anti-Semitism that existed in Nazi Germany. After reading the book I obtained a copy of Steiner's The Portage to San Cristobal of A.H. (A very good read and highly recomended). While Rosenbaum clearly does not believe that the Jews were responsible, and neither did Steiner for that matter, the chapter does make one think about Jews as active actors in the holocaust instead of the passive victims that they are often portrayed as.Equally fascinating was the chapter on Goldhagen and the participation of the average German in the holocaust. While Rosenbaum certainly has a biased against Goldhagen, he presents each side of the controversy. From this chapter I read Turner's book on the Nazi rise to power, as well as Sereny's books on Franz Stengel and Speer. What comes out of the analysis is that while the acquiescence of the German people played a major role in the holocaust, this does not provide a singular explanation.What was most disturbing was the chapter on Claude Lanzmann and the belief that to even ask \\"why\\" as to the cause of Hitler's evil is to disrespect the victims of the holocaust. Lanzmann, the creator of the film on the holocaust seeks to present himself as the be all and end all of holocaust studies. He ignores the fact that the inability to ask why is one important thing help define the concentration camps.Rosenbaum does not seek to give the answer as to the origin of Hitler's evil. When I purchased the book I was hoping for such an answer, but by the end I knew that one would have been a been a copout.This is an excellent book, not just for what it contains but because it makes one think about the origins of evil and responsibility for evil acts."},{"Title":"Explaining Hitler: The Search for the Origins of His Evil","review":"Overall, this is an very good read. Well written, fair and informative with a good account of the schools of thought and divisions over Hitler's mind.There are two big problems, however. The first is that Rosenbaum depicts the Munich Post (newspaper) as Hitler's watchdog until 1933. Anyone who digs deeper will know that the Munich Post was a socialist paper. As Hitler was the arch enemy of both socialists and communists, a fair historian would give it as much credibility as the V&ouml;lkischer Beobachter...The second flaw is that Rosenbaum doesn't offer a real conclusion. After exposing, analyzing and criticizing many visions of Hitler, you would think that the author would come up with a conclusion where he tells us what he believes in. Instead, he wrote generalities and the conclusion looked more like an escape trap than the final touch to an overall excellent book.Despite its flaws, Explaining Hitler is a great book and a must-read for anybody who is fascinated by the history of the Third Reich."},{"Title":"Explaining Hitler: The Search for the Origins of His Evil","review":"Boring, pretentious, long-winded. Reads like a nightmare textbook authored by the most overblown professor on campus. The theories about sexual shortcomings and/or deviations being responsible for Hitler being Hitler are ridiculous."},{"Title":"Explaining Hitler: The Search for the Origins of His Evil","review":"Explaining Hitler: The Search for the Origins of His Evil by Ron Rosenbaum. Highly recommended.Explaining Hitler is a misleading title, for the focus is primarily on the Jewish academic community's attempts to explain Hitler-to put it in grossly oversimplified terms, this is somewhat like the prey explaining the motivations of the predator. The result is that, while Hitler remains a mystery, the academic and personal biases of the explainers are revealed. To each person's theories and comments Rosenbaum adds his own analysis, finding the flaws with precision.Hitler explanation ranges from the deeply personal (abusive father, infection by a Jewish prostitute, mother's painful death under the care of a Jewish physician) to the inevitable influence of historical forces (post-war inflation, depression). Rosenbaum discusses the personal in depth, including Hitler's rumored Jewish ancestor and bizarre relationship with his half-niece Geli Raubal, the convolutions each theory takes, and the lack of facts or reliable information to support any of them. For example, Rosenbaum astutely points out the only real \\"proof\\" of the abusive father is Hitler's own assertion and sarcastically suggests that there is reason not to trust Hitler's word. One argument that immediately comes to mind that Rosenbaum only briefly alludes to later is that millions of people have abusive fathers, bad experiences with individual members of ethnic and other groups, and so forth, yet do not turn into war criminals responsible for the deaths of millions. In short, these theories might explain Hitler's anti-Semitism, but not the results.What is disturbing about so many of these explanations (some of which are advocated by such noted people as Simon Wiesenthal, who favors the Jewish prostitute theory), and more sophisticated ones that appear later in the book, such as George Steiner's, is their insistence that a Jew or a group of Jews is responsible. In these theories, a Jewish ancestor, a Jewish prostitute, an Eastern Jew with a different appearance, or the Jewish \\"blackmail of transcendence\\" and \\"addiction to the ideal\\" is responsible for Hitler-implying Hitler is not responsible at all. Although the egotistical and monomaniacal Claude Lanzmann, maker of the documentary Shoah, is too self-centered and angry to clearly articulate the basis for his belief that Hitler explanation is inherently \\"obscene,\\" it could be because so much \\"explanation\\" has found a way to point a finger at the Jews, directly or indirectly, while minimizing Hitler. Perhaps for that reason, Lanzmann is interested only in how the Holocaust was accomplished, not with the motivations of Hitler or his followers. The major flaw is that Lanzmann has missed the point by dictating that his rule of \\"There is no why\\" must apply to all other individuals-and the irony of that.As Rosenbaum repeatedly points out, no explanations for Hitler are acceptable that excuse him-that look to a bad experience with a Jew rather than to, for example, the influence of anti-Semitism surrounding him in Austria and Germany. Again, however, it can be said that anti-Semitic influence has surrounded many people (as Rosenbaum notes, pre-war France was more anti-Semitic than either Austria or Germany) who have not killed, let alone killed millions.Rosenbaum's approach is excellent, pairing individuals with complementary or opposing viewpoints, e.g., Lanzmann and Dr. Micheels, the theologian Emil Fackenheim and the atheist historian Yehuda Bauer in \\"The Temptation to Blame God.\\" Even revisionist David Irving is given a chapter. Rosenbaum saves what seems to be his preference for the last chapter-Lucy Dawidowicz's belief that Hitler decided on The Final Solution as early as 1918, based on what he said and did not say over time, and on the \\"laughter\\" that is transferred from the Jewish victims to the Nazi victors. While this does not explain the origins of Hitler's evil, it pinpoints the time frame and removes the notion that he was ambivalent or experienced a sense of moral ambiguity. Dawidowicz's Hitler knows early on what he wants to do and lets insiders in on the \\"joke\\" he finds it to be. Presented in this way, Dawidowicz does seem to have come closest to the truth about Hitler. After all, how can one capable of ambivalence ultimately kill millions?To me, one critical question is not why or how any one man became evil or chose an evil course of action, for the explanation could simply be that the capacity for evil in an individual may be higher than most of us are capable of realising or accepting. That is, everyday evil like John Wayne Gacy's is accomplished in isolation and is therefore limited in scope. The intent and the desired scope given opportunity remain unknowns. The more frightening question is why and how so many chose to follow Hitler. I do not necessarily mean the German people, per se, but the thousands of bureaucrats, managers, and soldiers who physically carried out The Final Solution, knowing exactly what this entailed and what it signified. Hitler seized the opportunity offered by the political and social situation to institutionalize his personal evil. A single man may envision and desire genocide, but it takes followers and believers to carry it out. Explaining Hitler (or Stalin or Genghis Khan) is not enough to explain the scope of this particular human evil. Without followers, there are no leaders. And without followers, millions of Jews (and Cambodians and Indians and so forth) could not have died. The evil that is so hard to face goes well beyond Hitler to a place that no one could truly wish to discover.Diane L. Schirf, 18 January 2004."},{"Title":"Explaining Hitler: The Search for the Origins of His Evil","review":"Rosenbaum opened this thoughtful and literate review of the supposed \\"explanations\\" for Hitler with a gripping account of a winter journey to Hitler's birthplace in the Austrian hinterland, to glean what can be gleaned from the - largely obliterated - traces of his family and early life. There is effective use of the dangerous iciness of the mountain roads as a metaphor for some of the people and places he encountered there: cold to the bone, dangerous, and frozen in time.That set-piece opening led to a consideration of some of the \\"explanations\\" of Hitler's madness and evil: that Hitler had been abused as a child, that he was genitally deformed, or even that he was born normal but traumatised when his genitals were mutilated by - of all things - a goat. These and some of the other speculations that have been offered - that Hitler was homosexual, that he had caught syphilis from a Jewish prostitute, that he was brainwashed into megalomania by a doctor experimenting with new psychological techniques, and so on - led Rosenbaum to a fascinating discussion of what is involved in even attempting to \\"explain Hitler\\".Rosenbaum noted that many of the attempts at explaining Hitler tend, deliberately or not, to reduce the focus on his evil. To understand is to forgive, at least a little, and risks reducing Hitler to a victim, whether of other people or of circumstances. Worse, many of the proffered explanations put the blame on Jews, for example Weisenthal's notion of the (probably imaginary) Jewish prostitute who gave Hitler the clap.Rosenbaum then examined some of the people who have made a career, or a business, of \\"explaining Hitler\\", beginning with engaging portraits of the old school historians Trevor-Roper and Bullock, two wise and wily old dons from an intellectual and academic world that has since largely - regrettably - vanished. This was followed by portraits of Claude Lanzmann, who came to feel he owned the Holocaust, and of David Irving, who tried to minimise it and deny Hitler's guilt, whose treatment is less affectionate. For these sections alone, and for the fascinating material on those journalists, Hitler's contemporaries, who tried to warn Germany and the world what Hitler was, and paid for their courage with their lives, this book deserves classic status.But the book loses momentum and coherence somewhere past the half-way point. The editing is partly at fault, but worse, Rosenbaum's critical reasoning and crap-detecting seem to flag. He settles, finally, for Lucy Davidowicz's idea that Hitler had planned the Holocaust as early as 1918, based on isolated lines from Hitler speeches, such as, \\"they [the Jews] are not laughing now.\\" It was a pity to see Rosenbaum apply critical reading for most of the book only to let his guard down completely for something as flimsy as this. The words Davidowicz cited do not say what she claims they say.Previously Rosenbaum had challenged people who backed their claims with rhetoric rather than evidence, insisting on precision on what words were said, what they meant, who said them, and when. Davidowicz's claims are not only contradicted by almost all recent work on the Holocaust (as an atrocity that evolved over time and took its final form after the war had commenced), they are not even supported by her own citations. And Davidowicz's \\"explanation\\" would explain nothing even if it were true. She offered a fanciful and unconvincing answer to the question \\"when?\\", but the real question is not \\"when\\" but \\"why?\\"However Rosenbaum's earlier chapters more than justify buying and keeping this book. The most reasonable conclusion, taking Rosenbaum into account, is that we will never know the cause of Hitler's madness and evil, but this is not the real issue. Ultimately Hitler was a squalid psychopath, in the same broad category as, say, Charles Manson or Jeffrey Dahmer. He was intelligent, with the ability to charm and impress people when he needed, and murderously mad. Any alternative-history version of Hitler's life would probably have finished with him as a mass murderer: but he should have been another lone killer with a grisly basement and victims numbering in the tens, or fewer, not a head of state with victims in the tens of millions.So although \\"why?\\" is the right question, we should perhaps not direct it at Hitler, but at the forces that put him in a position of power. That means looking at the political, military and business figures, who were basically sane, and evil only on a normal human scale, who actually did the deals that made Hitler the German Chancellor against the wishes of the majority of the German electorate. And even after Hitler was in power, there was a long period after it was quite clear - \\"crystal\\" clear - what he was, when it was still possible to remove him, had the will been there.That group, who nurtured a rootless psychopath and put him into power for their own varied purposes, and who kept him there until he destroyed them too: perhaps it's the people like Papen, Hugenberg, Hindenberg and others, who have not yet received their share of historical scrutiny, or of humanity's hatred, ridicule and contempt. I suspect that this group is the best place to look for meaningful answers, not only to the question, \\"how?\\", but also to that most anguished of questions: \\"why?\\"(People sometimes defame democracy by claiming that Hitler came to power by democratic means. In fact the Nazis never won an election, and had lost ground in the election before Hitler was appointed Chancellor. Hitler was installed into power in a betrayal of the voters, and thereafter there were no elections.)Though \\"Explaining Hitler\\" ends disappointingly, it still offers some fascinating portraits of heroes and villains, historians and pseudo-historians, and a great deal of interesting and insightful writing. Though I don't always agree with his conclusions, it is never less than a pleasure to read Rosenbaum thinking aloud. Strongly recommended.Laon"},{"Title":"Explaining Hitler: The Search for the Origins of His Evil","review":"This book examines the various schools of thought regarding Hitler and the Holocaust and the author did a wonderful job of researching and interviewing many of the scholars on the topic who have in turn influenced our understanding and perceptions of what happened and why. The questions may ultimately not have definitive answers but reading this and having Rosenbaum guide us through the various viewpoints is a worthwhile exercise in intellectual and philosophical investigation. The question of whether Hitler was essential to the Holocaust or if in his absence someone else would have set the same events into motion is one example of an unanswerable question that gets considered.The questions surrounding the origins of Hitler's anti-semitism are also explored in detail.There are scholars quoted who adamantly believe that any attempt to understand is misguided because understanding Hitler's motivations is considered by them to be the first step toward rationalization and diminishing the horror of the Holocaust to just a human crime on a larger scale.This is not a biography of Hitler although many critical episodes in his life are referenced. Instead this is a fascinating look at how different perspectives on the nature of Hitler's evil have developed and how in the end there is no comprehensive answer as to the how and why of the suffering he unleashed. THere is a quote used from Primo Levi's book Survival in Auschwitz. Levi suffering from thirst reaches for an icycle. An SS guard knocks it away and Levi asks \\"why ?' The response..\\"there is no why here\\". I think that story captures some of the spirit of Rosenbaum's book."},{"Title":"Explaining Hitler: The Search for the Origins of His Evil","review":"A highly stimulating series of perspectives in the attempts to 'explain Hitler', at the end of which we still, no doubt,are without the explanation, a point made by the author with his epigram of Emile Fackenheim at the beginning of the book. One might note the danger of being distracted by details, when the probably impossible-to-obtain explanation is both ordinary yet unknowable, as we gaze on a crime scene, assessing clues. There is a danger of becoming metaphysical in the wrong way, notwithstanding the need to consider the nature of radical evil.There are a series of obvious explanations, none of which can be confirmed, but which emanate from the occult stench and dark muddled rumours of this episode of history, and many leadup and synchronous episodes completely disconnected with the historical context, which also includes 'explaining Nietzsche', not easy to do. That genre of explanation tends uniformly toward the crackpot and doesn't explain anything either, but that aspect of the evidence is always missing (and was surpressed at Nuremberg)This is a very informative account, dealing with the whole history, starting with Trevor-Roper and Alan Bullock, to Goldhagen. Especially gripping was the account of the journalists of the Munich Post battling Hitler from the early twenties in the gangster world from which he emerged, to the final accession to power, when they were all wiped out."},{"Title":"Explaining Hitler: The Search for the Origins of His Evil","review":"The author states that the purpose of this book is to 'disentangle the historical Hitler from the meanings projected upon him' [p. 205] and to find out what made Hitler *Hitler*. He succeeds admirably on both counts.Rosenbaum neatly untangles the gnarled web of myth and fiction surrounding Hitler's supposed Jewish grandfather and the sexual activities and possible suicide of Hitler's half-niece and paramour Geli Raubal. He then moves on to a dispassionate and carefully considered survey of the major explainers of the Hitler phenomenon, from Hugh Trevor Roper and Alan Bullock to George Steiner and Daniel Goldhagen, not omitting the likes of David Irving along the way.Was Hitler convinced of the rectitude of what he was doing, or was he an actor, a mountebank who came to believe in his own lies and impersonations? Was he one in a long line of demonic figures, from Caligula and Genghis Khan to Stalin, or was he a unique eruption of pure unadulterated evil? Was he a human being like us (Hitler within), or was he somehow different, because of a missing testicle, conflicted identity, self-hatred, or some other tragic flaw? Does the Holocaust mean that God does not exist, or else is powerless? Did Hitler, then, defeat God?These are some of the questions that Rosenbaum and the Hitler explainers that he covers grapple with. Rosenbaum held extensive interviews with most of the people whose ideas he presents, and he gives each their due consideration. As he modestly admits in the preface to the book, Rosenbaum is a consumer of scholarship rather than a scholar, but in *Explaining Hitler* he has produced a book that should be the envy of any true scholar."},{"Title":"Explaining Hitler: The Search for the Origins of His Evil","review":"Mr. Rosenbaum states very early in EXPLAINING HITLER that &quot;throughout his life, wherever he went, Adolph Hitler was always a Mysterious Stranger&quot;. Following from this statement, and from the title of the book, we would naturally expect Mr. Rosenbaum to definitively shed some light on this enigmatic person. To the extent that he does not, we can be justifiably disappointed in the book.But wait a minute. The task at hand is immense - there are scores of biographies written on Hitler, some dating back to before the war. Furthermore, this book was intended to shine a light on the origins of the man's evil (which it does); hoping however, to fully illuminate that darkness, is a vain hope indeed. Also, EXPLAINING HITLER was not intended to be a historiography of Hitler biographies - for that check out John Lukacs' THE HITLER OF HISTORY. Mr. Rosenbaum offers instead a sythesis of historical explanations of Hitler's evil, specifically as manifested in his rabid anti-semitism. The author is clear in stating that his interest is in what this says about the historians themselves, their views of human nature, and how they see evil - in Hitler and mankind in general. On this score Mr. Rosenbaum delivers as promised.One of the techniques used by Mr. Rosenbaum (an investigative reporter by training) is interviews with these various Hitler historians. Incisive and revealing, especially when the question that is explored is whether one sees Hitler's evil as something unprecedented in history or as a sign of the malevolence of human nature. The assumption being that how one answers indicates perspective. There are two camps of Hitler historians; those that see him as patently evil and individually responsible for the attrocities of the Nazis, and those that see other forces (societal or psychological) at fault.Mr. Rosenbaum is at his best when providing a sythesis of the various schools of thought on Hitler. We see that within the group that sees evil and responsibility residing in Hitler, the focus is on the connection with his anti-semitism. They are constantly in search of documentary proof; some key turning point; a statement from him initiating the 'Final Solution'; any clear indicator of his turn toward evil. Mr. Rosenbaum calls this the &quot;Lost safe-deposit syndrome&quot;. More well developed are the views that qualify as belonging to the Societal/Psychological school of thought. Strange bedfellows are to be found here. Daniel Goldhagen of HITLER's WILLING EXECUTIONERS fame would be shocked to be grouped with a Hitler apologist such as David Irving but so be it; both find explanations for Nazi attrocities that excuse Hitler. Some of the more pernicious explanations - those that portray Hitler as a victim - are also on offer in this group. Amazingly, some see Jews at fault. The Doctor who treated (or mistreated it is argued) Hitler's mother, failing to prevent her painful death from breast cancer; thus breeding resentment in young Adolf. Mr Rosenbaum explores others such explanations, examples of what he calls the &quot;Menendez defense&quot;. Naturally, if we are going to apply the metaphor of modern legal defenses to Hitler histories we should expect to find versions of two of todays most popular legal appeals on display here. Yes, there are Hitler histories that are examples of the insanity plea and the sexually abused childhood defense. Certainly plausible in general but they make us distinctly uncomfortable when applied to Hitler.Perhaps that is the larger point of this whole analysis of Hitler histories. What do they say about how we view ourseves and culture as a whole? As the author says &quot;Hitler explanations are cultural self-portraits; the shapes we project onto the inky Rorschach of Hitler's psyche are often cultural self-portraits in the negative. What we talk about when we talk about Hitler is also who we are and who we are not&quot;."},{"Title":"Explaining Hitler: The Search for the Origins of His Evil","review":"Ron Rosenbaum joined a group of journalist whose work I would follow in the future with this book( or rather discussion compendium) on Hitler and the Jewish Holocaust. Although not as sharply honed and morally penetrating as Gitta Sereny Mr Rosenbaum never the less did a fine journalistic job of bringing together some fascinating minds with their insights and peculiarities making it easily accessible for the casual scholar.The book is a praiseworthy attempt to come to grips with the enigma of Hitler. The work essentially deal with the WHY behind the man and his actions. It is the big WHY that every intellectual that Rosenbaum approaches attempts to answer in different ways that makes this book really interesting. It is certainly not a complete in depth study of Hitler (for that I would recommend the reader to lower their guard of possible justified prejudice and read David Irvings Hitler or the last days of Hitler by Hugh Trevor Roper) but rather deals with the approaches to the answer WHY. I actually found the book tells me more about Rosenbaum and his individual contributors than necessarily elucidating Hitler the man. It raises more questions than it answers and I would argue that it is there were the value of this contribution of Mr Rosenbaum lies. It makes a contribution towards the intelligent continuation of the dialogue. And that is the most important Keep talking for in language will we lose and find one another. It will not erase history although it might obscure it but in the act of dialogue we can at least have the opportunity to reach out to one another something that silence will never achieve . The WHY can be summarised as follows WHY Don't ask its perverse - Claude Lanzmann, WHY It's the Germans, Hitler was just a puppet - Goldhagen, WHY It the shape of his nose and primitive Social Darwinism- Fritz Gerlich ,WHY He was a self hating closet Semite - George Steiner, WHY He is a lunatic petty ruffian with a mayor inferiority complex- Munich Post, WHY It was really Goebbels - Hitler was innocent -David Irving, WHY He was a mesmerising actor and the world his stage- Hugh Trevor Roper, WHY One testicle can make a guy do terrible things - Alan Bullock, WHY He just could get no weird sexual satisfaction - Walter Langer ,Robert Waite, WHY The Holocaust lies outside of language Silence is the key ( and 20 000$ per seminar) -Eli Wiesel, WHY He was just an evil son of a bitch - Lucy Davidovitz, WHY It's the culmination of 2000 years of Christian hatred -Hyam Maccoby, WHY God needs to do some serious answering - Yehuda Bauer Emil Fackenheim, and many more.....Many critics have cited this book as incoherent and biased. When you look at the above rather crude summaries can anybody expect not to have a sense of incoherency in their work when you are primarily reporting the words and thought of these diverse and very opinioned people? Of course not. Rather criticize Mr Rosenbaum for omitting competent thinkers like Raul Hilberg, Noam Chomsky Hannah Arendt and Joachim Fest. A central theme that does carry through all the works discussed is Mr Rosenbaum s' attempt to put Hitler the man back into the picture. He was not and accidental tourist in a spontaneous eruption of long simmering anti Semitism according to Rosenbaum. He was not the puppet result of an abstract dialectic of historical forces. Anybody that rides the whirlwind must reap it.. He was the key. He might have sowed into fertile ground but without him there would have been no bitter harvest. This I agree with but I do not discount the Dialectical undercurrent of history that could turn a mediocre painter into a fearsome Autocrat. Our history(as it socially ,culturally impacts on the individual) always means more for our future than our past.What most Holocaust writers especially Jewish writers tend to do is place a moral distinction between the level of Evil ( Stalin was bad but Hitler was the worst) as well as the fact that the Holocaust was somehow incomparable to other genocides mainly due to the almost mythical transcendence of normal ethical/moral boundaries by the Waffen SS and the Einsatz Gruppen responsible for the genocide. I would have preferred if Mr Rosenbaum could have incorporated this slant into the discussion in greater depth. I'm always amazed that the victims would complement their tormentors in such a way. The victims of Stalin certainly never did and never will.A Jewish friend suggested to me that the Jewish religious focus on being God's Chosen People makes them culturally prone to turn their tormentors into the Chosen Perpetrators as well .If they are chosen by the Almighty then so must be their tormentors. Both actors in the play of 20th century mankind's attempt to rediscover the Truth in a secular way( Communism , National Socialism, Capitalism) have paid one another a perverse but ultimate compliment it would seem. What horror do we not commit on one another when we want the temples but we do not want God in it. This more than anything else was the core impression the diverse tapestry of ideas around this complex subject left in my mind on completion of this entertaining work. Read it - it is definitively worthwhile"},{"Title":"Explaining Hitler: The Search for the Origins of His Evil","review":"This book is an excellent survey of the considerable amount of work and thought contributed by many scholars on some of the most crucial questions of our time: Who was Hitler? What was Hitler? Where did he come from? What environmental and psychological forces shaped him? How did he get to power? Who supported him? Who recognised him for what he was and stood up to him before he came to power? What happened to them? Why was Hitler allowed? Was he a puppet or a devil, a war-traumatised, dysfunctional soldier or a self-aware and cunning murderer? The only question not answered for me was: Why do we see so much of him on TV, filmed after 1939, strutting about until his demise, while the important issues (addressed by this book) are too-often ignored? We must know as much as possible about Hitler to help us recognise new Hitlers before they come to power, recognise the constellation of forces that produces them, recognise the flattery, and resist the seduction. Ron Rosenbaum's style helped to make this difficult and controversial subject interesting and more personal. He visited and described for us many of the places pertinent to Hitler's early life and his rise to power to give the reader a feel for time and place. He introduces us to people who were there at the time and who have tried so hard to contribute to our, as well as their own, understanding. He surveys their writing and introduces us to the main themes. Much is made in the book of whether an explanation of Hitler would lessen his culpability. But without explanation there is only emptiness and we cannot use emptiness to help us recognise another disaster in the making. It is always worthwhile to attempt an explanation of Hitler. This is an excellent book."},{"Title":"Explaining Hitler: The Search for the Origins of His Evil","review":"&quot;Explaining Hitler&quot; by Ron Rosenbaum is a bit of a &quot;bait and switch.&quot; Rosenbaum doesn't really attempt to &quot;explain&quot; Hitler himself. Instead, he attempts to &quot;explain the explainers,&quot; and the work does an admirable job of peeling each of those onions. This book gives the reader marvelous insight into Hitler's character, and reveals many mysterious sides of that character that I was not previously aware of. However, if you are looking for a book to explain the Holocaust through an explanation of Hitler, you will be disappointed. Rosenbaum, rightfully, does not attempt to do that. If that's what you are looking for, pick up a book about the history of western civilization. But if you want some fascinating insight into Hitler, his personal history and development, his relationships, and different theories about his make-up, this is an excellent resourse, well written and very readable."},{"Title":"Explaining Hitler: The Search for the Origins of His Evil","review":"ALthough not the most tightly written book around, Ron Rosenbaum has nonetheless produced one of the best books ever written about Hilter and about those who try to understand Hitler. I admire Rosenbaum for making it clear at several points that he has a point of view that he is not trying to hide, and yet I found him overall to be quite objective in his discussions about what other's think. He is a little harder than necessary on poor Hugh Trevor-Roper, but perhaps not without reason. Overall, this remains a marvelous cultural history, with the added bonus of a great detail of interesting information about Hitler.I found Rosenbaum's portraits of those pursuing an explanation for Hitler, and those who say that there should be no attempt to try to undestand or explain the man, to have been uniformly intersting. Particularly disturbing were the chapters on the pitiful Hitler-as-a-nice-guy David Irving, and the awesomely awful, supremely arrogant and fascist Claude Lanzmann (can this man have any credibility left?). Perhaps most disturbing are the Steiner and Hyam Maccoby sections. Rosenbaum's section on Steiner led me to read his controversial The Portage to San Cristobal of A.H. I came away from that satisfied that Steiner is not a self-hating Jew who was trying to blame the Shoah on Jews. Rather, he wrote a thought-provoking book that has been used in ways that he naively did not (and does not) recognize could be done. Maccoby I find even more despicable than David Irving; what a hateful, narrow-minded, terribly sad person. Finally, the section of Goldhagen was quite illuminating, not only for its dissection of the weaknesses of Goldhagen's book, but, more imporantly, for the incredible hyprocisy displayed by some in the academic community--the font of freedom of ideas--who savaged Goldhagen.No one need agree with the above characterizations. One of the wonderful things about Rosenbaum's book is that the author does two things--he gives plenty of information to let one reach one's own conclusions and also inspires one to seek out the works of those he writes about. (In addition to the Steiner book, I ordered Trevor-Roper's The Last Ten Days, Primo Levi's book on Auschwitz, and Berel Lang's Act and Idea in the Nazi Genocide.) The reader will also come away from the book with a much better understanding of Hitler, and what the central questions are about Hitler that seem to beg answering.This is a thought-provoking, richly detailed book, that will profit all who read it. Rosenbaum is to be commended for his courage in tackling this subject, and for the relentlessly objective eye that he brings to the subject. This book, along with Ian Kershaw's first volume of his Hitler biography, are the absolute best places to start if the reader wants to learn about Hitler and his impact on the latter half of the last century."},{"Title":"Explaining Hitler: The Search for the Origins of His Evil","review":"In attempting to answer the source of Hitler's evil, this book begins with discussing the rumor factories that surrounded him from the very beginning, and this is frankly a rehash of about all the stories (some maybe true, some not, who knows) in constant circulation (mentioned in the amazon reviews here).But the section on the MUNICH POST and this paper's constant assault on the \\"Hitler Party\\", even listing street political murders on a near daily basis is the one new thing (to me) in the book. Barely mentioned are previous historical \\"Lebensraums\\" including Russia in Siberia, and the 400 year exploration and populating of the the New World, not to mention European colonizations in Africa. Hitler was a big reader of Karl May's cowboy and Indian stories even in his days as Fuehrer. The centuries old assualt by the Christion religion on the Jews is also discussed. This is surely an overlooked aspect of earlier huge anti-Semitic movements. Also hardly noted is Hitler's fear of \\"poisoned blood\\" and a \\"diseased race\\" which he mentions in MEIN KAMPF. It seems that practically all the scholars feel that their idea is about the only one, when truth to tell, there is probably some truth to about all the theories which can help explain Hitler."},{"Title":"Explaining Hitler: The Search for the Origins of His Evil","review":"What if? If Hitler did not exist, would we have someone just like Hitler? What force or forces produced the extermination of millions? One man or a nation? Rosenbaum's work is beyond thought provoking; it jars the psyche. For those doing graduate work in Comparative Lit, Psychology, History, Jewish studies, etc., this is a must have. Many, many intriguing ideas (and sources) are guaranteed to produce numerous writing projects much less intellectual party conversation.He does not explain Hitler, but gives you the paradoxal ammunition to try and create an explanation yourself. It will never be done. What are you waiting for? Buy this book."},{"Title":"Explaining Hitler: The Search for the Origins of His Evil","review":"This was a good book. The author did a nice job looking at, and evaluating the many theories on Hitler. I especially enjoyed the chapter on Hitler's Willing Executioners. Hitlers Willing Executioners makes an important point, but is impossible to read. This book did a nice job explaining the work in plain English. Also the book has an interesting chapter on David Irving. I also really enjoyed the chapters dealing with Hitler's sexuality and Freudian Interpretations. Again, this book is a great overview of the many ways to look at Hitler."},{"Title":"Explaining Hitler: The Search for the Origins of His Evil","review":"I was not sure what to expect when I began reading this book because of the online reviews. Now I'm not quite sure what to think. However I can understand why some readers may not have liked it. It &quot;attacks&quot; some long held notions about the origins of Hitler's evil and his complete and total hatred of Jews. I think it causes, at times, painful introspection about our own beliefs about this most heinous of humans. It asks us to examine core beliefs, beliefs which we discover can be so convoluted as to be used to commit atrocities of an unspeakable even unreadable nature. It has caused me to want to know more about some of the arguments and philosophies presented. It also has me reading Kafka!"},{"Title":"Explaining Hitler: The Search for the Origins of His Evil","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this book which examines the various theories and theorists of Hitler's actions. It was extremely well researched and remained an interesting read from beginning to end."},{"Title":"Explaining Hitler: The Search for the Origins of His Evil","review":"So deliberately journalistic and breezy that its breeziness becomes an annoyingly disingenuous style of its own."},{"Title":"Explaining Hitler: The Search for the Origins of His Evil","review":"I am 55 years old and have a master's in journalism. I am a professional copy editor. When I read this book I became so frustrated I came close several times to throwing it away.This book had to have been published without an editor. About every third sentence in the entire text is not a sentence with a subject and verb -- instead what you get is a clause, dangling by itself, with a period at the end.Also, the author must have sat down before he wrote this manuscript and compiled a list of every obscure word he could find in the dictionary -- or worse, German publications from the 1920s and 1930s -- and made sure he used every last one.If I knew a way to ask for my money back I certainly would do so.This book is a nightmare."},{"Title":"Explaining Hitler: The Search for the Origins of His Evil","review":"I think ONE of the \\"explanations\\" offered in this book . . . is especially worthwhile. But Rosenbaum doesn't explicitly reveal which one it is -- it's just mixed in with the others as part of the book's process. I think he maybe does that intentionally. He's a subtle fellow.The specific explanation that I have in mind . . . doesn't depend on proving or disproving certain facts. That's where all the other proposed explanations fall short -- they argue for or against one set of facts or another. Instead, the explanation I have in mind depends on a certain kind of intellectual and emotional capacity for holding the facts together in a certain way.Of course, if that were an easy and obvious thing to do -- this book would not have been necessary. Reading the book offers a process by which the capacity can be discovered by the reader.Very much worth the effort -- if you're open to the possibility . . ."},{"Title":"Explaining Hitler: The Search for the Origins of His Evil","review":"I give Rosenbaum credit for rejecting the apologists and the psychoanalysists, and reaffirming that Hitler was responsible for his actions and was a profoundly evil person. However, his book falls far short of explaining the Holocaust or why German people helped Hitler to carry out his final solution. At the end of this book, Rosenbaum has failed to &quot;explain&quot; much of anything, but has done little more than to merely &quot;describe.&quot;I recommend Leonard Peikoff's _The Ominous Parallels_ for a truthful explanation of the Holocaust, and and introduction to the only philosophy which can prevent it from happening again."},{"Title":"Explaining Hitler: The Search for the Origins of His Evil","review":"Sorry, this book just didn't do it for me. The author starts out well enough, but then loses himself in the pursuit of inane drivel which he supposes will illuminate the dark corners of the psyche that condemned the world to chaos. He is not content to state and justify his case; rather he drags the reader along through an endless, agonizing record of the efforts of his research. It's almost as if he is desperate to convince us he did a good job, even to the point that the book often loses sight of its subject matter in a painful celebration of the saga of its writing.Rosenberg wants to get into the mind of Hitler, but fails; thus he is compelled to dwell in the corona of outrageous excesses that surround the still impenetrable center of the man. He obsesses protractedly, for instance, over Hitler's sexuality and reputed awkwardness with women, as if therein lay the final explanation of Hitler's awkwardness with the rest of the world. The gas chambers at Auschwitz, it would seem, had their genesis in the fact that Adolf never developed a \\"good line\\" with the ladies of Vienna. Bad for Adolf, bad for the rest of us. The book is liberally laced with other such digressions, made necessary, it would seem, by the actuality that Rosenberg is in over his head.Then the author launches a lengthy discourse on his differences with OTHER of Hitler's biographers. Really, we didn't need to know this. It tells us nothing about Hitler; it's just more \\"Look at what I had to go through to write this book!\\" nonsense.For me, \\"Explaining Hitler\\" explains nothing, least of all how I managed to stay awake through the long, arduous labor of reading it."},{"Title":"Explaining Hitler: The Search for the Origins of His Evil","review":"A great amount of information on explaining Hitler. The author looks at all different explainations about Hitler and goes into detail to explain each (or discredits). It's very well writen and I recommend if you have an interest in Hitler Explainations, this is a great book."},{"Title":"Explaining Hitler: The Search for the Origins of His Evil","review":"This book mesmerised me for hours into the initial chapters. I felt that with every page I was being pulled down not only through history but into a nether world where explanation and the inexplicable merged. Although never reaching this place Rosebaum's book gets you frighfully near to it. Although not for traditional lovers of narrative history it does force one to function in a mode where doubt is near and ever present. It is the doubt of not really knowing what makes Hitler the monster that he demonstrably was.Narrative history usually proceeds in linear fashion to describe the horrors of Nazism and Hitler and then as an aside ascribes the explanation to a singular event --- Hitler's obsession for power, his hatred of the Jews, some psychological trauma or problem in his past --- produced an explosion of evil acts on the international stage which Hitler's mechanised death squads made particularly dreadful.But why? Why should Hitler, this very average person act so? What is the explanation? The answers in well reasoned chapters leads one all over the range of excuses. We are found at the end of it grasping for an answer and one of the theorists Claude Lanzmann says merely that there is no explanation.... there is only Hitler and Hitler is beyond explanation. It is such uncomfortable questions that most narrative historians do not engage with Rosenbaum's rigour of analysis.I enjoyed the book. The first chapters were written well and although long, seemed to be edited well. That middle part of the book waxed prolix and Rosenbaum is guilty of some of the grossest lack of editing I have seen in a long while. If he could rework the book from 400 pages to just under 300 he would have a much tighter and tense book, rivetting all the way through. As it stands however I must say that I hestitate to read the book again or to recommend it to my freinds. At 3 stars it a pity that an editor did not turn this book into the 5-star opus major that it could be."},{"Title":"Explaining Hitler: The Search for the Origins of His Evil","review":"As an educated consumer of works on Hitler and the Holocaust, I found Explaining Hitler both lively and thoughtful. Especially important is his treatment of Hitler's first explainers, the journalists of the Munich Post who opposed him for twelve years before he came to power. Much of the rest of the book analyzes various controversies among scholars regarding the source of Hitler's evil. While many of their positions make sense in the context of his life, they make little sense when taken by themselves. I found puzzling Rosenbaum's dismissal of Alice Miller's focus on Hitler's childhood experiences as significant. You don't have to be a Freudian to know that the lack of a warm relationship with one's father can cause a big hole in a man's personality, one that can never be filled, no matter how masculine, how brave, how tough, or how cruel he tries to be. Rosenbaum's book will make much more sense if you are familiar with Hitler's biography. No explanation of the Holocaust is not going very far that does not put it into context of Hitler's biography, of history, of the social mechanisms of stigma, and especially of Hitler's experience of war and its function in the modern nation state. If anything can be said about Hitler's crimes, it is that they were political crimes, that is, committed on behalf of the enlargement of the German state. The scholars such as Rosenbaum discuss at length whether or not Hitler recognized his own evil. What they refuse to look at, however, is Hitler's keen recognition of the terror on which the modern nation state is built. Hitler knew that it was only in the context of war that he was able to carry out his plan of extermination, not only because war gave him cover, but because the psychology of war itself would destroy any opposition. I also missed a discussion of the psycho-historians and their explanations of how we use our leaders as moral garbage cans to do our evil for us. This is not a problem unique to Germany or Austria. As our millenium races to its bloody end, it brings a clear message of the relationship of nationalism, racism, terror, and genocide. In the context of the nation state, it is not so difficult to explain Hitler. What is difficult to explain is our support of the nation state that makes Hitler possible."},{"Title":"Explaining Hitler: The Search for the Origins of His Evil","review":"I am impressed enough to have read it twice, back to back. Author works through both the standard Bullock, Fest, Trevor-Roper)and the kinky (two dozen also-rans) explanations of Hitler's rise. Trouble-- too much a priori assumption. For example, he admits that David Irving has a major point in arguing that there is no DIRECT EVIDENCE to link Hitler with the extermination of Gypsies, homosexuals, Jews, etc. yet he proceeds to explore the nuances of his &quot;evil.&quot; (That Hitler was anti-Semitic is without question, but whether he engineered and directed the executions is still a moot point.) Author is best when he outlines (and demolishes) all the weird theories and farfetched rumors that comprise the total Hitler story. Author has legalistic miknd-- but often is &quot;so sharp he cuts hisself&quot;-- to borrow from Faulkner. REaders m;ust be cautioned about his deductive leap to &quot;conclusions&quot; that are only self-generated opinions. John Lukacs' recent &qu! ot;Hitler in History&quot; is a more reliable exploration of Hitler bibliography, but Rosenbaum has an edge in presentation through creation of a kind of historical &quot;myustery story.&quot; In sum-- take a big dose of salt then read the book."},{"Title":"Explaining Hitler: The Search for the Origins of His Evil","review":"Quite frankly, I agree with the professional journalist/copy editor. I have been slogging through this book for much longer than normal. I find the information quite interesting but the prose and writing is HORRIBLE!

An evil genius?I wouldn't say near-unique, but definitely world-historical in his application of power to galvanize his 'realpolitik' conceptions.Problem is, when you play the 'Evil Genius Sweepstakes,&quot; begin comparing the likes of Lenin, H, Stalin, Mao, Nixon (yes, RMN) you risk reducing them in scale. You have to preserve some measure of their individualness, the distinct character of their crimes, to understand what they were all about.Ron Rosenbaum's book should be cherished. It's not a tome for the timid (I loaned it to a friend, but when I raise the book as subject, she falls dead silent.)The two most noteworthy chapters, for me, were the interview with the theologian Bauer, who makes a convincing argument for doubting the existence of God in the face of something as Awful as the holocaust.While the now famous chapter on the 'Poison Kitchen' reads like a thriller, the concluding segment, in which Rosenbaum revives the scholarship of the late Lucy S. Dawidowicz, is singularly terrifying.Ron Rosenbaum isn't onto anything new. He approaches the problem of Hitler scholarship using the oblique approaches of crime fiction. Raymond Chandler in the Reich. [Fantastic] writing."},{"Title":"Explaining Hitler: The Search for the Origins of His Evil","review":"The title &quot;Explaining Hitler&quot; is particularly poor for this book since the author is not in any position to explain why the various explanations given for how Hitler came to be are tenable or not. The chapter entitled &quot;Dark Matter&quot; is particularly weak, whereas it should have been at the very core of the book. In an attempt to summarize the Freudian psychoanalytic &quot;explanation&quot; for Hitler, the author bases his entire argument around one cause, that Hitler may or may not have had only one testicle. The author may be surprised to learn that psychoanalytic studies of pathological personalities such as Hitler usually contain more substance than &quot;a one ball theory&quot;."},{"Title":"Explaining Hitler: The Search for the Origins of His Evil","review":"This book is 'torture', only overtaken by Robert Waite's 'The Psychopathic God - Adolph Hitler' and enema/water-boarding combinations.What do you say that we 'explain' Hitler differently than the conformist and media-darling writers and historians do. It's about time a new and more realistic understanding of Hitler take center stage.

It was that uncle who in turn convinced Adolf's father, Alois Hitler, illegitimate child that he was, to assume the surname of his purported father (and uncle as well!) rather than retain that of his mother (the comic Schicklegruber). Adding to the colorful history of this family is that fact that Adolf's mother is none other than his father's much younger half-niece (after his father had consorted with other women). This curious parentage is seen to be paralleled by Adolf's own obsession with his own young half-niece (and eventual suicide/murder victim) Geli Raubel!"},{"Title":"Explaining Hitler: The Search for the Origins of His Evil","review":"Ron Rosenbaum fails to do justice to a fascinating subject. The glaring problems of the book being Rosenbaum's complete lack of objectivity, and important omissions.Although Rosenbaum makes a concerted effort to appear objective, he has a clear agenda from the begining. Rosenbaum is on a mission to remove the blame from complex sociological factors such as Goldhagen's &quot;eliminationist anti-Semitism&quot;, and put it squarely back on Hitler. Hitler clearly deserves a large share of the blame for Nazi atrocities, but the Holocaust could not have happened without the German people.Another problem with the objectivity of the book is that Rosenbaum almost exclusively interviews Jewish scholars. Men like Yehuda Bauer, Milton Himmelfarb, and Daniel Goldhagen definitely deserve to be heard, but so do the German scholars. Joachim Fest is among the most respected Hitler biographers, and Rosenbaum makes no mention of him.In the attempt to make sense of Hitler Rosenbaum omits important factors such as Hitler's experiences in WWI, and makes no comparison to other instances of mass murder. It seems silly to portray Hitler as the first and only incarnation of pure evil, when Stalin was murdering millions as well right next door.Overall the book is crudely written, and only loosely tied together. There are much better books on the subject out there."},{"Title":"Explaining Hitler: The Search for the Origins of His Evil","review":"Although Explaining Hitler does shed some new light into the complexity of trying to explain Adolf Hitler, Ron Rosenbaum fails to come to any conclusion of his own. His book focuses on the controversy and dissent between Jewish Historians and their views of Adolf Hitler and if that is not the readers primary interest the book proves to be a tough read."},{"Title":"Explaining Hitler: The Search for the Origins of His Evil","review":"In this ambitious, well researched, well thought book, Rosenbaum critiques those theorists and academics who try to come up with explanations for Hitler's behavior whether Hitler is motivated by childhood traumas, sadistic power, sincere belief in his anti-Semitism, etc., and what Rosenbaum discovers, to his dismay, is that too many deep thinkers cannot accept evil without \\"the fig leaf of rectitude.\\" In other words, too many good-intentioned people unwittingly give Hitler a pass, excusing his evil in a way, by saying he was crazy, deranged, sincerely misguided, a true believer in his own vision.What these theorists are doing, Rosenbaum convincingly argues, is trying to come up with a single theory that says more about themselves than it does Hitler. A single theory advances their specialty and more importantly a theory is a form of consolation, a comfort because we deluded ourselves into believing that evil--even the kind of evil on the magnitude of Hitler--can be explained.In fact, what I got from reading this book is that evil cannot be explained entirely. Hitler, the mountebank, became a cult figure who created an Evil Culture, complete with art, architecture, music, and fashion, and the Cult of his Personality was necessary for the Nazi evil. You couldn't replace him with some other anti-Semite to advance his vision. In other words, Hitler was Nazism.What I concluded from this book is that Hitler was a fake, a clown who became intoxicated by his own cheap demagoguery and the German people's belief in it and in this intoxication he unleashed pure evil: a man who takes sadistic pleasure in torturing and killing others.Rosenbaum warns us not to try to explain evil with one over simplistic theory to suffer the either/or fallacy of Hitler was either a true believer or a cunning manipulator because he was in fact both."},{"Title":"Explaining Hitler: The Search for the Origins of His Evil","review":"Rosenbaum is an enormously gifted writer, who takes a hard look at the ideas and individuals in this book - even the ones he clearly admires. As a result, this book is an enormously stimulating read. If you've ever wondered why history is important or exciting, this book will show you. The academics, philosophers, filmmakers and quacks Rosenbaum observes in this book are not just arguing over the facts of Hitler's rise to power and the Holocaust; most importantly they are arguing over how we should understand those facts, and what meaning Hitler has or should have to us today. Sure enough, these historians are \\"making\\" the history which informs our future."},{"Title":"Explaining Hitler: The Search for the Origins of His Evil","review":"Rosenbaum's book is in essense a series of interviews with historians, writers, and philosphers, covering their views of Hitler, the Holocaust, and reactions to each other's work. It covers tough questions such as anti-semitism within Christianity, the nature of evil, the possibility that Hitler,while he did evil, was not in himself evil, and the morality of trying to explain Hitler. The book is provocative, fascinating, challenging. The interviewees are as fascinating at the topic they discuss, and Rosenbaum is not afraid to display his own opinions and prejudices. An essential read not only for those interested in history, but in human nature."},{"Title":"Explaining Hitler: The Search for the Origins of His Evil","review":"I generally agree with the review written previously by &quot;mungerthegreat.&quot; I believe this book is indispensible to anyone interested in 20th century Germany and especially the WWII period. I do wish he had chosen a different title since the author does not attempt to explain Hitler but instead summarizes the history, and conflicts contained therein, of trying to explain Hitler. It also would have been more comprehensive if the author had analyzed German scholarly attempts at Hitler explanation. Regardless, I still give this book a five star rating."},{"Title":"Explaining Hitler: The Search for the Origins of His Evil","review":"From where did Hitler's intense hatred of Jews come from? There are many theories proposed in this book such as that his mother's doctor(she died of breast cancer) was Jewish...the same doctor he allowed to escape Europe by granting special visas to.Or maybe it was some bad dealings as a young struggling artist in Vienna before WWI. Nobody really knows though Hitler did personally seem to account for it as having developed in Vienna...The book is really insightful in many ways and focuses on Hitler's mental state or such influences upon it.The whole period for Germany, the world and yes Hitler too was tragic...imagine a life wasted on hate."},{"Title":"Explaining Hitler: The Search for the Origins of His Evil","review":"Rosenbaum's wideranging examination of the theories explaining Hitler and the people behind these theories is replete with thoughtful and penetrating insights presented in a remarkable literary style. There are unsung heroes revealed (the Munich Post), incredible detective work at work, and questions that cause authors of books to reveal their own inner thoughts. It is hard to conceive of a person with any interest in Hitler at all that would not thoroughly enjoy and devour this book, destined to become a classic."},{"Title":"Explaining Hitler: The Search for the Origins of His Evil","review":"The book's title is a bit of a misnomer as the author seeks to explain, not Hitler, but the scholarly obsession with (or opposed to) understanding the nature of the Holocaust and Hitler's involvement in its orchestration. I agree with Rosenbaum's skepticism of the psychohistorians' Freudian dissections of Hitler's psyche in an attempt uncover the source of his hatred of Jews. However, I find it curious that he seems to employ convoluted arguments to explain the motivations of some of the &quot;explainers&quot; similar to those he dismisses as unconvincing when applied by the psychohistorians to explore the origin of Hitler's antisemitism. Overall, the book is fascinating, meticulously researched and well composed. The discussions of the nature of good and evil and the implications of the Holocaust on the bearing of God are thought provoking although somewhat overdone."},{"Title":"Explaining Hitler: The Search for the Origins of His Evil","review":"While Hitler is an enigma to most of us, I find it most interesting that nobody has this same sort of fascination with his right-hand man, Himmler. While Hitler's fantasies and his idea that his will alone would bring on the Thousand Year Reich, it was Himmler, head of the SS and later Minister of the Interior, who devised and oversaw the existence of the concentration camps, the Einsatzcommandos, the poison killings.This is not a comparison of the two men, but a ponderance.Watch Himmler on YouTube. A short, smiling little man, surrounded by the SS killers and visiting Auschwitz, is described by another contemporary as resembling a \\"salesman.\\" Himmler does not absorb our attention or warrant any sort of macabre fascination or spell-casting over us. He doesn't really evince eerie, unless you know what he did.Yet, it is Himmler's very appearance that seems to defy the massive embodiment of evil that he really personified. It was this little man, seen by Hitler's secretary Traudl Junge at a dinner party as \\"a man who resembled a primary school teacher,\\" and \\"insignificant with no outstanding characteristics\\" who really brought many of Hitler's private destructive dreams into operating effectiveness.If Hitler needs explaining, then we must ask the same questions of Himmler. The difference is in the two men's outer appearances. There is no menace in Himmler's smooth complexion, no scowling dark eyes. In many ways, he is as much of an enigma as Hitler."},{"Title":"Explaining Hitler: The Search for the Origins of His Evil","review":"I can only say that I could not put Rosenbaum's book down. From the baroque beginning one hears undertones of Transylvania or the Ozarks during the author's visit to the 'cursed' Waldviertel. Rosenbaum's visit to the barren marches of the Austrian/Czech border country evokes centuries of isolation and oppression near Hitler's ancestral village of Dollarsheim, an impoverished fief of the Ottenstein castlelords. Hitler, part Slav, part Jew, part Celt, part Teuton, part perv, part squalid blackmailer.....For a good read evoking some of the same 'objective correlative' dark emotions from dungeons of gloom, try Fitzroy MacLean's wild &amp; wooly Back of Beyone.

He is now known as a massive fraudster who achieved a lot of money and little else.Israel itself, protected by its Media silence has been indicted I understand, for misappropriation (theft)and misuse of proprty belonging to \\"holocaust' victims.The Jewish \\"interference\\" accusation didn't suddenly arise with Hitler. His reaction was only one of numerous reactions after 2000 years of often well earned mistrust when they were enabled to lodge in one nation after another and ended up out on their collective ear.I wish that were not so, I wish in a way it was just mankind's indecency.Obama, a zionist enthusiast who three times passed zionist muster even after Masonic/bilderberger approval before election recently found as did we all just how seriously zionist is the US congress.In those 139 or there-abouts expulsions of jews over centuries, I feel an ache through and through, for the suffering of the innocents, even the not innocent everyday jews and the children and I feel anger towards the culture of control through finance and predatory instinct to achieve self image and position in a group which sees others outside the group as less than human.I also grieve for the Palestinians who suffer so terribly at the hands not only of the IDF and Mossad but through the Jews who emigrate there specifically to settle on Palestinian lands and drive them to reaction which they then call \\"terroism\\" from the \\"arab dogs\\" and to ridicule, spit upon, stone and shoot them.Dominantly the really loud mouthed bigots stealing Palestinians property have American accents.Whilst few WW11 camps were \\"death camps\\" I still grieve for those suffering people, I think of were it my own children and a rage fills me. None of that would excuse me killing Brtish soldiers or 63 years of murdering and displacing Palestinians as well as setting up wars amd mayhem around the globe..including for example South Africa and Sri Lanka...Iraqis mass murdered after the 911 attack was done as a\\"false flag\\" conspiracy to have USA \\"justified in atacking the ME which Israel had been pressing it to do since 1967.(USS Liberty conspiracy/Massacres of Egyptians Gestapo style)......Israel concocted and deliberately infuriated, demonised by repetitous reporting of the same events and misinformed Sadam to achieve the death of innocent people.The 'false flag' used by Israel was not even Iraq's!I grieve also for the ignored, the 500,000 non jews killed with Jewish made Zyklon B (IG Farben) before any Jews were lined up for it and for the 6 million non Jews especially Russians who were so diabolically treated. I grieve for my own family and others who had soldiers returned in appalling health owing to the Jewish manufactured Mustard gas(IG Farben) of WW1.I do not believe the breast beating inference that we would have done anything differently from the German soldiers...we would claim to be under orders as did they.Take a look at USA and its 'rendition centres' as a starting point and in fact its wartime historyI am appalled that even one Jewish person was maltreated during WW11 yet Hitler warned of reaction if the interfering bankers and industrialists didn't back off.They had been pressing for war for years...because all wars advantage them. That doesn't justify what was made to happen , nevertheless. Jews worldwide had boycotted German goods and services, with violence, well before the so often quoted in Jewish and western propaganda \\"nacht krystal\\" and persevered on with it for years after the one night of retaliation.Germany continued to transfer Jews to Palestine...built Irael's first bank to facilitate trade.The Daily Express headlined \\"Jews declare war on Germany\\" in 1933 and certainly Britain was pressed to do that well before Hitler attacked Poland.The jewish attacks on Germany before Hitler took powerwere highly organised with conferencesand publicity.quote (wintersonnewend)\\"The March 24, 1933 issue of The Daily Express of London (shown above(but not here)) described how Jewish leaders, in combination with powerful international Jewish financial interests, had launched a boycott of Germany for the express purpose of crippling her already precarious economy in the hope of bringing down the new Hitler regime. It was only then that Germany struck back in response. Thus, if truth be told, it was the worldwide Jewish leadership - not the Third Reich - that effectively fired the first shot in the Second World War. Prominent New York attorney Samuel Untermyer (above right) was one of the leading agitators in the war against Germany, describing the Jewish campaign as nothing less than a \\"holy war.\\"At the outbreak of war Russia was massacring Ukranians at the quota of 10,0000 every week.It would well explain their attitude towards Jews in camps in WW11 because the Ukranians well knew this persecution was by the Jewish leaders of Russia. All though this time and the \\"cold war\\" the Central Bankers of the USA, Europe and Britain were the Central bankers of Russia. What a great scam that was!!Hitler put his finger absolutely correctly on the people longing for war, for profits and control, the Internatonal Jewish bankers and their Central Bankers who's founder had in 1770 in conspiracy with 12 of the most successful Jewish bankers in Europe had planned the takeover of the world, a plan almost now at success point and openly spoken about as \\"the New Order\\" by politicians.WW1 was one of their outstandng financial successes as was the Russian Revolution and the French \\"revolution\\".WW11 was step two, WW111 is currently underway...millions being killed on the utter deception that the world MUST have \\"democracy\\".Democracy you call it??..what a laugh.Obama used the Australian Parliament recently to announce to Australians now powerless in their political \\"democracy\\" that USA would now become a never-ending power in Asia-Pacific and Gillard arranged prior to that with self admitted illuminati,H Clinton, that 2500 US meatheads would park themselves in Darwin \\"for training exercises\\". Clinton and Gillard have much in common ond hit it off.No \\"by your leave\\" was sought from Australians..between themselves the two zionist puppets agreed that's what would happen.It becomes evident why the zionists of the ALP and elsewhere levered Rudd out and her in. Rudd had the temerity to give a wrist slap to the Israeli embassy over Israel's advertising stunt of using Australian and other passports durng an assassination. Better he'd shut the embassy down.The reality of the NWO is that countries (called the axis of evil) must be bought under the auspices of the Central Bankers, predominently the so called \\"de Rothschilds\\" but they only directly own about 57% of the Central Bank. The notion that Jews have been persecuted for no good reason for 2000 years owing to the murder of Jesus, is vaccuous.Though the crucifixion accusation as a continuum has been a cause of considerable vile injustice and inexcusable bigotry..Jesus would never condone that...Treachery or suspicions of it and powerbroking through money have been dominant in Jews being exiled. Several rulers have tried to give them a break from Nebuchadnezzar forward, but though many countries have been considered for the stealing of lands for permanent Jewish settlement none has suited he end purpose. Many Auvergnians, by the way,still regard themselves as \\"like Jews\\".Palestine was always the goal of Khazar and Askenazi jews after the Hebrew invasion and massacre after 40 years wandering the desert. Now we act on the ludicrous proposition that Jews had a right to it..The Hebrews had no right other than forced occupation as they are trying to emulate now. As Hebrews are as scarde as 1930 pennies, what now claims \\"ownership\\" are frauds from Europe and the Soviet bloc...who's ancestors never set foot in Canaan.One thing is absolutely so..the jews today are not hebrew, most are of Asian descent from Europe, viz Georgia, initiated by a conversion to a form of Judaism around 680 ad for power and profit.They successfully use such an error filled story book as the old testament to justify their absurd claim pretending jews today were jews of 3000 years ago and governments controlled by the zionist central bankers and churches without the guts to deny the lies support them.The term \\"creating a state within a state\\" has been often used. Their notion of being \\"special, chosen by 'g-d' \\" and that the rest of humanity are Goys, human cattle is omnipresent and is Israel's outlook today.You may not like to hear it, but that's how it is.Today there's a multi-billion dollar/ year industry generated from the \\"holocaust\\" with and IDF no better than Hitler's gestapo in some areas and history proves it.The Gestapo was a powder puff compared to Mossad. The greatest planned obstacle to peace in the world since WW11 has been the Israel/US conspiracy. Both reject any form of moderation even by the institutions they use whenever they wish to impose sanctions on others. It is a truly sick situation, supportd by Governments in Australia, Europe and Britain to name but three of the major zionist/US sycophant governments on both sides of politics.The present Prime minister of the present government of Australia was an active zionist when at University and whilst threatening legal action on people calling her a zionist (as I heard) she still applauds the Israeli deceptions such as \\"the Palestinians broke the treaty\\" leading to \\"cast lead\\" with its vile and debauched atrocities by the IDF and the USA who supplied their disgusting weaponry and shiploads of cash.Cast lead was planned long before the breaking of the treaty by Israel and was a \\"goodbye zionist friend George, welcome zionist friend Barrack\\" celebration.Ostrovsky in his \\"Deception\\" books speaks time after time as does ben Menashe in Profits of War how utterly stupid the CIA is and how Israel deceives them and laughs at them whilst conrolling major US institutions.Israel does as it pleases and then parasites on other nations and nationals and corporate criminals, for cash.In the meantime the skeptics and ill-educated dream on like Huck Finn down the river....they supporting absent-mindedly the conspirators and the vile actions of Israel and the US Presidency...don't worry about Hitler...he's long gone, concern yourselves more with the Hitler continuum (see operation Paperclip\\" and MK Ultra\\" as well as Pilger on the IMF/World Bank and the CIA. They specialise on behalf of the New Order in ruining countries then offering money and when they default demanding assets like rainforests be destroyed and turned over to \\"production\\" to gain control.These countries don't suddenly jump up and start hacking down thousands of acres of trees...they are rquired to \\"pay debt\\" after usually CIA conspiracy and mass murder, ruining economy, changing of government to a sycophant,lend money which they can never repay, attack assets.)The same people involved in crippling the German economy by inflicting massive debt on Germany supply and deny the money to ensure the West is crippled financially and emotionally. How many realise for example that the appalling plastic notes we use only came into use through hundreds of millions of dollars in bribes being paid world wide...Greece Europe today in their crisis and USA also are now beholden to the Central bank which prints of billions at a nett cost to it of a few hundred dollars to 'lend to them' ONLY as taxpayer guaranteed at exorbitant rates and gaining political control further with every dollar.Few understand derivitives or that the vast quantities of notes the Central Bankers churn out have no value..worthless coloured paper with illuminati symbols and a value number. They have no underlying value at all....the way they become valuable is by the Central bank and its sayanin banks encouraging debt. When you work to repay the loan/bankcard and the outrageous interest and charges you begin to give the worthless money symbol,real value but only for an instant. That's enough to create 90% more notes and lend them out...Debt is the primary tool for the jewish central bankers...themselves never audited..to exercise government control.\\"Give me control of a nations currency and I care not who makes the laws\\" 'deRothschild.Hitler, for all his abominations was not anti-jewish as a young man, they however mocked him.I will not use the rather stupid and inaccurate term \\"anisemite\\" concrening Hitler..it is as stupid a slur attached to him as anyone else...part of the zionist control mchanisms as are the JDL, ADL, Bnai Brith, CFR and numerous other anti democracy forces.Germany formed Israel in the 1930's and transferred willing jews to there.That included terrorists such Stern and the Irgun Jews of whom a very mild exposure comes in the truly excellent film \\"the Promise\\" which Zionists from \\"jewish\\" powerbroking organisms have tried to have banned. The complaints are ignorant and infantile, but its the POWER over us all they want to enforce by such a ban.The Palestinians and rightly so both resented and feared the Zionist invasions.They knew the jews wanted the whole place and we now know that in WW1(commenced by a freemason ...deRothshild's captive..assassinaing Ferdinand.) and WW11 the USA was not going to assist the allies but did so on the instructions of the Jewish powerbrokers when Britain on both occasions at the point of defeat agreed to hand over Palestine as a \\"Jewish refuge\\".Though by then in force for 15 years of misery for the Palestinians the matter was \\"made legal\\" in 1948, the boundaries delineated. Insane with fury the Jewish terrorists began to massacre the British and anyone near them..because they didn't get the 100% they wanted. Since then over 63 years of lies deception and 400 billon in US aid alone, Israel has taken over the balance of Palestine headed by the truly satanic Mossad and a string of governments so steeped in lies they cannot even give their real names...from \\"ben Gurion\\" to \\"Netenyahu\\"..No one stops them no one is permitted to criticise them unless prepared to face legal charges or assassination. It has perfomed the most appalling experiments on captives and even on poor blacks in Sowheto hospital according to a Mossad Katsa.It has a massive..massive..regime of spies and assassins and their 'sayanins\\" you may not comprehend unless your read \\"by way of deception\\" (Ostrovsky) .Hitler may have been evil, certainly the founder of the Central bank was, however are not worse than he, those who knowing how wrong some actions are and having seen the effects of war and experimentation on humans,have continued them to this very day.Whatever we think of Hitler, and however deservedly, he was ultimately a puppet. He was as I said before very much aware of who was rotten in the state of Denmark and America and Russia to name but three, it was his actions though which went over the top once the invasions began. The grief for all those 100 million lives as with WW11 and with those murdered 100 million in Russia and millions of others should also be allocated to the Central bankers which plot and finance all sides of such events.The allied response was in the cases of bombing and fire bombing of German civilians in my view more evil than Hitler and resulted in the bombing of London.The Israeli hierarchy conspired with Germany against the allies. Hitler knew as did many others who conveniently ignored it and still ignore it, and that the US Presidency and much of the country was pro National Socialism and had massive investments in Germany's war effort as did the conglomerate of Standard Oil and General Motors as just two examples,throught the early part of the war...Until the Britsh were reeling, the US refused proper aid and saw Britain prepared to relinquish Palestine, overnight then it all changed.He also knew that Russia,a nation controlled by jews,(see any unexpurgated Russian history of the revolution funded by Jacob Schiff of Loebs on behalf of de Rothchild) ) was a threat to Europe and he was not going to tolerate it.Hitler in his bid to become the New Order went overboard but he was a genius, wonderful orator and a determined soldier.None of what he wanted was worth the sacrifices of mankind and his efforts to breakdown Jewish power in Germany and Russia ultimately failed.The Central bankers pocketed the profits ready to move to the next war.They are going like a house on fire after fulfilling via the \\"Globall Financial Crisis\\"...(and they have done it at other eras)...Rockefeller's call for a massive world wide catastrophe to accelerate the NWOP through people's misery...The history of war within the USA is the history of deRothschild actions and the Masonic Lodge's manipulations. Britain has twice been brought to its knees by deRothschild's..post Waterloo and via Geroge Soros, their agent, apart from at wartime.. Britain so massively in debt in the 19th century colonised places such as India to repay these rapacious money lenders instead of locking them up and stripping their assets...as should be done today...deRothschild's wealth is in the order of 300 trillion dollars on estimates alone.Rochefeller about 30 trillion.That would cure the world of debt and leave plenty to spare..Sarkozy has been distracting us recently as has the womaniser Strauss Khan, and Frau Merkel,she for whom I have some admiration..however we there is now an even more sinister move, a sort of subliminal New Order anouncement by Gillard of Australia to put Australians into even more debt than they now \\"enjoy\\" ...She has raised and spoken in support of Australian taxayers contributing hundreds of millions in aid to the European /Greek crisis as they are \\"after all, a part of the global community\\"...Well actually 'global community' is a misleading New Order term to prepare us all for the one world government and she is a part of it as are the prsidency conspirators however ...I don't know about you...especially if you are inured by the laugh-offs about \\"conspiracy theories\\" but I am not going to be a serf for any Jewish central Banker or it's political sayanims.Part of the distraction is the relentless proposing of Buffet as the world's richest man...he's nowhere near that but it keeps attention away from the \\"deRothschilds\\" and the Rockefellers who are draining the world into financial chaos quite deliberately.We are all being nudged pushed and inveigled into a society which will make Hitler's look like a pub crawl....it's massacres of dissenters and people 'in the way\\" has been going on ever since WW11...time to wake up fellers. .

On the surface, this view is idiotic to today's secular society.

In terms of body counts of innocent victims, 10 million of them being fellow Germans, Hitler's sins against the Jews are trumped by his sins against his own people, not to mention those 20 million pretty dead Russians, 10 million of which were completely innocent civilians, which constitutes three times the horror visited upon Rosenbaum's Jewish relatives. Rosenbaum is, like other minority groups, making claim that his ancestors were the champion victims. Perhaps in terms of percentages, but percentages aren't realistic metrics, only total numbers are, which makes the Russians and Germans tops in this competition. I wonder if Rosenbaum ever even considered who was actually massacred by the war, other than his targetted Jews?"},{"Title":"Explaining Hitler: The Search for the Origins of His Evil","review":"This book does not really explain Hilter. Rather it highlights what the various explanations for Hilter reveal about the people or societies attempting the explanations. Rosenbaum offers a balanced assessment of the various opinions commonly offered to explain what happened in Germany in the 1920's through the 1940's and the European reaction to those event. Explaining Hitler is not a full history of the Nazi era but it is a fascinating social analysis of our response to that era."},{"Title":"Explaining Hitler: The Search for the Origins of His Evil","review":"There has been an effort lately to name the \\"person of the century\\" , good or bad. Let's limit the field to only those characters known world-wide by just one name. Certainly Hitler will be included within that group; more than some are, like him, at least mass murderers. So our century, more sanguinary than others seems to bestow fame upon those who manage to climb to the top of a mountain of corpses. After the atrocity, the question is always Why? As if in finding the full, complete and verified explanation would in some way soothe our concerns about our world and ourselves. If we found the curriculum and study guides and the library and plans for the Holocaust Management Business School ; would we be better or worse off for knowing? Mr. Rosenbaum in looking for Hitler interviews 25 \\"explainers\\" a collection of historians, psychohistorians, pundits, philosophers, all manner of academia with grant money to spend and time to blow a few years in Europe. What he finds are cliques, and groups in trench warfare against each other, sniping in the professional journals, tossing press-release grenades ; squadrons of publisits carpet faxing the media.One explainer is combing all the existent photographs of early 20th century Vienna looking for just one protean image: Freud, Mahler and Hilter walking arm in arm on the Ringstrasse. If we had that photo would the 6 Million rest easier? Would it stop or start another 50 years of Hilter books?One dillusional explainer, a former literature student, parses every Hitler speach looking for \\"code-words\\" by which Hitler communicated secret messages to his followers. Not finding them doesn't mean that Hitler only meant what he said; on the contrary , the very absence of \\"code-words\\" is evidence that the secret communications were made. Go figure. It is the lack of specific commands and orders that drive this explainer and others to read between lines and words; finding just what they want. Has the same Rorschach technique been applied to others on our list, Gandhi, Einstein, Stalin, Mao, Freud, Churchill? Does it tell us more about the subject or the \\"explainer\\"? More about ourselves?We meet the goofballs you already know , Goldhagen and his friend Irving; but the real surprise, the crank that makes both look like a thoughtful, meticulous, professional historians, is the unfortunate Herr Lanzmann. He has all the answers because only he is allowed to ask the questions; all other explainers are revisionists, justifiers and deniers...Nazis. He is the true \\"paper Eichmann\\" whose work is to destroy all other analysis, comment and opinion; a Fascist with a small \`f' that only Adolf could hug. Has the community of explainers accepted into their fold a Hitlerian character; hysterical in his eliminationist and exclusionary rhetoric? Are they afraid of him? Will they continue to allow his rant?It seems to me that Rosenbaum in bashing around on the world tour of Hitler Studies has produced two things; the first is the best biography of Hitler yet , not the tactical military dictator, but the person behind the image; incomplete but compressive. The second is a review of the convoluted and politically charged community of explainers; those with agendas and those unbiased, but all engaged in an activity that insures , after a half a century, that Hitler lives.Put this book up on your shelf next to it's only comparable volume: \\"The Hitler of History\\"."},{"Title":"Explaining Hitler: The Search for the Origins of His Evil","review":"The content is interesting (4.5), the text does not read (1). Full of obscure words, clumsy syntax. Should be rewritten with readability in mind, then I will give it a higher mark."},{"Title":"Explaining Hitler: The Search for the Origins of His Evil","review":"This fine book fulfills the promise of Rosenbaum's provocative article in the New Yorker from several years back. Rosenbaum covers all the familiar territory in Hitler scholarship, as well as much that is quite new -- his retrieval for memory of the &quot;Poison Kitchen,&quot; among Hitler's first and fiercest contemporary critics is vivid and moving. As a journalist writing what is essentially a meditation on evil, Rosenbaum is free to go where the professional historians feel they cannot, and he uses that license to considerable effect. He has a talent for the lingering image: Hitler leaving Geli Raubel's body on the floor of their home to grow cold while he went off to concoct an alibi, the imagined scene of Stalin contemplating Hitler's bones in some musty bin of the Kremlin, the haunted landscape of Hitler's ancestoral home territory. Rosenbaum manages to be respectful and fair to all the opinions he encounters, even as he leaves the clear impression that his ultimate sympathies are with Lucy Davidowicz's explanation -- '...Because He wanted to...' For me, the point, reiterated several times in the book, that Hitler must not be considered beyond explanation, but that doesn't mean he HAS been explained, is central: the most disturbing point made by Rosenbaum -- almost off-hand -- is his observation that the region Hitler's family came from produced virtually no historial personage of note for hundreds of years -- then, him. Nothing, then, this rough beast...The Truth of Hitler and his crimes may indeed be out there, but it's impossible to conceive of any truth that doesn't suggest frightening things about human potential. Rosenbaum does not shrink from this."},{"Title":"Explaining Hitler: The Search for the Origins of His Evil","review":"I don't need to add another praise for this book. The author catches two flies with one stroke by really digging into the myths and half-myths of Hitler and by introducing the different individuals and their frameworks, who try to come to terms with that historical figure and his deeds.After reading this book, I was amazed how the theories treated related to the two following books:Richard Sennet &quot;Fall of public man&quot; - where there are explicit references to the acting of public behaviour and self-perception.Mintzberg et al. &quot;Strategy Safari&quot; - which is actually a business book explaining different trends of strategy theory. Especially, the chapter on strategy as a cognitive process would lend itself easily to emphasize certain explanations of Hitler's actions.In summary, I would like to indicate that, even if one is not interested in this specific period and Holocaust studies, this book will certainly allow you to transfer a lot of ideas into other ares. Above all, &quot;Explaining Hitler&quot; is simply a riveting read; and despite its very personal narrative style, it features remarkably objective observations."},{"Title":"Explaining Hitler: The Search for the Origins of His Evil","review":"The author has done a very good job of digging out some fascinating nuggets of information about Hitler, such as the Henry Ford connection and the possiblilty that Hitler was an offical mourner at the funeral of a Jewish socialist a matter of months before becoming a Nazi. I had expected to see a contrast of Hitler's background or upbringing with Stalin's/Pol Pot's/Mao's to try and find a common threads. One of the saddest comments on the 20th century is that the atrocities of Nazi Germany are perhaps not as unique as the author seems to think, &amp; I was disappointed that the book had less comparison with other personalities that perpetrated state-sponsored mass murder."},{"Title":"Explaining Hitler: The Search for the Origins of His Evil","review":"Previous commentators have summarized the book. What I'd like to speak about is the terrifying brilliance of the writing. Rosenbaum has a piercing intellect and also a gift for language -- a rare combination. Reading this book I felt I was accompanying a brilliant man on a very important quest -- indeed, the quest of his life. His obsssion with trying to explain Hitler became my obsession. I felt total identification with his journey. For me the book had the drama of a very good novel, with Rosenbaum the detective-protagonist and a viable &quot;Hitler explanation&quot; the solution to a great mystery. This is not only an important work on account of its content, but is also a terrific piece of literary journalism.

For instance, there are a few paragraphs devoted to the description of Geli Raubal. The author questions how she could have seduced Hitler because, when the author saw photographs of her, he could not see any such &quot;spark.&quot; I (like many other readers, for certain) have no idea what Geli looks like, so the questioning of her &quot;siren-like nature&quot; is lost on me.All in all an incredible read -- I haven't been able to put it down yet."},{"Title":"Explaining Hitler: The Search for the Origins of His Evil","review":"I would be lying if I said I enjoyed all of this book, some of it I didn't and skipped over.

This book made me reconsider my ideas of evil.I have read this book twice and get more out of it each time I pick it up."},{"Title":"Explaining Hitler: The Search for the Origins of His Evil","review":"He is a satanic cartoon, the nightmare we cannot awake from and the clich&eacute; we erect against the void he made. He is the black hole in the middle of our blasted century, a figure so weighted down with the allegorical trappings of Evil that his reality seems ungraspable. Adolf Hitler stands at the limit of so many kinds of human understanding -- moral, political, psychological, perhaps even metaphysical -- that he is forever escaping into the gilded glare of the absolute, like the hideous negative of one of those inscrutable saints in Byzantine portraits.&quot;These people must not know where I come from,&quot; Hitler said when he learned of an early investigation into his murky origins. &quot;Nobody must know who I am.&quot;For half a century, historians have been trying to learn who he was -- and there is still no consensus. In &quot;Explaining Hitler,&quot; Ron Rosenbaum tries to approach him indirectly, by interrogating the ways that other scholars and journalists have tried to explain Hitler. He hopes to discover, he says, &quot;if not the truth about Hitler, then some truths about what we talk about when we talk about Hitler. What it tells us about Hitler, what it tells us about ourselves.&quot;Agree or disagree, few contemporary writers are better equipped to pull off this tricky double task. Rosenbaum, who writes a column of sui generis criticism for the New York Observer and teaches literary journalism at Columbia University, is a rare triple threat: He is a first-rate thinker, a fine reporter and a superb writer. Explaining Hitler gave me inner glimpses into myself. As I have often wondered--why does he fascinate me so?A somewhat slanted, yet striking view of, whom some refer to as the artist of death."},{"Title":"Explaining Hitler: The Search for the Origins of His Evil","review":"Ron Rosenbaum tells us he went into this project looking for some still-undiscovered Hitler thesis, presumably one that would neatly explain why the man did the evil he did. Not having found this magic key, the author goes after many (or is it most?) of the notions which, up to now, have been used to explain how Hitler's personality incubated. And he has an alarming habit of using ridicule and lavish speculation when facts alone fail to demolish stories that interfere with his views.Hence we have chapter subtitles that refer to \\"The Family Romance of the Hitler Explainers\\" and \\"The Sexual Fantasy of the Hitler Explainers\\" -- taunts from which we may safely infer that R. doesn't like the notions mocked therein, the one about Hitler having a Jewish grandfather and almost certainly believing he did (\\"The Family Romance\\"), or the suspicion of something deviant in the dictator's sex habits (\\"The Sexual Fantasy, etc.\\"). Similarly, he puts poison labels on \\"the Hans Frank story\\" (the Jewish grandfather again) and \\"the Heiden story,\\" in which a reporter Rosenbaum otherwise respects makes the faux pas of saying Der Fuehrer was a coprophiliac, which R. translates into the symbolic but understandable smearing of excrement on Hitler's memory. R. also uncovers a little-known magazine interview in which a woman dated by the young Adolf appears to remove the stigma of deviance from Hitler the romantic suitor. Or does she? (In any case, R. doesn't call this \\"the Mimi Reiter story\\" as would be likely if he didn't buy it.)And could Hitler's father possibly have been a regular sort of parent instead of the nightmare disciplinarian so often hitherto described? Rosenbaum seems ready to think so. And his mocking use of the term \\"Hitler Explainers\\" (n.b.: in a book called \\"Explaining Hitler\\") leaves experts thus described smelling like amateurs whose ideas are scarcely worth hearing. The explainers he interviews fare a little better, or at least some do. Take Rudolph Binion, one of whose theories is that the Jewish Dr. Bloch's painful treatment of Hitler's mother at the time of her death created so much unconscious resentment in her son that the doctor is to blame for practically the entire Holocaust. (On a conscious level, Der Fuehrer not only expressed gratitude to Dr. Bloch, but gave him safe passage out of Austria when he needed it, but R. kindly explains that conscious and unconscious feelings or gestures need not agree.) Though Binion's must rank among the most spectral of Fuehrer scenarios, he gets just as much respect as the British historian Hugh Trevor-Roper, and maybe more.Give Rosenbaum one star for showing up for this deadly mission and at least one more for such chapters as the one on David Irving and another on the Munich Post, the Nazi-christened \\"Poison Kitchen\\" that gave full voice to some of Hitler's earliest enemies. But there are also chapters -- the one on Daniel Goldhagen, for instance -- where intellectual hairs undergo exquisite micro-surgery while a few hundred Hitler demons dance merrily on the head of a pin. And fathoming Der Fuehrer is hardly this book's long suit.I prefer to call it \\"Dis-Explaining Hitler\\" since much of what we had previously by way of psychic explanation is on R's demolition list. Oops, there go the so-called psycho-historians and their Freudian interpretations! Down the tubes with the \\"family romances\\" and \\"sexual fantasies\\" of the other \\"Hitler explainers.\\" Into the tank along with the deviant Adolf and the abusive Papa Hitler, both now scrubbed up to fit the possibility of normalcy, however remote. As this book winds down to its last paragraphs, we find the author in a quandary about where his thousands of words have gotten us.After 395 pages, I'd like to know, too. Yes, I remember Rosenbaum's sweet way with words in hundreds of previous - and ongoing -- appearances. For a look at the kind of Hitler explanations R. seems to be struggling against, try George Victor's recent but less advertised \\"Hitler: The Pathology of Evil.\\" Both in order to add a bit of balance, and because Mr. Victor is uninterested in rewriting history in the service of originality. (Note: This review was originally written in 1998 and taken down several months later at my request. Somehow it remained posted on German Amazon, from which I just copied and reposted it with a few edits on 2-18-10. George Victor's book has, I think, found a good many more readers since then.)"},{"Title":"Explaining Hitler: The Search for the Origins of His Evil","review":"This book is a great introduction to the ways the world's thinkers, philosophers, historians and conspiracy enthusiasts have taken hold of the enigma of Hitler and projected about every theory on to him that the lecture circuit will tolerate.It pays homage to the brave early dissenters in Germany who payed for their lives while trying to alert a comatose public to the dangers of this cartoon devil with a microphone and an army.The second half of the book shows some of the arrogance of the researchers who felt a need to claim the holocaust as their personal property and decide what is ethical discussion and what is blasphemy. I applaud Mr Rosenbaum for his courage to point out that nothing is gained by making Hitler a unique devil, the very symbol of evil, without probing the root causes because then we do put ourselves in danger of ignoring the sad but undeniable truth that he could be duplicated just like any other human menace and madness and cruelty can reoccur. I found the controversy about whether it is tasteful to put his baby picture on the cover very telling because it shows how uncomfortable people are with the truth that behavior is made and facilitated and encouraged, even the most diabolic edges of human impulse, and it is not inborn. Adolf Hitler looks like every other baby and that in itself should be our warning sign."},{"Title":"Explaining Hitler: The Search for the Origins of His Evil","review":"To the non-Holocuast scholar unfamiliar with the enormous amount of research on Hitler, this book provides a valuable framework that enables the reader to understand and place in the appropriate school of contemporary thought the controversial debates that swirl around Hitler. However, because Rosenbaum analytical gaze remains tightly fixed on Hitler the man, and not Nazism or the German people , he regretfully neglects accounts, such as William Shire's, which use socio-historical forces, to explain Hitler's catastropic emergence. Instead, he explores explanations, mostly Freudian, which concentrate primarily on personality factors such as Hitler's childhood traumas, his relations with women, with the possibility that he had a congenital, genital defect, his Macbethian obession with tainted blood, and so on. The riveting protraits of the &quot;explainers&quot; themsevles and their &quot;off the record comments&quot;- Hitler scholars such as Goldenhagen, Bauer, Stiener, Dawidowicz, Micheels, Maccoby and film maker Lanzman-make alone make this book worthwhile. Also of great worth is the enlightening discussion of how Hitler and the Holocaust have influenced modern conceptions of good and evil. All in all, this is not a perfect book, but an excellent book nevertheless, which is well worth anyone's time who wants to know more about the most important and disturbing subject of recent history."},{"Title":"Explaining Hitler: The Search for the Origins of His Evil","review":"Written about the history of Hitler studies, Rosenbaum gives a well-written and thoughtful insight into Hitler historians (be they primarily focused on Hitler or some other aspect of the Third Reich/Holocaust - the figure of Hitler always seems to rear his head). Direct interviews with historians gives Rosenbaum insight into who these historians are, and attempts to explain not only what we believe about Hitler but WHY we believe it. Very interesting, and the bible of Hitler historiographies."},{"Title":"Explaining Hitler: The Search for the Origins of His Evil","review":"Those with more than a passing interest in Hitlerhistoriography will probably feel obliged to add this annoying book totheir libraries (it will generate a lot of discussion), but those with more than a passing knowledge of the subject will find it the unfocused work of a tendentious dilettante. It's an attempt to explain Hitler's explainers--or more often than not to set them straight--largely by rehashing the secondary literature. There are also some entertaining interviews with some of the best-known explainers including Hugh Trevor-Roper, Alan Bullock and the controversial David Irving. Basically, this is a journalistic version of scholar John Lukacs' superb &quot;The Hitler of History&quot; (1997), which is light years superior both in content and writing. Ron Rosenbaum is one of those reporters who seem to feel the reader will be fascinated by the story of how they got their stories (cranking through all that microfilm). In his search for Truth, he find! s himself &quot;feeling a bit like the obsessed detective in [the movie 'Laura'].&quot; He can't refer us simply to Albert Schweitzer's &quot;The Quest of the Historical Jesus.&quot; It must be to &quot;a fading copy of which I came across in a secondhand bookstore in Jerusalem at the time I was interviewing theologian Emil Fackenheim and historian Yehuda Bauer.&quot; This man suffers from terminal logorrhea; he's a windbag with a penchant for belaboring the obvious and beating dead horses. Among the horses: Was Hitler's paternal grandfather Jewish? (Rosenbaum doesn't know.) Did Hitler conspire in the violent death of his half-niece Geli Raubal? (Rosenbaum doesn't know.) Was Hitler missing a testicle? (Rosenbaum doesn't know.) There are some shocking omissions. Among the prominent Hitler explainers Rosenbaum barely mentions in passing are Joachim C. Fest (considered by many critics to have written the best of all the Hitler biographies), Eberhard Jackel and Ian Kersh! aw. Sebastian Haffner doesn't even rate a footnote. Wo! uld that a few thousand first-person pronouns had been omitted instead. Another irksome cachet: Even in footnotes, Rosenbaum won't date his interviews--which presumably could have occurred at any point during a decade of research. Thus he'll tell us an interview with Rudolph Binion was conducted over pasta and potato salad during lunch at a Pick-a-Chick deli in Brookline, Massachusetts. But he won't tell us even the year. As for focus, what begins as an examination of Hitler narrows to an examination of the Holocaust and such related topics as the nature of evil (if it exists) and the nature of God (if God exists). And Rosenbaum in the end seems to agree largely with the late Lucy S. Dawidowicz that what happened in Europe during 1939-45 was not so much World War II as (to quote her 1975 book title) &quot;The War Against the Jews.&quot; Well, it was certainly that, among other ghastly things. But Hitler emerges here as a one-dimensional hater rather than an egomaniac! set on world conquest. Among the many interesting questions Rosenbaum doesn't ask about Hitler: What made this idiot declare war on the United States four days after Pearl Harbor? Finally, Rosenbaum dwells at length (of course) on &quot;Shoah&quot; director Claude Lanzmann's impassioned assertion that publication in the past of Hitler baby photos was an immoral &quot;obscenity&quot; that could lure the unwary into trying to understand the forces that transformed this innocent babe into a mass murderer--and maybe even to entertain &quot;the forbidden possibility of forgiving Hitler.&quot; On the jacket of Rosenbaum's book: A well-known Hitler baby photo, described in the author's text as showing us &quot;a mildly pensive cherub.&quot; True, writes Rosenbaum, we might project upon that face &quot;the stirrings of some deep emotional disturbance in embryo.&quot; He adds: &quot;But we might just as easily see there not incipient demonism but a kind of gentleness and sensitiv! ity. We could just as easily predict this child would turn ! out to be Albert Schweitzer.&quot; Don't invite Lanzmann and Rosenbaum to your next party."},{"Title":"Explaining Hitler: The Search for the Origins of His Evil","review":"\\"Hitler represents near ultimate evil.\\" Yehuda Bauer, the most authoritative historian of the Holocaust, said that to the author Ron Rosenbaum (p.xxi). As a teenager, I saw the Germans, torturing, beating, shooting, hanging, and other unimaginable acts of extreme wickedness, carried out against innocent people, mostly Jewish but also many others. Experiencing or just witnessing such concatenation of atrocities, for no other reason than wickedness, will not be explicable or fathomable to me. How much more brutal should a person be to be characterized as a radical evil rather than \\"near evil.\\"The author dedicated his book EXPLAINING HITLER \\"to those who survived and those who did not.\\" As one who did survive the Holocaust, I appreciate Ron Rosenbaum's efforts in his extensive research, trying to explain Hitler. Most theories attributed to Hitler's behavior and actions are just speculative, not verifiable and ridicules. Missing one testicle, being a sexual pervert, mother's Jewish doctor was not able to cure his mother's (Klara) cancer; his father (Alois) being of Jewish ancestry, was an abuser or anti-Semite Streicher's influence, those are not justifiable reasons for the Holocaust. Hitler might be convinced of his own rectitude but in reality he was transcendentally evil. He was lacking a moral conscience; he brought the Holocaust and led to the loss of 62 million lives in WWII. To my understanding Hitler was plain and simple a radical evil man. Tragically, Hitler's driving force ordered others to implement the Final Solution. Himmler, Heydrich and others carried out Hitler's evil dreams into operating effectiveness, like Auschwitz and other killing centers.Forced labor camps were established for the purpose of extermination through labor rather than to keep the German economy abreast. The Germans would rather abuse us than use us as substitutes for the German work force which had been mobilized for military services. The Germans had a reputation of being superbly efficient. While thousands of skilled working Jewish men were annihilated, the ministries of industry of the German Reich were in constant search for evermore manpower. While being captive, I could not understand that paradoxical policy. Apparently, the Germans were not prudent slave owners. They had an asinine policy! Nazi Germany was rushing to develop the apparatus of death rather than spur the economy. I wish Rosenbaum would have made references to that phenomenon.Hitler, by killing himself, did indeed escaped explanation. More troublesome to all is the fact that Hitler and so many of his cohorts managed to escape judgment."},{"Title":"Explaining Hitler: The Search for the Origins of His Evil","review":"A friend gave me this book several years ago; and it's difficult, sometimes, for me to convey to people why this is the one book to read when it comes to the most evil human being of the 20th century. The title certainly suggests that Rosenbaum's intent may be to explain what made Hitler 'Hitler' in a way that might turn him into just another psycho, some sort of merciless wretch who couldn't help himself. The cover photo of baby Hitler some might regard as a reminder that Hitler began life just like the rest of us.Instead Rosenbaum's focus is to describe what others had theorized about Hitler - that he hated Jews, for example, because Hitler was ashamed of his own Jewish ancestry - and investigate on his own. The result is one of the most remarkable books of non-fiction I've ever encountered, though it reads very much like a detective novel. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!"},{"Title":"Explaining Hitler: The Search for the Origins of His Evil","review":"One of the few times that I agree completely with the comments of virtually everyone on the book's jacket. Rosenbaum presents the insights of the world's 'experts' on Hitler...from historians, theologians, psychologists, psychiatrists,etc. all of whom have spent a significant part of their lives studying the Hitler 'phenomena'.(Insights which in many, if not most, cases are unique and 'opposite'to those of their colleagues.) From beginning to end, the narrative was riveting. I felt the intensity build as I read, leaving me exhausted and overwhelmed. at the end. Few books have impressed me in quite that way."},{"Title":"Explaining Hitler: The Search for the Origins of His Evil","review":"In Rosenbaum's &quot;Explaining Hitler&quot;, the opening chapters give us a sense of stability yet total confusion of Hitler. Yes, the book is graphic and yes, the book is REAL. The writing is quite smoothly written, however, constant tautology gives the book an overall boringness to it. This does not take away the greatness or the interest of the book, in case. Rosenbaum's vocabulary was quite extensive and some may need a dictionary near by, especially during his introduction. However, for all you word freaks out there, this book is quite for you. But you must have some type of interest in Hitler and a large interest into how he became what he was: A monster."},{"Title":"Explaining Hitler: The Search for the Origins of His Evil","review":"This is a heavy and excellent book, provoking one to serious thought. For one who is not a student of Hitler I thought it was full of fascinating information and I recommend it wholeheartedly."},{"Title":"Explaining Hitler: The Search for the Origins of His Evil","review":"I read this book in about two days (off and on reading). Well written although at times, the interrogations of the historians seemed a little naive...an historian just talking (without proof reading or time to study a statement) on a controversial subject should be taken with a little salt...nevertheless, as a good a survey of the historiograpy of hitler as there is...very interesting discussion of the Munich journalists..why not some pictures, though...a picture of the remains of dollersheim and other matters would have been very interesting. One fact point...I don't think Pasewalk is on the western front...it's a little north of berlin...also wasn't the eagles' nest given to hitler for his fiftieth birthday, i.e., 1939?"},{"Title":"Explaining Hitler: The Search for the Origins of His Evil","review":"I was sceptical, at first, that Rosenbaum's newest work would help me to separate fact from fantasy in the life of Hitler -- but Rosenbaum has done a masterful job. His chapters on the work of Munich journalists would in the 1920s to uncover the true Hitler -- the political criminal -- is a tour-de-force. I cannot say enough about this book. It does what few other non-fiction books are capable of doing -- it will keep you up, reading and thinking, into the early hours. In my opinion, the book is simply above criticism."},{"Title":"Explaining Hitler: The Search for the Origins of His Evil","review":"The information in this book is excellent. That being said, the prose is at times absolutely outlandish. The introduction gives you a cue of what's to come as the author gives you a \\"Dennis Milleresque\\" outline of the facts. After he used the term \\"Heathcliffian\\" I knew I may be in over my head. I ended up keeping my Franklin electronic dictionary next to the book to define the plethora of odd synonyms used.It's worth the dollars. Just prepare to feel uneducated."},{"Title":"Explaining Hitler: The Search for the Origins of His Evil","review":"I had heard this was a good book. I was not prepared for how excellent and absorbing it turned out to be._Explaining Hitler_ does NOT explain the mystery of der Fuhrer. In fact, it often questions whether such a thing can ever fully be done. The book is about the various parties who have devoted much of their lives to the attempt -- their theories, their possible motivations, the pitfalls and blind spots -- and in the course of that raises larger issues about the nature of knowledge, of history, of identity. The book manages a marvelous, near-perfect balance between narrative and theory, speculation and investigation, philosophy and psychology, character portraits and historic background.Part of what makes Rosenbaum's book so enthralling is that he not only describes the arguments of various individuals and schools of thought, but seeks out the representative authors and chats with them in person, which enlivens the text considerably. We get to meet the historians, stately Professor Hugh-Trevor Roper (who is certain Hitler firmly believed everything he said) and Alan Bullock, (more inclined to regard Hitler as a manipulative mountebank). Rosenbaum spends time with canny, insecure David Irving, back in the news in April 2000 for losing a libel suit in London against Deborah Lipstadt for highlighting him as a Holocaust denier (or at best, minimizer).Rosenbaum's judgments are fair and judicious, he never dislikes any of his subjects entirely, but he is not afraid to call someone out for intellectual hypocrisy and bullying (as in the case of &quot;Shoah&quot; documentary filmmaker Claude Lanzmann, who comes across as some sort of Old Testament prophet).The statements and positions of the various &quot;explainers&quot; clash and knock one another down. Hitler and the Holocaust drive intelligent and thoughtful men to amazing extremes. Theologian Yehuda Bauer suggests God's silence might mean he is either Satan too or a nebbish; Emil Fackenheim refuses to write or speak of Hitler at all for 20 years; George Steiner, author of the stunning novelette &quot;The Portage to San Cristobal of A.H.&quot; theorizes that Kafka metaphorically invented Hitler, and far from expressing something inherent in the German soul, Hitler might have risen to power even faster in France.Like God, I find Hitler himself a bore, because insufficient evidence seems to guarantee no final understanding. But looking at those who try to account for him, thinking about how we ourselves see him, the world he came from, the world we live in because of him, is a fascinating process, and Rosenbaum's tremendous book is a great contribution to that form of inquiry."},{"Title":"Explaining Hitler: The Search for the Origins of His Evil","review":"This is a thought provoking book however, Mr. Rosenbaum too easily dismisses the physical and emotional abuse aspects of Hitler's early life. He writes off the Alice Miller and OSS theories with a few brisk paragraphs. Hitler's abuse symptons are clear: incredible anger/rage, blaming others for his life unhappiness, messianic vision, social disconnection, greater empathy for dogs and animals than people, lover of sweets and chocolates, and sexual dysfunction. The sad part is that Hitler in his November 1918 hysteria fit was finally able to channel his rage into an Enemy that would give him a purpose. This of course was the &quot;Jewish Race&quot; and other sub humans."},{"Title":"Explaining Hitler: The Search for the Origins of His Evil","review":"This book is every bit as much about Rosenbaum's search for the true Hitler as it is about Hitler himself. As an academic, I found this very interesting, but I can see how other readers might find this information irrelevant. He also strays from his task, and tries to explain Hitler's lasting legacy; again, I found this intriguing, but other readers may only find it distracting. This is a great book for anyone who wants to dig deeply into psychology, sociology, and history, and should probably be avoided by the casual or uninformed reader. But - if you haven't noticed - I thought it was excellent."},{"Title":"Explaining Hitler: The Search for the Origins of His Evil","review":"Rosenbaum has indeed done for Hitler interpreters what Albert Schweitzer one hundred years ago did for Jesus scholars, he shows that we do not study the past to learn about the past but to learn about ourselves. But where Schweitzer remained sceptical of all attempts to get to the real Jesus, Rosenbaum in his last chapter seems to succumb to one particular interpretation of Hitler, that of Lucy Dawidowicz; this constitutes a failure of nerve on his part. Nevertheless, Rosenbaum has performed brilliantly and his book should be the starting point, perhaps even the finishing point, of all study on Hitler. It occurs to me that the most important thing in life may well be to understand Jesus and Hitler! Yes, that is exactly what I mean."},{"Title":"Explaining Hitler: The Search for the Origins of His Evil","review":"This is a book quite different to any other book I have read before. It is probing, controversial and, speculative. It has a philosophical bent to it and will make you think.The book revolves not only about Hitler but also about the Holocaust and the Germans. Before reading this book, I happened to read Daniel Jonah Goldhagen's \\"Hitler's willing executioners\\". Goldhagen puts the Holocaust's responsibility squarely on the Germans but \\"Explaining Hitler\\" goes deeper and entertains the additional possibility that \\"no Hitler, no Holocaust\\".The book has somewhat long chapters that sometimes feels were written in a haphazard fashion and, as a result of this, it is not a reader friendly book as far as reading mechanics go."},{"Title":"Explaining Hitler: The Search for the Origins of His Evil","review":"Rosenbaum tries to wrap his mind around a subject that defies analysis or explanation: where did Adolf Hitler's horrendous evil come from? He interviews leading scholars and commentators about their views: Hugh Trevor-Roper, Claude Lanzmann, Alan Bullock, Yehuda Bauer, even the Holocaust denier David Irving. In the end, he concludes that the &quot;laughing Hitler&quot; of Lucy Dawidowicz comes closest to the truth. In Hitler's mocking prediction of January 30, 1939 that war would lead to the &quot;extermination of the Jewish race in Europe&quot; you can almost hear the satanic glee. See also Rosenbaum's great collection &quot;The Secret Parts of Fortune&quot; and Ron Hansen's terrifying novel &quot;Hitler's Niece.&quot;"},{"Title":"Explaining Hitler: The Search for the Origins of His Evil","review":"Thousands of books describe what he did and hundreds more examine how he did it, but none offer a convincing explanation as to why a failed art student from Austria embarked on a global crusade to exterminate a people and authored the worst cataclysm of the 20th century. And neither does Rosenbaum. If he did, the book would be called &quot;Hitler Explained.&quot; Instead, he compellingly examines the evidence behind some of the more sensational Hitler theories. Did Hitler have a Jewish grandfather? Was he sexually deformed? Did he murder his niece? If he did, was it to avenge her affair with a Jewish music student or to cover up his own alleged sexual perversion? Rosenbaum is inconclusive, but that's because the evidence is inconclusive. And that's the point of this book: the world's foremost biographers and historians really have no &quot;unified theory&quot; why Hitler hated Jews and what motivated him to murder them. But on a few key points Rosenbaum is clear. Hitler did order the extermination of the Jews, and he and his lieutenants knew it was wrong. In fact, they reveled in the evil of their acts. And perhaps that's the most chilling aspect of this book: maybe Hitler wasn't insane or deprived or abused or a sexual pervert. Maybe he was just a normal guy who consciously chose to engage in the most unspeakable acts of terror in human history. And something within each one of us allowed him to do it until it was almost too late."},{"Title":"Explaining Hitler: The Search for the Origins of His Evil","review":"I would have to take issue with those reviewers who disparage the book because it doesn't provide a definitive historical &quot;explanation&quot; of Hitler. That's not what this book seems to be about. While the author does say that he set out intending to find the &quot;Swiss safe deposit box&quot; of Hitler explanation - that missing document or witness that would finally and definitively explain what made Hitler &quot;Hitler&quot; - it is clear that instead Mr. Rosenbaum has written an erudite, sophisticated and eminently readbable exposition on the themes of the nature of evil, the notion of individual free will, and how the predominant culture defines what it is or is not permissible to discuss about the darkest event in human history. The book explores the interesting tension between the notion of physchohistorical and sociological explanation and the concept of individual moral responsibility. I came away from the book convinced of the impossibility ever being able to provide a complete explanation of what drives a human being to form intention, based on our current understanding of how the human mind works. The chapter in the book about the Gestapo Cottage leaves one with the undeniably creepy feeling that the darkness lies bubbling just beneath the surface in many elements of contemporary society, waiting to be unleashed. For good measure we get a fascinating portrayal of the industry of &quot;Holocaust experts&quot; who have spent their professional lives attempting to explain the unexplainable, from those who out of moral conviction and courage are doomed to relive, on almost a daily basis a period in their lives of the most extreme personal anguish (including a tribute to the journalists of pre-Nazi Germany who paid the ultimate price for their moral convictions), to the most unsympathetic figure in the book (other than Hitler and his henchmen, of course), Claude Lanzmann, a strutting egomaniac who appears to have elevated himself to the position of ultimate arbiter of what others may or may not say about the Holocaust, even those who were in the camps (he was not), based on having directed a film about the Holocaust that took a long time to make. I found the book to be a real page-turner, and beautifully written to boot. I loved it!"},{"Title":"Explaining Hitler: The Search for the Origins of His Evil","review":"This is not really a biography of Hiler, it is more of a search on the margins of the impact the world may have had on Hitler and the influence he had on the world in a very personal sense. It could be best compared to the books of Gitta Sereny, as both authors examine those scarred and impacted by Hitler. Rosenbaum seeks out the places of mystery and people on who Hilter made a lasting impression. It is a journey to try to unwrap a riddle that may truly never be solved. Hitler is not a cut and dried, black and white issue, he is shades of grey, and Ron Rosenbaum effectively presents a lot of these shades. To understand this man of evil, this is a most important book, best complimented with John Lukacs'\\"The Hitler of History\\", Sebastian Haffner's \\"The Meaning of Hitler\\" and Percy Schramm's \\"Hilter as a Military Leader\\" which while dont complete the man provide much of the picture."},{"Title":"Explaining Hitler: The Search for the Origins of His Evil","review":"What does it mean to explain Hitler? Although the book is very well researched and well written, the author does not really tell us in this exposition. Nor does he tell us why it is necessary to \\"Explain Hitler.\\"From the point of view he sets forth, we can infer that \\"Explaining Hitler\\" seems to mean: engaging in a self-fulfilling process whereby the holocaust stands, a priori, as proof of Hitler's madness, and then going about the business of finding and validating this pre-positioned truth. That is to say, going about selecting the appropriate explanation, from among several the author offers, that would account for Hitler's obvious but already presumed insanity.Some of the \\"explanations\\" the author gives of Hitler's madness are: That as a child he was severely beaten and psychologically abused by his father, thus warping his personality. That due to a traumatized testicular mutilation at birth, the deformity so distorted his mind that most of his life he remained a walking psychological time bomb waiting to explode. That he was sexually aberrant, being both homosexual and a sampler of other more bizarre sexual habits, with both contributing greatly to his unstable personality. A rumor had been circulated that as a teenager, Hitler had caught syphilis from a Jewish prostitute and thereafter he vowed eternal vengeance against all Jews. And finally, one source claims that Hitler was brainwashed by a doctor Jekyll and Mr. Hyde-like doctor who used \\"the young German Chancellor to be,\\" as a \\"guinea pig\\" for new experimental psychological techniques, eventually driving him mad.Rosenbaum's real quest: to try to locate the cause of the holocaust in the aberrant brain of a single evil person, seems a vain, superfluous and somewhat theoretically misguided quest. Using his strategy as a general approach in the end explains nothing but the author's already built-in assumptions. In fact, his approach so over-simplifies the complexities involved in Hitler's life and rule that it effectively gives Hitler a moral pass, under the rubric of what today would be called a \\"justifiable insanity defense,\\" or using the famous lawyer and legal scholar Alan Dershowitz's ideas, it would be giving Hitler moral immunity under the abuse-excuse defense. Either defense trivializes and ignores the fact that, however aberrant Hitler's brain may have been, or however sexually deviant he may have been, or however much he may have been abused as a child, he was also a willing instrument of the German Nation and acted as their sovereign.A great deal of the hypothesizing about Hitler's alleged mental illnesses and sexual deviance -- although backed up by good Freudian common sense -- remains little more than that. And, however cleverly these theories may have been packaged, they remain unsupported by any hard evidence and thus never rise above the level of speculative claims. But worse, even if they did rise above speculation, it clearly wouldn't matter.The point the author seems completely blind to, is that, reducing Hitler to a \\"lone psychopathic serial killer\\" seems to explain away as much as it explains. No matter how strong-willed, mad, abused, or sexually deviant a leader may be, there is no escaping the fact that he rules at the moral behest of the conscience of the people within his political domain. For sure, there is a difference between democratic and autocratic rule and consent, and in many cases (but not all), this reduces to the difference between full consent, and no consent at all. But is it not the true nature of this very distinction that is one of the questions this analysis begs?Since \\"Explaining Hitler\\" is unnecessary and superfluous to understanding the holocaust, why the author chose to turn his speculation into a Procrustean bed that insists from the start that Hitler must fit into - that is, if the holocaust (not Hitler) is to be satisfactorily explained -- is more than just a bit puzzling. A \\"Hitler\\" is neither necessary nor sufficient to commit industrialized genocide; a greatly insane Hitler is little more than \\"misdirected psychological overkill.\\"In our own times, we see that a world-class demon is neither a necessary nor a sufficient condition to explain (or in this case to explain away) world-class genocide. The extermination of the Native American in our own country is a perfect case in point. But also, in our own times, we have Rwanda and Yugoslavia as additional instructive examples.Why then does the author imply, not only that a Hitler is needed, but also that he must be sick beyond the ordinary madness of racial, ethnic, cultural, and religious hatred? In retrospect, we must do a bit of speculation of our own: Is it that the German holocaust is so unique that these tried and proven historical precursors to genocide no longer apply? Perhaps, in the author's mind, this cluster of factors, which constitutes a very ordinary sickness for sure, is not quite grandiose enough to account for so much Jewish suffering? It seems to have escaped the author's attention that Hitler was afflicted by this very ordinary sickness too.Or, maybe it is that such an ordinary explanation to Hitler's madness cuts a bit too close to home? Is it not true that at some level we all suffer from this the very common disease of racial, ethnic, cultural and religious hatred, a sickness that has proven over and over again that it can and does lead to holocausts and genocide? And is it not true that among those inflicted with this very ordinary disease are most Americans, and inescapably this of course includes many Jews?As Rwanda, and Yugoslavia has taught us in our own times, cultures possessing deep-seated grievances, with ideologies of long-standing racial, cultural and religious hatred, when triggered by the right sequence of incendiary events, in most cases satisfy all the necessary and sufficient conditions to lead to wholesale racial and cultural genocide. The material for the next holocaust resides in us as much as it does in the largest and most evil and aberrant brain.Positing demonizing fantasies as a way of proving that a \\"single mad leader is needed to cause the German holocaust,\\" adds little or nothing to this already well-established causative formula. In fact, arguably (and unwittingly), it does just the opposite: By trying to further demonize Hitler, the author in the end actually re-humanizes him, giving him greatly exaggerated human impulses that can then serve as an excuse for his crimes.Thus this search for a deeper answer -- by demonizing Hitler even further than the reality of his dastardly deeds would justify -- reveals more about the author than about the events of the holocaust, or about Hitler. If explaining Hitler is the answer, we must first ask what indeed is the question? In this book, the author leaves this question and its answer up to the reader. Three stars."},{"Title":"Explaining Hitler: The Search for the Origins of His Evil","review":"The idea behind the book is great, a meta-analysis of Hitler. Unfortunately, Rosenbaum guiding principles are twofold. First, he is obsessed with his misinterpretation of Keats' idea of Negative Capability. Keats postulated that one must not reach after 100% certitude because it closes the mind. It is best to allow a certain amount of mystery and inexpressibility in one's understanding of things and in so doing you will ipso facto keep an open mind. And to do this, you must train your mind to not to need certainty. You must be able to live and be happy without certitude. This is fine. Rosenbaum however, takes negative capability to mean that an understanding of some things is unattainable, and that it is intellectually superior to be able to be able to say \\"This thing is beyond understanding\\" and stop grasping after answers. This creates a skepticism that closes the mind to explanation, and this is the lens with which he filters Hitler explanations.Rosenbaum's second principle is his contention that nothing should take away from Hitler's moral culpability. So explanations based on childhood trauma and any resulting psychological deformations are out because one can't blame the parents. No, the parents are never to blame when an offspring turns out deranged. It's always the mental patient who is to blame for their condition, it's their choice, their fault. [Please note sarcasm]The majority of theories the author has chosen to examine all have fundamental flaws that are easily identifiable, and he takes great delight in enumerating them. However, he doesn't posit his own theory or examine theories that hold up rather well to scrutiny. I will provide an example here.Some have argued that Hitler is a human, and therefore his actions can be understood in relation to the actions and analysis of other humans that exhibit similar pathologies. The most readily apparent diagnosis of Hitler is that he was a Narcissist as defined by the psych disorder manual the DSM and supplemented by proposed changes to the DSM's classification. (google \\"dsm narcissism\\" for more info). Also of interest is looking at Sam Vaknin's writings, he is a self aware narcissist (a rarity) who has written extensively on his subjective experience of being a narcissist. He has also coined the term 'malignant narcissist'. Anyway, Hitler's personality which can be deduced from his actions, words, and ideas fits so unbelievably nicely with the personality disorder of Narcissism that I believe to understand Hitler one must understand Narcissism. And since there are plenty of living breathing ones alive today, the object of understanding and explaining Hitler is not, as Rosenbaum believes, beyond possibility.Here are some traits of the Narcissist: 1)Feels grandiose and self-important (e.g., exaggerates accomplishments, talents, skills, contacts, and personality traits to the point of lying, demands to be recognized as superior without commensurate achievements); 2)Is obsessed with fantasies of unlimited success, fame, fearsome power or omnipotence, unequalled brilliance; 3)Firmly convinced that he or she is unique and, being special; 4)requires excessive admiration, adulation, attention and affirmation - and/or wishes to be feared; 5)Demands automatic and full compliance with his or her unreasonable expectations without question; 6) Is \\"interpersonally exploitative\\", i.e., uses others to achieve his or her own ends; 7) totally devoid of empathy; 8)seeks to hurt or destroy the objects or perceived causes of his or her frustrations; 8)Suffers from persecutory (paranoid) delusions; 9) Behaves arrogantly and haughtily; 10) feels superior, omnipotent, omniscient, invincible, immune, \\"above the law\\", and omnipresent (magical thinking); 11) Rages when frustrated, contradicted, or confronted by people he or she considers inferior to him or her and unworthy. Sound like Hitler? I thought so.Narcissists are incapable of forming normal healthy relationships because of their lack of empathy, exploitative nature, attacks of rage, paranoia, constant need for attention, etc. It's not surprising that of the seven women Hitler is believed to have had a relationship with, 6 of them tried to commit suicide. They also create and maintain a fictitious world view that emphasizes their specialness that is tremendously resistant to change.I could go on, suffice it to say that the case for Hitler as malignant narcissist is pretty convincing. Rosenbaum does not address this view. The analysis of psycho-explanations for Hitler is confined to the fanciful and extreme. And in so doing, he implies that because the psycho-explanations he looked at were lacking, they all are. I looked on the interwebs to see if he has had any comments on it since the publication of his book and I found this quote from a speech he gave to some journalism students: \\"it's often useful...to ask, you know; what's the agenda? In a Hitler psycho-historian chapter, the agenda was the longing for certainty, and you know, the fear of Hitler being normal in some way and believe if we can give Hitler a syndrome, a name, malignant narcissistic disorder, we can somehow control it more.\\" He is dismissive of the Hitler as Narcissist analysis, and moreover disparages the motivation of those who advance this view as having a misguided need for certainty. I.e., they aren't mentally advanced enough to be negatively capable and therefore their analysis cannot be valid.Well the truth of the matter is if we understand Hitler's psyche we are in a better position to control it (or people with the same disorder). By saying that it is not possible and that any reaching after understanding is sign of mental deficiency or some unconscious agenda, he reduces our ability to prevent Hitlers.So what caused Hitler to become Hitler? Explanations for the development of Narcissism include abuse (sadistic physical, mental, and/or sexual), smothering/domineering (i.e. the child is allowed no autonomy or boundaries), or extreme rejection (extreme ignoring of a child, no love and attention, which children absolutely need). What was Hitler's damage? It's hard to say. If you take him at his word, and Narcissists are notorious liars, he was severely beaten as a child as his father was an angry domineering alcoholic, while his mother was doting. So was he smothered or abused or both? Dunno. A psychological explanation of Hitler is not going be all pervasive and you'll be able to use your negative capability just fine.A second target for Rosenbaum's terminal skepticism is the German people. How could the German people be complicit in such a crime? Again he uses easily criticizable examples as representative of the explaining enterprise. I don't think it's a great mystery. Hitler never advertised the fact of what was being done to the general population; in fact he went to great pains to hide it. Those who did know were members of the military. And the number one thing military men are trained to do is obey without question. So when the officer says \\"Go over that trench and get machined gunned\\", the soldier does it without the need for explanations or critical reflection. Let's look at something more recent and less obviously evil.Between 1965 and 1973 the US dropped almost a third more ordnance (2.8 million tonnes of explosive power) on Cambodia, a country the size of Oklahoma, than the allies dropped in the whole of WW2 (2million tonnes) including the atomic bombs which struck Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Cambodia is thought to be the most heavily bombed country in history. And remember it is the size of Oklahoma. A US general said he wanted to bomb them \\"back into the stone age\\" Pol Pot is believed to have been a direct consequence of the social disintegration caused by the constant bombing. And even today, people are maimed by unexploded shells. So, a country was terrorized for years, innumerable children and infants were murdered, and a genocidal megalomaniac came to power because US soldiers unquestioningly bombed the crap out of Cambodia. And lets not forget that the bombing was illegal (against American law). Yet no one asks \\"how could these men have committed these terrible acts.\\" In fact, the soldiers are generally seen as upstanding citizens who did their duty for their country. The fact that German soldiers committed 9-15 million gas chamber murders speaks not to the character of the German people but to military culture that normalizes murder. Afterall, millions if not tens of millions of civilians died in Cambodia/Laos/Vitnam during the US bombing. Yet no one asks how the service men press the buttons that meant death for babies. In fact, not pressing the button was cause for revilement and prosecution. In Sideshow, author William Shawcross reports the story of a young air force captain, Donald Dawson, who was court-martialed for refusing to fly after learning that a Cambodian wedding party had been \\"boxed\\" by B52s. \\"It forced him, he said, to realize that Cambodians were human beings and to recognize that non-military targets were being hit,\\" wrote Shawcross. He was the lone exception to the rule. All the other soldiers committed murder because they were told to without question or critical reflection. Why is it so hard to believe that German soldiers did the same thing.But because the German soldiers dropped Zykon B pellets into the buildings, the whole German nation is condemned as abnormal and evil. No, the repression and destruction of the consciences and critical faculties of soldiers is to blame that allows them to be used tools for evil unquestioningly. Combine this with the results of the Stanford prison experiment, and the concentration camps become explicable.When I bought the book, I was hoping that Rosenbaum's enterprise would yield useful fruit. The fruit I had hoped for was an explanation of Hitler and Nazi Germany that would equip readers with the tools to be able to identify leaders with similar pathologies to Hitler (and there are Narcissists in Government today) and thereby inhibit their malignant potentialities. And I hoped that there would also be a critical evaluation of the forces and societal constructs that allowed innocents to be murdered by so-called normal people. And through this understanding, we would be able to identify similar structures and forces in our own society and thereby inhibit their potential for evil. Soldiers with working consciences maybe?Instead, Rosenbaum's contribution to Hitler studies seems to be \\"Hitler is beyond explanation, and if you're smart you'll be happy with that.\\""},{"Title":"Explaining Hitler: The Search for the Origins of His Evil","review":"I have not read all 58 reviews, but one thing I am not seeing mentioned is the disjointed repetitiveness of this book. It feels like magazine essays spliced together rather crudely into a book. Sentences reappear over and over. People are reintroduced every time they are mentioned. The book needed a severe tightening.I am in no position to judge its scholarship; he is a well read and opinionated man. I found the arguments he traces quite interesting; this was certainly a provocative read. He clearly has several unwieldy axes to grind, and grinds them often.But the book itself suffers from its repetitiveness, its smarminess, its endless wild speculation (\\"Hitler could very well have...\\" \\"So-and-so might very well have thought...\\") and its overall feel of cuteness.Many little things that detract from what could have been a powerful read. What a shame."},{"Title":"Explaining Hitler: The Search for the Origins of His Evil","review":"Rosenbaum examines with a cautious mind the many and varied theories and purported facts presented since Hitler's rise to power to explain his hatred of the Jews and the atrocities of the Holocaust. Most of the theories as explanations are insufficient, ridiculous, and overly speculative: e.g. he was missing a testicle, therefore the Holocaust; he was a sexual pervert, therefore the Holocaust; he did not exemplify his own Nordic ideal, therefore the Holocaust; his unknown grandfather was a Jew, therefore the Holocaust; his half-niece Geli Raubal, whom he loved, loved a Jew, therefore the Holocaust; he was devastated by Geli Raubal's death, therefore the Holocaust; Eva Braun could not replace Geli Raubal in his needs, therefore the Holocaust; he had an artistic temperament and, wanting to live an artistic life, he viewed morality through an aesthetic lens, therefore the Holocaust; his mother, suffering from cancer, was maltreated by a Jewish doctor, and in WWI he himself suffered under poison gas and was hospitalized, therefore the Holocaust; he was transcendentally evil, immoral beyond human explanation, therefore the Holocaust.Other theories are less reductionist and admit complex motivation, but are incomplete in themselves as explanations: e.g. his hatred emerged from his ideology, therefore the Holocaust; his hatred emerged viscerally, prior to his ideology, therefore the Holocaust; his hatred was socially determined and outside his control, shared by many and culturally prevalent, so if not Hitler, then someone, therefore the Holocaust; Western culture itself in its totality is corrupt, therefore the Holocaust; Judaism with its God, its invention of conscience, and its separatism has incited hatred of the Jews, therefore the Holocaust; Christianity through its story of Judas, and of Jesus the sacrificed Jew, sanctions hatred of Jews, therefore the Holocaust.Rosenbaum examines in compelling detail the stories behind these theories and the evidence for the stories. At times he gets carried away in metaphorical analogies, but his discussion is otherwise clearheaded and free of gullibility.He examines the complex issue of moral accountability in relation to will and belief, where culpability is clearly present only within a purposive, willful act in which there is a conscious belief of moral transgression: if Hitler believed in his moral rectitude, or if the motive force behind his choices overwhelmed his moral will and diminished his moral conscience, what are the implications for deciding his moral guilt?Rosenbaum also examines the metaphysical question of God's omnipotence, love and justice: the Holocaust seems to imply that if God is just and loving, he in not omnipotent, and if he is omnipotent, he is not just and loving. In stronger terms: God is either weak or wicked. God's sorrow means nothing if God does not act. Ultimately God is responsible for the nature of humankind: the moral flaws in God's creation are the result of His handiwork, and implicate Him in the moral depravities of humankind.What Rosenbaum does not spend time on is Hitler's dependence upon the collaboration of National Socialists as the source and support of his power, a cooperation which allowed for the full, uninhibited expression of his hatred."},{"Title":"Explaining Hitler: The Search for the Origins of His Evil","review":"I really enjoyed this book,both for its interesting writing and thewealth of information about Hitler and the perception of Hitler today. The sub-theme of Rosenbaum's personal journey to Hitler's creepy birthplace and his meetings with the various &quot;explainers&quot; was fascinating.The &quot;explainers&quot; for the most part come across as a hare-brained, closeted, ivory-towered lot; and a quote to explain this is found on page 378: they have &quot;...a preference for seeing historical figures as complex, as sensitive to conflicting forces, as historians themselves...&quot; Most seem too clever by half, yet unable to see the forest for the trees.The Munich Poison Kitchen probably came closest to seeing the true Hitler and nobody seemed to listen. Subsequent historians almost all fall short because they seem so dumbfounded by his &quot;evil&quot;. Theories about Hitler reflect dimly the various &quot;explainers&quot; personal foibles....Claude Lanzmann in particular stands out.... Beryl Lang's evil artist theory actually seems to me to come closest to the truth, especially in contrast to the absurd B.S. of Hyam Macoby. The book is a great read, a real page-turner, but in the end I think all this hand-wringing and head-scratching about &quot;evil&quot; and Hitler's uniqueness is absurd-come on guys-you gotta get out more- there are hundreds of little Hitlers all over the world right now shooting women and kids, bulldozing homes, torturing people for whatever ethnic cause or idea...."},{"Title":"Explaining Hitler: The Search for the Origins of His Evil","review":"Although there is probably no new information in this book (is it possible to find new information about Hitler?), the perspective is unique. Rather than trying to determine what made Hitler the way he was, Rosenbaum talks about the people who have theories about what made Hitler the way he was. One review of the book (in &quot;Newsweek&quot;) stated that all these theories can't be true. I am not sure about that. It seems to me that one theory being THE cause is too simplistic. I hypothesize that all, or at least many, of the theories are facts that played a part in the complexity of Hitler's being. Rosenbaum may be the first to have gathered all of the main theories into one book, which makes it easier to become initiated into this world of theories."},{"Title":"Explaining Hitler: The Search for the Origins of His Evil","review":"This is a very interesting book; however I criticize it on two points: 1) The author's distate for Irving and his ideas, while understandable, gets in the way of his objectivity and, ironically, does a disservice to the search for truth. 2) The book ignores the essential characteristic of Hitler; i.e., his success.The problem I have with the Irving chapter is that the author does not present Irving's ideas with enough clarity for the author to be able to refute them. For example, there is an offhand allusion to Irving's denial of the use of gas chambers but not a summary of his arguments for that position. This does not allow the author to counter those arguments (as I believe that he could). In my view, the effect of failing to identify and to specifically refute Irving's arguments combined the author's obvious distate for Irving and his positions could lead the susceptible to believe that Irving was denied a fair hearing and therefore may serve to increase Irving's appeal, a result I am certain that the author did not intend.I have no doubt that within a hundred kilometers of the reader's location there exist people who would exterminate there favorite scapegoats be they jews, Christians, males or what have you. Hitler's distinction was not that he was willing or even enthusiastic to do evil. His dinction is that he did not confine his activities to expressing his opinions to the moron on the barstool next to his or to a few brutally violent rages against targets of opportunity. Hitler lies within in the contradicition that he was both an irrational hater and a well organized leader who could evaluate the situation and act or react accordingly to achieve his goals."},{"Title":"Explaining Hitler: The Search for the Origins of His Evil","review":"I read this book when it first came out in bookstores.

Maybe Hitler was just a gifted nut who was there as a flock of circumstances flew by.

I now have a different feeling about this. The last chapter, the one on Dawidowicz, finds the only possible explanation of Hitler in his love of evil. Rosenbaum whether he realizes it or not is saying in effect that Hitler was a manifestation of the Devil. I find this explanation both satisfying and unsatisfying. It is unsatisfying because it is an admission of failure, the Devil being the cause of evil when no other cause is found. But satisfying since no other cause has been found for Hitler. Thus perhaps Rosenbaum is right. Dawidowicz herself did not focus on the Devil but this is the result of her and Rosenbaum's discussion.

Many times the entire thrust of the letters are changed due to problems and blatant mistakes in the translation.Rosenbaum adheres to the psycho-babble school of Hitlerism prevalent in the 1970's. He relies on discredited or fabricated sources such as Otto Strasser, the OSS Report and pop biographer like Ralph G.L. Waite. Nowhere is their a cogent or reasonable explanation for both Hitler's banality and his evil.It's amazing that such a poorly written book garnered favorable reviews and was a best seller.

The author seems to forget that since Freud, there are no more secrets. The selective and restrictive vector he uses to probe into Hitler's mind is bi-directional, unerringly and unavoidably, pointing back into the mind of the one doing the probing.While we discover much new (but very speculative) information about Hitler's personal eccentricities, the author's selective use of these data evidently does not \\"explain Hitler\\" well enough even to meet his own satisfaction. Lingering doubt leads the aware reader to ask: what indeed is the real question at the bottom of this research? The answer of course is: How can the enormity of the holocaust perpetrated specifically against the Jews be explained?This book fails to give a satisfactory answer to this transparently obvious question because it is a search restricted to the light under the lamppost. It explains Hitler in the same way that the \\"single bullet theory\\" explains the JFK assassination. Both are searches for simplistic closure to monumental crimes.However, there is a difference. The JFK assassination has skeptics who see the \\"Oswald did it\\" explanation as too simple, and as too \\"pat\\" an answer. They assess this single bullet theory as leaving too many unexplained loose ends. Rosenbaum's explanation of Hitler, on the other hand, like the FBI's investigation of Oswald, from the outset seeks to close off all other known avenues of enquiry. The author is an avowedly \\"Hitler done it, now lets find out why\\" kind of investigator.The problem with this line of attack is that, by definition, it can only reveal or explain that which has already been presumed. It is not so much an investigation as it is a symbolic re-execution. The danger in such an approach is, that resulting explanations represent a kind of \\"Hitler overkill.\\" In addition to being slightly dishonest, another unpleasant side effect of \\"Hitler overkill\\" is its boomerang effect: It turns into more an exploration of the author's mind than an explanation of Hitler's.Hitler's responsibility for the wanton industrial-like murder of millions during WW-II has been a fact established beyond any shadow of doubt. Today, no unbiased and sane person would deny it. However, Rosenbaum's attempt to explain the holocaust by further demonizing Hitler and by \\"piling on\\" to him all remaining residue of responsibility may in fact have exactly the opposite effect. It is worthwhile to note that demonization and deification are opposite sides of the same coin. As evil and as demonic as Hitler is, and as much as those who suffered may wish it otherwise, some of the responsibility for those murders must be assigned at feet other than Hitler's.With the benefit of hindsight, it must be clear now that Hitler was only the trigger in a gun centuries of religious, ideological, ethnic and racial hatred had cocked and loaded for him. Bull-eyes were drawn across the backs of Jews because they were the nearest and most convenient scapegoats. Many historians argue that the Versailles Treaty and the turmoil in German society in the aftermath of WW-I was the straw that finally broke the camel's back, leading logically to Hitler's rise to power. Whatever is the final truth, what is incontrovertible is that Hitler was a seed grown in fertile German soil who was destined to become the trigger in the loaded gun Germany always had pointed at the Star of David affixed to the Jewish breast.\\"Chosen suffering\\" and \\"selective but traumatized memories\\" cannot be allowed to get in the way of finding the historical truth, because only through the truth can we learn how to prevent future tragedies such as the German holocaust.Was Hitler a willing and nervous trigger finger for the German cultural gun? Did his personal eccentricities conspire with his insane compulsions about Jews to allow him to institutionalize his personal evil? Yes, and yes, but these are mere details to an even larger story about how to prevent the next holocaust, not an explanation of Hitler.

He took part in the Second World War and this book deals with the time he went flying with the RAF in the war. Everyone dislikes going on wars but Roald Dahl enjoyed it. He thought that it was a free travel and it was interesting. He described all the interesting and exciting events happening to him. After three years of fighting and flying, due to the severe head injuries he had received when his Gladiator crashed in the Western Desert, he must on no account fly a fighter plane again and so went back home. I do not enjoy the story because I do not like wars. Wars are terrible and Roald Dahl described how he helped the others fight and how the others were shot and died. I felt upset when I read this book. I think this book is thick. The plot goes slowly and it makes the story boring."},{"Title":"Going Solo","review":"Many years ago, I read this book, which thoroughly captivated me. Before earning a worldwide reputation as a writer of exciting and wildly imaginative children's books, Dahl had served as a fighter pilot in the Royal Air Force during the Second World War. Here he relates his experiences of undergoing flight training in Southern Africa. He conveys with touching clarity the stresses, joys, and pain any pilot trainee experiences in coming to grips with flying. As someone who is fascinated with aviation, I almost felt as if I were in the cockpit with Dahl as he advanced through the various levels of training.Dahl went on to serve with a fighter squadron in Libya, which, in the wake of the German blitzkrieg in the Balkans in April 1941, was later sent to Greece. It proved to be a fruitless undertaking as Dahl's squadron sustained heavy losses and Dahl himself was greviously wounded. This book is a testament to one man's love for flying and his efforts to pick up the pieces and resume a full life again."},{"Title":"Going Solo","review":"If you see the classic Roald Dahl cover illustration you might think this is an appropriate book for young children. It's definitely a book for 6th or 7th grade and up. Scroll around and you'll find some excellent reviews written by teenagers. I just gave it to my dad who is a WWII buff--he loved it. Adults, particularly those interested in Africa and WWII, will enjoy it so don't think you're going to read a children's book. It's really a classic memoir. The great British actor, Derek Jacobi, has recorded a fantastic unabridged audio version (and a fine one of Dahl's \\"Boy\\")"},{"Title":"Going Solo","review":"What an entertaining read this proves--not surprisingly--by the author of the children's classic, CHARLIE AND THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY. Continuing the autobiographical expose of British boarding schools as revealed in BOY, Dahl opens this meant-for-adults book with a delightfully wacky view of his fellow Englishmen en route to work in Africa. Scornful of the repeated falls from stoic grace by so many of his predecessors, this young Empire Builder is at first shocked by the sight of so many decent chaps who have Gone Native--a result of prolonged absence from the UK and intense heat exposure. Can an idealistic youth rise above heat, humidity and British bravado to maintain his unflappable equanimity, or will he too succumb to the national trend?Most of this book, however, consists of Dahl's serious account of his contribution to the Allied air war in Africa's western desert, followed by a long recuperation from head trauma. Before he returns safely to England, he describes the deadly action in Greece where German planes far outnumbered the intrepid RAF pilots. Interspersed among the reports of the air war are his own b/w photos and letters (self-censored) to his beloved Norwegian mother in England. This account will easily capture the reader's interest as Dahl translates the global struggle by bringing it down to an intensely human level. With his treasured possessions--pilot's Log Book and his 2nd camera--we leave him when he is reunited safely with his mother. A fast read--well worth the effort even if you are not a war buff."},{"Title":"Going Solo","review":"Going Solo is the great story that Roald Dahl adventured throughout his young life. Roald Dahl accomplished many things once he was able to do things on his own. Mainly the book is about himself traveling all over Europe and Africa just trying to experience as much as he could. He travels all over the bottom of Europe and works way down and around Africa staying at many non civilized villages and getting to know many natives. At the time he is working for the Shell Oil Company until he finally quits. In East Africa he also is endangered with a near fatal death with a Green Mamba , one of the most deadly snakes. Roald also has a passion for the air force, and ends up joining the RAF. Going Solo is one of the most adventurous books that I have ever read, with the nonstop climax's and so many near death experiences. This is a very descriptive book with so many heroic twist that can keep anyone's attention. Roald Dahl is very famous for most of his work such as Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, but this book is amazing because this all actually happened to writer in real life. The greatest part about the Roald Dahl in Going Solo is that he never gave up, even after a plane crash that he should not have been able to live after. He was told that he would be blind for the rest of his life, but about a month later he started to gain his sight back. I feel that this book is a miracle."},{"Title":"Going Solo","review":"WOW! Going Solo, by Roald Dahl is an amazing and heart capturing book. Read this book if you love war stories. These stories are serious, funny, and keep you wanting more. I found the book almost impossible to believe during some points in the amazing novel.Dahl's biography tells about his survival in the dated war planes without experience (while outnumbered 100 to 1) and on the ground as commander with no experience again. Dahl uses great language and thought to describe things and to progress the novel with amazing simplicity. To me, simplicity and straight-forwardness makes a book enjoyable (not school like), and pretty easy to read. It is not a \\"piece of cake\\" reading, but it isn't unbelievably hard. His survival in the air of Greece and Africa come down to one thing, instincts. I believe Going Solo shows how most humans would act during a war; very scared, rather excited, nervous, and filled with heart pumping adrenaline. As I read, my eyes read faster than my brain could keep up with. I felt I was flying right next Dahl, watching him struggle to survive the most horrid war of history, World War II. What I also love about Roald Dahl's story is that he has a perfect balance of humor and exploding action. There was never one seriously boring dead place.This is one of the best books I have ever read. I love Going Solo because I always want to read more. Most of the time I do not wish to put it down. These are the types of books I love to read. Astonishingly, the novel feels like a movie. At the last second when all hope seems to be lost, Dahl shows his intelligence by giving you a story you will remember for a long time. That is why I recommend this book.Do not read Going Solo if you hate adventurous, unbelievably true World War II stories. Trust me; read Going Solo if you want a great read with amazing plot.The novel builds and builds with drama and action, then the unfathomable happens...read Going Solo to find a great ending with a great last word."},{"Title":"Going Solo","review":"Going SoloGoing Solo by Roald Dahl is an action-packed adventure full of laughs and frights. Dahl uses up-front, to the point explanations that provide detailed and somewhat sudden images of events from his life. The book itself, Going Solo, is based on Dahl's experience in Africa and in the air force. Dahl starts his tale as a young man headed to an African coastal city where he will help in the management of a Shell public relations group. Dahl encounters much more than he bargained for and provides readers with a great bed-time reader. I wouldn't however suggest it for bed-time reading, because you won't be able to put it down.I typically read books that fall under the Fantasy genre because the author has the ability to constantly fill the characters with excitement as opposed to a biography in which the author may only use real events, which are not always as fast-paced. Dahl, however, has had a life that really has very few dull moments. I had no problem keeping the movie in my mind going. He transitioned well from event to event without stopping the action. I was drawn in at first by the experience Dahl had on the ship. He explains that the ship taking him to Africa was occupied by men who were somewhat mentally unstable. His colorful imagery of all his situations and scenes makes for a compelling and intriguing story-line.In addition to detail through words, Dahl has pictures in his book. This is not a critical component of literature, but it allowed me to complete my mental images. His photographs depict people he met and things he encountered. These pictures aided in my idea of the time period and culture of the setting. This book is by no means a picture book, but it has several images throughout the book.The book also drew me in because it was Dahl reflecting on his life. As I read the book I felt as though it was the first time since his war experience that he had looked back on the events. I felt as though he was developing his opinions of his decisions throughout the war as he was writing the book. In a sense, it felt like I was the first person to here his reflection on his life. This display of a relationship between author and reader further demonstrates Dahl's mastery of literature.I would recommend this work to anyone seeking a short-term commitment as far as reading goes. This book can easily be finished within a few devoted days. The book is not a very high reading level, but leaves the door open for deep thought and role-playing. I enjoyed this piece and through it's creativity it compelled me to read another of Dahl's pieces. For those who choose to try this book, I invite you to spend equal time reading and reflecting to get the most out of the book. Enjoy this piece.-Jess13KY"},{"Title":"Going Solo","review":"tHIS BOOK IS GREAT!!!Roald dahls bio is actually like a story!Instead of writing boring stuff about life, Roald Dahl will make u very intrest and will make want to read moreYou would n't put the book down until you finish itAnd even after finishing, you would dream of it and want to read it againAnother book reccomende is Boy, tales of childhood"},{"Title":"Going Solo","review":"This thrilling, true-life adventure stands on its own as a great read. In fact, I read it to my 8-year old son before we read &quot;Boy&quot;, and turned to &quot;Boy&quot; only because &quot;Going Solo&quot; is so wonderful. Although the story is filled with action, what makes this book a classic - and one you won't want to put down - is Dahl's magical use of the English language."},{"Title":"Going Solo","review":"If you want to show your kid or student that an biography is fun to read, well, in \\"Going Solo\\" Roald Dahl describes every fun and depression of his experience as a teenager to adulthood. It is just as fun reading \\"Matilda\\" and \\"The Witches\\". The language is easy to read, lots of photographs took by Roald Dahl himself, and the ending is satisfying.The story is about Roald Dahl's first career in Africa (Sudan) working for the Shell Oil company. When the second world war broke up he joined the royal airforce throughout middle east and the coast of Greece.Throughout the book you follow a period of his life, experiencing both the positives and negatives of his adventure. You also get to find out how he begins to build ideas, and these ideas become great children books that are unforgettable to this day.This is not just a great read for the Roald Dahl fans, but everyone who loves for adventures and wild creativities. Go get it and start reading!"},{"Title":"Going Solo","review":"Going Solo Review by Samuel WOne of the characters I most enjoyed was David Coke, pronounced Cook. David is extraordinarily kind even throughout hard times of the war. When Roald Dahl first arrived at the Greece airbase the CO greets Roald with, \\"You can find yourself a bunk in one of the tents. You'll start flying tomorrow like the rest of them.\\" The CO doesn't greet him with, \\"I'm glad you made it,\\" or \\"How are you?\\" David gives Roald a good greeting and trys to help Roald by teaching him tips on combat.An aspect of the book that I liked was that the story is true. The experiences that Roald endured are amazing and surreal. He joins the Greece air force of fifteen, up against hundreds of German fighters, with no combat experience, and alone. It's survival. There story of survival can be scaled to the part after the Battle of Athens when both Roald and David get back to their base. \\"I think were going to get killed,\\" Roald said. \\"So do I, said David. \\"you can have the basin in a moment. I left a bit of water in the jug in case you happen to come back.\\" Both pilots thought they were going to die.I chose to read this book because I knew it was a flying book and it was titled \\"Going Solo.\\" Though I have never been in a fight like that, I felt a slight connection. As does any pilot when they hear the word solo. To some degree the word solo to a pilot is the same as survival. I recommend this book to all adventure seekers."},{"Title":"Going Solo","review":"I read the fantastic book named Going Solo by Roald Dahl. This book was an autobiography of Roald Dahl's life prior to and during World War II. The book explained many of his encounters with the enemy as a pilot for the Royal Air Force in Roald Dahl's personal view. There are an uncountable number of fascinating events that occur when he is a pilot. Some of them include when he receives a life threatening injury, going into a hardcore battle with no experience at fighting enemies, and getting out of a long-lasting dogfight where he was outnumbered 200 to 12. The other half of the book explained his thrilling adventures prior to the war when he worked for the Shell Company. Some of his experiences while working for the Shell Company included chasing a lion, saving a man from a deadly Black Mamba, and sighting a deadly Green Mamba enter his friends house. Every page of the book was full of plot and adventure, and I could not put this book down.In the beginning of the book Roald Dahl is on a ship, which was taking him from England to Africa for a job with the Shell Company. He ended up in a beautiful tropic town named Dar es Salaam, located in Tanzania, which is on the coast of Africa. Once there, he was given a personal \`boy' named Mdisho, which back then was like an unpaid worker. Mdisho and Roald form a very close father-son relationship, Roald being the father and Mdisho being the son. Roald teaches Mdisho many things, while Mdisho goes out and works for him. After a while, Roald decides to join the army as a Pilot Officer. He began his journey in flight training for six months. Then, he was given directions to join up with the 80 Squadron, who were fighting in the middle of the Sahara desert. The directions were incorrect and he ended up crashing and getting a life-threatening injury. Once he recovered, he was to meet up with the 80 Squadron again, who were now located in Greece. He finds himself fighting in Greece with only 12 planes in the whole of Greece. The Germans had thousands of planes located in Greece, so they fought as best they could. Once it was getting too dangerous, the 80 Squadron left and went on to a place named Argos, which was another fifty miles along the coast. After that, they went along to Palestine and Syria, and fought off more Nazis. He then was experiencing major headaches when flying and had to be sent home. This is a brief overview of the book, and as you can see it's full of suspense.This book was an awesome book, because I learned a lot about how life was during World War II through the eyes of a magnificent writer. It was so good that I read it the first day I started reading it. Roald Dahl draws out a scene for you each battle, so you can imagine like you are there with him, in his Hurricane airplane fighting off the Nazis. This book is for the sort of person that enjoys reading fast-paced books and loves to read about history. Also, if you like the author Roald Dahl, I would suggest reading it because it tells a lot about him, and his personal history. If this book sounds interesting to you then I definitely recommend it and suggest you check it out, or maybe you might want to check out the prequel to Going Solo titled Boy."},{"Title":"Going Solo","review":"I read this in one sitting, so you can see it is pretty interesting. I get the feeling Dahl was a really honest person. His account of how he learned to fly and was dumped right into fighting German airplanes without any fighter pilot training is amazing and rather frightening. He mentions several times the number of young lives lost because of the lack of training and support. One of the grim aspects of war. The accounts of living in Africa, black mambos and lions, pretty strong stuff too."},{"Title":"Going Solo","review":"Como siempre desde hace a&ntilde;os Amazon sigue enviando los libros y los discos con rapidez y eficacia. Me parece incre&iacute;ble que los env&iacute;os sean tan veloces."},{"Title":"Going Solo","review":"'Going Solo' is the second part of Roald Dahl's sort-of-autobiography, covering Dahl's experiences in Africa and the Mediterranean, initially as part of his work for Shell, and later on as a fighter pilot in the Second World War. Although it is designed to be read by those who have just finished 'Boy', the tone is more serious, and themes such as warfare are somewhat weightier than Great Mouse Plots and chocolate sampling. Whereas 'Boy' can be enjoyed by children of any age, 'Going Solo' is probably best suited to slightly older children, and even adults.The first half of the book picks up right where \`Boy' leaves off, with Dahl beginning his travels out to East Africa. This part of the book is the more light-hearted and closest in style to \`Boy', with its discussion of snake handlers, warrior servants, and especially the eccentric people who inhabit the farthest reaches of the Empire. Dahl's description of the oddballs who travel out on the ship with him (including a man who fakes having dandruff to disguise his wig, an elderly couple who run around the deck without a stitch of clothing on, and a woman who will only eat oranges with a fork) is hilarious.The tone gets more serious with the outbreak of the war, with Dahl forced to round up German civilians fleeing the country, and following this he enlists in the RAF. The remainder of the book focuses on his wartime training and service, in Africa, Greece, and later on in the Middle East. I've always regarded this as the most interesting part of the book, and Dahl does an excellent job of describing what it is like to be a fighter pilot; crashing in the desert, shooting down enemy planes, being strafed, diving and banking to avoid being shot down, and especially the appalling loss of life among his fellow pilots. This part of the book also provides a fascinating insight into parts of WW2 that don't get much publicity, such as the hopeless against-the-odds Grecian campaign. In many ways it's a miracle Dahl and several others survived to fight another day. The final chapter sees Dahl invalidated home, and offers some insights into the Home Front during the war.In all, I found \`Going Solo' to be just as good, and probably better, than \`Boy'. Dahl's humourous and engaging style is still present, but the book covers more serious and (in my opinion) interesting issues than the child-like fascinations of \`Boy'. As I say, it may be more suitable for slightly older children and adolescents, but this is a must-read for fans of Dahl's work, children and adult alike."},{"Title":"Going Solo","review":"My 10 years old Boy is reading this book and it kept his attencion!he enjoy Dahl sotries but this one seems to be one of the bests for him!The WW2 is the scenario but imagining that you are a pilot there is amazing!excellent book!"},{"Title":"Going Solo","review":"Going Solo by Roald Dahl is a fantastic adventurous book about Roald's experience as a WW2 fighter pilot. He talks about his other stories from Hatia and Marigua. His friends like David Coke and other squad mates give him more stories to tell. He tells about his journey to England and how he felt during the stress and pressure of the war. Roald describes this book like pie if you use clear details.Roald Dahl gets sent from Norway to England to enlist in the British air force to fight for the allies in WW2. When Roald flies in air battles it has a lot of action because air battles are always epic. His word choice excels in telling the story. The action comes from the intense and complicated words he uses. Here is an example of him using action in Going Solo: \\"As I swerved through explosions and planes, the bullets looked like orange fiery sticks flying at me.\\"The book also has a suspense cliff-hanger technique that wants you to keep reading. All of Roald's books all have this trait that makes it fun but full of suspense. It feels like it's giving you hunger to play the story out. You can almost imagine it because it is so intense. An example of suspense in Going Solo is \\"The blow to my head smashed my face in. I was blind. Who knows what shall happen to Roald Dahl?Another reason this book is entirely awesome is because this book is written by Roald Dahl. Roald Dahl is a great author and has interesting topics from Friendly Giants, to chocolate factories, medicine to shrink people. He is a great author because he loves to write children's books in a way that grabs the reader's attention. Roald tells autobiographies in every story and loves writing which makes him a clear detail-telling story teller/writer.Going Solo by Roald Dahl is a great story overall. It is action-packed, full of suspense, and is written by a great author, Roald Dahl. It is kind of boring in the beginning, but it progresses when Roald really tells his stories during air battles. His dangers were growing, and accidents were fatal. Roald Dahl talks about how his adventure as a WW2 pilot is really amazing and glorious when he was going solo.-- B. Lee"},{"Title":"Going Solo","review":"I think this is a great coming of age book and one of the more memorable ones that I have read. I think it would have had even more of an effect on me if I had read it again after I graduated high-school. Come to think of it, this would be an excellent graduation gift. As it is I've used the rice and banana recipe many times. I loved the stories of him in his fighter airplane and I liked the story of the nurse where he fell in love with her voice but when he actually went on a date with her, he found out she wasn't his type. He leaves it as a mystery to why, but someone who doesn't facilitate communication, respect, honesty, and trust in a relationship is a throwback no matter how pretty the person is. I think it's a very important lesson that Roald Dahl introduces. This book is an excellent coming of age story with a responsible, confident healthy protagonist."},{"Title":"Going Solo","review":"This is the best book I have read in a long time. My third grade son recommended it to me, so I can say it's good for both kids and adults. His stories of his life as a young man working in East Africa and flying for the RAF in WW II are compelling and, as always with Dahl, so well-written. His stories of human encounters with snakes and lions are entertaining. I look forward to sharing this great book with friends. His autobiography \\"Boy\\" about his childhood was also very good and worth reading also."},{"Title":"Going Solo","review":"This is one of the most interesting and interestingly written books in recent memory.

He describes with engaging candor his role in how the British \\"muddled through\\" WWII -- just.The Brits would have one believe that all went \\"according\\" to plan -- that the issue was never in doubt -- but Dahl's charming account of how he learned to fly the Tiger Moth for the RAF and how he became an \\"instant\\" Hurricane fighter pilot in Greece were convincing evidence to the contrary.Easy reading!!

It's a real page-turner; I couldn't wait to read the next chapter!As always, his style of writing is a pleasure to read, and although most younger readers prefer his macabre tales of fantasy, this is well worth adding to their Dahl Library.Both \`Boy' and \`Going Solo' are the perfect way to introduce the developing younger reader to biographical/true-life stories, rather than remaining forever stuck in the magical realms of fantasy fiction.

The book details the narrator's life as a pilot in the Navy. When the book starts, the narrator tells about his great adventures from Africa to the Mediterranean. One of his many adventures occured, when he almost gets killed by one of the most dangerous snakes in Tanganyika, called the Green Mamba. Then later on in the story he starts his life as a pilot in 1939. dahl's first challenge was trying to learn how to fly a plane. This would usually consist of just the basic's, flying, and landing. After he had learned to master this skill it was on to the next. The narrator tells about the six months he went through constant flight training, in learning how to attack enemies in different situations. Towards the end of his training, Dahl crashes in the middle of the desert and is stranded. With no plane to fly, and his body badly injured, there was nothing he could do but just hope for someone to help him. An hour passed and Roald was put in the nearest hospital. The doctors told him he could never fly again, but Roald refused to accept that. With alot of recuperation he was able to meet up with his squadron and be ready to fly again. As soon as he got to Egypt, his capton leader said he was going up in battle against some of the best German pilots tomorrow morning. What do you think will happen when he has to battle the Germans? You better read this book to find out."},{"Title":"Going Solo","review":"In this sequel to Boy, Roald Dahl writes about his life as a young adult. After leaving Repton, his boarding school, he signed on with the Shell Oil Company and was sent to East Africa, which is now called Tanzania. While Dahl was serving in Tanzania, World War II happened and he signed up with the Royal Air Force. He chronicles in detail his work for Shell, and his experiences as an RAF pilot.In East Africa, Roald Dahl had a near-fatal encounter with a deadly black mamba, whose poison can kill you in about two seconds. Right after the war broke out Roald's servant, a descendant of warrior tribesman, decided to become a warrior himself and killed a civillian. Roald had to spirit him away before the murder was discovered. And just to show how dangerous flying with the RAF was, one day when Roald returned from a mission his tent-mate told him, \\"I boiled enough tea for two, just in case you happened to come back.\\" He was eventually shot down, but survived. While recuperating in the hospital, he fell in love with his nurse.Going Solo was, like all of Dahl's books, wonderful. I only wish he'd have written a third about his later adulthood. Pity he died before he could do that."},{"Title":"Going Solo","review":"As a 17 year old boy who spent my childhood in Norway, with roalds books, I was really surprised when I found at that he wrote books for adults as well.

It is very discreptive it tells everything about his life and is very well done. Before you read this book read Boy tales of a childhood."},{"Title":"Going Solo","review":"Going Solo (the sequel to Boy) is a collection of Roald Dahl's most interesting stories of his time in Africa. These include: meeting a man you gives himself dandruff, teaching an African boy to read and write, seeing a lion attack a cook, learning to fly without a teacher, crashing in the African desert, leading a unit of R.A.F. soldiers to stop a caravan of German people from leaving Dar es Salaam, becoming temporarily blind, meeting the girl of his dreams then falling out of love when he sees her and living on a Greek airfield soon before he was grounded. Roald Dahl's style of writing changes each time slightly changes to fit the story. Basically, you get the idea that you have known Roald for years and he is just telling you an amusing story. Going Solo was not as interesting as some of his other fiction stories. For some readers it may not be interesting enough to keep you in the book; but it is not boring, thrills and adventure are always happening. To compare this to Boy would be a little difficult because even though they are the same writer, Boy is about his childhood and is for younger readers. Going Solo is probably for older readers. Even it you do not like one of the chapters the next will bring you back in. So if you want a lot of good anecdotes to read then or if you really liked Boy, you should pick up Going Solo."},{"Title":"Going Solo","review":"This gem of a book is surprising in many ways. The whimsical cover suggests tongue-in-cheek, and, indeed, there is some of that, but mostly it is a book that sneaks up on you, grabs you, and astonishes. \`Going Solo' is the story of Roald Dahl's World War 2 experiences, and is divided roughly into two main themes. The first part records the experiences he had while he was stationed in East Africa before the war, when excitement meant such things as dealing with green mambas. I know virtually nothing about Africa, but resolved to learn more after reading this part of the book. There are many charming stories here: watch for the one taking place on his voyage out when Dahl discovers that his roommate is simulating dandruff on his dinner jacket with talcum powder!The second half of the book records his RAF exploits, many of which would not be believed had this been a work of fiction. Dahl's descriptions of such things as plane crashes are charmingly low-key and understated, an unusual way to depict danger and hardship, but one that succeeds brilliantly in this book.Adding to the charm of the book are pictures of letters, postcards, photographs, maps and the like - visuals that make the lively text come even more alive. This is one war story women who steer away from the usual blood-and-guts stereotype war novels will absolutely enjoy. It is a touching and interesting portrayal of courage and amazing happenings in the life of a very unassuming gentleman."},{"Title":"Going Solo","review":"In the book \\"Going Solo\\" Roald Dahl describes every fun and depressing part of his experience as a teenager to adulthood. Its in his hilarious style where no word is boring, and the language is easy to read, lots of photographs took by Roald Dahl himself, and the ending is satisfying.Everyone dislikes going on wars but Roald Dahl enjoyed it. He thought that it was a free travel and it was interesting. The story is about Roald Dahl's first career in Africa (Sudan) working for the Shell Oil company. When the second world war broke up he joined the royal airforce throughout middle east and the coast of Greece. some of the things he gets himself into and out of are incredible...like when he captures the war's first prisoners, or crash-lands in the desert, or flys in the Battle of Athens...the list goes on and on.Throughout the book you follow a period of his life, experiencing both the positives and negatives sides of his adventure. You also get to find out how he begins to build ideas, and these ideas become great children books that are so memorable today.Best parts: all the flying missions, of which Dahl writes so enthusiastically, by a 6'6\\" pilot crammed into the tiny cockpit of a Hurricane.Worst: I cannot believe how the RAF could send so many practically untrained flyers into combat in aircraft they had never even flown beforeGoing Solo was, like all of Dahl's books, wonderful. I only wish he'd have written a third about his later adulthood. unfortunately he died before he could do that."},{"Title":"Going Solo","review":"&quot;Going Solo&quot; is a continuation of Dahl's autobiography &quot;Boy.&quot; Once started, one will not be able to put it down. It is a page turner. This should be required reading for all men above the age of 16.

In this book Roald Dahl joins the army to fight in WW II while he is in Africa in the 1930's and 40's, Dahl comes face to face with many dangers, including lions, poisonous snakes, war waging people, and many other things while he is fighting for England. He has many adventures while he is in the war. This book is a good read and is hard to put down. if you like Roald Dahl than read this book."},{"Title":"Going Solo","review":"Dahl is the author of some of the most imaginative works of fiction ever created and this tends to overshadow his personal accomplishments, which are considerable. This book is an autobiography of his early adulthood, starting from the time he traveled to east Africa to work for the Shell Company through the first years of World War II.Dahl was one of the people that left the British Isles to work in and administer a colony in the British Empire. His descriptions of that group of people are amusing and accurate, for they were simultaneously a tough group of people although a bit daffy. Dahl's descriptions of the Major and his wife making several rounds on the deck in the nude every morning followed by the strict rule of everyone formally dressing for dinner were very amusing.Dahl volunteered for the Royal Air Force (R. A. F.), received his initial training in Kenya and flew fighter planes. He crash-landed in North Africa and after his recovery; Dahl was transferred to Greece as the Germans were moving in. It was a hopeless battle, at one time six fighter planes was all the R. A. F. could put in the air against hundreds of German planes. This installment of Dahl's amazing life ends with his flying a plane in the British campaign to take Syria from the forces of Vichy France.Dahl cheated death many times in this book; he was a true war hero of the first magnitude. Some of that was skill, but as he repeatedly admits, luck also had a great deal to do with it. In many ways, his life story is more amazing than his fiction, this is a great book for readers of all ages."},{"Title":"Going Solo","review":"I'm trying to imagine the kind of person who would not enjoy this book, and quite frankly I'm failing. If you can read this review, you will enjoy the book.It tells the story of Roald Dahl from his journey out to Dar-es-Salaam at the age of 18, to start working for Shell, to his being invalided home as a fighter pilot from the Middle East in 1941. Throughout he makes it sound as if it's all a bit of fun, but in reality the odds against his surviving the events in the book must have been 50 to 1.It's all told in a lovely deadpan voice that clearly shows up the utter absurdity what he was going through, from his servant killing a local German with a 17th century antique sword to being one of 15 fighter pilots in all of Greece to take on 1000 Luftwaffe planes. It's to his everlasting credit that he manages to do this in such a straightforward way. Of course, events speak for themselves, but it requires a skillful author to let them do so, and Dahl is more than skillful. This is a work of genius."},{"Title":"Going Solo","review":"\\"I must learn to fly a Hurricane and then I must take it to Greece and rejoin the squadron.When I got this news I was in Ismailia, a large RAF aerodrome on the Suez Canal. A Flight-Lieutenant said, 'You can have a couple of days to learn how to fly it, then you take it to Greece.''Fly that to Greece?' I said.'Of course.''Where do I stop to refuel?''You don't.' he said. 'You go non-stop.''How long will that take?''About four and a half hours,' he said.Even I knew that a Hurricane had fuel for only one and a half hours' flying, and I pointed that out to the Flight-Lieutenant. 'Don't worry about that,' he said. 'We're fitting extra fuel tanks under the wings.''Do they work?''Sometimes they work,' he said smirking. 'You press a little button and if you're lucky a pump pumps petrol from the wing-tanks into the main tank.''What happens if the pump doesn't work?''You bale out into the Med and swim,' he said.'No,' I said. 'Be serious. Who picks me up?'Nobody.' he said. 'It's a chance you have to take.'\\"- Roald Dahl (GOING SOLO p. 119)In this marvelous autobiographical sequel to BOY: TALES OF CHILDHOOD, Roald Dahl entertains and delights by recalling his experiences just prior to and during WW2 writing of the many adventures he had: traveling by ship from England to Dar-es-Salaam, Tanganyika (aboard the SS Mantola) and observing the bizarre habits of his fellow-British-passengers while on his way to work for the Shell Oil Company there, avoiding certain death from the venom of the Green Mamba, joining the Royal Air Force at the start of the war, learning to fly at an RAF airbase in Nairobi, Kenya, and crashing a Gladiator bi-plane in the Western Desert of Egypt, finally winning his wings and becoming a fighter pilot with the RAF in Africa and Greece, and then surviving dog-fights in the skies above Greece against German ME 109s. While many of Dahl's adventures were harrowing, others were very humorous.I won't spoil the fun for anyone in this brief review by writing too much. Pick up a copy of this wonderful little book and enjoy! You'll just have to take my word for it that you won't be bored or disappointed. Several maps and quite a few photos are included.As another reviewer wrote, it's a shame Mr. Dahl didn't write another autobiographical sketch about his life as a writer of children's books before he died in 1990. That, I'm sure, would have been an absolute pleasure to read."},{"Title":"Going Solo","review":"Another writer once told me that one of the most important elements to be found in a memoir is a \\"likeable\\" narrator. Roald Dahl is perhaps one of the MOST likeable of narrators. Modest to a fault and blessed with a very sly and subtle sense of humor, the story Dahl tells in GOING SOLO, his sequel to BOY, is perhaps one of the most readable memoirs of modern times. His story of the quick and almost informal training he received at a flying school in Africa shortly after Great Britain entered WWII, is hair-raising and nearly impossible to believe, except you do believe, because you trust this man. At six foot six inches tall, Dahl was physically quite unsuited to be a fighter pilot, noting that when seated in the various planes he flew, his knees were nearly under his chin and he had to hunch over to fit beneath the plane's canopy. But fly he did, even after surviving one horrific crash in the desert early on in his career as an RAF pilot. He sustained a very bad concussion (which was to come back to haunt him and finally \\"invalid\\" him out of service nearly two years later) and had his face bashed in. As he explained to his mother in a letter: \\"My nose was bashed in ... and the ear nose and throat man pulled my nose out of the back of my head and shaped it and now it looks just as before except that it's a little bent about ...\\" Dahl went on to fly many combat missions in North Africa and Greece, usually against vastly superior odds, but somehow he managed to survive until the middle of 1941, when the migraine headaches caused by the aforementioned crash made him unfit for further flying. Dahl's nearly laconic and completely unself-conscious manner of writing about the things he did - absolutely heroic things - made me think of Sam Hynes's WWII memoir of his missions in the Pacific theater. Both writers downplay the importance of their roles. They never speak of heroics or derring-do, only about the importance of their comrades, doing the jobs they were trained to do and trying their best to simply stay alive. This was an enormously satisfying, moving and often hilarious tale. After reading these two slim volumes of memoirs by Dahl, I do wish he had written another. I have ordered his slim collection of stories about WWII already. What a wonderful writer - and gentleman - Roald Dahl was. - Tim Bazzett, author of SOLDIER BOY and LOVE, WAR & POLIO"},{"Title":"Going Solo","review":"Excellent life story, adventure.

All of this is in this book.I found this book in my college library in the resources section so I could not even check it out. There may be very few copies of it."},{"Title":"Going Solo","review":"I've always enjoyed Dahl's children's books, and so I was curious to see what he might write about his own life. To say that his early adult years were exciting might understate the matter a bit. This book opens with Dahl embarking on a ship for East Africa, to start his first job as a representative of the Shell Oil Company, and follows him through his career as a RAF fighter pilot in the Eastern Mediterranean theater during WWII. Many of his tales are so over the top that it would be tempting to believe that he has embelished the stories. But even if he did, the result is an thoroughly enjoyable read, full of adventure and the excitement of youth. We also get a glimpse of the last hurrah of the British Empire, the epic struggle of the second World War, and just the barest idea of the conditions he found in war torn England upon his return. Very entertaining."},{"Title":"Going Solo","review":"i must say, this book was incredibly hard to put down!having read the previous roald dahl biography \\"boy,\\" i was eager to read this book. i wasn't disappointed at all. i was absolutely fascinated by the things that this man has gone through. i feel like a coward indeed after reading about roald dahl's trip to africa and his terrifying wartime experiences! it's magnetic!this book is written in a very straightforward style, and anyone and everyone should read it, i believe! there is a lot to be learned from this book. it shows the true insanity of war. people lose their minds in the kind of situations described in this book!it has a happy ending, though. this, you can look forward to!"},{"Title":"Going Solo","review":"Going Solo, by Roald Dahl is the epic sequel to his early age biography, Boy.In this book, Dahl is a grown man, just graduated out of Repton Boys School and is now working for the Shell Company. This book takes place during World War II, and Dahl starts in East Africa, and ends up in the places that you would least expect.Roald Dahl begins his new job in the small village of Dur es Salaam, Tanzania.Just as he wishes, he drives through the African jungles, delivering oil to people who live quite far from civilization. In Dur es Salaam Dahl encountered one of natures deadliest creatures; the black mamba. This particular snake's venom has no known cure, and its poison will kill its victim in no more then an hour. Dahl got the thrill of saving a person's life, by merely looking, out a window and screaming, \\"Salimu! Salimu! Beware huge snake! Behind You! Quickly quickly!\\" The boy, Salimu, quickly killed the snake off with a pitchfork, but owed his life to Dahl. Roald Dahl had many other adventures in Dur es Salaam, such as having a green mamba in his friend's house and having to call the \`snake man.' And seeing the cook's wife being carried off by a lion, but came back without a scratch!When war was announced, Dahl went off to be a Navy pilot. He leaves the Shell Company, and goes to Iraq, to be trained to be a pilot. Finally, when his training is complete, he is given coordinates of Squadron 80 (the Navy squad he's assigned to). While flying towards his squadron, Dahl realized that he was given the wrong coordinates! Nearly out of fuel, he attempts to land his plane on the bumpy terrain, but crashes, and barely escapes death!Squadron 80's assignment was to patrol Greece, and keep it safe from the Germans. There was only one minor problem; Squadron 80 had fifteen nice, well built Hurricane airplanes, while the German army had hundreds of planes that were the newest models. So no wonder Squadron 80 eventually fled, and Greece was captured by the Germans.He and his remaining squad go to Haifa Egypt, to once again protect it. Due to head injury's from Dahl's big crash, he becomes an invalid pilot, and begins his long journey home.I enjoyed this book, because it kept you on your toes at all times. There was never a moment that I wasn't enthralled in Roald Dahl's exquisite description, that put you right there in a Hurricane, dodging enemy blasts. I rate this book an 8 out of 10 because, even though its action packed, it sometimes gets a bit repetitive. If you enjoyed Boy, and are looking for a book that you won't ever want to put down, then choose Going Solo, and you won't regret it."},{"Title":"Going Solo","review":"And nowhere near as good as his fiction, GOING SOLO almost seems as though it was written as therapy. It's a professional job, don't get me wrong, but you can almost see Dahl working overtime to make his stories more exciting and gripping than they probably really were. The book begins with young Roald travelling to Tanzania on a boat under orders from Shell Oil, where he hopes to begin a career. Almost instantly the war breaks out and Dahl is ordered to round up the war's first prisoners. Then he's sent to flying school and taught to master a plane in a few months. Were planes simpler to learn back then? Well, for one thing, the RAF was educating its young men at assembly line pace, and the objective was to get up and come down; nothing fancier needed.It's sort of comical, especially because Roald felt himself to be abnormally tall (six and a half feet, a good foot taller than several of his instructors) so he really had to wedge his butt into the tiny Piper seat and fold his long legs like a heron to be able to play the pedals properly. The book peters out after a terrible crash results in awful head injuries, wounds that impacted his whole life way down the pike and narrowed his Swiftian vision into the refined cruelty that sparked his great masterpieces for children.No, I would not say this book is for kids, but on the other hand children love reading about flying, and they enjoy identifying with the \\"fish out of water.\\" Children feel a bond to outsiders of all descriptions, because everyone feels picked on. For Dahl it was a feeling that never went away, no matter how close he came to the stars."},{"Title":"Walpurgis III (Questar Science Fiction)","review":"Conrad Bland has finally found a world that accepts him.

The book concerns the role played by the Giriama (a fairly small tribe whose homeland is near the coast in what is now Kenya) in resistance to colonial rule. A good portion is devoted to the Giriama rebellion of 1913. I find East African history fascinating: I like history have had an interest in Africa since the 1960s and am married to a Giriama. However, this book is not everyone's cup of chai. It suffers from that which makes most scholarly works dry: recitation of lots of facts and cautiously drawn conclusions. It does have a feel of authenticity and some immediateness (my wife knows or knows of some of the individuals that Brantley uses as sources). One item of interest is that one of the main leaders of the Giriama restistance in 1913 was a woman."},{"Title":"Guide to the Study of Freshwater Biology","review":"A genuine classic used heavily by my students in ecology in several decades of teaching.

In addition, representatives most commonly seen by students are illustrated with accurate, well-labelled line drawings. A brief essay on methods of sampling and analyzing aquatic organisms and their habitats completes this compact, useful guide.

Most of the works have received few performances, to my knowledge, and even fewer recordings.The performers are well-known as exponents of Gregorian chant, but their commitment to and belief in all styles of choral music clearly shines through in these rivetting performances.The works cover a broad span of Mathias's all-too-quickly-ended life from 1973 to 1992 (the year of his death) and demonstrate both the eclecticism, humour and consistency of his voice as a composer. For those unfamiliar with his works, this is an ideal introduction. For those who already know his work well, like myself, this is a wonderful addition of rareties and a fitting memorial to a composer who is under-represented in the catalogues.I would give it 10 stars if I could **********"},{"Title":"My lord the fox: The secret documents of Anthony Woodcott concerning Queen Elizabeth I and Anne Boleyn : a novel","review":"Published in the 1980s, \\"My Lord the Fox\\" is out of print now, and not easy to get hold of. It's 1560 and our narrator, the fictional Anthony Woodcott, is an investigator who works for William Cecil, the \\"fox\\" of the title. Cecil requests that he looks into two seemingly unrelated matters: Anne Boleyn's conduct in 1532, the year of Elizabeth's conception, and the health of Amy Dudley, the wife of Robert, Queen Elizabeth's great favourite. The background to this is the friction between Robert Dudley and Cecil, and the latter regards the former as a very real threat.While York is a talented writer, I didn't feel this novel quite succeeded. Firstly, in an attempt to replicate early modern English, the writer falls into the trap of, to quote author Susan Higginbotham, \\"writing forsoothly.\\" It is a delicate balance for any writer in this genre - it's important to evoke a sense of the period and avoid glaring anachronisms, without getting too florid and risking losing the reader's attention. In this case, there are a number of lengthy, overwritten, meandering passages where I just found myself tuning out. Another problem is the form the novel takes, with Woodcott writing down his recollections of his investigation as insurance if anything nasty befalls him, but quoting from his notes of conversations with others instead of weaving them into a coherent narrative. The story-within-a-story approach can be very effective, but in this case, particularly in the first half of the novel, the result is disjointed and lacks any sense of immediacy or suspense, thus distancing the reader rather than drawing him or her into the story.Anne Boleyn is referred to interchangeably and inconsistently as \\"Mistress Boleyn\\" - please correct me if I'm wrong, but I'm not even sure that would have been an accurate form of address for her - \\"Mistress Anne,\\" \\"Lady Anne\\" or \\"Queen Anne\\" (as Anthony Woodcott's account takes place years after her death, couldn't he pick one and stick with it?). Equally irritating is the narrator's habit of referring to her repetitively as \\"vain, coarse, relentless\\" (yes, Anthony Woodcott, we get that you don't like her). At the time he is writing, the people he is asking questions about - particularly Anne Boleyn, Henry VIII, and Mark Smeaton the musician - are long dead, and therefore he is necessarily relying solely on hearsay upon hearsay, but the conclusions he comes to are based on leaps of logic that on any objective assessment of the evidence as presented in the novel (let alone on the basis of the evidence that emerges from the historical record), don't stand up to scrutiny. What Woodcott presents as \\"proof\\" is nothing more than conjecture and supposition. While at face value this annoyed me, on reflection I realised it was rather clever; we are dealing with a potentially unreliable narrator, and the point of the novel is how this information is used, which means that in effect it does not really matter for Cecil's or Woodcott's purposes whether it is accurate or reliable or not. It is left to the reader to make his or her own assessment of the so-called evidence and conclusions drawn from it.The section dealing with Lady Dudley and the \\"mystery of Cumnor Place\\" is much better, partly because we are reading about Woodcott's own observations and experiences, rather than his recollections of what others have told him, and the hypothesis York puts forward comes as quite a surprise. The ultimate denouement is well done, but thereafter the novel just ... stops. None of the characters emerges in a particularly positive light - Cecil, Elizabeth, Dudley, and certainly not poor Anne Boleyn, who gets the boot put into her quite a bit, as noted above - least of all Woodcott himself. The narrative form chosen - or more accurately, its execution - does not really allow for three-D character development, which is unfortunate.Overall this is an interesting read for its curiosity value, but otherwise pretty average. I wouldn't search the earth to get hold of it."},{"Title":"My lord the fox: The secret documents of Anthony Woodcott concerning Queen Elizabeth I and Anne Boleyn : a novel","review":"Four stars because it's been a few years since I read this book, but I remember that I liked it!What I enjoyed about this book was that the author twisted what we do know to create a great &quot;what if&quot; story. What if Anne Boleyn did this or that? What if Elizabeth I had to do something drastic to protect her position as queen?Who knows what really happened? Will we ever understand what motivated peoples' behaviour? The fun of it is that we probably ever will!There are items in this book that a historian could use to make a good argument for as being true, but of course, because the events took place so long ago, there is no way to test their veracity.

Written as a kind of Part Two to Kipling's previous hit, &quot;Puck of Pook's Hill&quot;, &quot;Rewards and Fairies&quot; continues where its predecessor left off. Like the first book, &quot;Rewards&quot; once again follows the tame adventures of little Dan and Una as their adventures with Puck (of &quot;Midsummer Night's Dream&quot; fame) give them new insights into England's fabulous past.Once again our unlikely heroes (and their unlikely guide) are visited by some relatively obscure but important members of England's great moments. These include everything from a lady of Queen Elizabeth I's court to a half-English half-French smuggler from the years of the French Revolution. Though the stories in this book vary incredibly in quality, Kipling has extended his narrative by quite a bit. Suddenly the kids are meeting a caveman that gave his own eye for a knife and consequently ended up a god amongst his people. Going completely overboard, Kipling includes a smuggler that tells a story about his travels amongst the Seneca of North America. His tale praises (of all people) President George Washington, making the man out to be just shy of a saint. I doubt very much that there are American works of fiction out there that praise our first president even half as much as Kipling's book does here. Some of the characters from the previous book reappear in this one for a brief encore. Once again we meet Harry Dawe, the stonemason who was knighted by King Henry VIII for saving him thirty pounds. There's Sir Richard Dalyngridge again, telling the last and most drawn out boring tale in the lot. In Harry's case, his reappearance is an extension of his somewhat foreshortened previous adventures. In Sir Richard's case, there is no such excuse.There are things to love in this book, of course. The poems are just shy of brilliant here and there. It's difficult to keep yourself from singing them once in a while. They're just so doggone rhythmic. And there's a lot of humor in these stories too. Puck at one point introduces the kids to an overly affected astrologer who saved a village from the plague (he had the right methods but the wrong reasons). Then there are lines in this book that could keep you awake and twisting for days. How quickly can you say, &quot;I tell you now that a faith which takes care that every man shall keep faith, even though he may save his soul by breaking faith, is the faith for a man to believe in&quot;? Even better, how quickly can you understand it? The book also gives chummy nicknames to some of the world's most infamous men. Suddenly Napolean Bonaparte is being referred to as &quot;Boney&quot; and Sir Francis Drake is reduced to a mere, &quot;Frankie&quot;.The best way to tell if you'll enjoy &quot;Rewards and Fairies&quot; is to read &quot;Puck of Pook's Hill First&quot;. If you read that one and enjoyed it then you should have virtually zippo problems with this later creation. Personally, I loved it. I thought it was a great little English History 101 (though I can't exactly remember the difference between the Normans and the Saxons anymore). If you read everything with the exception of the last chapter, I think you'll find it undeniably charming. And who knew Puck enjoyed hearing about business transactions? You could learn a lot from a text like this."},{"Title":"Rewards and Fairies","review":"\\"Rewards and Fairies\\" is the sequel to \\"Puck of Pook's Hill\\". I am very glad it is currently in print. Sometimes it goes out of print, sad because I find it one of the best books for young people. Dan and Una, two children growing up in the English countryside, meet their old friend Puck, a long time vistor to the farm where they live. Puck has used the leaves of the magical trees, oak ash and thorn, to wipe out the children's memories of their past visits, when Puck introduced them to the ghosts of the people who lived on and loved their land before them. In this book, the children and their visitors range further afield, visiting the chalk downs and sheep country where their father grew up. There they meet an early man-god, who sacrificed his eye and his mortality to protect his people and the sheep from their enemy, the wolf. They meet a French and English smuggler who introduces them to American history. This book is just as entertaining and magical as \\"Puck of Pook's Hill\\"."},{"Title":"Sweden;: The middle way,","review":"Many years ago, I bought this volume in a college bookstore, thinking it would help me understand more about Sweden, one of those countries that you think you know, but actually don't. That was during the height of the cold war, around the time when Kennedy and Khrushchov faced off over the Cuban missile crisis. So you know I ain't whistlin' Dixie when I say it was some time back. Even then, I assumed, without too much leafing through while standing in the store, that the title referred to Sweden's socialistic system being a middle way between capitalist America and the communist USSR. Recently, after \\"a bit of procrastination\\", I finally took Childs' book off my shelf, finding much to my surprise that he wrote about a middle way between fascism and communism, now both long extinct in Europe. He had written the book in 1936, though I had a later edition. In my edition, things were brought up to date--that is up to 1946 ! Thus, the picture of Swedish society offered here is a little passe. I don't think it would be of much use to anyone now, though SWEDEN: THE MIDDLE WAY was a best seller in its day and had a fair amount of influence on thinking in various countries.Childs writes of the cooperative movement in Sweden----how it started, what it achieved both nationally and internationally, its connection to housing, power generation, state industry and state monopolies, to the king, and even to liquor problems. He uses a lot of statistics and examples drawn from light bulb industries, galosh makers, living arrangements in worker housing colonies, and such. It wouldn't have been a very easy read even in the Thirties of the last century, being aimed at policy makers more than the general reading public. Now, I expect most people might wonder why they bothered. That's why I've given it only two stars. But if you want to know what cheap Bordeaux cost in Sweden back then, the Swedish king's role in the general strike of 1909, and many interesting facts about the Swedish state railway system eighty years ago, this could be the book for you."},{"Title":"Killers Kiss Fear Street 42","review":"This book is so mysterious and even when the book was over i still wanted to keep reading.at first you might wonder whats going a little bit but as the, story goes on you find yourself saying youre going to put the book down but dont.if you love suspense then read this book.you wont regret it."},{"Title":"Killers Kiss Fear Street 42","review":"Delia and Karina are competing against each other for everything.

Needless to say, the title made me suspicious as to the content. After I read it, his parents notified the school. It has now been removed. This type of book may be o.k. for adults, if they like this sort of story; however, it should not be allowed in schools. Wonder where kids are getting the ideas to shoot up classrooms and malls? Check out the books they're reading......"},{"Title":"Killers Kiss Fear Street 42","review":"Killer's Kiss is an easy to read fast flowing storyline that although a little predictable it has enough twists that keep the reader questioning what they think is going on is actually what is. R.L. Stine has written a substantial number of books marketed at children, young adults and adults and the publishing company has decided to place Killer's Kiss in the Young Adult category. Whilst some of Stine's childrens' fiction is a bit basic for adults or specifically written to only appeal to a specific age market this is not so with Killer's Kiss. Killer's Kiss is a simple and easy to read book but contains enough storyline substance that those who read most of their books from the adult fiction novel level won't still enjoy this. It also doesn't use teenage specific vocabulary (which would date the book extremely fast if it did) meaning those who are no longer teens can still follow it as well and in ten years time the next generation of young adults will still enjoy it as well.Killer's Kiss is the story of a the self centred huge egod popular highschool boy (Vincent) and the affect his desire to manipulate two former best friends into believing he is dating each of them exclusively and convincing them the other is just jealous and delusional. Delia and Karina (the two girls) have been competing against each other their whole lives with Delia usually being pipped at the post by Karina. Delia has had enough of this and won't have what she believes to be her current boyfriend stolen from her. Karina has also had enough of what she believes to be Delia wanting everything she has. Throw in a talent contest and you've got an unhealthy competition that's deadly serious!"},{"Title":"Killers Kiss Fear Street 42","review":"Although I thought this book would be kind of wack it turned out 2 be a great book.

The plot is that these two girls who have always hated each other and go after the same things, like this guy named Vincent. Both of the girls think he is dating them exclusively, but he's playing both of them. The ending is very unpredictable and interesting"},{"Title":"Killers Kiss Fear Street 42","review":"Synopsis: Delia Easton and Karina Frye have always been competing with one another since they were kids, on clothes, grades and friends, and now over Vincent Milano. What they don't realize is that Vincent, a boy who they both like, is secretly dating both of them and enjoying it. Needless to say, Karina finds out about Vincent and Delia, and thinks that Delia was trying to steal Vincent from her.Later, Karina sees Delia in the gym and starts strangling her and threatens to kill her. Afterward, Delia feels like Karina is up to something, especially when she sees Karina talking with Stewart Andrews - her stiffest competition for the Conklin Award, besides Karina. Delia's worst nightmare comes true when she opens her guitar case on the stage during the award show, only to find her strings in her guitar cut, and a decomposing rat jammed inside the guitar hole. Her troubles are far from over, and when she gets a second chance to show her talent, someone ruins her painting at the show. Delia realizes that Karina is dangerous and wants to see her fail in everything important to her. Can Delia stop Karina from stealing her boyfriend, her future, her life?Review: I enjoyed reading this book. It had a classic Fear Street storyline, strange characters, gruesome incidents, and lots of twists. One of the main reasons why I enjoyed it was to see Vincent get exactly what he deserved for being a disgusting character dating all those girls. Some moments in this book were gross to read, like when Delia sees a decomposing rat in her guitar case.Similar to other Fear Street books, Stine manages to give an unexpected twist in the end to shock the readers, but when he does this, I find loopholes in the storyline that don't make sense. Don't get me wrong, I loved the ending of this book, but it just made think of a few incidents that didn't add up. For example, at the Conklin Award, after the incident, Delia sees Karina speak with Sarah and they both walk out together, although no explanation is provided for this. I just feel like if Stine had given more details towards the end of the book to cover every mysterious incident that took place, I would have enjoyed this book more.Anyway, other than that, this is a good Fear Street book to read, and I would recommend it to anyone who likes the series."},{"Title":"Killers Kiss Fear Street 42","review":"overall, a very good book and storyline, the writing, is a bit slacked, sometimes, there's just too much of a description! you don't realy need to know so much.. and when u read the end.. it's like, but that's what i THOUGHT!!! hehe"},{"Title":"Killers Kiss Fear Street 42","review":"this book was one of the coolest books written by r.l.stine. the storyline is great and revolves around delia and katrina,two girls who have been enemies since kindergarten .

This book is a pleasant change. With its intuitive approach at the start of each chapter, the reader is given a feel for the subject matter, something which is often lacking in texts of this level. Particularly illuminating were the chapters on dynamical systems and embeddings. They gave meaning to what most of my generation had only heard through James Gleik and those fiendish cyclone generating insects. One can see the potential of the subject stretches beyond the financial markets.For new comers to this field, the collection of algorithms and references throughout the book provide a rich starting point. The writer has provided a sound reference for the researcher and clear signposts in the mesmerizing land of non-linear dynamics."},{"Title":"Footprints of Chaos in the Market: Analyzing Non-Linear Time Series in Financial Markets and Other Natural Systems (Financial Times (Prentice Hall))","review":"I'm surprised that this book got reader reviews thatare as favorable as the reviews posted before this one.If you are interested in the mathematics of chaos anddynamical systems, this might be a good book for you.However, this book is densely packed with mathematicsand unless you have a very solid mathematical background,Peitgen, Jurgens and Saupe's wonderful book &quot;Chaos andFractals: New Frontiers of Science&quot; might be a better choice.This book covers the basic mathematics of dynamical systemsbut does not delve into graduate level mathematics.If you are thinking of buying this book because its titlementions markets and non-linear financial time series,save your money. The author spends five very mathematicallyladen chapters discussing dynamical systems. There is nothingsolid on applying the mathematics of dynamical systems tofinancial time series other than the observation that theysure seem chaotic. At the very end the author weakly suggeststhat dynamical systems theory might be applied to marketinformation, but he provides no examples.People who develop successful market models usually don'tpublish much on them, since there is a lot to be gainedby trading them. So one cannot catagorically state what hasand has not been done. However, I know of no case wheredynamical systems mathematics has been used to successfullyprovide predictive models (e.g., models you can trade andmake money on) of financial markets. This book certainly doesnot live up to the promise of its title.There are a number of good book on time series analysis andmodeling. For example, see &quot;Wavelet Methods for Time Series Analysis&quot; by Donald B. Percival, Andrew T. Walden. This bookdoes not deal with financial time series directly, but it doesdeal with &quot;non-stationary&quot; time series."},{"Title":"Footprints of Chaos in the Market: Analyzing Non-Linear Time Series in Financial Markets and Other Natural Systems (Financial Times (Prentice Hall))","review":"1) first, there is hardly *any* mention of markets in thebook. I only found two referencesto the market in the entire book. the first reference wasearly on where a couple of plots of the S&amp;P were shown atdaily and weekly time frames, and the author stated that theplots resembled each other and therefore this could be takenas evidence of self-similarity.the title of the book is mis-leading... it would be as ifa calculus textbook were to call itself &quot;calculus in the markets&quot;simply because they have a section on compound interest...2) there is a lot of hand-waving in the theory that is covered.the author does cover a lot of ground, so it is understandablethat more details and explanations of certain subjects arenot provided. this book *is* a good bibliographic reference,for example if one is interested in a particular topic, itcould be looked up in this book, and references to all theseminal works are given.3) there are better books out there that cover similar subjectmatter, and *are* centered on the marketplace: for example,Mandlebrot's &quot;Fractals and Scaling in Finance&quot;, Lo andMacKinlay's &quot;A Non-Random Walk Down Wallstreet&quot;, William Brocket al &quot;Nonlinear Dynamics, Chaos, and Instability&quot;, andseveral books by Edgar Peters."},{"Title":"Footprints of Chaos in the Market: Analyzing Non-Linear Time Series in Financial Markets and Other Natural Systems (Financial Times (Prentice Hall))","review":"Everything you would care to know and to spare.

NOT recommended!

Frankly if your mother made $100,000 in the last year just using simple buy and hold strategy your professor advocated in your undergraduate, master and finally PhD program because of the effcient market hypothesis listen to her and don't buy this book. For the serious student of the market not tainted with academic nonsense or intellectual diarrhea of some world bank crony you will be able to implement some of your ideas painlessly. Enough background info is also provided so you can research from those academic deadbeats that have probably never bought a stock in their life.

(a mere one cent move in grain futures) Yet the same cost provides us with a wealth of knowledge far beyond a lot of the modern books written on commodity trading!Whilst certain things like placing a 2-3 cents stop will have gotten outdated, many of the ideas such as to divide your trading capital into 10 equal parts and risk only one tenth at a time are useful for the present time and also for the future!The section that is most appealing is the area that deals with the TIME periods. As Gann said: \\"Time is the most important factor.\\" I am in complete agreement with him.Another thing that I will like to add is that there are a lot of things that need to be understood as the reader may not grasp these on a first quick reading.I will definitely suggest that ALL teaders of all types of futures should get a copy of it and read it more than a few times. Use it as a source of knowledge and as a reference guide as well.From the use of this book, you will be inspired to carry out your own experiments and get some interesting results."},{"Title":"How To Make Profits in Commodities: A Study of the Commodity Market With Charts and Rules for Successful Trading and Investing","review":"WD Gann wrote this updated version of the book in 1951. Yes, 1951. His methodologies and style, as well as his world view, are so....well 1950's. However, what he provides to those of us who want to be successful in trading commodites is a broad set of 'do's and dont's' that you can find in nearly every trading book written today. You know, \\"stop loss orders\\", \\"dont over trade\\", \\"never risk more than X%\\" of your capital on a given trade, \\"let your winning trade's ride\\", \\"get out of a bad trade immediately\\", \\"when in doubt, there is no doubt\\".... We have read them all before. NONE of this is of any real value to the modern trader. However, what is of value, is getting a recognition of the painstaking historical analysis that WD Gann went through BEFORE he traded any commodities. This book includes several 100 year analyses of all the traded commodities of his time. The analyses include what happened in the \\"month of September in 1897\\" in cotton. And then that is followed by the next relevant technical occurance, which happened in October of 1897. He does this for many of the commodites of the time from 1841 to 1941. What the reader comes away with in my opinion, is that commodities are cyclical in nature. And that if you can holistically 'feel' the history and the motion of the cycles that exist in each commodity, you can trade more effectively. This includes understanding the 'how we got here' and the relevant bigger picture points that one can glean from looking at the historical data on a specific commodity. For example, that in the last 100 years (1841-1941), (I am making this up) Corn has reached a new yearly high in the month of June 22 times, and a new low in August 36 times. Whereas, new highs were reached in February only 2 times, and new lows reached in December 2 times. This information is valuable to a trader who knows what to do with this type of information. In my view, dont look to this book for more information on \\"how to trade\\" as much as you should look at 'what to do' to improve your chances of success. One last note, if you are looking to get some background or academic knowledge on how GANN lines are used, or GANN Boxes or any of the other GANN ascribed technical tools used or invented by GANN, this book DOES NOT show, teach or discuss any of them."},{"Title":"How To Make Profits in Commodities: A Study of the Commodity Market With Charts and Rules for Successful Trading and Investing","review":"W.D. Gann is considered to be the greatest trader of all time. This book shows how to make profits on the commodities exchanges. It is combines theory and practice. It is very logical and he presents an excellent case for making money in commodities. Many trading books are expensive and not worth the price you pay for them. Ganns books and courses are an exception. They are worth every penny. What impressed me most about the book, is that Gann is honest. He doesn't try to con his readers."},{"Title":"How To Make Profits in Commodities: A Study of the Commodity Market With Charts and Rules for Successful Trading and Investing","review":"For those who had not read any other Gann's trading book, this is an excellent choice. I assure you that you would be fascinated by Gann's superb insight and intelligence that had transcended over half a century. Though it focused primarily on commodities, the principles are applicable to stock trading as well. Traders can definitely benefit from them.For those who had read other Gann's books before, you may feel that this one is quite similar to his previous books (this is Gann's last book published). In fact, the rules set here are over 95% identical with those laid out in &quot;45 Years in Wall Street&quot; Gann published two years before this. However, as one reviewer wrote that the above average price ($49) of this highly valuable book is still lower than one single pip of a commodity futures contract, I think it should still be an essential item in any Gann friend's personal collection."},{"Title":"How To Make Profits in Commodities: A Study of the Commodity Market With Charts and Rules for Successful Trading and Investing","review":"I've been a commodities trader for many years but I've never owned a book by Gann so I bought this to use more as a reference than a first time read. I'm very familiar with many of his concepts but wanted to get them first hand instead of \\"Gann said...\\" which I know more often than not is used as a false come-on to lure you to the commentator's product - including software.That said, I'm rating the book on the quality of the printed product and not on Gann's trading. I purchased this book new directly from Amazon. Beginning with the Gann charts on page 329 there are five of them that are completely unreadable because the crosshatch on the chart along with its comments are mostly blank. It is a production problem. The five charts simply didn't reproduce on the page. They are blotchy or in some cases almost blank. The printing quality isn't limited to the charts. Some of the textual pages are lighter than others and some are heavy black, obviously a problem with the printer.I'm not exchanging the book because there is no guarantee that the next one will be any better and you know good and well they're not going to thumb through the book before shipping it out.C'mon Amazon - at the price you're getting for this product you can do better."},{"Title":"How To Make Profits in Commodities: A Study of the Commodity Market With Charts and Rules for Successful Trading and Investing","review":"I like this book. It does not promise \\"90% accurate signals\\" or treat reader with condescension. It teaches three things: 1) \\"swing trading\\" methods, 2) how to pay attention, 3) never forget stop loss orders.The book itself is structured in three large parts: 1) W.D. Gann's approach to markets and trader's discipline, 2) examples of trading patterns from various commodities all the way from 19th century, 3) addendum from 1951 with some more details and clarifications.Some people complain that Gann's writing style is too monotonous and droning. It is true in the sense that he does not entertain. But he does cover more ground than all those easy-reading \\"Trading for Dummies\\" book which are typeset in triple space with large charts.Parts of this book and interpretations of Gann's methods are available on the web - but it is still nice to have it as a book."},{"Title":"How To Make Profits in Commodities: A Study of the Commodity Market With Charts and Rules for Successful Trading and Investing","review":"Traders tend to confuse 'Gann, the Trader', with 'Gann, the Forecaster'. Gann, the Trader, was straight forward and logical. Problem starts when traders attempt to trade the forecast with Gann's numerous predictive methods and, vice versa, forecast the trade with Gann's trading method. Gann really does not deserve all the unfounded criticisms. Although there are doubts as to the claims that Gann was the originator of swing chart trading method, Gann, at least, refined and definitized the swing chart trading concept. No one can question the sound trading principles behind the method since there is a clear and convincing proof by none other than Jesse Livermore who achieved the spectacular trading accomplishments by using a variation of swing chart trading method. What Gann tried to do was to add his own brand of forecasting methods to complement his trading operation. There is certainly nothing wrong with the exercise as long as one does not confuse either objective with the other. To be a good trader, one does not need to be a forecaster. In fact, it is not recommended if the trader is a terrible forecaster for his prediction may be detrimental to his trading. However, to truly become an excellent trader, it does not hurt to be a good forecaster as well. The decision on whether or not the chosen forecasting algorithm should be based on Gann is another matter."},{"Title":"How To Make Profits in Commodities: A Study of the Commodity Market With Charts and Rules for Successful Trading and Investing","review":"If i could keep just one of my gann books this one would be it , it is packed full of ideas even a non gann follower could benifit from this book."},{"Title":"How To Make Profits in Commodities: A Study of the Commodity Market With Charts and Rules for Successful Trading and Investing","review":"This book is a hodge-podge of techniques presented in a droning, labored style.

Gann's writings supposedly contain \\"hidden clues\\" as to how to forecast price levels at a specific time in the future for financial instruments.Applying an honest effort to Gann's material, it appears that the SP500 index (SPX) should sell at 1172.50 on Wednesday, 11/03/04.

I've never been happy with the arrangements in most popular sheet music, especially &quot;PVG&quot; and &quot;Easy Piano&quot; sheets -- they are too simple and have almost no left hand accompaniment to speak of. Generally, there are no chords or arpeggios -- just single note &quot;plink, plink, plink&quot; etc. while the right hand has to carry the whole song.On the other hand, many of the arrangements in this book (and in Dan Coates &quot;Advanced&quot; and &quot;Professional Touch&quot; books in general) have *wonderful* left-hand accompaniments and dramatic chording and other nice touches for the right-hand. Difficulty ranges from intermediate (&quot;The Rose&quot;, &quot;Open Arms&quot;) to advanced (&quot;I Will Always Love You&quot;).Sure, if you're talented enough to arrange for yourself you might find fault, but for those of us who just read and play and like to play popular music, this is an exceptional book."},{"Title":"The Best in Popular Sheet Music: Advanced Piano","review":"For some time now I have been looking for a book that would challenge me and make me practice!

They are usually mediocre arrangements that take away the beauty of a song that was never intended for a solo instrument. This compilation is no exception and many of the arrangements are unacceptable rips. I found many of the arrangements in this collection are &quot;light&quot; and unappealing. But admittedly the fault is more in the genre of music than in the arrangements per se.The musician advanced enough to read this music will gain more satisfacaction trying to arrange the songs himself from a public domain chord sheet!

Due to an insightful report filed by a Bf 110 pilot, Htm. Wolfgang Falck, in April 1940, the Luftwaffe began serious efforts to create and organize a Night Fighter Force, Falck being appointed to command the first Nachtjagdgeschwader. The task was enormous but Falck's efforts were bolstered by the appointment of Oberst Josef Kammhuber to command a newly created Night Fighter Division. By the end of 1940 radar technology, both ground-based and mounted in Bf 110s, Ju 88s and other aircraft, had been incorporated, resulting in a force that began taking an increasing toll of their RAF opponents.Williams covers the first, faltering steps of German's nightfighters, chronicling their successes, failures and technical developments such as 'Schrage musik' along with giving proper credit - in the form of lengthy sidebars - to Falck, Kammhuber and top-scoring ace Helmut Lent. Several combat reports by aircrew and CGI controllers are included as well.In typical \\"Classic Colours\\" style the text is complimented by over 200 black & white and color photos and 14 Tim Brown/Tom Tullis color profiles of Bf 109, 110, Ju 88, Do 215/217 and even Arado 68 nightfighters. This is one VERY well-illustrated book!The exploits of experten like Streib, Gildner, Lent and Geiger live again in Williams' splendid book. Luftwaffe fans will enjoy this book; it's a winner!"},{"Title":"Nachtjager, Volume One: Luftwaffe Night Fighter Units 1939-1943 (Luftwaffe Colours)","review":"This is a well written though brief historical overview of the early years of the German nightfighter force in WW2. For its compact (less than 100 9\\" x 12\\" pages) size, there are lots of great pictures, color illustrations, biographies, anectdotal accounts, and techical descriptions of the men and equipment that comprised the Nachtjagd. My only complaint is that the number of these sidebars which sometimes are as large as three pages, interrupt the reading of the historical narrative which is actually the most interesting part of the book. One of the primary purposes of this series seems to be to clarify and illustrate the color, camouflage and markings of the aircrafts used by the Luftwaffe. To that end I would like to see more than just profiles of the aircraft which are illustrated. There also seem to be a few tiny errors in the identification of aircraft, but overall I am very happy with this book and would highly recomend it to anyone, especially scale modelers."},{"Title":"Nachtjager, Volume One: Luftwaffe Night Fighter Units 1939-1943 (Luftwaffe Colours)","review":"Same review as with vol. 2 goes with this book.

But her last trip was a bit too hasty and left loose ends, the deadly kind. Despite the strain on her new husband, Jane heads out to save her most likeable client to date, Pete Hatcher. He's not the brightest bulb, but a very decent guy who deserves to live. Unfortunately, others don't agree. In fact, they are so determined that they hire a couple of sociopaths, a man and woman who relish the hunt, to see to it that Pete is dispatched to the Great Casino in the Sky, because he knows too much about a crooked casino in Las Vegas. This is the third entry in an engrossing series. Jane is a Seneca Indian and Native American lore suffuses the books. Some of her skills and knowledge come from dreams, folktales and history, but it's all useful when trying to escape killers, even those with four legs. Much of the chase, which takes place before 9/11, wouldn't be possible under today's stricter surveillance, but it's riveting anyway. Thomas Perry has several plot devices that may not suit everyone, but I enjoy them tremendously. One is that his characters are pretty cold-blooded, able to make reasoned decisions and talk them out at length, even in the face of immediate danger. Another is that all his books, not just this series, features a lot of travel, by plane, car, canoe, or on foot. Along with the constant instruction on how to build a life under the radar, the reader can learn a lot while enjoying the twists of the plot. Pete, as it turns out, isn't the only one in danger. While suspense builds in the West as Jane and Pete head North, Carey McKinnon, her husband, is in peril back home. Can Jane save Pete? Carey? Herself? I recommend reading this series in order. There are only 7 books as of 2012, so it isn't an onerous task, and all the books are fascinating. It's particularly interesting to watch Jane's progress through life, from a single guide to a conflicted housewife. Carey is a very intelligent man, but he's an obstacle in her career. Can it work out? Read on and see."},{"Title":"Shadow Woman: A Jane Whitefield Novel","review":"Great book was usual.

After reading one of the more recent books in the series and loving it (Runner), I decided to read more of the Jane Whitefield books. \\"Shadow Woman\\" is going backwards, but it didn't affect my interest in the story at all. There were a number of bad guys in this novel, but the main two chasers were especially twisted and therefore much more interesting than usual. Jane has met her match with these two, and the story will keep you on the edge of your seat without giving you a heart attack. Sometimes I can't read these types of books because they are just all tension, and nothing else. In other words, this book has tension, but the story is worth it! I was glued to the book until I finished it.If I had to find something I didn't like, it would be Jane's dreams. In both books I have read so far the author describes Jane's dreams in detail, and sometimes they last several pages. I read them at first, but now I skip them. I guess the dreams might add to the story for some readers, but at the same time, I don't feel you lose anything by skipping over them. Fortunately, I think this particular book only had one long dream that I had to skip over.All in all it is still worth five starts for me, and I am now off to start reading my next 'Jane' novel."},{"Title":"Shadow Woman: A Jane Whitefield Novel","review":"This is the third novel about Jane Whitefield, half-Seneca \\"guide\\" who helps the hunted (who are not always \\"innocent\\") escape their pursuers and disappear into the cracks in modern society. Jane is recently married to a surgeon she's known all her life, and has promised him she would give up her escort activities (which he never knew about), but she has to renege somewhat when the casino executive who was supposed to be her last project has to holler for help a second time. The first two-thirds of the story really doesn't live up to Perry's previous work -- possibly because the two hunters/hitmen who are sent by the casino's owners to kill their errant executive are extremely unlikable. Many of Perry's professional killers (a frequent theme in his stories) are interesting characters, even sometimes sympathetic ones, as in \\"The Butcher's Boy.\\" Not this time, though. Earl and Linda are psychopathic rednecks who train vicious attack dogs and who have to build themselves up to hate their quarry in order to get the job done. You can be evil and still interesting, but loathsome is just loathsome. More than that, Jane seems only semi-competent this time out, failing to foresee the methods the hunters will use and not really being aware of just how vulnerable her new husband is. However, once Jane and her charge head up into the rugged mountains of Glacier National Park at the beginning of the winter season, the tone of the narrative shifts somewhat and the author does a good job of building the tension and resolving the threads of the plot."},{"Title":"Shadow Woman: A Jane Whitefield Novel","review":"There is a point near the end of this book where, if anyone tries to stop you from finishing it, you'd kill them.

In the beginning of this story, Jane's heart wasn't really into helping her client disappear and my heart wasn't into reading about it. I found myself skimming pages looking for action. I found it hard to believe Jane would give up her exciting life as a guide to get married and settle down to a &quot;normal&quot; life. In the book preceding this one, I had been rooting for Jane and Carey to get together. But their romance in this story seemed flat and lackluster.

In &quot;Shadow Woman&quot; Jane takes Pete Hatcher from his casino job and Las Vegas lifestyle to safety after he feels threatened by his crooked employers. And, Jane marries Carey MacKinnon, her long time friend and lover. Jane determines that she will no longer be a guide, taking up her new role as a doctor's wife.

This time, however, her extraordinary efforts are thwarted by three very clever bad guys (well not ALL guys) who infiltrate her very private life to track her. A thrilling ending in the mountains where Jane gets to test her mettle and her Indian instincts will leave the reader breathless. Thomas Perry's novel is a must for those who like a little substance with their mystery. My only beef with the book is that Jane seems too quick to adopt a very traditional role as wife.

The book suffers from long stretches of tedium and some serious lapses in plausibility. The two villains, supposedly ultracompetent supercriminals, seem amateurishly inept at times, and the good guys' narrow escapes often owe more to luck than skill. An awful lot of time is spent on Jane's marital problems, which might have been more interesting if we could figure out why she married this guy in the first place.

I could have done with a lot less of the character's agonizing over her marital obligations and a lot more of the action and suspense that made the first novels fun to read. I will pass on any more of this series that comes my way."},{"Title":"Shadow Woman: A Jane Whitefield Novel","review":"I really enjoyed this book. It is the first one in the series that I have read. I am going to purchase the previous Whitefield books to catch up. I also Recommend Virginia Lanier's Bloodhound books. Very strong female protagonist."},{"Title":"Shadow Woman: A Jane Whitefield Novel","review":"Jane Whitefield is a refreshing new face in the world of mystery. She calls herself a guide, and Thomas Perry 'guides' us deeper into her character with every book. A must read!"},{"Title":"Shadow Woman: A Jane Whitefield Novel","review":"Shadow Woman is the third Jane Whitefield novel, coming after the brilliant Vanishing Act and it's equally good follow-up Dance for the Dead. This book isn't as good as the previous two. The beginning is electrifying (and also a very funny depiction of Las Vegas), the middle is slow and convoluted, but the ending--which redeems the book--is very suspenseful. The hired killers, Earl Bliss and Linda Thompson, are interesting villains, competent and tenacious but ultimately flawed. My biggest problem with the book--and the evolution of the series--is Jane's husband, Carey McKinnon. He's dull, and he's no help to Jane. I haven't read Perry's latest Jane Whitefield novel, but I'm hoping he dispatches with the husband. He's dragging down the whole series. Maybe Perry should unite Jane Whitefield with his fictional anti-hero, The Butcher Boy. Now that would make a slam bang thriller!"},{"Title":"The Peterkin Papers","review":"Lucretia P Hale's, The Peterkin Papers is as wonderful today as I'm sure it was in 1880, when it was originally published. Meet the Peterkins, a nineteenth century family, totally lacking in common sense and enjoy their troubles and adventures as they muddle through life's challenges. For example, what do the Peterkins do when their daughter, Eliza Elizabeth's piano is delivered and set in front of the living room window backwards. They solve this problem by simply opening the window and she sits outside, on the porch playing and practicing. This is all fine during the summer, but when fall and winter arrive, it becomes too cold for her to sit out, even in her winter coat. Enter the lady from Philadelphia...she's so wise that she always has a quick solution to these tough Peterkin problems. &quot;But why don't you turn the piano 'round?&quot; And the Peterkins are always amazed that they didn't think of that. As Mrs Peterkins says, &quot;What shall we do when the lady, from Philadelphia goes home again?&quot; This is a delightful book of short chapters, each detailing a glich in the Peterkin's lives, that will charm and amuse your family, as it has families for many generations. The Peterkin Papers is an American classic and the perfect read-aloud book the whole family can share together."},{"Title":"The Peterkin Papers","review":"The basic Peterkin formula: the Peterkins are stupid, yetlogical. They are completely devoid of common sense. Theyget into complicated situations and try to work their way out by adding complexity. Eventually they consult the wise old lady from Philadelphia, who always has a sensible, commonplace, wise, BORING answer. The stories are also an unforgettable picture of daily life in what seems to be a suburb of Boston in the early nineteenth century, almost an Eastern version of &quot;Little House on the Prairie.&quot; And somehow there is an impression of a _slightly_ dysfunctional family that manages to muddle through, through with warmth, affection, and mutual tolerance. Stories are just the right length for reading aloud. Anyone eight years old or older will appreciate the humor."},{"Title":"The Peterkin Papers","review":"Ask the lady from Philadelphia -- a classic line -- one that is often quoted -- the book has been read by five generations in my family -- it is just as relevent today as when written"},{"Title":"The Peterkin Papers","review":"Quite the reverse. They just don't have a lick of common sense among them. If there is a simple solution to a problem and a complicated one, the simple solution simply won't occur to them. Their minds just don't work the way ordinary people's do. Imagine an entire family with varying degrees of Asperger's Syndrome.And the poor Old Lady from Philadelphia! I'm sure she sometimes just wants to take a baseball bat and knock some common sense into them.This is a wonderful book to read aloud to children. If reading to a group, one should stop just before the family goes to see the Old Lady and ask what you think she will suggest. Nine out of ten times, the children will come up with the same solution as the Old Lady; if not exactly the same one, then something equally sensible."},{"Title":"Ben Shahn's New York: The Photography of Modern Times","review":"Wonderful images and excellent catalogue of Ben Shahn's 1930s photographs.Exhibition currently on display at the Phillips Collection in Washington DC."},{"Title":"More Than the Sum of His Parts (Short Story Paperback 14)","review":"This story starts off as a sci-fi tale of reconstructing a man who was almost killed, and turns into a horrific ending.

Her mother doesn't approve though at all, so Fifi marries Dan in secret, then tells her parents after the fact. They then move on to London, where they a place in the slums on Dale Street. One of the first horrible neighbors they meet there are the Muckles. They are nothing but terrible trash, and have several kids unfortunately that are being mistreated. The saddest one is Angela, the youngest child, (about 6 years old), that is being abused both physically and sexually. Fifi keeps her eye out for the child, feeling sorry for her, and trying to act out of concern. Dan threatens Alfie, the daddy once when he sees him mistreating Angela, and hopes it won't happen again-but of course it does.One day Angela doesn't go with the rest of the family and seems to be left behind in the house alone. Fifi thought this was strange, so being the overly-curious person she was, she finds a way to let herself into the Muckle's home. Once in, she finds deplorable living conditions that would make anyone very sick. And after going into the bedroon, finds little Angela dead-after being seriously raped and laying there naked. Someone had covered her with a clean sheet-which was unusual to see in such a dirty mess. So she proceeds of course to call the police, and after this event, life goes steadily downhill. Fifi is questioned of course, the Muckle's are thrown in jail after getting home that night, and all the other neighbors questioned as well by the police. Fifi is left with a terrible memory, and can't shake it, and she and Dan's marriage begins to fall apart over her state of depression.The police never find the answers the really need for a long time-that is not until Fifi is kidnapped one day and held hostage in a barn with a cage enclosure where she can't get out. A little bit later, her neighbor, Yvette is thrown in with her. They are not found until Dan gets to the bottom of the man seen in a jaguar and his identity-of whom was a buddy of the Muckles. He barely reaches Fifi in time, but Yvette isn't so lucky. After this point in the story, (near the ending), everything comes together.Fifi and her parents get back together. They wake up to what a great guy Dan really is, and mother and daughter finally begin to mend fences."},{"Title":"Encyclopedia of the Sea","review":"His previous work shows that Richard Ellis is certainly a man of artistic talent with a broad interest in all things aquatic. With Encyclopedia of the Sea he has tried to bring together as much information as he can about the ocean. Everyone should know that this can't be done in one book, especially of this size. I don't think that this was a serious attempt to produce the master treatise on the ocean. If that is what your looking for look elsewhere (it doesn't exist but good luck).However, this book is good! Hard to put down even. I have curled up with it a few times randomly going from page to page appreciating the entries chosen and, as always, Ellis' illustrations. You can go from a description of a pirate vessel to a definition of a group of fishes. This book might have the most eclectic batch of information ever gathered in one binding. It should truly be a joy to any person who has a bit of the romantic in their own quest for information.

When Gaby was fifteen and shaken by tragedy, Bowie's parents had taken her in; yet even on their sprawling Arizona ranch, she had sensed his simmering resentment. Now, a successful journalist, she could hold her own with any man--professionally. And the dark shadows of her past seemed far behind her. Then Bowie came back into her life: handsome, rich, and threateningly sexy. He said he needed her help to save the ranch. Reluctantly, Gaby agreed to retun, never dreaming Bowie would be there too. And when he pinned her up against the rough wood of a stable wall, his lips hard and demanding upon hers, she never dreamed his touch would awaken a hunger she couldn't deny. Suddenly, for the first time in her life, she wanted more from a man. But &quot;more&quot; meant that Bowie might find out about the little girl she once was. And Gaby didn't dare risk that. Not for anything."},{"Title":"Fire Brand (Lovestruck)","review":"I have read this book at least 10 times since I originally purchased it in 1989.

This book had a very fast moving and in depth storyline. But most interesting of all was the similarities between many different religions of ancient Earth. i.e. A Buddhist sect that has a belief in a Valhalla like place. If you are an aspiring theologist, this is a must read for those reasons alone. If you are anyone else, read it for the story. I loved this book, I can almost guarantee you will too."},{"Title":"Silk Roads and Shadows","review":"Given the title, the natural question for fans of Silk Road history and geography will be whether the book has anything to offer for their tastes. Regrettably the answer must be mostly in the negative. Although the author seems to have made some attempts at research, the results seem rather cursory as there is relative little historical and geographical information and some of it incorrect, even beyond the errors admitted in the introductory note. No year or name of the the Chinese emperor is ever given, but it is probably intended to be set in the reign of Tang emperor Wuzong (ruled 840-6), one of the late rulers of the dynasty. But as by this time silk had long since left China for places like Khotan and points east, the premise of traveling all the way to Chang An to acquire silkworks makes little sense, as does the idea that the worms were kept only in the palace. It is doubtful that worms could be transported as described either -- eggs would be a much more likely proposition. But these are minor matters for the historical reader when constantly the caravan party is being attacked by magical, fantastical beings with no basis in reality. It could have been quite interesting if the tale was a mostly historical one with occasional magic to move the plot along, but here clearly the author's interest is almost totally on monsters and magic. At least there is a mostly correct map of the region from Constantinople to Chang An and some of the sites visited along the way are described with a bit of detail."},{"Title":"Silk Roads and Shadows","review":"Unreadable.

They are not straight novels. They are not 300-400 pages long. In fact, some adventures can last about 3 or 4 pages! They are not filled with big words, and they are not boring. In fact, they're aimed at pure action and adventure, yet they're not violent at all. There's little plot and character building, which is something that might turn a younger reader off.Plus, as small as each book is, they contain numerous different stories.

Their daughter, Anna, is a delightful girl, in the mold of her strong-willed, independent mother. &quot;Gates of Horn and Ivory&quot; will keep you involved as the town and the family grow over the years.

Most of the later Russian writers and thinkers used to keep this Gogol's work in mind, and the themes described in it are still actively disputed. The place of Russia in the family of nations, the mission of Eastern Orthodox Christianity, the tasks of Russian spiritual and political leaders are questions that remain open 155 years after the Gogol finished his &quot;Selected Passages from Correspondence&quot;.Built, as the title says, in a form of a series of letters, it is a collection of essays on topics from &quot;What is a governor's wife &quot; to &quot;On Odissey being translated by [poet V.A.] Zhukovski.&quot; The main idesa is-- moral improvement of Russian elite (&quot;...be humble, use to wear same dress to three, four, five parties and balls!&quot; or &quot;... Don't punch the peasant in the face, have {...} some imaginative curses for him instead&quot;), following the Christian principles and love to their motherland-- Russia.It seems the great classic wrote all that in vain, as I can guess living in the Russian protectorate-- Republic of Belarus, and visiting Russia often. Nevertheless, this work retrospectively sums up the searchings and custings of Russian and Russian-influenced intelligentsia for the last century and a half."},{"Title":"Total commitment: Blondel's L'action,","review":"To say that Total Commitment is a \\"poor man's Blondel\\" is not a disparagement. S. performed a real service in providing an abridged (roughly one half the length), simplified paraphrase of Blondel's seminal work--the dissertation of 1893, L'Action. The book was a stopgap until a full translation appeared and suffices as an introduction for those who never will get at the original. S. gives the complete argument of L'Action, along with enough significant detail to make it believable, while omitting the verbiage that sometimes mars the masterpiece itself. Not that Total Commitment is easy. It is perhaps as clear as it could be, considering the difficulty of the matter; but it is still a very demanding book. There are many passages I was not able to understand, and numerous arguments which, in their present telescoped form at least, failed to convince me. My over-all impression, however, is that Blondel has a good program. If, as Plato and Aristotle supposed, philosophy is always on the way to becoming politics--and if the thinker must ultimately \\"return to the cave,\\" bringing his speculation to bear on the real problems of man in society--then Blondel is a timely philosopher.S. himself summarizes the argument in a way that is hard to improve: \\"Blondel had tried to show that the internal dynamism of the will, when followed to the limit, uncovers various levels of life and values for which men live and die: sensation, science, consciousness, freedom, society, metaphysics, the idea of God, religious expectancy, the supernatural. Then, having developed an ordered series of means for the expansion of the will, he maintained that these ideal conditions, revealed to the understanding by the phenomenological method, must be freely embraced in their totality as a system of ends. We are faced with the metaphysical option: whether to submit our will and action to an order that stands before us as a heteronomous imperative, or whether to refuse and try to make phenomena suffice. Submission ... requires that the ideal and conceptual exigencies of the system be given concrete expression in our action\\" (p. 18). In the \\"ordered series\\" from sensation to the supernatural, Blondel tries to show that at each level there is an irreducible leftover which forces the phenomenological analysis to move to a next higher level--and so on up the scale. Thus, empirical science cannot account for the continuity and discreteness in its objects without a secret appeal to a subject; the subject cannot be understood apart from freedom; etc. Ontology is bracketed during this progression, arising only in the second (and more difficult) half of the book with the questions of objectivity, knowing and being, and the \\"bond\\" of action.Before Blondel can climb the phenomenological ladder, however, he first has to show that there really is a problem of action: that man must ask what he is to do with his life, whether life has a meaning, and whether his acts make any difference. The first two chapters, accordingly, dispose of negative answers to this problem, especially nihilism. Blondel did well to put his finger on nihilism--one would suppose him to be either a prophet or a reader of Dostoevsky. His answer to nihilism may be too hurried, but there is no doubt that he struck on the most agonizing problem of twentieth-century man. In two phases of the phenomenological ascent called \\"from consciousness to voluntary operation\\" and \\"from intentional effort to the first exterior expansion of action\\" there is a valuable study of freedom. Freedom is preceded and conditioned by determinisms in man's physiology and unconscious. At the other end, it unleashes determinisms into the world, an imperishable chain of external events for which one is responsible. Act we must, however, even with imperfect foresight, and at the risk of being compromised.In his appraisal of the determinisms and ambiguities that surround the irreducible primacy of freedom, Blondel has achieved a realistic and attractive view. What is lacking--as it so often is in the introspective French tradition which Blondel represents--is a feel for the historical and sociological dimension of man. A final warning: Blondel is a dialectician. The nondialectical reader will frequently be at a loss to see why one thing is always \\"both\\" it-self \\"and\\" its other, and why a train of thought that seems to point one way invariably ends up, like an ice-hockey puck, going \\"precisely\\" in the other. Aptly is Blondel called \\"the Catholic Hegel.\\""},{"Title":"Total commitment: Blondel's L'action,","review":"To say that Total Commitment is a \\"poor man's Blondel\\" is not a disparagement. S. performed a real service in providing an abridged (roughly one half the length), simplified paraphrase of Blondel's seminal work--the dissertation of 1893, L'Action. The book was a stopgap until a full translation appeared and suffices as an introduction for those who never will get at the original. S. gives the complete argument of L'Action, along with enough significant detail to make it believable, while omitting the verbiage that sometimes mars the masterpiece itself. Not that Total Commitment is easy. It is perhaps as clear as it could be, considering the difficulty of the matter; but it is still a very demanding book. There are many passages I was not able to understand, and numerous arguments which, in their present telescoped form at least, failed to convince me. My over-all impression, however, is that Blondel has a good program. If, as Plato and Aristotle supposed, philosophy is always on the way to becoming politics--and if the thinker must ultimately \\"return to the cave,\\" bringing his speculation to bear on the real problems of man in society--then Blondel is a timely philosopher.S. himself summarizes the argument in a way that is hard to improve: \\"Blondel had tried to show that the internal dynamism of the will, when followed to the limit, uncovers various levels of life and values for which men live and die: sensation, science, consciousness, freedom, society, metaphysics, the idea of God, religious expectancy, the supernatural.

The author discusses the history of the subject as well as giving a thorough discussion of modern developments. In addition, many references are given for readers who want to investigate the subject in more detail. The philosophy of law has become even more important in recent years due to the social tensions surrounding the Supreme Court of the United States as well as the difficult legal issues involved in nation building.The following questions, among many others, arose for this reviewer when reading the book, with some of them being answered in the book and some not:1. What is the difference, if any, between standards and rules?2. What is the difference, if any, between substantive justice and formal justice?3. Does the granting of broad discretionary powers to legal officials encourage abuse?4. When a legal rule ages, does it become less or more applicable to the activities it is supposed to refer to, i.e. will judges become more tempted to declare exceptions and extensions to it?5. How important is the use of formal logic in legal deliberations?6. Can most, or even all, legal argumentation/deliberation be given an algorithmic or formulaic definition?7. Can statutes or constitutions, being forms of communication, be verified in the same way as scientific hypotheses can?8. Does good legal judgment consist of caution, detachment, imagination, and common sense or must these be supplemented by other activities or modes of cognition?9. Is law an autonomous discipline, with the designation \\"autonomous\\" given its usual intuitive meaning?10. Can the complexity of legal deliberations/reasoning of a judge be modeled successfully using a language or framework that is clearly not being used by that judge?11. Is the \\"test of time\\" a legitimate criterion for accepting certain legal practices?12. What is the role of metaphors in legal reasoning?13. What is the role of defeasible reasoning in legal deliberation/argumentation?14. Are legal deliberations always inconclusive?15. Is there any need, from the standpoint of rational legal deliberations, for the \\"trappings of the judicial process,\\" i.e. the elaborate courtrooms with elevated benches and compelled etiquette on the part of the observers and litigants?16. Is criminal law dependent on the notion of free will?17. Assuming that certainty is unattainable in most legal deliberations, what is the role of probability theory in these deliberations?18. Is the interpretation of legal texts deductive, and if not, what does it mean to interpret a legal text?19. What is the difference between common law and statutory law?20. Does agreement on the meaning of legal texts depend ultimately on the use of force?21. How does one characterize an activist judge from a non-activist one?22. When a legal text or document is examined, is it always important to acknowledged the intent of the individual(s) who wrote it?23. Can interpretations of legal documents ever be politically neutral?24. Can a legal system be constructed that would be free of errors?25. How influential has feminist thought been in the philosophy of law in the last few decades?26. What is the nature of \\"prudentialism\\" that is advocated by the author of the book?"},{"Title":"The Problems of Jurisprudence","review":"What is law? How exactly do judges reason out it's kinks? Does it operate on presumtions of behaviourism or free-will? Why aren't lawyers or judges puzzled by these quandries? Posner seeks answers and ends up in a not-so-comforting place.This book starts small and ends big. From epistemology (how we gain legal knowledge) through ontology up through his concluding 'Pragmatist Manifesto' the book is quite philosophical and this may be offputting to some in the legal profession. As usual though, Posner tackles his subjects in a clear, fast-paced and exciting way. The task that Posner sets for himself is to forge a place in legal theory (or lack of?) between two radical extremes: On one hand, there is the view that law is a completely isolated profession and legal reasoning is completely internal to it. The other sees law as a clever guise for politics- it's 'methods' being a subterfuge for the judge to justify her political views.Through pragmatism, Posner sees both theories as gross exageration- the first, falsley denying law's susceptibility to outside non-legal techniques and the second's refusal to acknowledge the judiciary's independence from the legislature.As Posner acknowledges in the intro, Posner's view here is middle of the road and to many, it will be boring. He doesn't take sides, rather he creates a side: that of legal pragmatism. No matter what your persuasion philosophtical, political or jurisprudential persuasion, there's nothing like a little Posner to get you thinking!!"},{"Title":"Managerial Economics","review":"I used this book for the Managerial Economics course at Universidad Sim&oacute;n Bol&iacute;var.

Speech Act Theory; 2. Interactional Sociolingusitics; 3. The Ethnography of Communication; 4. Pragmatics; 5. Conversation Analysis; 6.

Beginning with &quot;Morning Songs,&quot; the poems flow naturally across the pages as a Caribbean day unfolds. Before day's end, the girl is greeted by the &quot;ebony man selling mangoes and papaws in the street,&quot; has school escapades, and sees &quot;Mama gone to market with the figs upon her head.&quot; The pleasures and secrets of the island are revealed throughout, as in &quot;The Palet Man&quot; (Caribbean ice-cream man), and &quot;Steel Drum,&quot; which beckons readers to hear the drum's &quot;pom da de de de dom pom.&quot; Text-enhancing, full-page illustrations, bursting with Caribbean life, leave lingering images behind. Glorious colors depict everything from the multi-hued blue water where Brother swims &quot;till he touch high heaven on a wave,&quot; to the all too real &quot;Jumbi Man&quot; (Caribbean boogie-man) with his &quot;monkey face.&quot; Joseph craftily uses metaphors to construct new images from the familiar. In &quot;Pullin' Seine,&quot; the evening ritual of fishermen pulling nets in from the sea, Joseph skillfully places the text, creating an image of the net's heaving and hawing, as fishermen begin, struggle, and successfully pull their net in.

Why to study more complicated types of equations?&quot;, or &quot;I have enough trouble with differential equations; please don't tell me there's something else&quot;, and even &quot;Why to study integral equations? What are they good for?&quot;.The subject of integral equations is a natural part of analysis which serves to connect several related topics (complex analysis, harmonic analysis, potential theory, differential equations,...) and to use all the power thus gained to solve important boundary value problems of mathematics and physics.Everyone interested in mathematical physics should get a thorough training in integral equations, and this book is the right place to start. Using a modern and comprehensive language, the author exposes the most important highlights of the theory, up to the numerical aspect, and puts the reader in the track to current research.The contents of the book are: Normed spaces, bounded and compact operators, the Riesz theory, dual systems and Fredholm theory, regularizations in dual systems, potential theory, singular integral equations, Sobolev spaces, the heat equation, operator approximations, degenerate kernel approximation, quadrature methods, projection methods, iterative solution and stability, equations of the first kind, Tikhonov regularization, regularization by discretization, inverse scattering theory.Includes motivation for each topic, excercises for each chapter, and extensive references.

Francois Delsarte coached actors and developed a unique philosophy to help actors and public speakers with oratory. His philosophy inspired and changed the way actors were trained.Delsarte's work was at its peak from around 1839-59, with many immitators and spin-offs. Delsarte did not publish a book, however, many books were written by his students about his philosophy and techniques, and many these books are now in the public domain (some are available online from free library archives). Every Little Movement has a bibliography listing many of these books, with Ted Shawn's reviews of which books are most worth reading and were written by credible sources.One of my favorite belly dance instructors recommended Every Little Movement (published in 1954 and reprinted in 1974, this book is currently out of print). I found out later that some of the great American belly dancers studied Delsarte's techniques, using them effectively to enhance their dance performances and train students.This is a small paperback book, the 1974 reprint is 127 pages. It is not the easiest book to read (long paragraphs), but it is appropriate for college-educated readers and the illustrations are interesting. This is not a book I'd recommend to someone for a little light reading, but rather a book for someone seriously interested in Delsarte's philosophy or an academian in the field of dance or acting. If you want to buy this book, check various used book dealers to find a competitive price, since it's a rare book it can be expensive. I was able to find the 1974 Dance Horizons, Inc. reprint at a reasonable price, earlier editions were published in 1954 and 1963.

Schaefer has once again succeeded in giving the genealogical world a book that should be in everyone's library. As the title says, it covers all of the colonial Americas, North, Central and South. Not only does it provide information for each colony or nation, but it also gives resources available in the various European countries which colonized and changed the face of the Western Hemisphere. It's coverage is so complete that only a nation or area-specific book may contain more information. This book will go down in the annals of genealogical scholarship as one of the best works ever produced, if not the best!"},{"Title":"Genealogical Encyclopedia of the Colonial Americas: A Complete Digest of the Records of All the Countries of the Western Hemisphere","review":"Until the publication of this remarkable new work, no single source could be used to identify and locate the records of the various countries of the Western Hemisphere. Given the extent and diversity of the records, this is hardly surprising; and yet the creation of such a source is precisely the task Christina Schaefer set herself. The immense body of records of the colonial period in the Western Hemisphere presents a serious challenge to the researcher--in some cases even a stumbling block--and therefore in this work Mrs. Schaefer has undertaken a systematic examination of the records to show the researcher where to find the most important genealogical records of the period and how to access them, all within the framework of a single encyclopedic volume.Equally important, she has defined the various classes of records in each country, identified as many of them as is practicable in a book of this size, provided historical background and brief sketches of the records themselves, added a description of the principal holdings of the major repositories of each country, and has interwoven selected reading lists throughout. The reader will appreciate, of course, that the subject matter is vast, covering the colonial records of all the Americas, from Latin America to the Caribbean, from the original Thirteen Colonies to Canada and New France, so of necessity the author has been at pains to be as comprehensive as possible. In the end, she has put together a magnificent reference work, one that will guide all researchers, beginners and professionals alike, to the most direct and reliable route to the colonial records of the Western Hemisphere.The scope of the work covers the period of colonial history from the beginning of European colonization in the Western Hemisphere up to the time of the American Revolution, and the records described are the primary records used in genealogical research. However, the time line has been extended to provide more complete information in the following instances: U.S. states other than the Thirteen Colonies with records that begin prior to the Revolutionary War, until such time as they became part of the U.S. (possession, territory, state); Latin American countries, which did not declare their independence from Spain and Portugal until 1808 and later Canada through about 1841; Carribbean countries and dependencies to about 1810; The subject of slavery up to the abolition of the slave trade.While the best sources of information regarding an immigrant ancestor can usually be found in the country to which he immigrated, there are, nevertheless, many important records still to be found in the country of origin--records which had either remained in the mother country or had been returned to the mother country: church records, for example, emigration and trade company records, indenture agreements, military records, missionary society records, probate records and wills, provincial land grants, and tax records. Thus the last section of this book provides information regarding the location of colonial records in such countries as Denmark, England, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Portugal, Scotland, Spain, and Switzerland, and at the Library of Congress in Washington, D.C.The range of the book is so remarkable that even the most seasoned researcher will find it breathtaking. What follows is a listing of the contents of the seven distinct parts that make up the whole. From this itemization the reader can draw his own conclusions about the value of the work as an indispensable desk reference: Chronology of colonial history and dates of first colonial governors, Colonies of Latin America arranged according to mother country, Colonies of the Caribbean, The Thirteen Colonies plus Maine and Vermont, Other U.S. States with settlements prior to the Revolution, Canada, and Resources for further research, including the ocation of colonial records in such countries as Denmark, England, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Portugal, Scotland, Spain, and Switzerland, and at the Library of Congress in Washington, D.C.EDITORIAL REVIEWS\\"This extensive compilation will suggest numerous original and printed sources, leading the serious researcher to new and exciting works.\\"--AMERICAN REFERENCE BOOKS ANNUAL (2000), p. 157.\\"For Americans this is a valuable guide for Colonial research.

In the Introduction, however, he makes it crystal clear that open-book management is NOT a panacea, is NOT a substitute for TQM or reengineering or any other operational overhaul, and is NOT a single system. In essence, open-book management helps companies to create a shared environment in which everyone understands that they are competing in a marketplace, trying to make money. But for whom? Frequently, effective ownership has been limited to relatively few people. In privately-held companies, usually to a single person and/or to a family. Presumably Case agrees with Al Ehrbar (author of EVA) that the traditional concept of \\"ownership\\" must be re-defined so that everyone involved in a given enterprise assumes personal responsibility for adding value. Hence the importance of recognition of peak performance but also the importance of financial incentives. \\"What's in it for me?\\" is a quite legitimate question. Given the increasingly greater impact of globalization, the information revolution, and what Case calls \\"entrepreneuralization\\", companies must find new and better ways to answer that question. For Case, each company needs a mission, a strategy. \\"But more than anything else it needs eager, willing employees, people who have a reason to care about their employer's prosperity and who know how to help it succeed.\\"Ultimately, the measurable value of open-book principles will be determined by several factors: The extent to which a company modifies them to accommodate its own circumstances; the extent to which employees in that company (top to bottom) commit to the program, once devised; and the extent to which everyone involved shares equitably (NOT equally) in the rewards.Those who admire this book as much as I do will presumably want to read (if they have not already read) The Open-Book Field Book and The Open-Book Experience. These two books develop in much greater detail the material first introduced in Open-Book Management. Also, they provide an absolutely essential guide to deriving maximum benefit from John Case's wisdom and experience."},{"Title":"Open-Book Management: Coming Business Revolution, The","review":"What do TQM, reengineering, empowerment, teaming, and even six sigma have in common? They all implement parts of open-book management. And that's the reason they all have spotty records- they were successful when they, accidentally, incorporated enough of the rest of open-book management.The principle here is very simple- instead of your company or division relying on only the handful of minds at the top of the organization to improve the company, it treats all the employees as adults with brains and encourages everyone to work for the company's benefit. This also has the effect of reducing or eliminating office politics since everyone's pulling in the same direction.How? Fortunately the process is pretty simple, though it needs to be tailored to each business. The pieces are:1. Giving employees all relevant financial information,2. Giving employees training to understand the financial information,3. Giving employees appropriate responsibility for the numbers under their control, and4. Giving employees appropriate stakes in the outcomes (through bonuses, stock, options, etc.)."},{"Title":"Open-Book Management: Coming Business Revolution, The","review":"Case shows, with many examples from open book companies, that companies' performance really takes off (or pulls out of jeopardy) when they organize to:1. Give all their financial information to all employees;2. Teach employees to understand it; and3. Give employees a financial stake in how the company performs.In summary, experience shows that employees at open book companies act like owners. Case shows exactly how to do it.Give this book to your boss!"},{"Title":"Catherine of Aragon,","review":"Mattingly sets forth in very lucid prose the amazing and seldom told story of a woman noble in character as well as birth. Catherine of Aragon, daughter of Ferdinand and Isabella of Spain, is the first wife of England's Henry VIII. Though a foreigner, to the end she is deeply loved by the English people. But that does not save her from Henry's machiavellian machinery when she fails to produce a male heir to secure the Tudor dynasty. Although she eventually loses the battle, we see a woman of lion-like courage, refusing to buckle in an age of moral compromise. Her stubborn dedication to both church and country, and her deep love for her husband, make her a spiritual example to Catholics & Protestants alike. One wonders if there is any other figure of her time who comes off half so glowing. In a word, integrity! This is the English Reformation told from Catherine's perspective-- a fascinating tale and well worth the read."},{"Title":"Catherine of Aragon,","review":"When studying the era of Tudor England, specifically Henry VIII, much concentration is placed on the king himself.

The author has provided examples of buildings by use of a well-researched text, current and historic photos, and drawings. The introductory chapters on the development of the parks (24 selected in the book) and the origins of rustic design provide a comprehensive resource for preservationists and designers. The lavishly illustrated book is thoroughly researched and comprehensive in its coverage of the many fine examples of buildings. Included are structures that range from the grand hotels at Yosemite, Yellowstone, the Gand Canyon, Glacier National Park, and lesser known lodges to National Park Service functional buildings. The book offers strong support for preservation by illustrating the wealth of cultural resources in the National Parks. Strongly recommended as a pleasure to the eye and a travelers guide to the places and buildings of the western national parks."},{"Title":"Rough Cut","review":"Rough Cut is a good \\"whodunit.

I am forever changed, never to look back at the exhausting years of making bad choices and having no peace in my life. I have been reading this book now for 5 years now, and it still astounds me to read everyday; some how every year it shows different meaning also. This book is treasure sent from heaven, its simple and basic daily guide to Gods Standards for Men and I consider it much more value than gold or diamonds. This book would be my one item I would take out of my burning home. God continues to know exactly where I am and speaks directly in to my life through book. Its absolutely the most remarkable devotional out for men and again I acknowledge it as miracle gift from God himself to men. I also feel obligated and called to do like others have said and continue to hand out this amazing book to help men fight this war against the enemy who has most men deceived, distracted, and confused. I tell the men I give the book to that I have just 1 rule for the book; Keep it in plain view, dont put it on a shelf, or put anything on top of it..... I tell them, just always promise me you will keep it in PLAIN VIEW..... I dont even care if you read it every day, read it when you can and most importantly apply it to your day.

Lovecraft (of which I am a huge aficionado), the Sand Dwellers falls woefully short of a good novel, let alone one that evokes the same feelings of cosmic dread of the master himself. The characters are poorly fleshed out, and seem like cardboard cutouts of movie characters. The hardboiled detective, the strong-willed female physician, even the irascible but yet likable hermit Clem are all characters that ultimately readers will not connect with or care about. I won't mention any potential spoilers here, but let me just say that the scenes involving the Mythos entities are among the most inane in the book. Niswander reduces the awe-inspiring, omnipotent Mythos powers that be to Batman's nemesis the Joker. They become some kind of cosmic foil to the &quot;good guys&quot;. Yes, Sand Dwellers is better than most pastiches, but not by much. If you are a true Lovecraft fan, you wil likely be disappointed by this entry into the next miliennium of the Mythos!!!"},{"Title":"The Sand Dwellers","review":"The author weaves together a very interesting psychological and occult thriller solidly rooted in its Southwestern setting. The inspiration behind the plotting comes from the so called 'Cthulhu Mythos' first developed by H. P. Lovecraft. The author deftly guides the reader between four main protagonists through whose eyes we see the story rapidly develop. The plot concerns deadly events in Arizona's Superstition Mountains where monstrous forces, responsible horrific events in the past, have now bent their attention to a secret U.S. military base capable of causing a nuclear apocalypse. The suspense builds as the author keeps us guessing whether an old hermit, a deformed child, a private investigator, and the base commander can somehow come together to avert the end of the world. The only letdown is a perfunctory incorporation of ideas and terminology from earlier mythos writers (largely Brian Lumley [ author of the various Titus Crowe and other Mythos stories] and Fritz Lieber ['To Arkham and the Stars']) about a monster hunting organization based at Lovecraft's Miskatonic University. All in all a very enjoyable read by an author well-versed in his craft and a master of the Southwestern landscape."},{"Title":"Lorenzo dei Medici and Renaissance Italy","review":"After visiting Florence many times and not being too familiar with its history, I decided to educate myself. While looking through the italian history section in a second hand book store, I came across this short biography. I figured it would be a good introduction to one of Florence's most famous men; Lorenzo de'Medici. Once reading it, I quickly noticed that it was also an account of his times. Famous people and events of fifteenth century Italy are introduced in a clear and readable manner. Upon finishing the book, I had developed an interest and appreciation of the Renaissance. Eventually, I went on to read many other books on the period. In all, anyone who is interested in learning a little about Renaissance Italy would be wise to pick up this book. A good book for the general reader; highly readable and informative."},{"Title":"The 761st Black Panther Tank Battalion in World War II: An Illustrated History of the First African American Armored Unit to See Combat","review":"Here is a book that reads like a screenplay waiting to happen.

During the the beginning of the war, black soldiers were serving their country not on the front lines, but in secondary roles as cooks, laundry and logistics crews, and mail handlers. Out of neccessity, African American soldiers were finally given the chance to fight, and although they fought segregated from White troops, they were at least finally given the chance to prove themselves in battle just like their white counterparts. All too often they were stigmatized as being not smart enough or unable to handle the stress of battle. Air units like the Tuskegee Airmen and Armored units like the 761st tank Battalion proved that the African American soldiers and airmen were more than formidable foes for the enemy. The \\"Black Panthers\\", fought in many major engagements across Europe, inflicting as many as 130.000 casualties against the German army. They fought with valor, and suffered a 50% casualty rate, as they punched their way to Berlin, with their M4 Sherman Tanks. In 1978, the whole unit finally received long overdue recognition, as they were awarded the presidential Citation, and Sergeant Ruben Rivers received the Medal Of Honor posthumously for valor on the battlefield. This generously illustrated pictorial history not only brings the reader to the front lines of battle, but draws a vivid picture of the stereotypical discrimination that these young men had to endure on the homefront, before they ever had a chance to fire a shot at an enemy who was threatening the entire world. I highly recommend this book to all who wish to relive the history of some brave American Tankers who gave of themselves and asked for nothing in return. I dedicate this review to the late Dorie Miller USN cook, who without training, manned a deck machine gun on a damaged ship, and destroyed two Japanese Zero's during the Day Of Infamy at Pearl Harbor Dec 7th 1941. He was the first African American of the war to be awarded the Navy Cross for valor by Chester W. Nimitz commanding Admiral USN."},{"Title":"The Lord Is My Shepherd","review":"Awesome study guide.

Until we come again to little Carolina trying to decipher the code.\\"Book,\\" unsurprisingly begins at the beginning with a first accounting of expressing thoughts on a medium: cave art for a hunting quest, seals for contracts, bills of sale. Then the tools of the trade are illustrated through gorgeous arrays of brushes, inks, calligraphy, materials to write upon. That great translating tool, the Rosetta Stone, is shown and an explanation given for its use.To have language that goes into a scroll or stone requires ABCs. Similar sets exist for multiple peoples with variations here and there. Precision begins in placing the letters for straightness and practicality, then evolving into works of art, so to speak. Only the best scribes and finest materials were used in creating the Koran and the same with the illuminated manuscripts of the European monks.Do you ever wonder who thought of pounding the stalks of papyrus to make the first writing material? Or who thought of taking the skin of a young sheep, scraping off flesh and hair to create parchment. Do you know it took one sheep to make one sheet of parchment and an entire flock to make a book? In China someone thought to use mulberry bark and bamboo, in Europe rags were used to make paper.The second half of the book shows the development of the primitive printing press, then all the rapid advancements and more ways devoted to making books beautiful. Think of all the new branches of human invention that words bring: inks, nibs, vocabulary, handwriting, children's books, typewriters, libraries. It is all so amazing what man can do to communicate not only thoughts, but even setting those thoughts in their own houses of beauty--books. Perhaps that is why we want leather-bound classics--to show we value what is inside.And there's little Carolina, so anxious to take her place in the procession."},{"Title":"Book (Dorling Kindersley Eyewitness Books)","review":"\\"One of the most famous libraries of the ancient world was at Alexandria in Egypt.

You will notice that Amazon says that it is in English. In fact, the text is in Arabic. I need to get my Arabic to a level useful for scholarly reading, so I'm keeping the book. However, if your goal is to get a grammar of Syriac written in English, try Thackston,Introduction to Syriac: An Elementary Grammar With Readings from Syriac Literature(for the introductory level) or Noldeke,Compendious Syriac Grammar(for a reference grammar).By the way, I was not going to rate this item at all, since I cannot yet read and evaluate the text. However, Amazon will not let me publish this review without rating the book, so I have picked three stars just to have something in the slot.P.S.

Her descriptions are so mellowed that I felt confused and checked myself over and again to see if I understood correctly and something bad really did happen.This is a story of one street and its inhabitants, but could have easily been any other street in any suburb. In fact, Shirley Jackson herself said that the book was written, at least partly, to get back at her parents, so some of it has to be a life she knew. I believe I am right to guess that the character of Harriet Merriam, a girl in her adolescent years, who is fat and not pretty, has many \\"bits and pieces\\" of Shirley Jackson herself, especially in the first pages where Harriet's mother goes through her letters. This act, which according to biographers happened to Shirley herself, is mentioned in \\"Hangsaman\\" another of Jackson's first books.The story takes time getting into, the reason being that there are so many (around 20) characters and it takes time to differentiate between them. There is actually no character that is really \\"loveable\\" - if someone is described as a successful child or adult, then he has other faults. I guess this is exactly like real life where no one is perfect but it is so different from other literary works where even if a hero is imperfect you can have some sympathy towards several characters. Here the reader's sympathy does not exist although some people are more detestable then others. The merciless description of the characters even caused me some uneasiness at first. You can see down to the person's essence - as if you look at his soul with a magnifying glass and this intimate viewing can be quite uncomfortable.The horrors of this story can mainly be described as the inability of accepting anyone who is different: Jews, Chinese, retarded people. Shirley Jackson gives us a variety of outsiders. The horrors are also the powers of parents, narrow and limited in their world perception to forever change or shape their children world and not for the best. This issue is not new; however has a striking and horrifying appearance in this book.This is a powerful chilling book which, once you get into it (this takes time), cannot be put down. Shirley Jackson has a great knowledge of human nature which is again apparent in this bookI do wish I had some people around me I could discuss this book with. I was even disappointed to find only one review of this book as I am really interested in hearing how other people have understood or \\"felt\\" this book. I have studied Shirley Jackson's famous short story \\"the Lottery\\" at the university and am longing to analyze this book in the same way....I feel there is so much more to this book then what I was able to grasp and so many other nuances connected to the symbolism of the new road, the different family lives portrayed and the relationship and similarities between woman to woman, mother - daughter, father - son relationships to relationships between the kids themselves. I have to add that some of the elements of \\"the Lottery\\" are apparent here. What I mean is the seemingly peaceful, lovely atmosphere and the inner turbulence which becomes apparent through the end, when a victim who was introduced and chosen before is pointed out.This is a masterpiece I highly recommend."},{"Title":"The Road Through the Wall","review":"Although The Road Through the Wall was her first published novel, it is vintage Shirley Jackson. No one ever viewed and/or described human beings in the way Jackson did. Not surprisingly, this novel is terribly maudlin and disturbing. It is also very complex, and I'm not sure I would perfectly understand it had I read it over and over again. There are no heroes in these pages and only one innocent character. The premise of the story is fairly simple: Jackson paints a portrait of a well-to-do middle class neighborhood, shining her blinding light of truth on everyone. The portrait is not a pretty one. A wall separates the community from the well-to-do section of town, a section most of the men and women hope to eventually move to; in the meantime, they are terribly snobbish to those around them--quietly and secretly or brazenly and openly depending on how poor or ill-bred the inferior citizens are seen to be. Eventually, a section of the wall is removed in order to make way for a new road, a road that will expose their isolated community to the world and basically ruin their neighborhood, community, and lives. Well before the road is built, terrible tragedy does indeed strike at the heart of the community. I was quite shocked by the turn of events toward the end.Some of Jackson's plot points really make little sense to me. While it often seems that Jackson intends to introduce such confusing elements into her fiction, I find it very likely that I am just not understanding the immense subtleties and hidden clues of a masterful writer. This novel is especially hard to comprehend. The cast of characters is quite large, consisting of a number of families. Jackson constantly moves back and forth between the men, women, and children, which makes it hard to really &quot;know&quot; each character. The task of keeping track of who is who is made even more difficult by the fact that many of the girls' names all start with H and that two of the boys have the same initials. There came a point when I just had to stop flipping back through the story trying to exactly remember each character in turn. Perhaps it was a deliberate tactic by Jackson to indicate that all of the characters are basically the same. One family surprisingly moves away right in the middle of the book, much to my surprise, and the family that moves into their rental home seems far less important that the book's back cover led me to expect. The reader should take nothing for granted when reading Shirley Jackson.All in all, this is a wonderful if idiosyncratic read. The plot is amazingly complex for an author's first published novel. I wish I could talk about the ending, if for no other reason than to pose the questions I have about it. Once you permit yourself to enter Shirley Jackson mode, you may well be lured into a level of comfort, expecting the novel to simply end without any climax or conclusion. I can pretty much assure you that the conclusion is one you will not soon forget."},{"Title":"The Road Through the Wall","review":"More of a character study than a plot-driven novel, \\"The Road Through The Wall\\" is a haunting look at one seemingly perfect subdivision and its residents. It was the first novel Shirley Jackson published, and it is endowed entirely with her unique voice and vision. Jackson is a master at examining the ugliness and evil that lies underneath the thin veneers of propriety and expectations.The story is set on Pepper Street, a fairly well-to-do subdivision on the outskirts of a wealthier one. The block is cordoned off by a tall brick wall that keeps the residents separate from their wealthier neighbors. For some characters, like the Desmonds, Pepper Street is a resting place before they move on to bigger and better places; while for other characters, it is an acknowledgement of what they have achieved. And for some characters, the limits of Pepper Street are as limiting as the walls of a prison. The narrative is told through various eyes, young and old, as readers follow the residents' lives during one summer that ends in startling and unexpected tragedy.\\"The Road Through The Wall\\" is a quick-paced examination of the veils people hide behind. While almost all the residents would like others to see them at their best, their worst is revealed through their gossip and hypocritical treatment of their neighbors. Nobody is what they present themselves to be, and Jackson drops plenty of hints to the backgrounds of every character, but leaves the reader to piece these hints together. Jackson wrote with an intensity that has seldom been duplicated, crafting characters that draw readers in immediately, leaving the reader to wonder what becomes of them as they exit the story. The reader almost feels as if they were driving by Pepper Street and watching the story unfold, not quite catching all the background pieces of the puzzle, learning only part of the story.The abrupt ending to the novel is disturbing and somewhat reminiscent of Jackson's most famous short story, \\"The Lottery\\". It leaves the reader wishing for more, with a desire to follow these characters further on into their lives as Pepper Street changes beyond their control. Yet it is all of these elements that are left unexamined and unexplained that make \\"The Road Through The Wall\\" such an intriguing and unforgettable novel."},{"Title":"The Road Through the Wall","review":"\\"Road Through the Wall\\" is Shirley Jackson's first novel, and as first novels go it has surprisingly good qualities. The prose and characterizations are uniformly excellent. By stealth she decomposes the boredom, loneliness, and suffocating nature of American suburban life. No, this doesn't contain any of the gothic horror goodies found in her later works. And the ending seems a bit disjointed from the overall story. Yet written over fifty years ago, \\"Road Through the Wall\\" seems anything but dated.For a bit more about the story, it is actually a pastiche of daily events surrounding one neighborhood ... specifically one street. The dialogue and behavior of the children are realistically cruel. The parents are portrayed as being status seekers and gossip-mongers. Their insular world is shattered, symbolically and literally, when a new road is built which barrels through their enclave.Bottom line: a subtle and deceptively intricate novel. Recommended."},{"Title":"The Road Through the Wall","review":"I think my review will be appreciated the most by readers of Shirley Jacksons other works. First, the inside flap and the back cover are very misleading (although the inside flap does give a hint of what's to come, it makes it sound like it is something that happens early on). Both the inside flap and back cover also suggest that the book is somehow about the supernatural; it is NOT. This is summer vacation in suburbia with all it's dramas and tribulations; its ups and downs and percolating gossip. There's also an unusually large number of characters in what is only a 220 page book (I counted 35); mostly families on Pepper Street including parents and kids. I could relate to this book because even though it takes place in the 1930's I could translate that into the time of my childhood; a time without cell phones, PC's and Macs, MP3 players, satellite radio, and plasma TVs. It really did remind me of my time growing up and the summer vacations I had. Only this book adds a huge helping of tragedy. Overall I enjoyed it and I was a little surprised at the ending (which I think will seem familar to you if you've read two of Ms. Jackson's most famous stories). I have to recommend it, even though if your'e looking for something a little more supernatural or scary by Shirley Jackson, read The Haunting of Hill House, The Lottery, or Come Along With Me."},{"Title":"The Road Through the Wall","review":"I enjoyed The Road Through the Wall it for it's compelling writing, just as I always enjoy Jackson's work, but as with about fifty percent of her stories and novels, I reach the end of the story convinced that I missed something that would have made the story much more significant. This book mostly paints a bleak picture of suburbia which was rather difficult for me to follow as it had a multitude of characters with generic names that all seemed similar to me. By the end of the book, I was convinced that the characters were intentionally keeping me in the dark, and that they were switching generic nametags behind my back to make things even more confusing. Read Jackson's horror or anecdotal humor instead."},{"Title":"Tales of the Alhambra","review":"One of my favorite historical travel books for Spain, especially if you are visiting Granada.

I know no matter what you do you can never lock love away because of its power and its vast estate one would have to know it is impossible.

Thank you."},{"Title":"Tales of the Alhambra","review":"&quot;Tales of the Alhambra&quot; was penned by American author Washington Irving (&quot;Rip Van Winkle,&quot; &quot;Sleepy Hollow&quot;) during a stay at the legendary Alhambra in Granada, Spain. I bought this book after my visit to the Alhambra, and found it to be a fantastic companion to what I had seen and experienced.The Alhambra (and Generalife) is a combination fort/palace/gardens dating from the 13th century, filled with fantastic Arabic architecture (ornate plasterwork, ceramic tiles, sculpted marble fountains and archways), and lots of room for imagining the days of its former greatness, which Irving brings to life most memorably. The book is illustrated with charming and detailed watercolour engravings dating from the same period when the book was written.Irving seamlessly winds legend, history, and a Spanish travelogue of sorts together, and even though the book is over 170 years old, it seems as if it was written yesterday. There are tales of princes, genies, lost and found loves, enchanted treasures, battles, hellish headless horses (does the inspiration seem familiar?), and commentary on the Spanish landscape and nature of the Spaniards that he lives with. Full of bewitching music, the smell of roses and exotic perfumes, firey sunsets, and the ghosts of the past, the book is a sensory treat as well. If you plan on visiting the Alhambra, read this first--it will definitely enhance your experience. If you've already visited, this makes a priceless souvenir, bringing to life once more the stately halls and fragrant gardens."},{"Title":"Tales of the Alhambra","review":"I visited Spain in Nov 2002 and was absolutely enchanted by the Nasrid Alhambra palace in Granada. Built in the foothills of the Sierra Nevada mountains, it casts a watchful eye over the inhabitants of the city below.From the exterior, palace is surrounded by an imposing fort structure built of reddish brown stone - clearly meant to give the vision of martial strength to the outsiders. At night from the Albaycin (Old Arab Quarter), the palace is hauntingly beautiful-floodlights on the fort giving it a ghostly appearance. Upon entering the deceptively unassuming palace, a world of breathtakingly beautiful art and architecture slowly overwhelms you.I simply couldn't get enough of this palace and often found myself trying to absorb as much of it's ambiance as possible. I was introduced to Washington Irving's work when I had bought an audioguide at the entrance of the palace. This guide was essentially oral excerpts from his book detailing the history and legends of each room as I walked through them.Upon completing the tour, I then was compelled to buy the book. Reading it, I could see the Alhambra in front of my eyes again. In addition to that, I could imagine its former royal inhabitants as the legends of chivalry, romance and ghosts were told.Washington Irving had the opportunity to live for several months in the Alhambra palace. Back then it was a forgotten Moorish fort in a terrible state of disrepair. His style is very soft and dreamlike, thus one is drawn into his writing as he discovers the legends from the 'guardians' who have taken residence in the palace.This book was truly a delight to read, I highly recommend it to anyone wanting to learn about the Alhambra or as a memoir of one's own visit to the palace."},{"Title":"Tales of the Alhambra","review":"Washington Irving is credited with bringing the glorious history and unbelievable beauty of the Alhambra, in the city of Granada, (the last stronghold of the Moors in the South of Spain) to Western conciousness.After spending a day at the Alhambra last Summer, and passing by the closed apartments that he occupied, I decided to listen to his book while driving one hour each way to work. (any short trips won't work because all of the 'tales' are lengthy)My title says it all. If you are a student of dry history this book is not for you. Only about 20-30 minutes will satisfy your curiosity for the facts. If you enjoy legend and lore this book is it. The bulk of the book tells numerous stories of princes and princeses, kings and soldiers, common laborers such as mule drivers and water carriers, loves found and loves lost, and especially the perrenial human lust for long lost and buried treasure, etc., all told with a wonderous style and feel for southern Spain of the 13-th to 15-th centuries.The factual account of how Columbus finally came to agreement with Isabella and Ferdinand to sign the contract for the three ships, almost by chance in 1492, while the two sovereigns were outside Granada laying the final siege of the Alhambra fortress, is mind blowing. History came 'that close' to having Columbus sail three French ships instead of the Nina, the Pinta and the Santa Maria.If you want just the facts, look elsewhere. But if you are planning a trip to Granada and the Alhambra, definitely pick up this book, along with a second, more fact based, and give a read or listen. I wish I had done that before my trip. It would have given much more life and enjoyment to the place as I walked through the various rooms and towers and gardens that Irving so lovingly describes."},{"Title":"Tales of the Alhambra","review":"Washington Irving's \\"Tales of the Alhambra\\" is really two books in one. The first section chronicles Irvings 1829 visit to the crumbling Alhambra Palace in Granada, Spain. Irving was permitted to reside within the palace grounds. His beautifully detailled descriptions of the deteriorating palace and its inhabitants fit well within the romantic vision that was beginning to sweep Europe. One can only imagine Irving's influence in shaping the Orientalist craze that played out in the Nineteenth Century European art.As a young man, Washington Iriving was inspired to learn Spanish after having read Miguel Cervantes' \\"Don Quixote\\". In that work, Cervantes interjected long romantic tales into the middle of the narrative. The second half of \\"Tales of the Alhambra\\" is a collection of romantic tales inspired by the Alhambra's Moorish and Spanish past. They are charming tales clearly inspired by Miguel Cervantes.\\"Tales of the Alhambra\\" was published in 1832 and has been in continous print. This book survives because of Irving's ability to recreate a beautiful and romantic past for the ever elegant Alhambra Palace."},{"Title":"Tales of the Alhambra","review":"On returning from Spain this spring with fresh memories of The Alhambra of Grenada, I downloaded Washington Irving's work. I wish I had read it before visiting The Alhambra. In these not so dusty pages one views the political and social background of The Alhambra, and hence, all of Spain. The halls, terraces, fountains are richly discussed in this work, mixed in with the Ghostly visions and stories there associated that Irving relates. The stories alone are as fresh as modern television, rich fodder for the imagination.He also describes Spain as it was in the early 19th century, allowing the traveler to compares his own sojourn there.Well worth the reading."},{"Title":"Tales of the Alhambra","review":"Many Americans know Washington Irving as the author of \\"the Legend of Sleepy Hollow\\" and \\"Rip Van Winkle\\". Few realize that he was also a world traveler, scholarly fluent in Arabic and Spanish and something of an Hispanophile, to the say least.Irving's book is largely responsible for the widespread romantic image of Spain. It is a collection of observation, history, fairy tale, written in Irving's unique blend of romanticism and healthy skepticism. It is roughly framed by his journey to the Alhambra and his departure from it, an in between we are given a tour of the grounds and hear a few tales (including tales of Moorish ghosts on headless horses) which are roughly intertwined as in the Arabian Nights. Indeed, this little book is the 'Arabian Nights' of the west.Before visit the Alhambra read this book. If you are not planning on going, read it and you'll probably change your mind."},{"Title":"Tales of the Alhambra","review":"This wonderful book written by a well-loved American author details his travels in Spain, and more specifically in the Castle Alhambra. These tales are delightful, and seemlessly weave from fact to fiction to history to folklore. It is a true travel log, done oh so many years ago, and done with Irving's whimcical and enchanting style. The sketches give a good description of Spain and travel in the early 1800's. Older children and adolescents would probably enjoy these sketches."},{"Title":"Tales of the Alhambra","review":"Most likely you know the famous Washington Irving books. But this is left out of most school's must read lists. The Alhambra is a great gift of the Moors to Spain - they ruled there for almost 900 years.

Unusual for a gringo."},{"Title":"Tales of the Alhambra","review":"This book is out of print, our local stores couldn't get it for us.

There is a good progression to the short stories that make up the book, all of which revolve around the Alhambra. I truly enjoyed reading this one."},{"Title":"Tales of the Alhambra","review":"We returned from a visit to the Alhambra in March. The audioguide there consists largely of excerpts from Irving's book, read in a soft soothing voice. This book - and its illustrations - perfectly capture the Alhambra in Irving's time: both its tranquility in this space elevated above the city and its romantic and glorious past. The book reflects the aura of the place and Irving's captivation with its history; it is just right in size, font, and white space, a total publishing success."},{"Title":"Measurement of Joint Motion: A Guide to Goniometry","review":"I got an earlier edition of this book in Physical Therapy school and it was invaluable in teaching the finer points of goniometry.

Kilmartin, an experienced lawyer, has a visit from a Jewish refugee engineer, wanted for murder, who claims that he was framed up by the Nazis spy network in England coveting his invention. Kilmartin takes the story with a grain of salt, but...It's very early Hammond Innes novel and different from his usual adventure stories in wild nature; rather like Hitchcock suspense movie. Simple and predictable, still compelling and enjoyable."},{"Title":"The Trojan Horse","review":"'The Trojan Horse' was only Hammond Innes' second book, published way back in 1940, but already many of what would become his trademarks are apparent:* Lawyer Andrew Kilmartin is the standard Innes protagonist: the ordinary 'everyman' who through no fault of his own gets dragged deeper and deeper into a larger conspiracy.* Freya Schmidt is likewise a typical Innes tomboy-ish heroine, a capable young woman with a love of adventure and the sea.* Franz Schmidt is the mysterious, obsessive, and possibly mad character whose actions get the protagonist involved in the story.* Similarly, Sedel and Marburg are shadowy antagonists who may or may not be true villains.While lacking the epic scope and themes of his later books, \`The Trojan Horse' shows that even at this early stage Innes was a good adventure writer. Kilmartin's investigations into the disappearance of Schmidt soon find him being pursued along country roads, locked in bank vaults, running through sewers, stowing away illegally on ships, and courting Schmidt's attractive daughter Freya. The central plot revolves around a stolen engine, with World War 2 and industrial espionage providing the backdrop to the story.There is a greater emphasis on the action than in Innes' later books, but his appreciation of the environment and nature is already apparent, as is of course his love of the sea.In all, this is a very good book, and a great early example of Innes' distinctive style. I recommend starting off with one of his earlier books before tackling his later, longer work, and \`The Trojan Horse' is as good a place as any to introduce yourself this excellent adventure writer."},{"Title":"The Trojan Horse","review":"WRITTEN AT AN EARLIER PERIOD TROJAN HORSE IS ON OF HAMMOND INNES' BETTER WORKS.HE IS STILL A SUPERLATIVE STORYTELLER."},{"Title":"The Trojan Horse","review":"This book is an early novel by Hammond Innes with a tight thriller atmosphere.

He makes a deal with Ford Carson, where he agrees to marry his headstrong daughter (Fiona)for a sizable amount of money. Headstrong is not the word I would use to describe this spoiled brat. They end up marrying and as with any novel they fall in love in the end.Now I really loved Clay Martin. Being a homicide detective myself I really appreciated how the author described how personal his murder cases were to him. Especially when he told his selfish new wife, Fiona, to pound sand when she whinned about him being late for their reception party because god forbid he was interrogating a sexual preditor that had been arrested.The real problem I had with the book was Fiona. It was hard for me to believe that she had been so pampered in her life that she didn't even know how to make a bed. She threw tantrums, acted like a 7 year old and even went so far as getting herself arrested. It was very hard for me to believe, even for a jaded detective like myself, that there could be someone like this in existence. She did get better toward the end but by then I really didn't like her character that much.The author did write an excellent male character who was strong, intelligent, had a sense of humor, and who really seemed to care. I just wish that the lead female character had been better. Fiona is the reason for 3 stars but Clay is the reason I will read the book again. He is the perfect hero."},{"Title":"An Arranged Marriage (Lone Star Country Club)","review":"I usually like the arranged/fake marriage storyline in romance novels but both lead characters have to be someone I like.

There is a subplot that flows through all the Lone Star Country Club books about a kidnapping and mob activity that makes this worth reading if you are following the series, otherwise, don't bother."},{"Title":"Japanese Phoenix: The Long Road to Economic Revival","review":"Summary:The author provides excellent insights why the Japanese economy faltered. The economic miracle of the eighties did not grow much after 1989. He suggests economic reforms that would restore sustainable economic growth. But, he indicates such reforms are unlikely until Japan reforms its political system first. This means splitting the powerful LDP into two parties. This will not happen shortly. But, the building pressure for political reform as a result of the ongoing faltering economy is immense. Thus, Mr. Katz is confident it will happen.Abstract: Japan has gone from experiencing the \\"Japanese miracle\\" in the eighties to being in the economic doghouse since 1989. During the eighties, Japan economy grew at 4% per year with little inflation and unemployment. During the nineties, Japan experienced no economic growth, suffered deflation due to weak consumer demand; and. its share of World GDP and World exports shrunk. Japan sustainable growth rate has decreased from 4% in the eighties to only 1% in 2000, on its way to only 0.5% by 2010. Japan?s GDP grew by only 0.3% per annum since 1997. Why did this economic decline occurr? There are really two Japanese economies. One consists of the super efficient exporting industries, including automobiles and consumer electronics. The other consists of the much larger domestic sector which employs 80% of labor force. The domestic sector is protected from competition by an anticompetitive regulatory environment that allows price collusion and restricts all imports. This sector includes food processing, retailing, wholesaling , finance, farming, and other services. Within these domestic industries, Japan?s productivity is between 50% to 66% lower than in the U.S.During the eighties the productive exporting sector was carrying the inefficient domestic sector. But, in the nineties, the exporting sector progressively outsourced manufacturing overseas to lower its costs and remain competitive. As a result, the lagging domestic sector employing a rising percentage of the labor force caused a decline in Japanese productivity.Japan suffers many structural problems. Its companies are overleveraged, and have over invested in nonproductive investments. This has caused Japan chronic nonperforming loans (NPLs) problem. These NPLs represent a staggering 20% of GDP. The banking system generates these NPLs faster than it can charge them off. This crisis has been going on since 1989. Both the government and the banking industry have refused to make the tough decisions to resolve these NPLs. The allocation of credit is fraught with conflict of interests. Risk management is lackluster. The banking industry is the weakest among industrialized nations.Why are current monetary and fiscal stimuli not working? The Japanese central bank has maintained short term interest rates close to 0% for most of the past decade. The government has run large budget deficits (around 6% of GDP) for several years. But, despite these measures, economic growth has remained flat. The reason is industry suffers from excess capacity. As a result, loan demand is close to zero and so is the resulting economic growth.Is the U.S. likely to experience the same fate? Some believe that the U.S. economy is experiencing a decade later the same economic ills as Japan. Mr. Katz makes a convincing case that the U.S. and Japan are on different economic paths. As mentioned, Japan economy is plagued by NPLs representing 20% of GDP. Japan?s banking sector is weak. Also, its long term sustainable economic growth rate is only 1%. Meanwhile, the U.S. has no NPLs problem, as NPLs represent only 2.4% of GDP. It has a well capitalized banking system. Also, its long term sustainable growth rate remains robust at 4%. Contrary to Japan, the U.S. has the most competitive domestic markets. All sectors are fully exposed to invigorating price competition from both domestic and international competitors.What will it take for Japan to redress their situation? Mr. Katz suggests the following economic reform:1) Resolve the NPLs by making a large capital infusion into the banking system. This capital infusion would come with the implementation of tough banking regulations including: implementing better accounting disclosure and rigorous classification of bad assets. These measures would instill a sound credit culture within the banking industry.2) Cut individual income taxes to boost consumer demand.3) Boost unemployment compensation to allow for the necessary rise in unemployment resulting from the elimination of excess capacity.4) Promote forces of globalization to enhance competition within domestic economy. Deregulate domestic industries. Eliminate price collusion. This would increase the supply side efficiency and also increase real purchasing power of consumers by lowering monopolistic pricing.How likely are the above reforms to occur? Mr. Katz mentions that some of these reforms have been attempted. But, any progressive regulatory step has been associated with two steps backward. The deregulation of the financial sector in 1999 was too timid. Since 1999, there has been a rise in ?financial socialism? as government bodies mediate 45% of deposits and 35% of loans. Thus, competition within the financial sector has actually weakened since 1999.Mr. Katz indicates that political reform has to occur before successful economic reform can take place. This entails that the LDP will have to split into two parties. Japan is the only democracy that has been ruled by a single party since 1945. You need political competition before you can stimulate economic competition. Mr. Katz believe the LDP will inevitably split up because the LDP can not survive flat economic growth for another decade."},{"Title":"Japanese Phoenix: The Long Road to Economic Revival","review":"Books on the Japanese economy should follow a reasonably simple format. Having first explained the conflicting objectives of Japan's policy makers, they should then outline the constraints the policy makers face in meeting those objectives and, finally, they should discuss the monetary and fiscal options available to Japan's policy makers in trying to reach their objectives. That basic framework should serve as the scaffolding around which authors propound their various prognoses for the Japanese economy.Richard Katz, Senior Editor of The Oriental Economist Report, a monthly newsletter on Japan, takes a different approach in Japanese Phoenix: The Long Road to Economic Revival, his recently published book. Instead of approaching the Japanese economy in this systematic way, he seems to have merely gathered together several dozen of his articles from The Oriental Economist and collated them into a book. The result is a very uneven, disjointed and disappointing work that has little of substance to offer the reader.His rosary of disjointed articles put too much weight on the reforming zeal of recent prime ministers such as Junichiro Koizumi and the late Keizo Obuchi. He believes that Koizumi, like some hero in a manga comic, can single handedly turn the economy around and restore Japan's former growth rates. The reality is much more prosaic. Because Koizumi, like so many of his predecessors, is a prisoner of the outmoded structure of the Japanese economy, he is no more likely to effect fundamental change than they were.The Japanese economy is geared to exporting cars, video games, precision instruments and other high valued added products and using the trade surpluses those exports garner to pay both for its imports and to subsidize its very large sheltered sector: the farmers, distributors, construction workers and other inefficient sections of the Japanese workforce. Although Katz believes that these ailing sectors will become internationally competitive, he does not offer any compelling reasons or arguments to support his radical belief. Japan has gone from being a country with excess pools of labor to being a nation where young workers are at a premium. That being so, Japan must concentrate on high value added industries whilst also being cognizant of the considerable financial problems its graying demographics portend. Japan therefore runs the risks of concentrating on too narrow a range of exports and prematurely relaxing its immigration policies to make up its labor shortfall. Although these problems are easy to propound, they are not so easy to solve. New international markets are not easily won and a major influx of immigrants would lead to radical social upheavals, at least in the short term. Japan's political leaders, wisely enough perhaps, given the political constraints they labor under, prefer to postpone the inevitable day of reckoning.The Japanese problem is, in many ways, analogous to India's. Though we may criticize India's caste system, yet we cannot propound any way of effecting change without incurring very major short term upheavals. Japan's leader know very well what Japan's economic problems are: their dilemma lies in redressing them, not in identifying them and Katz certainly does not provide them with any useful policy insights.Contrary to what Katz may believe, Japan's problems will not be solved by whatever edicts Koizumi might pass. Rather, they will be solved by Japan's business community working in consort with the government and gradually achieving the necessary structural reforms.Because monetary policy will undoubtedly play a part in this just as it has in stimulating demand in America during the 1990s, Katz is therefore wrong to berate those who favor monetary action as a partial palliative for Japan's ills. He is also wrong to castigate the so-called revisionists, those who argue that the Japanese economic model is radically different from Western models. The reality is that every country is different from the standard text book model: the German growth model, for example, is markedly different from the British and Dutch models, which in turn have very little in common with the rent seeking Spanish type. American capitalism is very different again, simply because the United States faced a different matrix of objectives and constraints that did any of those European countries. Japan, which depends so much on exports to fund its huge protected area, marches to yet a different drum. Contrary to what Katz believes, Japan's problems are not \\"eminently solvable\\". They are as deep, as entrenched and as resistant to change as are those of India, the United States, Germany or any other country. Although Japan's political and business leaders will, in time, find partial solutions to Japan's economic woes, those solutions will not be found within the pages of this badly edited book."},{"Title":"Japanese Phoenix: The Long Road to Economic Revival","review":"The author seems very knowlegeabl on Japan, how it got to be an economic superpower and the recent decade of stagnation.

So I've pulled out some of the thematic gems that have stayed with me this entire time and served to \\"cure\\" me of my debilitating shyness.Not only was I too high minded to be bothered with idle chit chat, but I found people who participated in it banal. As you can imagine, this created the perception that I was arrogant (earnest would have been a more accurate label) which further complicated the matter. But the book showed me that small talk \\"serves an extremely important function. Without it you rarely get to the real conversation.\\" It \\"clears the way for more intimate conversation.\\" Viewed as a utilitarian tool I began to see the value in it and was then able to pursue it with understanding and it helped lead to the more substantial and meaningful conversations I longed for.The second and, I think, even more profound point the book made for me was that it was a form of selfishness to continue in my present course. The book stated it this way: \\"If you generally wait for someone else to take the initiative in a conversation you have been self-centered. It's true! You have allowed your own comfort to take precedence every other person's. You haven't been doing your fair share of the work.\\"If you think of small talk as a gift you extend to another it's easier to cultivate. \\"People who excel at small talk are experts at making others feel included, valued and comfortable.\\""},{"Title":"The Fine Art of Small Talk","review":"I think this book is helpful, but too narrow in its focus.

I was surprised to see that how many of these mistakes I keep making all the time. I am now more conscious when I make them. Ready reckoner of tips for many situations like opening conversations, ice breakers, exits lines are very handy.It is little gem that I will keep going back to again and again to continuously improve my small talk skills."},{"Title":"The Fine Art of Small Talk","review":"Small Talk is a good easy to read book that is kind of short, but very informative, and practical without all of the rambling nonsense. Its really more so directed towards business, but does include social parties, and galas."},{"Title":"The Fine Art of Small Talk","review":"This book truly changed my life. It contains tools that actually turned social contact from a dread to a delight for me. Thanks to the tools offered in this book, I am no longer clueless at conversations. I used to believe that good communication skills are inherited not learned, and I surely didn't have them. But practicing the skills taught in this book has actually turned me into a confident small talker. The book has fundamentally changed my viewpoint about social contact. I look forward to parties and social events now and get great feedback too. The book simply and clearly delivers what the author claims in the title. I recommend it to everyone: people who shy away from social events as well as natural smooth talkers."},{"Title":"The Fine Art of Small Talk","review":"I am a 21-year old male who lives in Los Angeles, and I was looking for a book that would help me get off to a good start with people I was meeting for the first time. I wanted a method for finding appropriate topics to ask questions about based on the context and situation I was in at a given time. This book did not deliver at all; among other things, it gives you a list of stock questions that don't necessarily apply to situations most people find themselves in. Does the author really expect us to approach a perfect stranger and ask them, \\"How has the Internet affected your life?\\" or \\"If you knew you were going to die tomorrow, what would be your biggest regret?\\" I don't know what kind of demographic this book was written for, but its definitely not for anyone my age."},{"Title":"The Fine Art of Small Talk","review":"I consider my self pretty well read in this genre of self-help books. The first thing I would share with anyone reading this review is that the advice offered in this book is pretty obvious and sometimes just plain bizarre. I know this has been shared in other reviews of this book, but after reading some other \\"independent\\" reviews of this book I felt compelled to tell you the honest truth about this book. The lines offered in this book on initiating conversation with strangers in social settings made me and my sister laugh while reading them. They are both awkward and bizarre at the same time. If you're looking for a good book on sharpening your social skills keep moving cause this is not the one."},{"Title":"The Fine Art of Small Talk","review":"In listening to the tapes I was thinking to myself that Debra made a lot of sense and offered some good advice. She is also pleasant to listen to, as far as a tape on small talk goes. Once you actually try to apply the tips she gives you though, it is a whole other story. I find it very akward to say things like, &quot;Really, and how did that affect you?&quot; Or, &quot;Tell me about your family.&quot; to strangers. I mean, who says that? lolThere are some little tips on information collecting that proved useful, but some of her actual &quot;conversation starters&quot; I fear I won't be using.Worth listening to for the price... maybe try to borrow it from a friend though first. :)"},{"Title":"The Fine Art of Small Talk","review":"I've have been in sales and sales training for over 12 years and am very successful at it. When someone recommended this tape to me, I thought, &quot;What could I possibly get out of small talk? I'm a sales trainer. I'm great at small talk!&quot; Now, I'm even better!Ms. Fine's ice breaker questions and topics, as well as her ideas on how to revive a dying conversation and how to avoid conversation killers were insightful and have already paid off in my interactions with my customers and prospects.For anyone who says, &quot;I don't need small talk&quot;, I encourage you to give this tape a try. I heartily endorse it!"},{"Title":"The Fine Art of Small Talk","review":"Two of the four sides of this set are extremely good. The others add information but not in the same &quot;wow, this is great stuff&quot; way. Example: Side 1, the Introduction, starts with &quot;Debra, is it ok to be shy?&quot; And her witty retort is &quot;Yes, it is very ok to be shy.&quot; Repetitious and dumb sounding. Side 4 on Listening is marred by imperfections as she intentionally confuses logcial, literal phrases with poor listening skills (&quot;Put a dot ON the letter i, NOT above it!! You weren't listening!&quot;) However, I rate this four stars because the content is easily digested and presented, the price is right, and, despite my shyness, I am seeing noticeable improvements after one week of listening to the set twice. The set is geared towards both business and personal users, and emphasizes them about equally. I particularly enjoyed learning how to make appropriate small talk at a wake, and how to avoid conversation killers."},{"Title":"The Fine Art of Small Talk","review":"This is my first audio book and second one on small talk. Though the 'tricks' Ms Fine provided is not uncommon in this field, she presented them with passion, which makes a great difference.What is more, Ms Fine does a great job to illustrate her points with vivid and helpful examples. For example, I believe many of us know that we should ask the so called 'opened ended' questions to keep converstaion going, but exactly what are open ended questions, and how one should ask them? Ms. Fine gives the answer, with vivid, to-the-point examples.Personally, I learn a lot from this audio tape, because of the use of examples, instead of just theory and high level statements."},{"Title":"The Fine Art of Small Talk","review":"I am a typical college professor---easy to speak at length (and ad nauseum) about information that is my specialty. However, students find that they learn better when they are comfortable with the professor herself--hence, the value of small talk! I learned from this book the importance of not being an FBI agent, and how NOT to make people uncomfortable! I also learned key niceties such as the importance of eye contact and a smile, even if the student was just given bad news about her grade.I also appreciated the text because I interact mostly with people who are not professors--it is important that I interact with them on the level of &quot;small talk&quot; so that they do not feel intimidated because I have a doctorate. After all, my knowledge is limited only to my field--it is very easy, though, for people to be put off by professional titles. One way to avoid this rut is through the beauty of small talk."},{"Title":"The Fine Art of Small Talk","review":"Upon finishing this book I couldn't resist being disappointed at what the book had just delivered. It's possible that it was I who had unreasonably high expectations of what the book should've taught me, but I doubt it.The author, Mrs. Debra Fine, is supposedly a super conversationalist (she calls herself that!) who promises to teach you how to become a super conversationalist yourself. She claims that she was one of those boring engineering specialists who aren't capable of talking about anything that they haven't been trained on in school or college. She used to be shy, afraid, and hesitant during conventions and hospitality receptions. So how did she change?In the beginning she tells you that there are many old tapes playing in your head that you should get rid of, which include the popular sayings \\"Don't talk to strangers\\" and \\"Silence is gold.\\" Instead, she provides you with new tapes to play that encourage talking to strangers and taking initiative in conversations.After that she talks about the benefits of getting over your shyness and hesitation and talking to strangers without fear. Afterwards, she provides you with tips and guidelines on what to say and what not to say during small talk conversations. Things not to say such as those questions that will result in a dead-end answer (i.e. How was your weekend, how's the family doing... etc.) and things to say such as proper self-introduction. Then she carries on by providing tips about proper and improper body language gestures during small talks. And finally, she tells us about some conversation killers that we should avoid at all costs.So you're wondering by now, all of the above seems to be quite interesting. What made me not enjoy the book and learn valuable skills from it? My answer is that I didn't like the book for two reasons.The first reason is that even though I might not be a \\"super conversationalist\\" but I can tell when I'm given bad advice! Why bad advice, you wonder? Well, what Mrs. Fine keeps telling you on and on is to approach strangers with questions that will make them talk, not questions that will make then answer! She keeps going on and on about how to ask the proper questions and how to acquire \\"free' information about the person you're talking to so that you'll be able to ask even more questions! She also advises you that you shouldn't be just a silent listener, because you should be an active listener. Thus, participate in the discussion by asking questions such as \\"How did that affect you\\" or \\"what did you learn from all that.\\"Notice anything wrong so far?She wants you to be one of those annoying people you meet at parties who keep on asking you questions and questions and questions and questions until you feel that you want to pull your arm until your rip it off just to have something to throw at them! You walk into a person's office and you notice a framed university degree hanged on the wall. Wow... free information... let's harass this guy! What did you like about the university? What are the advantages of living in that town? What did you learn in that major? How did this career affect your personal life? ...etc.Yet what puzzled me the most was that she herself, Mrs. Debra Fine the first, gives you a totally contradicting advice telling you to avoid being an FBI agent! She warns you against harassing people with questions. And I was like, but... what about what you've been telling me for over an hour now? What should I do with all the questioning techniques you just taught me? I guess, nothing...The second reason I didn't like the book is that whatever good advices remain after you filter the book are pretty much obvious to the average reader. Always keep an eye contact but don't just stare and try to nod and show interest. Don't initiate a conversation you're not sincerely interested in because it will show on you. Always seek the opportunity to converse with strangers because you never know what tremendous effect they might have on your life. And so on.The only good outcome possible of this book is for really shy readers who need some motivation to get out of their shells and approach people. For that purpose I recommend buying the audio tape because Mrs. Fine is a good speaker and her style is exciting and moving. But please, while doing so be careful so that you don't transform from a shy person into a nagging annoying person!"},{"Title":"The Fine Art of Small Talk","review":"I am a sales professional and am constantly looking for books to help better myself. This was definitely not one of them... This book was simplistic and lacked advise that would apply in the real world. The overview suggests that this book will help you with networking and business relations but very little of it applies. If someone approached you at a business function and asked you \\"What was the best job you ever had? What was the worst?\\", what would you think? How about \\"What would you like to come back as in your next life?\\"? These are just a few of the lame suggestions this author suggests to \\"break the ice\\" and begin a conversation. I wish I could return this book..."},{"Title":"The Fine Art of Small Talk","review":"The key points of this book would fit nicely into about 15-20 of it's small printed pages... I can summarize the content in this review. First the author gives her history... Next, she explains to not be shy and to approach people in conversation and people standing alone.... She stresses that you must really strive to take an interest and care for the people you are talking with. She tells you to only ask engaging questions (e.g. What have you done today? Instead of How was your day?) She devotes a few pages to body language and tells you to take note to always remember the other persons name and.... then she explains how to gracefully exit a conversation by leading out with \\"I have to go...\\". While I don't find myself in disagreement with Ms. Fine on any of her advice, I did feel about 75% of the book is common knowledge.... I read the entire book in a 2 hour period and because I felt like I didn't learn much I don't recommend it without picking up a copy and skimming through it."},{"Title":"The Fine Art of Small Talk","review":"Based on some of the 4 and 5 stars reviews here I approached this book with excitement and high expectations only to be let down - hard.The author states that her background is in Engineering and, frankly, I'm not surprised. The \\"problem\\" of small talk and conversation is treated like an engineering project rather than the fine art that it truly is (regardless the title). If you're an engineer (like I am) you might be tempted to believe that the litany of manipulative formulas presented here actually make sense and will work. And, I'm sure that they do - with OTHER socially challenged engineers (and others who are socially awkward). So, it's hardly surprising that the Author's client list is filled with companies with a strong engineering culture!However, in the rest of the real world they're finding out that what is truly effective when it comes to relationships and conversations is \\"Social IQ\\". So, therefore, in leiu of this book I would recommend any of the following:Social Intelligence: The New Science of Human RelationshipsSocial Intelligence: The New Science of SuccessAND that is what is sorely (I would even say conspicuously) missing from this book. Without Social IQ the techniques outlined here are not only ineffective they could be downright irritating to \\"normies\\". (and, speaking as an engineer, I would be hard pressed to call most engineers \\"normal\\" when it comes to social matters)However, if you develop Social IQ the techniques that are presented in this book would actually be quite effective - powerful in fact. So this reviewer's consumer advice would be, get this book AFTER you've developed (or refined) your Social IQ skills. Then you will have the essential skills required to be a superb conversationalist and friend!This may sound daunting (it was for me) but, believe it or not it really isn't and you probably have all that you need lying latent inside you! Social IQ -- that's the key NOT JUST the words and approach that you use."},{"Title":"The Fine Art of Small Talk","review":"Debra,Thank you for writing your book, \\"The Fine Art of Small Talk: How to Start a Conversation, Keep It Going, Build Networking Skills---and Leave a Positive Impression!\\". I have attended any number of courses on networking, and have read a number of books on this topic. Your book is the only one that doesn't make the assumption that making small talk to network effectively is easy. You provide specific information and techiques for how to engage people.Your little book is a gem. I have read it twice and will be referring to it before any networking event. Even though, I believe, I am reasonable good at engaging people in conversations, I have found that already your ideas and techniques have made me more effective at small talk.Your book has affected me positively. Thank you again."},{"Title":"The Fine Art of Small Talk","review":"Ms. Fine's tape provides basic guidelines on how to start and maintain a conversation. However, Ms. Fine is providing hints on small talk, not integral calculus. While the tape is relatively easy to follow, the subject matter is not particularly high level, in spite of the difficulty casual conversations often present to many intelligent people.Keep in mind that while the tape does provide helpful advice it is not a silver bullet for shy or uninterested people. For the shy, you still have to approach people and take the risk that, inspite of Ms. Fine's avice, you may be rejected. For the uninterested, you will need a class on acting- being able to engage another in conversation requires you to be truly interested in what one has to say. Only the most shallow will not be able to see through the manipulative veneer of those simply going through the motions of asking open ended questions."},{"Title":"The Fine Art of Small Talk","review":"This book does not challenge those of us without &quot;moxie&quot; to somehow develop it. Nor does the book insist that introverts somehow change their personality. Instead, this book provides conversational tools and techniques that one canimplement at a party, networking event or even during a job interview. I would recommend it highly for anyone who is sick of hearing that there is something wrong with them for being shy. The author acknowledges her struggle with shyness and provides skills for conversational comfort in almost any situation."},{"Title":"The Fine Art of Small Talk","review":"I hate small talk books that make such a big science of the whole thing. Debra presents a means to develop the proper attitude about small talk. She gives techniques and examples. She is funny in relating stories and empowering in those techniques.

I often listen to this tape in my car and I find myself entertained as well as trained."},{"Title":"The Fine Art of Small Talk","review":"This is a good thing for those of us who are clueless about what to even say.

But most of it is restating common sense basics for conversations, like smiling, shaking hands and making eye contact. She touches on asking open-ended questions to invite more conversation (as opposed to questions that can be answered in single word responses). She talks about they types of people who can be conversation killers and how to handle them in a polite manner so that the conversation doesn't come to a grinding halt. And she addresses those awkward pregnant pauses in conversation. The final topic of interest to me was how to gracefully exit conversations. My take home message from this book was that the burden of conversation is on me and it is my responsibility to actively listen, remember people's names, and come prepared with questions appropriate to the event."},{"Title":"The Fine Art of Small Talk","review":"- I am a psychologist and I bought this book to share with my college student clients who suffer from social anxiety.

I recommend it to my classes.It is probably worthwhile for persons interested in effective human-to-human communication to also consider that knowledge of non-verbal communication and an ability to handle contentious issues are also key elements. Adding these to this fine book would make it less accessible so I recommend that persons who seek competence in this area explore these other topics as well."},{"Title":"The Fine Art of Small Talk","review":"The \\"icebreakers\\" proposed by the author, supposedly to be the jewel of this book, involve so many personal questions. I am afraid that that will do more harm than good to people whose targets are conservatives. Furthermore, the author had wasted too much time to elaborate the importance of small talk. I think the potential readers know that well or they wont pick this book up at all. Even worse, the writing is real boring. In short, not recommended. For those who want to read something to reduce their fear in public gatherings or to improve their social skills, \\"How to Have Confidence and Power in Dealing With People by Les Giblin\\", \\"How to win friends and influence people by Dale Carnegie\\", \\"How to Talk to Anyone: 92 Little Tricks for Big Success in Relationships by Leil Lowndes\\" are much better alternatives."},{"Title":"The Fine Art of Small Talk","review":"The book has very good tips, but is repetitive.

The 'trick' is to ask the right questions to motivate the other person to do so.Let's take for example the review by Abdullah Z Jefri \\"Aceous\\" (Saudi Arabia). Here, the question is simple: What did you think about the book?This is a nice, open-ended question. It allows the person to express their feelings - in this case, their \\"feelings\\" toward the book.It is not a probing, \\"FBI\\" question. Think of Mulder and Scully from the X-files. They are looking for information and facts that they can use to their advantage and have no problem letting themselves into someone's house anytime they want information. But a sincere individual wants to know how YOU really FEEL.Now with that simple question, this individual was inspired to write a lengthy review, and they did a great job expressing their feelings.Ironically, Mrs. Fine's approached worked on this individual. The question could have been: Did you like this book? Unstead, it was asked in a way that could not be answered with one word and draws the individual out: in this case, that they were not impressed with the book and they no doubt felt good giving this non-recommendation.I use Fine's approach with everyone I speak to whether it's business, personal, or romantic. I have found that people enjoy talking about themselves. They are just looking for a good listener and really appreciate when you express to them something that you remembered about their feelings from a previous conversation. It really will touch them.If this book does what Abdullah Z Jefri \\"Aceous\\" (Saudi Arabia) claims (to help to envoke others' feelings through the use of questions), as well as those things you never say, then this is probably worth purchasing."},{"Title":"The Fine Art of Small Talk","review":"I saw this author on Today/Good Morning America.

Although I agree that most examlples stated are more relevant in business situations, the principles she teaches can be applied in several situations and there is even a great section for singles that I found to be great.The author's point is not to repeat the very slecific exmples she gives, but to understand what kinds of things you can consider appropriate small talk. I personally would not use the specific examples, but I will tailor those statements to my 20 year old way of speaking."},{"Title":"The Fine Art of Small Talk","review":"Debra Fine writes a detailed book on the art of small talk and guides the act of initiating, engaging, and departing a conversation skillfully. She analyzes the details of a conversation in each chapter to chronologically present the process of small talk. From encounter to departure Fine presents steps that will assist you with small talk. Another positive attribute of this book are the conversational lists that are available through multiple chapters that give specific questions to help advance and maintain the conversation. Fine's list of questions to kindle a conversation with acquaintances was especially helpful in my personal experience to stray from the conversation killing \\"How have you been?\\" question that can be immediately subdued by the one word answer \\"Good.\\".An important note of this book is that this is a business oriented book. What I mean by that is that the questions and advice given are aimed towards business social events. But the book does provide advice on situations that does not require one to have to be at business event. In this manner the aim of the book is towards the networking skills through small talk but the advice given can be applied to other situations in daily social lives. I find that even if your job doesn't require you to have to be a prolific talker that the business orientation of the book helps in providing a basis of understanding small talk.By using business events as the main social setting of the book the advice on small talk given here are presented with an example event to apply Fine's concepts and thus see how application of the skill is executed. The questions that are given to a business event can be mirrored and transposed to fit any situation outside of the business realm to grant the user flexibility. Thus one can read this book to not only learn business conversational skills but also to learn to maintain beneficial small talk in day to day life."},{"Title":"The Fine Art of Small Talk","review":"If a stranger at a party or a business meeting or whatever just came up to me and said \\"What's the best vacation you've ever had?,\\" I'd feel really, really uncomfortable and probably try to get away fast. Even if they said \\"Hi, my name is Bob. What's the best vacation you've ever had?\\". Now I don't have the best social skills in the world, but I'm pretty sure that asking a random personal questions immediately about meeting a new person is NOT socially appropriate, at least not in the American culture that I know.Some of the suggestions might work in some contexts if they were worded differently. For example, she suggests to say \\"Tell me about your weekend\\" or \\"Tell me about your family\\" instead of \\"How was your weekend\\" or \\"Do you have any kids?\\" Probably she suggests this because \\"How was your weekend?\\" Could be met with \\"Fine\\" and the conversation ends, and the kids questions is a yes or no. But demanding that a stranger \\"Tell me about _______\\" makes you sound either rude and bossy, or like a therapist."},{"Title":"The Fine Art of Small Talk","review":"Offers kind of weird conversation topics/starters - this book isn't for everyone, I'm sure there's a better option for people hoping to learn some of these skills."},{"Title":"The Fine Art of Small Talk","review":"The book is not giving you the secret of life.

May be this talk will not be much effective for you or may be there will be no value for you, but nobody knows what will happen during these small conversation..And it shows you that some those kind of thoughts are exists, not for only you but every people all around the world.

It covers the basics and a lot of it is common sense. It could have easily delved into a much more advanced and detailed system and structure but it's really just a basic frame for conversation. I was done with it in about an hour - its not that extensive but its a good basic program."},{"Title":"The Fine Art of Small Talk","review":"This book was a real disappointment. Although the information on the cover doesn't say so, it's aimed almost exclusively at people in business situations; almost all of Fine's examples deal with corporate conferences and other networking events. For example, her top suggested line for exiting conversations is \\"I need to go see the exhibits.\\" She continually emphasizes how improving your small talk skills will win you new clients, a promotion, etc. What about just making friends? The idea that you might want to improve your conversational skills in everyday social or family situations is hardly mentioned at all.Fine also has some peculiar ideas about what constitutes \\"small talk.\\" She offers a long list of \\"icebreakers\\" for initiating conversations with people you don't know. Unfortunately nearly all of these are too personal, too serious, or just bizarre. Imagine trying to strike up a conversation with a stranger by saying, \\"If you could replay any moment in your life, what would it be?\\" The person would just think you're either nosy or a kook. She even suggests using political statements as conversation starters, which is just asking for trouble.There are a few good suggestions in the book; she has useful advice for dealing with egocentric people who talk endlessly about themselves. However, all of Fine's good ideas could easily fit on two or three pages."},{"Title":"The Fine Art of Small Talk","review":"I found myself walking around day to day saying, \\"folks just aren't friendly\\"... my neighbors, church members, parents at my child's school, folks I see every day/week at the grocery store and believe it or not relatives. I think Debra Fine has hit on some of the key reasons that I was not finding folks to be \\"friendly\\". Some of the reasons being: we are socialized to be wary of strangers, we think too many questions makes us nosy, introducing ourselves and others is not easy always, initiating, carrying on and ending a conversation is a challenge and lastly, finding similarities and interest in our conversation partners is hard at times.Ms. Fine advised that no one can wait to be introduced or expect someone else to initiate the conversation and she is right. When I used the suggestions it made a world of difference in the contacts and connections that I began to make. I used the suggestions in professional and personal settings, with women and men and with folks my age and teens.What I relay to folks when I use these techniques is \\"I care about you\\" and \\"I am interested in you as a person\\". The feedback I have recieved from people is that I make them feel good, in a world that is too busy I take time. That is really the bottom line about this book, why would I not use the suggestions when the potential is to evoke that kind of feeling from folks that you interact with everyday of your life.Lastly, I have used this book in many ways. I have passed the book to my husband who works in a technical field is reading the book and has begun using some of the suggestions at his workplace and finding them to be applicable. As a homeschooling parent I used the book as part of a communciations curriculum for my 16-year-old son. Many of the stategies he used to get a job and now to maintain his employment; he has been told he is a wonderful conversationalist."},{"Title":"The Fine Art of Small Talk","review":"At the same time, I have ordered Debra's tape, I have bought also 7 others books and video, audio tapes from others authors, on the same subject of conversation. Debra's tape , definitely appears to me, easy, confortable, to apply for any occasions to talk to people Her voice is very friendly and warm. I am so glad to have found Debra' audio tape. She gives , not only advice and techniques, but immediate examples of small talk for introducing yourself , with warmness and giving people the chance and the desire to develop conversation with you. Usually, when invited to dinner, or cocktails , or meeting , I go with the apprehension to meet new people , and to be in the situation of nothing to say , and to appear not interesting to be with.The days after listening to Debra's tape, I have the opportunity to apply in a dinner . I was the guest on a table of 12 persons that I did not know. The evening was lovely, because at last I could engage conversation with new people, as if we were friends. I feel much more confortable ,in such short time and I know that with more training with this tape, I will allow myself, for near future, to love meeting new people, as well as to talk friendly with my clients, my hairdresser, old friends...

Please think about the type of book this is as you read the reviews. This is a book designed for people who are more comfortable dealing with machines, numbers, logic, animals, etc., then they are with people. The author freely admits that she was an engineer and wrote this book to help other engineers and technical people. It is a beginner's book on how to interact with people. If you are married, for example, you probably don't need this book. You were able to talk to someone. I suspect the people who found it boring or uninformative were too advanced. Like a brain surgeon reading a high school biology book.

I can tell that using the advice makes a big difference in how people respond. The Fine Art of Small Talk really has had a positive impact.

The book includes many useful lists, such as icebreakers to get a conversation going, topics to avoid,, great exit lines to retreat gracefully, ways to fuel a conversation, and ways to leap the chasm of pregnant pauses.One chapter of special interest is on listening. Do you sometimes talk too much to converse? Do you get distracted by other people or happenings in the room? Do you show your boredom by letting your eyes wander? You, too, huh?

Yes there are many useful and helpful advices, especially with open-ended questions, and rephrasing few \\"daily questions\\" but their delivery on the audiotapes takes rather a long time.

All the MBA's, CPA's and LLB's have brought boardroom boredom to the small screen by confusing reporting with entertainment and bottom line statistics and you get criticized for being critical of the blunder bosses, with the publication of Bad News. They were born too late.They will never understand the intellectual and social advantage of entering this world during the Great Depression when heroic men and women inspired great hope in what should have been the worst of times; and then, moving into the adolescent years, a part of the total commitment of the Greatest Generation of World War II. Meatless meals and ration coupons were no sacrifice while GI's we knew were dying for a proud country and twenty-one dollars a month. We had stable, supportive neighborhoods; extended families, and dependable, imaginative, friends. Additional encouragement was surely provided by the poorly paid nobility of superbly dedicated teachers. All of it grew us. There was no bottom line, no money issue beyond survival. The issue was posterity.Tom, do you know of a front office exec that has used - or even understood - that word? It was the selfless platform that our founding fathers built a nation on. Too, the early newsmen at CBS knew they were builders for the future, not grasping bottom-liners. What a world of giants you followed, Tom, with those paragons of intellect and elocution, Edward R. Murrow's \\"boys\\" at CBS News: Eric Severeid, Charles Collingwood, William L. Shirer, Robert Trout, Ed Bliss, Bill Downs, Richard C. Hottelet, Howard K. Smith, Larry LeSueur, Winston Burdett, and Murrow's producer, Fred W. Friendly? All of patrician mien if not patrician birth, they were mesmerizers and rarely, if ever, spoke a word in error.That you aspired to follow them does you credit, Tom, a courageous recognition of personal worth....and you certainly fit that CBS mold, now discarded in some musty attic of fading memory, an artifact that wouldn't find a buyer on eBay or a price on the Antiques Road Show.The inspirations are long gone now, Tom, remembered and commemorated only in the minds of the elderly among us mourning the lost legacy of the great issues your words speak of in Bad News. Today's power elite believe in narrowing down the salable, simplistic, \\"big story\\" and rehashing it over and over to the exclusion of all else, even as tens of thousands dying in the darker, obscured-to-the public regions of the world are ignored. And that is as much the fault of an increasingly crass Fourth Estate, the erstwhile custodians of public conscience, as it is uncaring governments not urged into action. \\"It's the competition stupid!\\" So what if more than half the public can't find Sweden on a map. Who ever heard of Scandinavia anyway, huh!Compare those legends of the past to today's anchors and correspondents, particularly on the cable news networks that are now threatening the very existence of network newscasts. It's a world of pretenders, despite their degrees from Harvard and Stanford. They would have been an embarrassment to \`enry \`iggins and my 8B3 class back in 1944! When the Elbe River and Wilkesbarre , PA, are as foreign to them as quarks and mesons are to the average major league shortstop, they commit errors that should send them to their minor leagues to report on automobile accidents and two-headed turtles. No such luck. Too many of them are paid to be personable gigglers and chatter-boxers, too good looking and too sexy (in somebody's opinion) to be given the boot. They blend perfectly with the made over, tucked and enhanced generation. Alas, these jolly anchor people are now used as occasional correspondents in more distant venues. They are save-a-buck assignees, doing in-shallow reporting in fractured English. What ever happened to incisive follow-up questions? Soft ball players!Dare we expect something better from our news centers while the United States is listed near or at the bottom of the world's industrial nations in educational quality, in knowledge of our native language, in math skills, and even in our pitifully low contribution of foreign aid as a percentage of GNP? Small wonder that our once most-admired-nation is now out-sourcing our foreign correspondents along with everything else of value, to enrich the grand poobahs of commerce, while impoverishing the rest of us.For every concerned Lou Dobbs or sensitive Aaron Brown on the domestic front, or a Tom Fenton (before he retired) on the foreign scene, there are a dozen silver-spoon generation entertainers. Whether in the news rooms or temporarily on the road, they are readers, essentially, who read poorly scripted news poorly, and who are indistinguishable one from the other, society's Peter Pans, that will \\"never grow up\\" as long as they are suspended like marionettes. As a lifetime news junkie, I resent it.Thanks again for telling it the way it is, Tom; but the Dutch boy at the dike is folk fiction. I fear that you, and a few less expressive others, can't hold back the spreading wasteland. It is no longer fashionable to be smart, and compassionately concerned. And we are becoming increasingly aware of how dangerous it is to be critical. Once on \\"the list,\\" you lose access.What the hell! You're right, it's still worth the fight, Tom, or else I wouldn't have bought your book in the first place."},{"Title":"Bad News: The Decline of Reporting, the Business of News, and the Danger to Us All","review":"As a former local television news producer I have been dismayed at the lack of news to be found on network television. Foreign news may not seem interesting to many, but I never thought a news show was aired to entertain us. There are plenty of other shows that do that. I agree with the author on this point. We would never have learned much at school is all we were taught had to be entertaining as well. I don't think that adding another 1/2 hour to the evening news is too much to ask for. How else are we going to find out what is going on in the world around us.Fenton's book is well written and easy to read and gives clear concise reasons why it matters."},{"Title":"Bad News: The Decline of Reporting, the Business of News, and the Danger to Us All","review":"I think that the problem with the news as being broadcast by television, both national and local is that we consider it to be the news. If we think of it as just another form of entertainment show featuring a small team of bubble heads with puffed up hair and the ability to giggle at each other then it all makes sense.Last night a featured local story was that diesel fuel prices were higher here than a few hundred miles away so truckers were just buying enough fuel to get to where it was cheaper. So what.Every day or so we hear another American has been killed in Iraq. Every week or so a thousand Americans are killed in car crashes. Not a mention. Every month 10,000 or so people die from AIDS -- old news, no one cares.Tom Fenton's book is quite interesting from an international news point of view.

It is entertainment and/or opinion. The political News is mostly strong highly-biased opinion. Most of the \\"News\\" available is sensational reporting that has no impact on the lives of ordinary Americans. Ordinary Americans need real News about important issues that truly effect their lives. However, most of these real issues are not sensational and sexy. Therefore, they can not sell enough product for advertisers. Advertisers almost always reach for the most sensational of issues to bring to the public. The bottom line is that there is a dumbing down of information that is provided to most TV viewers. What is called \\"News\\" is usually not News at all, but really some type of exploitive reporting designed to \\"capture\\" the viewer at an emotional & visceral level and \\"glue\\" that viewer to the TV for tens and hundreds of hours so that the TV source can pour out commercials that are in themselves often exploitive.Media (351/1)"},{"Title":"Bad News: The Decline of Reporting, the Business of News, and the Danger to Us All","review":"... to Tom Fenton on his comprehensive book as well as to the guts to finally say what needed to be said.Mr. Fenton points at \\"wasted air time\\", \\"lost trust\\", and a \\"disillusioned audience\\". I would add, that the on-going trial reporting was \\"new\\" - a decade ago. Since then the American audience has figured out that time stands still in court rooms. In the meantime, \\"real\\", newsworthy history is developing like 9-1-1, which was planned and worked on - for years!Americans do not trust TV news because too often these reports focus on \\"sensationalized\\" news as a way out of what is happening. Whether Scott Peterson did blink or not or Martha Stewart slept well in jail is NOT news.I am hoping that Mr. Fenton will soon analyze how U.S. domestic news reporting (though cheaper) isn't any better.Every day, our media misses a chance to be the watch dog, who announces developing catastrophes, foreign and domestic. E.g. In 12/04, instead of reporting that US students' math skills dropped below OECD average, something so dramatic that it might cost U.S. kids the chance for a decent paying job in the future, TV reported about Scott Peterson's case day-in-and-out.Eventually the American public might awaken to the news that US kids' math scores are so low, respectively that other countries' children have improved their skills so much, that IT corporations don't have any other option than hiring foreign workers with better math/computer programming skills.And, like Mr. Fenton points out so eloquently, then, again the American public might wonder \\"how this could happen - so suddenly\\"?Mr. Fenton's book is a relief to those of us who have waited for this book and an eye opener to those who are suspecting... It is a must-read book."},{"Title":"Bad News: The Decline of Reporting, the Business of News, and the Danger to Us All","review":"Fenton may appear to be piling on as CBS is getting pounded from so many directions. However, he claims to have been working on this book last year - prior to the current lamentable condition of CBS. He states, \`the timing is coincidental'.One thing I appreciated about Fenton's approach is his emphasis on the need for good coverage of foreign events - regardless of what that might do to ratings. As an example he writes about a project he was working on to interview Osama Bin Laden, \\"Our bosses saw him as an obscure Arab of no interest to our viewers,\\" Fenton writes. \\"More concerned with saving dollars than pursuing the story, they killed the project.\\"Fenton goes on to suggest it's not possible for networks to provide in-depth coverage of worldly events when they're compacted to just 18 minutes of broadcast time.He really doesn't pull any punches when he writes, \\"Once you get halfway through the CBS Evening News, the rest of it you can turn off,\\" Fenton goes on... \\"There's nothing there you need to know. It's an attempt to entertain people and pump up ratings. If I want entertainment, I'll watch 'The Daily Show.'\\"In short, it's a hard hitting account from a long respected insider.

What he gives us is in \\"Bad News\\" is what lies underneath.That the news is \\"bad\\" these days is shameful and the author pounces on everything from news executives who are more interested in profits to the Bush White House, where spin rules the day. While at the outset one might think that Mr. Fenton is part of the \\"left-wing media\\", let me re-assure you....he goes after the Clinton White House as well. The clincher is that Walter Cronkite doesn't watch the CBS evening news....now that tells us something.Mr. Fenton relates where the state of the reporting of news has gone and why it has gone there. He offers pratical solutions to repair what has become the \\"news as entertainment\\" dilemma that we face today. His most important contribution is to remind us that practical reporting from foreign correspondents, an area in which he suggests the United States has failed miserably, is a key to enlightenment, enrichment and the ultimate education of American (and world) viewers.\\"Bad News\\" is a good book.

I was aware of some of the details but not to the extent as illustrated in \\"Bad News.\\"However, since reading this important book I have opened my eyes, as the saying goes and changed my viewing habits.Being retired, my daily routine included viewing the 6PM evening news. Usually I would switch between CBS and ABC, according to the content and rarely stayed for the full program.I was and am interested in meaningful news and not eye candy items that are of no importance in a newscast that lasts approximately seventeen minutes, mingled with disgusting Pharmaceutical commercials.My handy remote control's mute button really comes in handy when the silly commercials break in.I manage to get more meaningful news from the New York Times Discovery channel and from the BBC-America. However I would prefer the BBC in the UK, which is supported wholly by the owners of television sets for which there is a yearly license fee which supports BBCI & BBC2 as an independent entity. There are no commercials and no acknowledgement to corporate sponsers as is the case with Public Television in this country. I wish we had the same system here in America.I would recommend this book by Tom Fenton to everyone who is really and truly interested in what is going on at home and abroad.I am more critical and observant, thanks to this book.The other evening on ABC News sporting the backdrop \\"World News,\\" had very little of world news. Instead most of the short span (approx 18 minutes) was spent featuring the manipulated nonsense of Laura Bush which was written by a comedy writer and was definitely in poor taste, to say the least and it was followed by a segment showing a Mama Duck and her ducklings helped by the secret service. To add insult to one's intelligence, in closing the camera zoomed into \\"ABC World News Tonight.\\"To sum up: Network News are purveyors of repetitive and boring comercials with short breaks offering a sprinkling of contrived and manipulated news items.Alas, where are the muckrakers of the past to open up the cans of worms, as the saying goes? That is other than Tom Fenton who has started the ball rolling."},{"Title":"Bad News: The Decline of Reporting, the Business of News, and the Danger to Us All","review":"We learn from this critique of the news media that Cronkite no longer watches the evening news. Surprise? Fenton's acute, but not shrill, expose of the decline and continuing fall of televised non-news has the feel of one who knows the ropes and the inside dry-rot that set in during the nineties: from public service to corporate cash cow operations. It is a peculiar version of censorship amidst the paeans on the free press and the American way. We are rapidly becoming a completely uninformed public, awash in streaming media dayglow, it had best not the final verdict"},{"Title":"Bad News: The Decline of Reporting, the Business of News, and the Danger to Us All","review":"There was a time when broadcasters were required to provide a public service in order to retain their broadcasting license, that public service was the news. News networks were more interested in the prestige of offering the best content and competed fiercely. Following deregulation all the major media outlets were bought up by major corporations and the prestige of quality reporting took a backseat to ratings and cost management. The effect was to close almost all overseas bureaus, dumb down the news content and switch the business model from news gathering to news packaging. Purchased stories have to go through a variety of filters in order to reach the public. Is the story affordable, does it conflict with the business of the parent company or the advertisers, does it satisfy the target demographic, does it balance out the flow of the show and is it understandable in 30 seconds or less. Networks can now target viewing trends by the second and avoid stories that are shown to have a ratings dip.Tom Fenton has the connections to investigate the problem from within and the honesty to unleash heavy punches. \`Bad News' is extremely dense with information and the writing style is at the same time hard hitting and engaging. It's certainly not a feel good book, after all Mr. Fenton draws a parallel between the various filters on American media reports and Soviet totalitarianism where citizens were fed a steady diet of government propaganda. The United States government is known for using \`soft power' in order to gain influence and this extends to control on media content. There seems to be a quid pro quo relationship with the large media conglomerates and the government who owns the licenses. The White House in particular has become quite adept at freezing out unfavorable reporters. Ironically much of the problem is brought on by reporters themselves who are either too lazy, too worried about losing interviews or too budget constrained to actually do their own investigative journalism. It's much easier to recite White House talking points than investigate their validity or larger impact.It may be small consolation but the United States media is still doing better than most overseas. Sure, Al Jazeera may be showing U.S. inflicted carnage that doesn't reach our shores but that doesn't mean they don't have their own thick filters. Italy has practically a state run media monopoly and France media is owned almost exclusively by two conglomerates. In some ways the current U.S. media suffers from comparisons with what may have been the golden age of reporting during the Cold War. Unfortunately as bad as the news media has sunk since the end of the Cold War they seem to be continuing their race to the bottom with the modern day William Randolph Hearst, Rupert Murdoch leading the decent.Tom Fenton focuses almost exclusively on the decline of foreign reporting but he's missing the degradation in domestic reporting. The problem is that reporters have become little more than stenographers except in the case of partisan reporting like Fox News. Bush can travel the country giving clearly misleading information on the tax cut savings for the lower and middle class and the media says nothing. It's a delicate balancing act to offer context and informed judgment without biasing the report but stenographers can sometimes be worse than useless by giving legitimacy to lies. The lack foreign reporting and poor job in informing the public on important domestic issues leads to a vacuum that's being filled by agenda driven partisan reporting and ignorance has left the door wide open for political spin as was evident in the 2004 election."},{"Title":"Bad News: The Decline of Reporting, the Business of News, and the Danger to Us All","review":"Anyone who tries to follow news in the current atmosphere of world events knows that journalism, TV journalism in particular, is in a sad state. Retiring foreign correspondent Tom Fenton is canny to jump on the issue right now, when it's fresh in a lot of minds. He offers a lot of insights into what's wrong now. But in the end he lacks a clear vision of how the industry used to be and how it got to be where it is now.Fenton points out that the major American TV networks have exactly one foreign bureau these days, in London. At home, \\"news\\" often consists of repackaging press releases from the government or Big Business, and abroad, news is regularly purchased wholesale from the BBC and other sources, international bureaus have withered to a few stringers, and many networks (Fox News in particular) have fallen prey to creating \\"spectaculars\\" with celebrity newsmen like Geraldo Rivera.The author is correct to point out that this represents a major decline from the heyday of Edward R. Murrow and Walter Cronkite. News is on the skids. But as early as page twenty-seven, he reveals why things used to be better back in the Golden Age of newsgathering: the Cold War. Fear of the Soviets justified massive outlays that can't exist in the absence of a monolithic enemy. Any Noam Chomsky acolyte would point out that this means the news was NEVER really about facts, but rather about nationalist propaganda.And Fenton is contradictory about how things stand today. For instance, he suggests that many news veterans are still stuck in a Vietnam-era liberal mindset and that's why they're eager to let slide on hard news gathering, tossing softballs to world leaders like President Bush and Vladimir Putin. Let me repeat that for you: he thinks that it is old-line leftism that is causing the news to give a free pass to right-wing nationalists like Bush and Putin. Need I explain why this is a ridiculous notion?Still, there are a lot of ways Fenton is correct. Because newsgathering is toothless today, we have no context to understand forces like Islamist terror and Russian neocolonialism. Frivolous attitudes toward Chinese industrial expansionism and Venezuelan saber-rattling leave the average American unequipped to prepare for what may be our next big national struggle. And our highly overpaid news anchors have a moral responsibility to push their correspondents and stringers for a higher standard of reportage.Even the solutions Fenton suggests are valid. An hour-long prime-time news show every night would be a good idea, and the success of shows like Dateline and 60 Minutes proves that people would watch them. An FCC willing to enforce the networks' responsibility to the public good would bring news in line with what it should be, and what we certainly need, to grasp our place in the world.For all this good, Fenton's appeal to false nostalgia and his oddly contradictory view of how things are right now undermines how we see and understand his arguments. (And all this is not helped by odd typographical quirks that suggest the publisher was in a real hurry to get the book out and move on. I think we should expect higher quality from a HarperCollins imprint.)Fenton is canny to spot a real need and throw his weight behind solutions. And with a little time and consideration, I suspect this book could have been a major contribution to real improvements in the state of affairs. But as it is it's a near miss, a selectively useful and alternately odd book that clouds the issues as much as it clarifies them. If you want to participate in the push for a more responsible press, this book is not the one for you."},{"Title":"Bad News: The Decline of Reporting, the Business of News, and the Danger to Us All","review":"Tom Fenton worked for many years as the senior European correspondent for CBS News. From 1966 to his retirement in 2004, Fenton covered almost every major European and Middle Eastern story. Nearly a decade before 9/11/01, Fenton tried (in vain) to convince his bosses at CBS that CBS should do an interview with Osama bin Laden. As a journalist on the ground and in the field where news happens, Fenton received four Emmy Awards, a Columbia University Dupont Award, and numerous other awards for his reporting. Fenton currently lives in London, England.In Bad News, Tom Fenton starts a campaign to galvanize Americans to demand more from their news media, especially the networks. He offers a \\"fiery indictment\\" of how far the news has fallen since the conclusion of the Cold War. The book reveals a news-gathering environment destroyed by corporate employees obsessed with the bottom-line, staffed by producers and executives more concerned with ratings than with the news, and \\"dangerously dependent\\" on information gathered by news agencies instead of ferreted out by correspondents.The era of foreign correspondents is over and with it is gone the time when network news covered the important stories as a public service. Now, the network news has been taken over by corporate parents who have turned it into a \\"cash cow.\\" Critical issues and stories are abandoned by producers because the American public might think they are too boring, distant, or depressing.Fenton argues that news media working with the mindset of entertainment instead of education is more than irresponsible: it is dangerous.A great read and interesting inside look at the news and what's wrong with the media today."},{"Title":"Bad News: The Decline of Reporting, the Business of News, and the Danger to Us All","review":"Tom Fenton has a bone to pick.As a veteran foreign correspondent for CBS News, he watched as his industry gave up investigative antagonistic independent journalism for \\"puff pieces,\\" Barbara Walters/Geraldo Rivera-style entertainment, and rebroadcasting corporate and/or government packaged reports masquerading as \\"news.\\" He's completely right that for at least 20 years the evening news has been a sham.Economics is part of it, as Fenton describes how a couple tenths of a percentage point in the ratings means millions in advertising revenue. By pandering to the lowest common denominator, the major networks have guaranteed that the LCD is the only demographic served.Also part of it, as Fenton takes great pains to point out, is the coziness of news bureaus with the current administration, which freezes out journalists who do not toe the party line. When lying to the public has become such an art, exposing the man behind the curtain is a sure trip to the Nowhere Idaho beat, or an IRS audit, or both.Fenton has stern words for the current Bush Administration, as well as the Clinton and Bush Sr. Administrations before it. He seems rather soft on the Reagan Administration, even though this was when the run-up to Wall Street tyranny began.The first third of the book is a little annoying, as Fenton takes every opportunity to place himself on a short list consisting of \\"Cronkite, Brokaw, Rather & Fenton.\\" Frankly, I don't think he belongs on that list.Nevertheless, having established his credentials the second third of the book details the failings of the TV news industry, how foreign bureaus were trimmed or eliminated completely after the fall of the USSR, and how American news turned inward and downward -- to our great detriment. In large part the developments in the world-at-large went unreported for two decades so the events of 1998-2001 caught many of us by surprise.The last third of the book explains why this situation is so dangerous. In a nutshell, with nobody trusted & respected to report world events accurately, the Administration is free to contradict facts bold-facedly and the public either buys the lies or is willing to entertain the notion. In a state where the \\"Fourth Estate\\" does not function, the truth is a casualty and becomes open to interpretation -- or spin -- or outright political manipulation. You can't have Democracy without an informed populace.Tom is right, this is unacceptable.His book is unusually forthright, startlingly direct, and surprisingly it names names. That it came to print at all is a glimmer of hope that a free press still has a chance to resurrect itself, and the tide may yet be turned.We can only hope."},{"Title":"Bad News: The Decline of Reporting, the Business of News, and the Danger to Us All","review":"Fenton cites many instances of important events brewing that were never reported, so that when the situation exploded, it seemed to come out of nowhere. An early one was the impending fall of the Shah of Iran, a situation that Fenton personally reported but which was dropped from the broadcasts as not sufficiently interesting. The most spectacular was the news of 9/11 which the New York Times had two days in advance. It chose to put the news on its website but not print it in the newspaper that prints \\"all the news that's fit to print.\\" (p. 6) Fenton's reporting of this long list of unreported news is the major reason for reading this book. \\"Had there been a drumbeat of segments on network news showing the steadily rising Islamist threat abroad, we might be living in a different world now.\\" (p. 5)Fenton's message is that entertainment trumps hard news every time. The causes of this include \\"underfunding, arrogant insularity, contempt for the view's attention span, loss of mission, corporate greed.\\" (p. 191) News media are now owned by corporations that own many other businesses. Profit, or the bottom line, is their mission, not informing the public. This has led them to close foreign news bureaus and to take their \\"news\\" from local feeders. At the same time, salaries for anchors and other stars of the news media have risen from $36,000 for each in the mid-1960s to 12 or 15 million apiece today.\\"Anyone accustomed to watching CNN abroad, or the BBC in England, cannot believe what those channels offer in the U.S. market.\\" (p. 223) \\"They manifestly assume that American tastes simply cannot be raised.\\" Fenton admits that this could be true. \\"Perhaps Americans, particularly younger Americans, have become too fluff-happy, too incapable of concerted attention.\\" (p. 233) (Virtually every book and article on the American education system confirms this.)Bias or \\"spin\\" also is discussed, and Fenton says that it is getting worse. Much of it is corporate in origin, advertisers, etc. However, \\"No one ever mentions the influence of ethnic lobbies or affiliations on American media.\\" (p. 99) \\"Yet neither will you see much on network news about the influence of Saudi money in Washington\\" (p. 103)Fenton mentions blogs and ezines but contends that they are mainly pushing a point of view rather than reporting hard facts.As one solution, Fenton recommends the formation of a news pressure group, perhaps composed of retired newsmen and anchors. The group's first job should be to \\"out\\" news executives who turn down important news stories. The group \\"should run a weekly register of egregious news shortfalls.\\" (p. 236) It should also feature \\"comparative lists of how the media in other countries reported stories differently from ours, or showed us up in reporting what we didn't.\\"Perhaps we could add that a good place to get the news you're not getting is to read the many nonfiction books available here on Amazon. One of the most important recent books is While America Sleeps: How Islam, Immigration and Indoctrination are Destroying America from Within."},{"Title":"Bad News: The Decline of Reporting, the Business of News, and the Danger to Us All","review":"This was an incredibly enlightening read. In a time when so many people have become mental couch potatoes and easy, minimialist sound-bites are sold as \\"fact\\", this book sheds the light on the depth of real world events and affairs and the American role in them--and how it impacts us directly. Once you read this book, you'll never view broadcast and print media \\"reporting\\" the same way."},{"Title":"Bad News: The Decline of Reporting, the Business of News, and the Danger to Us All","review":"In writing this book, Tom Fenton confirms what a lot of us have known for quite some time: the state of the TV news media is pathetic. In this sense it is nothing new. However Fenton supports his allegations with the sort of hard evidence only a reporting insider like himself could. And this is why Bad News is such an essential read.Reading this book, we get a look at the news media with the unique perspective of a 30 year veteran of foreign reporting. Not surprisingly this vantage point provides loads of hard facts proving the decline of substantive reporting on TV. We see the corners cut in Middle East reporting. We see the bottom-line, moneymaking attitude of the networks' top brass. We see the dearth of new talent in foreign news reporting. In short, Fenton argues that the TV news business' unwillingness to invest in foreign newsgathering and real investigation is going to cost us in American lives. A chilling thought.Everyone with a brain knows that something isn't right with our news media. And most of these people have a nagging suspicion that they should know more about the increasingly more dangerous world. Fenton agrees, and with this book will confirm the worst fears of many ordinary Americans."},{"Title":"Bad News: The Decline of Reporting, the Business of News, and the Danger to Us All","review":"After 34 years as a roving reporter for CBS News, Tom Fenton has put his guard down and written a blistering book about how the three networks have failed to provide the American public with the news they deserve. It isn't exactly a groundbreaking topic, but his insider position lends credence to a valid perspective even if he is frequently didactic about it. Fenton justifiably states that the decision makers at the network news regularly kill or downplay unpleasant news from outside the United States, leaving Americans uninformed and consequently unprepared for global trends, such as those that led to our current war with radical fundamentalism. It's a worthy tenet to explore and illuminate, but Fenton just doesn't seem to go far enough to address his claims. He says the problem is a complicated mixture of profit motive, limited vision, skewed ideas about what is good for audiences, and kowtowing to those in political power. That is certainly believable, and the founders of the political watchdog Web site, Spinsanity.com, covered this last point more thoroughly in their enlightening treatise, \\"All the President's Spin: George W. Bush, the Media, and the Truth\\". But Fenton's argument seems rather narrow given the breadth of his argument. He believes that if only the profit-driven executives who control the TV networks would fund some serious reportage -- particularly overseas reportage -- they could revive the media and educate the public. Fenton recognizes the ties of extensive news coverage to the spread of democracy, but he falters in drawing realistic solutions that would appeal to the programming chiefs. Ideas such as extending the evening news to an hour are honestly half-baked in his narrative, so we are left with a valid opinion with no tangible call to action.There is nobility to Fenton's old-school ideas and certainly a passion in his attempt to galvanize America to receive the news they must have in order for our democracy to survive. Yet I am left to surmise that the problems with how citizens receive information in a democratic society are deeper than anything the media can be expected to solve on its own. Even if Fenton articulated that finding, there is little for the reader to think could be done to alleviate this increasingly dire situation. One would have hoped there was beacon of hope with the advent of the 24-hour news channel, but as Fenton rightly states, this has not turned out to be the case, as each network fills their schedule with programming targeted toward the bottom line. Fox News Channel is the most cited offender of throwing logic and balance to the wind, but MSNBC, CNN and all the rest are equally guilty of dropping their commitments to serious reporting. The real value of this book, though, lies not in Fenton's discussion of the lack of foreign correspondents, but rather in his revealing interviews with Dan Rather, Peter Jennings and Tom Brokaw, obviously due to his insider status. Their individual personalities come across vividly in their responses - Brokaw comes across as relatively distant from the topic; Rather is thoughtful but still defensive about the quality of reportage on terrorism pre-9/11; and Jennings is more forthright in his disappointment with the coverage during the same period, unsurprising given his fifteen years as an ABC News foreign correspondent. These perspectives, especially Jennings', provide a look at global news coverage that makes this a worthwhile read."},{"Title":"Bad News: The Decline of Reporting, the Business of News, and the Danger to Us All","review":"Never met Tom Fenton but, both of us being in the same business - network news - I certainly knew of his work and therefore when I became aware of Bad News I just had to own it. Sadly, Fenton hit the nail on the head as he accurately described the decline and fall of quality, straightforward, no holds barred reporting on every level. Quoting other well known colleagues, he relates their personal concerns over the drive for ratings, celebrity and sensationalism over \\"the way it used to be.\\" Not much more to add to this picture nor could I, after a mere 57 years in broadcasting, offer a solution. Not to say there isn't a lot of damn good reporting going on at all the networks, even Fox manages to get it right now and then, but I don't think we'll ever see what we grew up reading and watching. Money talks. Got the book at a wonderful price via Amazon and it arrived in mint condition."},{"Title":"Bad News: The Decline of Reporting, the Business of News, and the Danger to Us All","review":"Fenton's long book title is misleading. His main issue is the lack of US foreign policy coverage on US broadcast television. He ignores issues with domestic and local news. He briefly deals with print journalism. And just casually mentions journalistic blogging.He wants his old job to reclaim the importance and respectability it had during the Cold War. He credits the Cold War days as the reason foreign news correspondents were revered and coverage was at its professional heights.After the Cold War, America lost its fear and vigilance, and the broadcast networks degenerated into profit-seeking infotainment. He also claims that the fall of broadcast news is intimately linked to the earlier fall of foreign news coverage.Fenton wants a national consensus among the public on the importance of foreign news. And he wants journalists to not just present the news, but to push it; doing less is to shirk journalistic responsibility. He ties his arguments for increasing foreign news coverage as bettering the national security of American soil and the international security of American citizens.In Chapter 4, \\"The Culture of Spin\\", Fenton confronts the biases in journalism at all levels. He notes that a majority of it is partisan politics and corporate interests, but other factors are more personal, like a journalist's desires to cling to socioeconomic or \\"ethnic solidarity\\". Fenton also complains in this section that liberalism as a philosophy (and not a party or a political entity), has taken the gumption out of news coverage.Overall, the most useful thing about Fenton's book is that it gave me a strategic historical overview of all the countries relevant to the foreign news still occurring today. And the little insights peppered throughout the book are eye-openers in other ways. Page 171 is particularly singed to my brain, where a mention of \\"the oddly straight-line borders of Iraq\\" highlights the fact that the country didn't develop organically, but is \\"an essentially artificial space.\\" Just by giving me a handy historical rundown, Fenton's lessened my apathy towards foreign news.But despite Fenton's hopes, I feel that the causes of audiences' apathy towards news reporting are bigger and beyond the problems Fenton claims are plaguing journalism. Reviving foreign news coverage might be a step towards the cure, but the apathy runs deep and is intertwined with too many other factors.ULTIMATELY, his huge nostalgia for the Cold War leads to a radical conclusion: what he's essentially calling for, but doesn't say outright, is to elevate US foreign reporting to the level of military intelligence gathering.To the publisher: WHY ARE THERE SO MANY TYPOS AND STRAY WORDS IN THE TEXT? GET A BETTER PROOFREADER!"},{"Title":"Bad News: The Decline of Reporting, the Business of News, and the Danger to Us All","review":"Tom Fenton was a reporter for a broadcast network for four decades, covering Europe and the Middle East. He says much of America depends on the network broadcasters for news about the world. [No mention of news about America.] Since the fall of the Soviet Union networks drastically cut back on foreign news, replacing it with sensationalistic and meaningless news. Fenton doesn't understand the purpose of this: to keep citizens ignorant of the events whether in Washington or in foreign lands. People who know little, like children, are easier to manipulate and exploit. The owners of a network can do as they please, and they please the Government that controls their money-making machine. Do Clinton and Bush really want the American people to know what they're doing overseas? Don't broadcasters want a larger audience, no matter what? Fenton is arguing for a system that would reduce profits and the credibility of the US Government, and that won't happen soon. If Fenton were serious, he would recommend short-wave radio to hear foreign broadcasts in English. But that has its drawbacks. A good solution would be a weekly newspaper devoted to foreign news. But who would own and control it? Was the foreign news broadcast back in the 1970s and 1980s all that great?The bottom line is this: do the networks, and the Govt., really want us to know there were no \\"weapons of mass destruction\\" in Iraq? That the 1989 invasion of Panama was not needed for America?That \\"globalization\\" is a fraud to impoverish the American people? That Reagan and Bush I supported Osama Bin Ladin?The American public was not informed ahead of time for many big stories (p.3). This is by design of the networks (p.4). The real truth is that most Americans will not waste their time listening to \\"talking heads\\" in a foreign land unless it is relevant. And that eliminates most of the background news that Fenton would want broadcast. You could ask how much of this news is shown on British, French, German, or Italian TV. Could it be that the American voter is irrelevant in a system of fixed and rigged elections, where the Corporations and the President do as they wish? Why did it take so long for the media to break the story of prisoner abuse at Abu Ghraib (p.10)? Has outsourcing damaged the credibility of TV news (p.12)?There is no entry in the index for \\"Westmoreland\\". After CBS successfully defended itself against the General, it was sold to new owners. What changes did they make? [See pages 71-72.] Did the FBI fail to follow up the connections to the 1993 WTC attack (p.21)?. Are the network news the equivalent of junk food (p.22)? Was there really \\"a massive and damaging cutback in military and intelligence funding\\" (p.27)? Fenton summarizes the events in Russia on page 30; was this so reported on TV? Fenton says America last saw the horrors of war in 1814; he had overlooked the Civil War, the Indian Wars, even the incursion into 1916 Texas. Fenton uses \\"60 Minutes\\" as a showpiece; but you should know that the questions asked are often created in editing to add drama to the subject's answers! Fenton tells about foreign bureaus (p.65), but not of their work product. The events noted on page 81 can be best covered in a magazine article, not in a few minutes of TV. Chapter 4 documents the use and abuse of the press (p.97). Does the rest of the world get better news (Chapter 5)? \\"Voices Inside the Industry\\" say the reporting of world news is inadequate (p.143). Chapter 7 says we know little of what our Govt. is doing around the world, and its not in the nightly news. Censorship of foreign news is Washington's policy (pp.207-213). What can be done?Chapter 9 has his \\"Solutions\\". Like other special-interest pleaders, he claims that what benefits him is good for the country. My experience is that 30 minutes with your local newspaper will tell you more than TV news. Your results may vary."},{"Title":"Bad News: The Decline of Reporting, the Business of News, and the Danger to Us All","review":"If you buy the role Fenton proposes for the media, then perhaps you might like this book more. But since he simply posits that the media is there to protect the country, promote unity, and a whole list of other (about 10 total) roles of the media, and then fails to explain why this is the media's role.....I sit there questioning this expansive role of news.I see the newsmedia as a source of information. They are to provide the people with the who/what/where/how and why of what is going on in the world at large and locally. They are NOT to be ideology machines, whether good or bad ideologies.Fenton observes how foreign news has drastically declined since the Cold War and how disastrous this has been. Here, describing the ins and outs of his field he excels, and does not spare any administration or political position. Yet he fails to notice that the reason why it was so much easier to report news in the Cold War era, and why his goals of unifying the country blah blah were so much more attainable is because we had an obvious enemy in front of us. In today's society, what foreign threat do we focus upon? Terrorism, the middle east, n. korea, chinese economic expansion, resurgent russian and japanese nationalism? Its unfortunate and a very valid point that the newsmedia seems to focus on NONE of these, at least with their own correspondents abroad. But Fenton's attacks often draw upon the sympathies of a post-911 world. Of course the news, like the government should have paid more attention to Bin Laden and company. We now that NOW. But hindsight is 20/20."},{"Title":"Bad News: The Decline of Reporting, the Business of News, and the Danger to Us All","review":"Fenton's plaint is well-taken: Americans need to be better informed. But, as humorist Dave Barry once noted, try to get them to read a four-part newspaper series on bauxite mining, and they'll flip to the sports pages. What to do? As the cliche has it, there are No Easy Answers here.Fenton blames the news media's corporate ownership for the decline of the news. Maybe. But it was a CBS marketing exec, not anybody in the news department, who first sounded the internal klaxon on the fake Air National Guard memos. The newsies wanted so badly for them to be true, they couldn't be bothered to properly verify them.What's truly remarkable is the mention made of liberal media bias, and the advent of bloggers. These are noted in passing, and are basically \\"of-course\\"d aside, but it's still startling to see a major media figure even acknowledge their existence. Maybe the MSM is coming out of denial on this score. I guess they'd have to, sooner or later. You can't be a gatekeeper when the walls are down.Throughout, Fenton casts the Bush Presidency as a calamitous consequence of the failures of the news media. Sorry, not buyin'. This is merely a retread of the liberal notion that the American public are too stupid to vote in their own best interests, unless liberals tell them what those interests are. As for Bush being culpable for 9/11, as he insinuates at one point, the reader is galled anew at the cheek of liberals, who hold their guy Clinton blameless for his eight years of dithering, yet point fingers at the Bush team for not sorting out the muddle in eight months.Fenton's conclusions are pessimistic: TV news needs to be expanded, and fortified, but how can extended news programs draw a viewership? The public probably isn't up to it, is the glum conclusion. Fenton is right that if internet gossip replaces hard news, then the citizenry will suffer. But the success of substantial major blogs, which have caught out major media outlets in errors, distortions, and downright fabrications these past few years, bodes well for the public's appetite and capacity for hard, informed news. If TV can't deliver it anymore, then that's hardly the public's fault."},{"Title":"Bad News: The Decline of Reporting, the Business of News, and the Danger to Us All","review":"I remember that I thought, at times, that American news shows would do better if they watched BBC or listened to NPR.

(I still don't know when it actually became a war, in terms of the offical U.S. forein policy). The U.S. disregarding the U.N.'s inspection/judgement was enough at least for some of us to doubt any yet-coming-out proof of existence of WMD's. It is a piece of news, indeed informative one, if we hear a simple truth like it's too risky for reporters to go into certain regions and don't really know what's going on there or the U.S. goverment didn't allow reporters to go to certain areas, etc. Again, some of us figured anyway because we never heard iraqis talk on TV--even now we do rarely on radio (to tell you the truth i haven't had a TV for a long time).

This book was published in the U.S. in 1968 as &quot;The Fall of Berlin&quot;. The book is out of print but you can still occasionally find them through one of the online auction houses. I paid $12 for my copy.Chuikov's tale of the endgame of WWII in Europe is a fascinating contrast to his first book, &quot;The Battle for Stalingrad&quot;. This book begins with Chuikov's 8th Guards Army fending off a German counterattack at the Dniester River and ends with the final surrender of the Germans in Berlin. By this time, Chuikov and his 8th Guards have become the &quot;go-to&quot; guys for the Soviet Army. Having proven themselves in Stalingrad, they know in advance that they have been selected for the final storming of Berlin.Chuikov reveals himself to be a fascinating character - keenly observant and insightful about both military tactics and human nature, honest to the point of bluntness, personally courageous under fire, and intolerant of fools, cowards, and military stupidity. He is also a diehard Communist, and more than capable of sucking up to the right people (like Nikita Khrushchov, who he first met at Stalingrad).Chuikov's 8th Guards are called upon to undertake a wide range of difficult assignments, ranging all the way from the savage guerilla style defense of Stalingrad, blitzkrieg attacks on the German defensive line at the Bug River, storming the fortress at Kustrin (another Soviet General had made the mistake of incorrectly reporting to Moscow that the fortress had already been taken when it had only been bypassed - Chuikov the trusty go-to guy was called upon to bail everybody out of this embarrassing dilemma), and then finally the &quot;honor&quot; of storming Berlin.It is worth noting that while street to street fighting is a virtual anathema to most of the Western world's military, here in this book, Chuikov describes an outline of how it is to be done correctly. In essence, Chuikov gives leeway for planning the attacks on individual buildings and streets to small groups of soldiers, the storm groups, and lets them decide on the proper usage of artillery and tanks, making sure that his soldiers have plenty of both. The storm groups were always led by veteran and proven soldiers. It is interesting to contrast this approach to the top-heavy approach of the Germans at Stalingrad, and how the Germans never figured out how to use their troops, tanks, and artillery as well as the Russians. A great deal of Chuikov's success, it becomes clear, came from his ability to select and surround himself with subordinates who could carry out his orders while acting and thinking independently.Of course, Chuikov does not mention in this book the heavy casualties that his 8th Guards suffered or about the rape and pillaging by Soviet soldiers in the conquered German territories. Or about the tens of thousands of Russian soldiers who were executed so that the rest would fight bravely.Chuikov wrote the book, it seems, primarily to counter the impression left by the memoirs of the defeated German generals, that the Soviets won only because of superior numbers of men and weapons. Indeed, the Soviets did have an overwhelming advantage, but military quality also counted - it still took someone with the brains to figure out how to get the job done. And, Vasili Chuikov, field commander of the 8th Guards Army, and later the Supreme Commander of Soviet Land Forces, got the job done for the Soviets in World War II."},{"Title":"Tangled Destinies","review":"The back cover reads:&quot;He was a stranger from the wrong side of town.

The story unfolds like a usual mystery - the suspects are considered one by one, and Bailey follows a number of false leads before suddenly discovering the real killer at the end of the novel.\\"If Looks Could Kill\\" was a quick, easy read. I loved that it was set in New York City, and it was very sexy at times. It was obvious to me that White had inside knowledge of the Fashion Industry herself - every character's outfit was described in lengthy detail, and that helped me form a detailed picture of each character in my mind's eye.Unfortunately, I felt that the story dragged in places. Bailey followed one lead after another, but without any real depth or insight. Just one task after another, as if I was watching someone go through their daily routine - and it stirred up about that same level of excitement. The writing style was very simple. It was meant to be edgy at times, using slang and words someone young might utter, and I suppose it fit in with the New York theme. The entire tone of the novel was very light, even while it tackled such a heavy topic as murder.As far as the characters go, I liked Landon best out of all of them, and I wish he had been given more depth as a character. Unfortunately, he only appeared in a couple of scenes. The same was true of Jack, who I also instantly liked. Oddly enough, I didn't quite take to any of the women, including Bailey herself. They all seemed aloof, whiny, and just slightly out of my grasp and understanding.Bottom line: a light, entertaining read, but simplistic and predictable in the end."},{"Title":"If Looks Could Kill: A Bailey Weggins Mystery","review":"I really loved this book. I will be honest, this is my first mystery book to read...EVER! And I couldn't have read a better first book then this one! I'm now an avid fan of both mystery books and Kate White! If you're not sure about buying this book, don't bother being worried about it, just buy it; you'll love it!"},{"Title":"If Looks Could Kill: A Bailey Weggins Mystery","review":"Kate White spins a tale that is a quick, fun summer read. The main character in this book truely leaves no stone unturned as she tries to help her boss find out who murdered the Nanny. Everyone is a suspect. Set in the world of Fashion magazines the book mixes Sex and the City single life with Mary Higgins Clark. The story did get a little lengthy but this did not detract from the novel. Overall it's a great beach read."},{"Title":"If Looks Could Kill: A Bailey Weggins Mystery","review":"I had heard and read mixed reviews about this novel and curiousity got me to borrow it from my library. I just finished it and I have to admit that I did enjoy it. White wrote with a sure direction of where she was going with the story. Her twists and turns made the story continually interesting to read because there were so many ways that the murder could have been committed that I kept reading to find out what happened. Perhaps too many lines were devoted to describing the wardrobe of the characters and a few more lines could have been devoted to exploring the motive of the killer. The discovery of who did it and the confrontation between them and Bailey occurs in the span of one chapter and seemed too quick for such a good build up in the pages before. Overall, this was a great murder mystery that leaves the door open to future capers for our Miss Weggins to solve!"},{"Title":"If Looks Could Kill: A Bailey Weggins Mystery","review":"If Looks Could Kill is one of my all time favorites!

It is funny and intriguing. I highly recommend this fast and entertaining read."},{"Title":"If Looks Could Kill: A Bailey Weggins Mystery","review":"I was intrigued by the hype--Bridget Jones/Sex and the City/Nancy Drew and figured this would be a good summer read. I assumed the heroine would be smart, tough and funny (a la Janet Evanovich's Stephanie Plum but without the unfortunate fashion sense). Sadly, the plot was predictabe and simplistic; White tries to throw in twists to keep the reader guessing, but the whiny characters that never get past two-dimensions leave the reader not really caring who did it or why and just wishing they could off the rest of the cast. Bailey has more panic attacks than your average Paxil user and never rises to the occasion of spunk and toughness that great female detectives reach. Boring boring boring."},{"Title":"If Looks Could Kill: A Bailey Weggins Mystery","review":"This reminded me of mystery novels I read as a kid. It took me 3 weeks to finish because it just didn't hold my interest. It seemed so standard and ho hum for adults. I wanted to get away from the serious and depressing books from other book clubs and just enjoy a good mystery. This just didn't do it."},{"Title":"If Looks Could Kill: A Bailey Weggins Mystery","review":"I, too, was expecting to do backflips over this book, based on the reviews I had heard. While I can't say it was a waste of my time (especially since it took only a day-and-a-half to read), and it was entertaining, I was left scratching my head as to what the fuss was all about.This book would have been a lot better had Kate White spent less time describing the various breakfasts, lunches, and dinners Bailey consumed, and more time on character development. Also, for someone in the magazine world, White's description of what goes on behind the making of a fashion magazine was rather bland. I must admit the cracking the case alongside Bailey was fun, even though the plot twists were easy to spot. The ending was way too quick. White spent more time describing Bailey's public transportation woes than she did explaining the motives of the killer.There is potential in this book, and I would be interested in seeing how this series develops. However, reading it made me wonder whether or not it would have been published to such rave reviews had Jane Noname submitted it."},{"Title":"If Looks Could Kill: A Bailey Weggins Mystery","review":"Ok...I picked up this book because of Kelly Ripa's recommendation and I don't think I'll ever read another of her book selections again. This book was easy to read, but it was quite boring and therefore, pretty far from entertaining. First of all, it seems like half the book is spent describing what the main character, Bailey, is eating, where in New York City she is going, and how she is getting there. WHO CARES??! Then, I found one motive for the murder/murders to be sooo completely absurd that it was laughable...\\"there's a big plot to kill all the editors of women's magazines.\\" Oohhh, what an idea. I'm sorry, but once again I have to say, \\"WHO CARES??!\\" I am honestly and completely surprised by reviewers who are giving this book great reviews. It makes me wonder what their intellingence levels are. Do they like to watch Ricki Lake and wrestling?? Well, needless to say, I would never read another book by Kate White again and I'm sad that I actually spent money on this one."},{"Title":"If Looks Could Kill: A Bailey Weggins Mystery","review":"If Looks Could Kill is an ok effort, but falls kind of flat on it&#65533;s face in the mystery department. Bailey Weggins is an appealing character, but the story itself does not hold up for her to shine. The book&#65533;s main problem is the fact that it&#65533;s not really centered on the mystery at hand but more on the nuances of the publishing world of magazines. Not to say that the magazine business is not an interesting topic but when it almost over shadows the story at hand, then there&#65533;s a problem.It&#65533;s an ok effort but it should have been better. I will though pick up the next book in the series to see if the Character of Bailey Weggins get a better story to shine in."},{"Title":"If Looks Could Kill: A Bailey Weggins Mystery","review":"This book is great - fast-paced, interesting and NOT gory.

You will love it."},{"Title":"If Looks Could Kill: A Bailey Weggins Mystery","review":"I was looking for a summer book that was easy to read, quick to read and fun to read. This fit the bill! The story flows easily and is like others state a basic murder mystery. Kelly picks are on the totally opposite end of the spectrum of Oprah picks and to that I say good! This book is a book to read, no messages in the end, no re-reading pages 5 times to understand it, no deep thinking, no hmmmm ending. Just a plain good summer read. End of story. If your looking for something more than you need to check out the Oprah picks instead."},{"Title":"If Looks Could Kill: A Bailey Weggins Mystery","review":"If you want a funny book that deals with magazine publishing, check out Marian Keyes \\"Sushi for Beginners\\". It's not out in the US yet but can be ordered through Amazon.uk.It's a much funnier book with heroines who actually qualify as \\"gutsy\\". I thought \\"If looks could kill\\" was very [bad] and the main characters were a pretty unappealing lot. Must the women in this books be obsessed with men that treat them like they're disposable? Do most of the men have to come across as jerks?The mystery itself was not terribly clever, the characters were cardboard and there wasn't enough magazine publishing details to really make it fun. Personally I would have much preferred a version where the detective was the deposed editor in chief (i.e. the Helen Gurley Brown character. At least it would have been a little more imaginative."},{"Title":"If Looks Could Kill: A Bailey Weggins Mystery","review":"I purchased this book after hearing it was the first selection by Kelly Ripa for her book club.

No doubt failed authors that are only posting hateful comments out of spite and jealousy of this writer. Jealous that Ms. Rippa selected her book over theirs!Maybe all you green-eyed monsters should do something more constructive with all that spare time on your hands...why not change vocations in life and become nicer human beings for starters???

I'm jumping on Amazon to dive into my next Bailey Weggins mystery now!"},{"Title":"If Looks Could Kill: A Bailey Weggins Mystery","review":"The story starts off with free-lance journalist Bailey Weggins being called by her boss to investigate her nanny not answering a call, when they find a dead body. Even though she's a writer and not a cop, Bailey is given the task of investigating this murder. Bailey's character to me was much more style than substance. She's too cool, too sassy, and not much like a real person. Her relationships in this story fell flat and did not remotely interest me. It seemed as if they were there just so she could have love interests, but like her character had little substance to it.The murder investigation had some good twists and turns to it, but in the end became a little predictable. At times it felt the misdirection was forced, but at least the logical progression of the story made sense. The story moved at a good pace. There was enough going on to keep it interesting, but there wasn't enough to really sink your teeth into.Carl Alves - author of Two For Eternity"},{"Title":"If Looks Could Kill: A Bailey Weggins Mystery","review":"I found that this story was a good read.

The characters are a bit one-dimensional and they all seemed rather cold to me except for Bailey's friend Landon,the ever-present gay friend that seems to be a must have in all novels based in New York these days;however, this is still an engaging read."},{"Title":"If Looks Could Kill: A Bailey Weggins Mystery","review":"I really enjoyed this book-- it was funny in places, spooky in others, and interesting all the way thru. But one thing was never explained, and I'm wondering about it. There was a long section about a man breaking into Landon's house while Bailey was there alone, and the storyline led the reader to believe he was after her. Nothing ever came of this, and was not later explained when the killer was revealed. What was that break-in all about? Someone want to tell me?"},{"Title":"If Looks Could Kill: A Bailey Weggins Mystery","review":"I liked the book If Looks Could Kill.I thought it was great murder mystery.The characters in the book were very interesting.The book kept you interested until the very end.If you love a murder mystery pick up this book and read it.]It is highly recommended."},{"Title":"If Looks Could Kill: A Bailey Weggins Mystery","review":"Kate White is by far the best of the new mystery writers.Her detective Bailey Weggins, magazine crime writer isfantastic at solving crimes. I am old enough to have untilrecently placed all my faith in the mystery writers of the1800's and early 1900's as I havent been able to find anyof today's mystery authors I like -but White knows howto write a book and keep your attention in each book shewrites."},{"Title":"If Looks Could Kill: A Bailey Weggins Mystery","review":"Book did not get interesting until about page 300. Bailey's life wasn't interesting enough to keep the story going. For the most part, Bailey exhibited common sense, but to me there was one glaring (and for me, annoying) idea about the murderer that she ignored. I didn't know who the murderer would be, but I don't think Kate White provided enough clues for a person to definitely know either. In other words, great mystery writers can leave you in the dark and then once you know who did it, you want to slap your head and state how did I miss it? White didn't do that.The book back cover talks about a romance but really there isn't much of one. Bailey states that she wants a relationship when she's with a creep and then she meets a nice guy and almost chases him away with her seeming noninterest. Slightly annoying but not as bad as it could have been. Though the choices she makes romance-wise don't seem to match up with the wise woman otherwise. By the way, Bailey hooks up a guy for casual sex but it is not described graphically.I was able to keep reading it, because I was on vacation and didn't have anything else around. But otherwise, I could have put it down after the first chapter, and I won't be reading another book by Kate White."},{"Title":"If Looks Could Kill: A Bailey Weggins Mystery","review":"Bailey Weggins is in bed with her so-called lover, when her boss, Cat Jones, from Gloss magazine, the magazine in which Bailey freelances about paranormal and mysterious happenings, calls with a frantic tone to her voice. Bailey rushes to Cat's aid, and the two of them soon find the body of Cat's nanny, dead in Cat's Upper East Side town house. Bailey begins doing some investigative research, and soon realizes that Cat was the intended victim of the murder. Now Bailey is searching high and low from Manhattan to Connecticut in search of the true murderer, when she realizes that the killer is now after her. Bailey now needs to stop the killer before she's the next victim of this vicious killing spree.White has created a fantastic character in Bailey Weggins. She's lovable, enticing, and oh-so interesting. Her boss, Cat, is also someone who fans of IF LOOKS COULD KILL will learn to love, and viciously hate at the same time. A fun amateur sleuth mystery that every woman should keep on her bookshelf.Erika Sorocco"},{"Title":"If Looks Could Kill: A Bailey Weggins Mystery","review":"This is an easy, slight, amusing, thoroughly enjoyable read, marred by a clumsily executed denouement. It lacks the literary merits of P.D. James at her best, or the outright hilarity and juice of anything by Janet Evanovich. But for a mass market disposable mystery, it ain't bad. Impressive as a debut, actually. I would certainly check in again with Bailey Weggins should there be a sequel. (By the way, I took this out of the library and might suggest you do the same. That way, you won't feel cheated if you hate it.)"},{"Title":"If Looks Could Kill: A Bailey Weggins Mystery","review":"I found this quick-read to be very intriguing. It's the kind of book that gives you the heebie-jeebies enough to look up from the book and all around you to make sure you're not the next victim. I literally couldn't put it down. I thought I knew 'whodunit' several times throughout the book, but was surprised in the last 15 pages to find it was none of my suspects. I reccommend this book to anyone who likes a good murder-mystery or a quick read."},{"Title":"If Looks Could Kill: A Bailey Weggins Mystery","review":"I was more impressed with this book than I'd imagined I'd be. Though White can't hold a candle to authors like Elizabeth George, P.D. James, and Sue Grafton, she does have a knack for a chatty style that is interesting and involving and draws the reader in. The drawback to this style, though, is that the story tends to get too bogged down by details that don't have much to do with the main plotline.Bailey is a good character but feels a little too stock. She has a backstory and feelings but, at times, she's too given to dialogue that sounds stilted and cliched--especially when someone has done something to give her offense. She sounds like someone at a customer care hotline who's trying to diffuse an angry customer. Still, I liked her well enough and feel that over time and with some additional development she could turn into a pretty engaging character.The mystery itself was fairly interesting though some of the more mundane details of Bailey's life tend to overwhelm it. The reader didn't really need to know every last dish Bailey orders and this was page space that could have been better served by using it to further develop the central murder mystery plot. The ending was too dragged out and Bailey does some truly and utterly dumb things that I think most rational human beings would know enough not to do but the mystery is tied up fairly nicely.In general, this book makes for good beach reading and I feel the author can only get better with time. If, however, you're looking for a more nuanced mystery with complex characters, you'd be better served by reading one of the authors mentioned at the beginning of the review."},{"Title":"If Looks Could Kill: A Bailey Weggins Mystery","review":"Mystified as to how this book can be considered a good mystery.I was hoping for a fun romp through the world of women's magazines. However, Ms. White barely dips into this arena which is unfortunate given that those rare moments are the most fun in the entire book. The characters are two-dimensional bordering on the cliche... We never even get a good description of the office or Cat's domain -- her private office.There were two or three chapters when the pacing was right on, but for the most part the plot drags. Ms. White does a great job in the first chapter setting up this mystery but takes an over long 350 pages to meander through possible solutions (a chapter for each character as possible suspect -- boring!)before rushing to finish. Ultimately, she never even wraps up one of the key incidents/story lines in the book: who was responsible for attacking her at Landon's home in Buck's county? This is just plain sloppy.The worst news of all is that the last line of the book leaves the door open for another installment."},{"Title":"If Looks Could Kill: A Bailey Weggins Mystery","review":"Stop NOW and do not add this to your cart. While this book has been plugged by celebs who may hope a kind word will do them good with it's author, who's the editor of Cosmo, there's not a mystery book on the racks that isn't better-written than this one. A totally haphazard solution, leaden, interchangeable characters, prose with the rhythm and style of a sickly pigeon -- a terrible disappointment, given the build-up."},{"Title":"If Looks Could Kill: A Bailey Weggins Mystery","review":"I knew the name Kate White sounded familiar, I just couldn't place the name with a face until I read the back flap of the book. Of course, she is the editor of Cosmopolitan, my favorite magazine! I was excited to read this book before, but I was really excited after knowing who the author was.Meet Bailey Wiggins, a free lance writer for Gloss, a Cosmopolitanish magazine, that is run by a snibbish woman named Cat. Cat is a very smart, career lady who has made many people mad on her way to the top. Bailey considers her a friend, but really only when Cat needs something. So when Cat calls early one Sunday morning panicking about her Nanny, Heidi, not answering the door, Bailey figures she is just overreacting but decides to humor her. What Bailey finds when she enters the Nanny's apartment is not something she would never wish to see again. She finds Heidi dead after appartently being sick everywhere in the house. Since Bailey writes crime stories, Cat begs her to help find the killer. The things that happen to Bailey are suspensful and sometimes a little scary. In a book where everyone is a suspect, it is a huge who done it until the end.The cover says A Bailey Weggins mystery so we can only hope that she appears in more books and they are just as good. I was not disappointed in this book and I was very glad that I took the time to read. I eaglerly await Kate White's next novel, but for now, I will just keep reading the Cosmopolitan and hoping the next book comes out soon!"},{"Title":"If Looks Could Kill: A Bailey Weggins Mystery","review":"I love mysteries that do not seem like a Murder She Wrote episode. The murder of the nanny of a top fashion magazine editor begins this novel. The main character, Baily, is enlisted to help the editor, Cat, solve the crime so as to be one step ahead of the police.

It is sitting in the corner of my den where I tossed it four days ago.Do not believe the hype- this book is banal. Period."},{"Title":"If Looks Could Kill: A Bailey Weggins Mystery","review":"Kate White's novel mixes sex, surprise, and mystery skillfully, but not with out a few mishaps along the way. The story follows an Amateur Investigation by a magazine reporter, Bailey Weggins, a 33 year old divorcee who is more then eager to help out her boss and semi-friend Cat Jones, magazine head honcho, check out the facts after Cat's 22 year old nanny Heidi dies.There are a number of colorful characters throughout the novel, but I found at times both Kate White and Bailey were trying to hard to place them into labelled boxes, while the theories Bailey developed opened them up for far too much discussion. Read: The characters were a bit cliched at times, but for the most part enjoyable enough. Although Bailey's life is relatively interesting, you are only given glimpses of it as she forges through with her case.The story itself is a very very detailed look at what a person goes through to get to the heart of the truth. In this case, Bailey has amazing skills and should really just be a detective, because even when she discusses other articles she is actually working on, you see the amount of detail and questioning she is up to. While some of the clues and details Bailey stumbles on are a bit far-fetched, and a lot of the leads end up dead (in a metaphorical sense only) the book is very intriguing and kept me wanting to read, mainly just to get it out of the way! Whether or not the killer is obvious, right under your nose, or if you are looking for hidden clues within the book, you'll have a good time reading it. The book does end somewhat abruptly in my opinion, and wraps up the conclusion extremely fast, but leaves the reader relatively satisifed in what the purpose of the book is: To see how BAILEY handles the case, not the police. I reccommend it as a good book to curl up with on a rainy day."},{"Title":"If Looks Could Kill: A Bailey Weggins Mystery","review":"This book was fun to read.

Cat says that Heidi does not respond to her knocks on her apartment. Bailey tries to convince Cat that the woman is probably sleeping with some guy, but when Cat calls everyone leaps. Bailey grabs a cab and goes north to investigate where she finds a dead nanny.Apparently, someone placed poison in a box of Godiva chocolates that Heidi had taken from a party hosted by Cat. The editor wonders if Heidi was the intended victim? She insists that her true crime \\"reporter\\" investigate. Unable to persuade Cat to let the police do their job, Bailey begins making inquiries, but soon finds clues taking her from New York to the surrounding states.IF LOOKS COULD KILL is an exciting journalistic investigative tale that is at its best when Cat is off stage. Bailey is fabulous as she makes the rounds trying to balance her personal life, her regular assignments (no relief), and her new task. Cat might have the ability to make the city's superheavyweights wear rubber underwear, but her whole reaction to the Heidi caper seems out of character as she acts more like a damsel in distress because she saw a mouse. Still the trip through the media circus from within, a strong who-done-it with plenty of red herrings, and a great \\"shoe slut\\" makes Kate White's mystery quite entertaining.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"If Looks Could Kill: A Bailey Weggins Mystery","review":"I very much enjoyed this story.

Debut mystery by a young editor with a wicked sense of humor, an insider's take on the world of women's magazines, an eye for detail, and a great sense of pace. Its gloss (and I mean this in a complimentary sense) reminded me of Mary Higgins Clark -- perfect for a laid-back summer read. The heroine is appealing, and the book is well-plotted for the most part...though some of the characters are exaggerated to the point that relationships (e.g. Bailey and K.G., Cat and Bailey, Cat and Jeff)are a bit hard to believe. Enjoy it for what it is...."},{"Title":"If Looks Could Kill: A Bailey Weggins Mystery","review":"I had high hopes for this book as &quot;light summer reading&quot;. I was highly disappointed.

When a frantic phone call sends Bailey uptown to the Jones' brownstone, she finds one very dead live-in nanny, and one very scared and upset editor. The police suspect poisoning, and the culprit turns out to be a half eaten box of Godiva chocolates. It soon becomes clear that the intended victim may not have been the nanny at all. Using her crime-writing investigative skills, Bailey jumps into this mess with both feet, and unofficially starts asking hard questions, and in the process, ruffling more than a few feathers. And with no lack of suspects or motives, it becomes crystal clear that if she's not careful, she might be next..... Take Sex In The City, add a little Murder She Wrote, and you've got Kate White's debut mystery, If Looks Could Kill. Her well paced plot twists, turns, and keeps the reader guessing to the end. The writing is breezy and entertaining, the characters fun, though a bit light and underdeveloped, and as Cosmopolitan's editor and chief, Ms White's indepth knowledge of New York City, and expertise in the fashion world and magazine business, adds real credibility to the story. This is the perfect whodunit for lazy days at the beach or a long plane ride, and with the promise of a new series, Bailey Weggins is a character you'll certainly want to get to know."},{"Title":"If Looks Could Kill: A Bailey Weggins Mystery","review":"Kate White's books are all fun to read and easy to lose yourself in. This one is no exception! Perfect to stash in a beach bag and read when you have a whole day to devote--you won't want to put it down! It's not a \\"lowest common denominator\\" kind of mystery--it's actually quite thrilling without being too twisted to follow. I loved every minute, and look forward to reading more of Kate White's books."},{"Title":"If Looks Could Kill: A Bailey Weggins Mystery","review":"Fun read. The author leads you to believe everyone is guilty. Definitely a book to make any commute bearable."},{"Title":"If Looks Could Kill: A Bailey Weggins Mystery","review":"I had previously read Kate White's novel A Body to Die For which had the same lead character, Bailey Weggins as If Looks Could Kill does. A Body to Die For was a lot faster paced with more interesting and realistic characters than this novel. If Looks Could Kill spends too much time and too many words trying to outline Bailey Weggin's character than is necessary which means the novel gets rather boring at times. An all right read but not in the same category as A Body to Die For, get that one instead.In If Looks Could Kill Bailey Weggins works as a writer in Mahattan for a woman's magazine and one early Sunday morning she is pulled away from a good time between the sheets by a phone call from her boss demanding she accompany her to check on her nanny. Bailey finds the corpse of the nanny and it soon becomes apparent she has died from poisoned chocolates. Bailey suspects the chocolates weren't meant for the nanny but instead her boss and decides to use her journalistic skills to find out just what happened. Of course this sort of thing does not please the murderer."},{"Title":"If Looks Could Kill: A Bailey Weggins Mystery","review":"Kate White's debut novel introduces amateur sleuth Bailey Weggins (what a name!); she is newly divorced, and dating, albeit somewhat reluctantly. Bailey writes for a Gloss, a sexy fashion magazine run by good friend Cat Jones. Cat lives the dream life of a high-powered Manhattan magazine exec, married to a dreamboat...until her nanny is murdered. The intended victim appears to be Cat herself, however, and Cat calls friend Bailey to have her do a little investigation herself outside of what the police are doing...she wants to make sure that gorgeous-and-now-dead nanny Heidi wasn't involved in anything that could prove embarrassing to her or the magazine. But Bailey may be in over her head...as it seems as though the murderer is now stalking Bailey herself.A serviceable mystery, it's certainly an enjoyable read. Readers may find themselves becoming annoyed with \\"heroine\\" Bailey and her lapses in common sense ( who walks around Bucks county in the dead of night when they know they are being stalked?) with regard to both her own safety and her love life (i.e., the elusive commitmentphobic K.C.)...but a fun read it is, although I felt it lacked a certain spark. There was not enough insight into the behind-the-scenes activities of a fashion magazine; it is certainly not deserving of a Sex In The City comparison (as indicated in one review). But if you'd like a fun, uncomplicated mystery with a Manhattan backdrop, this may be what you're looking for.DYB"},{"Title":"If Looks Could Kill: A Bailey Weggins Mystery","review":"LOOKS COULD KILL by Kate WhiteWarner Books, 2002 $22.95 0-446-53023-9This debut novel by COSMOPOLITAN editor in chief Kate White arrived in the bookstores with much advance buzz. I was afraid that the buzz would be based on who the author is rather than the actual merits of the book. Given the plethora of superb mystery novels being published by authors who are themselves not celebrities, as well as, the fact that this novel is merely ordinary, my fears are well realized.Bailey Wiggins is a true crime writer who works for \\"Gloss\\" magazine one of the major woman's magazines. She is called one Sunday morning to Cat Jones' NYC apartment. Cat is the editor and chief of \\"Gloss\\". The problem is that Cat has gotten no response from her child's live in nanny, Heidi, who appears to be at home in her apartment but is not answering her phone or door. Bailey is asked to come over and investigate. Heidi is soon discovered dead-poisoned, apparently, by chocolates intended for Cat. The murder might be similar to the recent death of an editor at another magazine. Could there be a connection? Cat asks Bailey to investigate.When a celebrity decides to write a mystery the question must arise as to why?Perhaps it could be to attempt to explain what their life is like or to give an insider's view into a certain industry be it entertainment, politics, warfare, law etc. They might have a favorite agenda to push such as environmental or medical concerns. The hope is the individual will succeed in, not only pushing their agenda, but, in writing a solid and entertaining mystery. Kate White has managed to put together a competent book. Actually, it is quite good considering that writing fiction is not what she does for a living. Her mystery is relatively routine and offers nothing unique to the habitual mystery reader. Characters range from highly stereotypic to the somewhat interesting. In reading this book, there is little to be learned about the world of the glamour glossy magazines. Kate White simply did not adequately use her background as one would expect given that Cat is very much based on herself. However, Ms. White's prose flows quite smoothly through the pages and the story is entertaining enough. However, the mystery aficionados will probably not be fully satisfied."},{"Title":"If Looks Could Kill: A Bailey Weggins Mystery","review":"I picked up Kate White's If Looks Could Kill during an impulse purchase at Kennedy Airport's bookshop. Glad I did! If Looks Could Kill is an entertaining -- albeit light -- mystery that kept me turning the pages throughout the gruesome six-hour flight to the UK.The novel introduces the reader to Bailey Weggins -- a single, thirty-something-year-old Manhattanite and true crime reporter for Gloss magazine. With an enjoyable career and new romantic prospect, Bailey's life couldn't better. That is until Cat Jones, the editor-in-chief at Gloss, makes the phone call that turns Bailey's life upside down...At the risk of using a cliche, If Looks Could Kill is Bridget Jones and Nancy Drew rolled into one. White mixes whodunit suspense with single-girl-living-in-Manhattan exploits. The results make quite a chic mystery. This novel isn't meant to provoke one's intellect, but for sheer summer escapism it can't be beaten. I recommend this novel for an afternoon on the beach or for light entertainment during a rather long flight..."},{"Title":"If Looks Could Kill: A Bailey Weggins Mystery","review":"I enjoyed this book. It was certainly not up to the standards of my usual mystery novels, such as those written by Linda Fairstein, but it was a pleasant little read. I didn't dislike the characters as much as some reviewers seem to do, but I also will say that I don't think Kate White went very far in trying to disguise the characters from the people she knows in real life. Even the doctors Bailey talks to in the book have names and positions very, very close to the people that Ms. White thanks in the acknowledgement page - this, to me, is a sure sign of a first novel - where you can't think of names that aren't similar to your friends' (or enemies') names, jobs, descriptions, etc. Hopefully the next books (and yes, there is a least one more coming) will dampen down on that \\"drawing from life\\" tendency a bit.Also, I was a little put off by some of the assumptions that the author makes about her audience's lack of knowledge. I grew up in a tiny town in Central Illinois, and will admit to having never been in NYC. However, I don't need to be told that \\"the Village\\" means Greenwich Village, or what the Hamptons are, or even what the Circle Line Tour is. I guess I assume that anyone picking up a mystery novel by the editor of Cosmo might have a working knowledge of the culture of NYC - especially when it's so touted as a \\"Sex and the City\\" type deal. The reviews and marketing all are aimed at a type of reader that probably knows this stuff. I felt a bit patronized with some of those basic explanations that really didn't seem necessary - it seemed like she was TRYING to cover all her possible audience bases, which distracted me from the story.Also, I think that the fashion descriptions, while certainly something that Ms. White would be interested in, may not hold up if the book is ever reprinted in a few years. It's something that I notice when reading fluff - if the fluff is from the '80's, you notice and kind of mock the clothing descriptions. The best authors keep that kind of thing to a minimum, so that the book will hold up in the future.That being said, the mystery was enjoyable enough, though most dedicated mystery readers will figure out all the plot twists about 2 pages ahead of the heroine. Still, it wasn't a waste of time if you're not expecting the \\"great American novel\\"."},{"Title":"If Looks Could Kill: A Bailey Weggins Mystery","review":"This book was a great mystery and a nice look at the magazine industry as well. I hope Ms. White takes this very likeable character and makes this a series."},{"Title":"If Looks Could Kill: A Bailey Weggins Mystery","review":"If Looks Could Kill is a lot of fun--a sort of hybrid murder mystery-romantic comedy (with more of an emphasis on the comedy than on the romance). It is quite possible that a true mystery purist may take issue with the novel--so if that's you, consider yourself warned. This novel is all about having fun and being amusing. Cat Jones nanny is found dead one morning by our narrator Bailey Weggins, a newly divorced New Yorker. Both Cat and Bailey inhabit the glamorous New York fashion magazine world. Cat is the editor-in-chief of a Cosmo-like publication and Bailey freelances there. The mystery has several twists and turns and it is all told with much humor. It is an engaging story and a very quick read. Very enjoyable, if not very deep. A novel to have fun with and not take too seriously. Enjoy."},{"Title":"If Looks Could Kill: A Bailey Weggins Mystery","review":"I thought this book was fun and kept my interest, which is sometimes hard to do. The only thing that stuck out in my mind throughout was how in the world did Bailey pack so many things into each day? One minute she's working out, then the next, she's already showered, dressed, and out the door. Come on! Please give us a realistic time frame! All that can't be done in less than an hour. And each day was like this. The girl never had time to sleep...and she was ALWAYS eating! ....Despite all that, I still enjoyed it and would recommend it if you're looking for something easy and intriguing to read."},{"Title":"If Looks Could Kill: A Bailey Weggins Mystery","review":"Though Kate White's storyline could definately hold the listener's attention, the reader, Parker Posey, could not have been a worse choice. I found myself focusing on her lack of energy and inappropriate inflection rather than on the story. Though I look forward to more books from White, for me they will have to be in print or with another reader."},{"Title":"If Looks Could Kill: A Bailey Weggins Mystery","review":"I thought this novel was a nice first for Ms. White. I would have rated the book 31/2 stars if they had one because I felt the story was a little better than 3 stars but that wasn't an option and I don't think this book deserved a 4 star review so I had to settle for 3 stars.

And you know what? It was fun to read. It was fun to read the writing itself. But as a book, it just wasn't very good. The only time I got excited was when I thought that maybe the whole &quot;A Bailey Weggins Mystery&quot; was a brilliant device to keep us from suspecting that Bailey would get killed in the end. But that didn't happen. Instead we find out who the killer is and our reaction is, &quot;oh, that makes sense.&quot;"},{"Title":"If Looks Could Kill: A Bailey Weggins Mystery","review":"Gosh, I'm glad I just happened upon this book at the library and picked it up on a whim. It sounds like most of the other readers came into this with unnaturally HIGH expectations and were (of course!!) disappointed. However, with no expectations, no direction from Kelly Ripa, and not knowing what Kate White's day job is, I had the freedom to truly enjoy it. I thought it was a fun, fast read and a well-written mystery with a decent number of plausible villains. I found Bailey to be funny, smart, and gutsy, and I felt all the characters were as fleshed-out as they needed to be.Come on, people, lighten up -- if you want War and Peace, go read War and Peace!"},{"Title":"If Looks Could Kill: A Bailey Weggins Mystery","review":"\\"If Looks Could Kill\\" is about Bailey Weggins, a true crime writer for Gloss magazine who lives in Manhattan.

Bailey arrives at Cat's lavish home, only to find Heidi, the nanny, dead. What killed her? Poisoned Godiva chocolates that were meant for Cat.

I thought it was well written, the characters were interesting and so was the plot. It has many twists and turns and it has you guessing right up until the end.

About two thirds of the way through I thought the plot got a bit convoluted, however.Would like to see more in this series!"},{"Title":"If Looks Could Kill: A Bailey Weggins Mystery","review":"Here's the kind of debut novel that I'm always on the look out for. A great story told with a flair for the comical mixed with a solid and intriguing story. Kate White obviously calls on her experience as a magazine editor to present to us Bailey Weggins. This is a murder mystery with plenty of suspects and a plot that is sure to keep the reader entertained.My own radar on how much I enjoy a book is the time it takes for me to read it. If I rip through in no time flat then it's surely a sure-fire winner and that's exactly what happened this time. Humour and a good mystery are a great combination and done very well here."},{"Title":"If Looks Could Kill: A Bailey Weggins Mystery","review":"Regis read the first few sentences on TV this morning and it was wonderful.

It was a great story, Kate White kept me guessing right until the end who the murderer was. I am looking forward to reading more of these books."},{"Title":"If Looks Could Kill: A Bailey Weggins Mystery","review":"I was pleasantly surprised with this debut from Kate White. It's not Stephanie Plume, but who is? Baily Weggins is a 30-something ameteur sleuth and writer of crime nonfiction when she's plunged into the mysterious death of her boss's nanny. There are a lot of characters and that sometimes makes it difficult to keep up, but White keeps the author guessing at who-dun-it. Suspects keep shifting with new revelations - and I like that. I'm curious to see where Baily goes next - and if she finally finds the man of her dreams.This book is a pleasant mix of chic lit and mystery, with good character development and great prose. Overall, it's an easy read - except from keeping track of all the characters. Give it a shot. There are plenty of copies on sale, so you can check it out and see if it fits your tastes for a reasonable price."},{"Title":"If Looks Could Kill: A Bailey Weggins Mystery","review":"I read this book while on a stalled Amtrak so it did help pass the time in a pleasant way, but this could not be considered a riveting mystery novel. The heroine, Bailey Weggins, is a freelance crime writer for a women's magazine who tries to solve a murder. There are several conceivable villains and the ending is satisfying. The women in this book, including Bailey, seem defined by whether they have a man attached to them, what they wear, how fat or thin they are, and where they work. Bailey is in constant need of a caffeine fix. To say they are self absorbed is an understatement. There is never any reflection or sense of empathy for others. For a light summer read, this is fine. It is inexpensive to buy--but checking it out of the library might be an even better idea."},{"Title":"If Looks Could Kill: A Bailey Weggins Mystery","review":"If this is an example of a book from Kelly Ripka's list, I'm glad I've never thought to check it out. If Looks Could Kill started out okay, but by about Chapter 8 I had to start skimming to get to the end. The main character just couldn't carry the book and I hated having to read through every single thought process. Then there was the part with Bailey and her current boyfriend who she finds is cheating on her towards the end -- this added nothing to the story and seems like it was just thrown in for padding."},{"Title":"If Looks Could Kill: A Bailey Weggins Mystery","review":"God, the book starts out good. It gets old and tiresome in the middle with a bunch of stuff you could skip and go to the last chapter and never knew you missed anytrhing. Thats what I did, when I got to page 180 and jumped to chapter 22 and finished it from there. I have to say the last chapter was the best of the whole book... too bad the rest wasn't like it."},{"Title":"If Looks Could Kill: A Bailey Weggins Mystery","review":"I have been reading the books recommend by Kelly Ripa's book club Reading with Ripa. If Looks Could Kill had a good story line. It was intriguing, suspenseful and it was written from Bailey Weggins point of view, which from my understanding is the hardest way to write. This is the first novel I have read that was written that way and it took me some time to adjust to it. I give credit to Kate White for writing that way. I really like Bailey, she is a very likable character. I agree with some of the other reviewers that the book was a little long. The chapters went on forever. The ending of the book was really good. If Kate White writes another book about Bailey Weggins perhaps maybe she should change careers and become a Private Investigator, she's pretty good at it."},{"Title":"If Looks Could Kill: A Bailey Weggins Mystery","review":"Bailey Weggins is a single girl in NYC who makes her living as a freelance journalist specialising in crime stories. Early one Sunday she gets a call from her friend Cat Jones who is also editor of Gloss magazine and thus indirectly her boss. It turns out that Cat's very attractive nanny (Heidi) is dead. When it turns out that Heidi was poisoned, and then that Cat herself may have been the target, Bailey steps in as amateur detective. Many of her friends and colleagues are suspects - but who will have committed the crime, and can Bailey catch them before she herself becomes a victim?This is a fun book, with plenty of twists and red herrings to keep you guessing and a Sex in the City style sub-plot which I also enjoyed. Kate White works for Cosmopolitan and that shows in her knowledge of the magazine industry. It's genuinely suspenseful in parts but never gory or really scary. I've recommended this book to several of my friends and those who have read it have also really enjoyed it."},{"Title":"If Looks Could Kill: A Bailey Weggins Mystery","review":"This book has it all - romance, murder, mystery, fashion, ambition, and glamour. If Looks Could Kill is a non-traditional fun murder-mystery, that is easy to follow and fun to read. Great to see strong female characters with real issues (if not real lives). Much more funny and likeable that a traditional murder mystery novel, I read somewhere a description of this book that sums it up for me -- Sex in the City meets Nancy Drew. It was refreshing for me to see two of my favorite genres of books meld together into a fun, page-turning novel."},{"Title":"If Looks Could Kill: A Bailey Weggins Mystery","review":"This is an amusing little mystery.

Don't wonder, just buy it!"},{"Title":"If Looks Could Kill: A Bailey Weggins Mystery","review":"I wasn't going to write a review until I read what the others had written. But, I have to say that this book was SO boring. The end was so lame that I was mad when I read it. This is one of those books where you can skip entire chapters and only miss what she had for breakfast. I am thinking of throwing this book away to save the next unsuspecting victim. This book had to much drivel and not enough meat, which is too bad. The initial concept reeled me in."},{"Title":"If Looks Could Kill: A Bailey Weggins Mystery","review":"So folks are ticked at Kelly Ripa on a personal level for recommending this book? Give her a break, it was a personal preference, she's still cute as could be and sooooo much better than Kreepie Lee Gifford any day of the week. Oprah tanked on many a book club book. MANY.On to the book... so, it's marketed as Bridget Jones meets Nancy Drew... the flap of the book even touts its comparisons to Sex and the City. BIG FAT LIE. It has none of Bridget's achingly real self deprecation or hilarity. It has none of Nancy Drew's even eighth grade level of suspense. It has not an ounce of Sex and the City's heat. This book is at best a knock off of anything written by Mary Higgins Clark with a slightly (SLIGHTLY!!) hipper heroine. It's awful.The characters are totally one dimensional. If Kate White can't be bothered to invest in Bailey (her main character) why the heck should I? Bailey is cute and smart and sexy but only because she says so. There is not a written word in the whole book to suggest that it is true. Her boss Cat is the shallowest of them all. Everyone in this story is typecast. Leslie=Witch. Cat=Shallow. KC=Commitmentphobe (*note to Kate- borrowing a one word phrase from Bridget is not enough to qualify as Bridgetesque book). This book is strictly PG and if Kate White has any sense she'll pull the sheet off her ghostwriter immediately.Wait for the paperback, but if you can't wait, at least save your money and take it out of the library. ..."},{"Title":"If Looks Could Kill: A Bailey Weggins Mystery","review":"The first in the Bailey Weggins series, \\"If Looks Could Kill\\" shows that Kate White isn't just a pretty, fashionable face -- this woman can write!

The pacing was uneven, but mostly slow, the plot didn't hold my interest, and it was too cliched and predictable and superficial to provide a good insider's look at the glossy women's magazine biz. I'm surprised it made it into paperback, or that she ever published another novel. Helps to know people in the indistry, that's for sure!"},{"Title":"If Looks Could Kill: A Bailey Weggins Mystery","review":"I enjoyed the characters and the story line. Will definitely be checking out more of her books. That is all."},{"Title":"If Looks Could Kill: A Bailey Weggins Mystery","review":"This book was written for a younger audience. I was not interested in the hook ups.of this woman. Not my cup of tea."},{"Title":"If Looks Could Kill: A Bailey Weggins Mystery","review":"I'd be the first to admit that I truly enjoy reading books along with a group. When Oprah announced the possible end of her six-year book club, it was a sad day for me. The sadness, however, was replaced with joy as other TV shows and newspapers jumped on the bandwagon and started their own book clubs. While Regis jokes that Kelly's book club could be better known as \\"beach trash reading,\\" this statement couldn't be further from the truth with Ripa's first pick. Prior to this, I had never heard of Kate White and this is one of the reasons I love book groups....you get introduced to authors whose books you might not have picked out on your own. I'm happy to report that White's book is informative, enjoyable and an overall excellent \\"who done it.\\" I read about fifty books in the mystery/thriller genre each year and I must admit that she had me guessing until the very end.IF LOOKS COULD KILL is set in Manhattan where the main characters work together at \\"Gloss Magazine.\\" The author gives the reader a great inside look at both the magazine as well as the fashion industry. Her characters navigate different parts of the city from Greenwich Village to Tribeca to Chelsea to Central Park West in search of their stories and photo shoots. I particularly loved her descriptions not only of the locales but of the outfits worn by her characters as well. It was like being in a Sex And The City episode but, instead of following Carrie Bradshaw around, we get to tag along with Bailey Weggins, the crime story journalist for \\"Gloss. Since she writes about crime, her boss Cat Jones thinks she'll be perfect for trying to solve the mystery of \\"who killed Cat's nanny\\" and remove some of Cat's fears that she, herself, was really the intended victim. In order to get to the bottom of this fiasco, Bailey will travel out of Manhattan into beautiful Bucks County, PA, which, coincidentally, is the home of this reviewer. Imagine my surprise as Bailey drove into my hometown on a picture perfect day. Unfortunately, her trip wasn't as enjoyable as it might have been but you'll have to read the book to find out what happens.So, all in all, I give this book a solid 5 stars in comparison to other books in this genre. I understand the author is working on another book with Bailey Weggins as the main character and I look forward to its release. It was nice for a change not to be reading about the male, alcoholic, divorced, bad-tempered, wisecracking private eye that so many authors are relying on nowadays to sell their books. Instead, we are given a female, who is a loser at love, dresses well, has an exciting job and thinks about things that we readers can associate with on a daily basis.Kudos to you Kelly Ripa for a fine first pick and congratulations to Kate White for being the beneficiary of this notoriety....and well deservedly so, I might add."},{"Title":"If Looks Could Kill: A Bailey Weggins Mystery","review":"I was sort of hesitant to read this one but I couldn't help my curiosity. I'm glad that I read it because it is a nice guilty pleasure. I've been a fan of Janet Evanovich and Sue Grafton for a while now and what I really like about this book is that it combines the best of those two lead characters (Stephanie Plum and Kinsy Millhone respectively) into the fun but serious Bailey Weggins. She is easy to like and her life is not so outrageous as to be unbelievable. It would be very easy to follow her exploits further, so I hope that the fact that the cover advertises If Looks Could Kill as 'a Bailey Weggins mystery' means that there is more to come. As for the writing Kate White does a masterful job plotting out her mystery, leading you in many directions without confusing you and throwing in just the right amount of twists. My one complaint would be that the ending seems to happen pretty quickly, but that hardly takes away from the book and actually leaves you interested in what happens next. All in all this was a thoroughly enjoyable read."},{"Title":"If Looks Could Kill: A Bailey Weggins Mystery","review":"This book is a terrific mystery, with a totally captivating heroine. Bailey Weggins is smart, sexy, very funny, and the reader gets to solve the murder along with her!"},{"Title":"If Looks Could Kill: A Bailey Weggins Mystery","review":"I was moderately disappointed in this book.I found it to be a fairly standard modern murder mystery, a la Mary Higgins Clark. While the writing was solid, it was one-dimensional and the story and characters were generally bland. From the hype, protagonist Bailey is characterized as \\"smart, sexy and gutsy,\\" and I really didn't notice her being anything other than plain and normal; if she was meant to be a Stephanie Plum rip off, the author should go read more Janet Evanovich. Mystery-wise, the killer was always on my short list of suspects, so I had no \\"so THAT's who did it!\\" epiphany like I did from Neil Gaiman's American Gods (which is an excellent book even though the mystery is only a very small sub-plot).What annoyed me the most about the book, though, was the over-use of slang phrases. It seemed like the author was including slang specifically to appeal to a \\"younger\\" audience, yet it ended up just breaking my concentration.Over all, this isn't a bad book. Just nothing spectacular, and something I'd recommend only if you're really bored and in the mood for a plain mystery."},{"Title":"If Looks Could Kill: A Bailey Weggins Mystery","review":"Cat Jones, editor-in-chief of the Cosmo-esque Gloss magazine, goes to confront her nanny early one Sunday morning, and when she doesn't get a response to the live in apartment, who does she call? No, not the police, or her husband. Cat calls Bailey Weggins, friend and freelance crime journalist at Gloss magazine.When Bailey enters the nanny's apartment, she finds the 22-year old nanny dead. And Cat, always the editor-in-chief, assigns Baily to mirror the police investigation and determine what is going on.When I read the pre-releases for IF LOOKS COULD KILL (\\"Bridget Jones Meets Nancy Drew\\") I thought it sounded like a fun book. I've enjoyed good mysteries (such as THE ALPHABET MYSTERY SERIES by Sue Grafton) and I liked THE NANNY DIARIES, so I thought a marriage between the two would be fun.Unfortunately, we get a fairly standard mystery, and somewhat pedestrian plotting.Bailey Weggins is supposed to be observant, beseeched by her friend Cat to involve herself in this mystery because of her unique way of looking at things. Mostly, Bailey looks at clothes. Every character is first described by what they're wearing.Bailey is also into good food. Each chapter has her hankering after a good penne putenesca or a fine rissoto. I almost expect for the recipes and restaurant reviews to be included as an appendix.Also, the motivations of the main characters here are somewhat forced. Why does Cat choose Bailey, of all people, to help her out with this? When Bailey senses herself in danger, why doesn't she just beg off somehow?All in all, this was a disappointing entry into what will probably turn out to be a fairly average mystery series. If you like mysteries in general, or if you are really in to behind the scenes glimpses of glamour magazines, then this book is for you.Otherwise, take a look at some of the other beach reading out there.Kilroy's Rating System:5 stars - Loved it, and kept it on my bookshelf.4 stars - Liked it, and gave it to a friend.3 stars - OK, finished it and gave it to the library.2 stars - Not good, finished it, but felt guilty and/or cheated by it.1 star - I want my hour back!

Hats off to Ms. White!"},{"Title":"If Looks Could Kill: A Bailey Weggins Mystery","review":"Add me to the list of those who are reading all of Kelly Ripa's book selections. I am a huge fan of Kelly, so anything to tells me to read, most likely I'll read. Her first choice, If Looks Could Kill, was a fun, light beginning to her bookclub.Bailey Weggins, true crime reporter for Gloss magazine, receives a frantic call from her boss, Cat -- Cat's live-in nanny, Heidi, has not showed up yet nor does she answer her door. Cat begs Bailey to come over and check things out; she's afraid something has happened to Heidi and doesn't want to be alone. Once Bailey enters Heidi's apartment, something is immediately amiss -- if the smell wasn't a dead giveaway, then Heidi's lifeless body is a sure tip-off. Who killed Heidi, and why? Cat asks Bailey to help solve the mystery, and by the novels' end, everyone seems to be a suspect.Told with a light, easy tone, this mystery is not for die-hard, edge-of-your-seat fans -- this is more for the chick-lit fan who wants something a little different than the norm. Author Kate White did a very good job of keeping me guessing -- I thought the killer was every character at least once throughout the book -- and had me surprised once the killer was revealed in the last few pages. The writing was very easy and flowing, and the New York City setting made it all the more fun, especially since my first trip to NYC was only a few weeks ago. I recommend this book for an entertaining beach read or for anyone wanting a quick, satisfying, light story."},{"Title":"If Looks Could Kill: A Bailey Weggins Mystery","review":"I bought this book after Kelly Ripa recommended it as her first \\"Beach Trash\\" selection expecting a quick, exiting read for summertime. What I got was a very slow-paced, boring story with such forgettable characters, that I can't even remember them as i'm writing this.It's being described as a \\"murder mystery\\", but that's hardly the case. Yes, someone dies, and someone else is in search of a killer. But throughout the entire book, I found myself not really caring who the murderer was and since the list of suspects was longer than a grocery list for a family of 5 who hasn't eaten in over a month...there was really no point in even guessing who it was. And when you finally get to the end and the killer is revealed, you're like \\"Huh?! Who the heck was that person?!\\" I had to go back just to remember who the killer was in relation to the whole story.Long story short, the book sucked. Kelly Ripa picked a really bad first selection and I think was just trying to make sales for Kate White, who's a first time author. (She should stick to Cosmopolitan or Vogue magazine, or whatever it's called and stay away from fiction writing forever.)Now if you want truly trashy, fun, light summer reading with lots of humor & sex, pick up \\"It's My F---ing Birthday\\" by Merrill Markoe. The title obviously caught my attention in the bookstore, and I was hysterical laughing from the first page and kept laughing after I brought it home. Check it out it you really want summer trash!!!"},{"Title":"If Looks Could Kill: A Bailey Weggins Mystery","review":"Maybe there's something wrong with me b/c everyone else seemed to love this book but I found it pretty eh. I got through it in 3 days which is average for me but kept reading b/c i kept expecting it to get better. The first person past tense makes it feel like Bailey is retelling her story to you...but in a boring way. I didn't feel the suspense of being there with her, solving the mystery. Also, I couldn't identify with Bailey's character. She lets her boss, her lover and many others walk all over her. And she doesn't develop into her own person through the story...she's still pretty much a doormat at the end.So overall, I got through the book but there was no WOW at the end of it. So it was just eh."},{"Title":"If Looks Could Kill: A Bailey Weggins Mystery","review":"I love a trashy read, but this IS NOT one. Are people so obsessed with Kelly Ripa they cannot judge a STUPID book when they read one?? The main character, Bailey Weggins, is a vacant, shallow character along with everyone else in the book. Three hundred and fifty pages led to a ridiculous and disappointing ending. Do not waste your time or money on this book!"},{"Title":"If Looks Could Kill: A Bailey Weggins Mystery","review":"Don't go looking for this book to change your life. But if you want to abandon the typical depressing novels that constantly show up on the bestseller lists and pick something up that's light, fun and deliciously engrossing (almost like gossip), then here's your summer read. I'll admit that I had rather low expectations for this book, but was delighted to find that the book was written extremely well and quite witty. You don't usually find light summer fare so well-composed."},{"Title":"If Looks Could Kill: A Bailey Weggins Mystery","review":"I am an new mother and really don't have time to read anymore. This book was just what I was looking for. It's a fast, easy read and I was surprised to find out who the killer was. Yes, lots of food is described in the book and I did find myself craving cappucino's as I read it, but I did enjoy the book. It's not really to be taken seriously, but I got several laughs throughout the read with my favorite being Cat saying she didn't need any security - what she needed was a food taster, but that went out of style 500 years ago!!!!I sure hope we can look forward to more Bailey Weggins' mysteries???????"},{"Title":"If Looks Could Kill: A Bailey Weggins Mystery","review":"I really enjoyed this book. About two thirds of the way through I thought the plot got a bit convoluted, however.Would like to see more in this series!"},{"Title":"If Looks Could Kill: A Bailey Weggins Mystery","review":"Bailey Weggin is your typical thirty something woman who is working for a magazine. But Bailey doesn't write your typical fluffy chick articles. She writes about poltigeists and spirts and murders and that type of stuff. But when something happen with Cat Jone's nanny Bailey finds herself in a whole new world.Bailey starts out by helping Cat figure out how and why someone would want to hurt her nanny Heidi. Bailey looks around and talks to a lot people and finds that possibly the Heidi wasn't the target that person wanted to get. But with the more looking she does the more she uncovers about other people and what had happen.This book keeps you wondering who in the world would want to harm either Cat Jones or Heidi and keeps you guessing till the last few pages.Bailey finds herself getting deeper and deeper in the case and meeting new people whom she has to wonder if possibly they were the ones who might have killed Heidi.This is strong first book from this author. I hope she contiues to write more."},{"Title":"If Looks Could Kill: A Bailey Weggins Mystery","review":"This book is downright boring. The writing has no pop. The dialogue is flat. The lead character of Bailey Weggins is totally forgettable. And the mystery is, well, not very mysterious. I have to believe that Kelly Ripa is a friend of Kate White's and that's why she recommended the book. I won't be taking Kelly's suggestions anymore. If you want to read a wonderful female lead, with great writing, read the Janet Evanovich series with Stephanie Plum. Janet can write!! As for Kate, don't quit your day job."},{"Title":"If Looks Could Kill: A Bailey Weggins Mystery","review":"I really enjoy this book. I kept me turning the pages. I cannot wait to read what other adventures Bailey Weggins will get herself into. This book got me into reading mysteries. I would recommend this book."},{"Title":"If Looks Could Kill: A Bailey Weggins Mystery","review":"I was interested in something along the lines of Johnathan Kellerman. What I found instead was a simply told and predictable story. It had no twists or turns. It was written on a level that would hold a teenager's interest. That could be due to the fact that the writer is an editor for Cosmo mag (correct me if I am wrong). I like books that are fun to read, but I expected this to be spooky and mysterious. It wasn't. The few attempts at plot changes and twists turn out to be false. Usually when I finish a book, I am almost sad that I am done. I finished this one, put it down, and washed dishes."},{"Title":"If Looks Could Kill: A Bailey Weggins Mystery","review":"I was looking for a new mystery writer, having read all of Patricia Cornwell, many Dean Koontz books, recently Harlan Coban and the standby Richard North Patterson. Kate White took forever to stretch this book out, often repeating the same descriptive phrases and recounting the same details. I really can't say I even enjoyed it and it was a chore to finish."},{"Title":"If Looks Could Kill: A Bailey Weggins Mystery","review":"Now Kate White ... *she* knows how to write a mystery. Unlike Stephen Carter's \\"The Emperor of Ocean Park\\", this is a lean, focused mystery. Well, maybe a little too lean but as debuts go, this book held my attention from the first page and made me continue reading until the mystery was solved. The writing is assured, and not wooden or forced. I do agree with some readers who feel the climax was a bit rushed. We spend the whole book wading through red herrings and clues, and when the mystery is finally solved, there is about a half a page of action and that's it. It's a dull thud rather than a fiery denoument.Bailey Weggins is an enjoyable enough narrator, although I do wish that writers would get off their \\"Sex and the City\\" kick. I am not saying Bailey shouldn't have had a complex life but this whole single woman in Manhattan looking for love (and sex) in all the wrong places is rapidly becoming tired. I love strong women in literature, but it's dull when they always need to have a man attached, or be defined by their men and their sex lives. Come on, the women of the world deserve better in the new Millennium. The women in this book (not just Bailey) all seem a little too defined by their material lives, their men, their clothes, their jobs and their gourmet food. It makes them all seem a bit hollow. Yes, I know this was a Kelly Ripa book selection and that just means fun, fluffy reading, but had Bailey been a bit more introspective, I think she'd have come across even better. Well, I suppose we can all wait for the next book. It would seem that this is the first in a series of Bailey Weggins books; if they are as enjoyable as this one, Kate White stands to do quite well."},{"Title":"If Looks Could Kill: A Bailey Weggins Mystery","review":"This is a really good book. I recomend it for people who like light reading. Its a real page turner. Kept my intrest through the whole book. Kate White also gives it alot of personality. I found it funny and entertaining."},{"Title":"Character in Action: The U.S. Coast Guard on Leadership","review":"I was provided a copy of the book when I became a contractor for the USCG. Having a military background already, I was interested in the military history of the USCG. This book has provided me with a glimpse into the mission of the USCG and its leadership style. There are many heart-warming stories of real life heroes that inspire one to the esprit-de-corp that the military resonates.If your looking for a turnkey book on leadership this is not it, but if you are looking for ways to inspire people, and to refine your own personal style than this book is definitely what you are looking for. It is food for thought.Hope you have found this review helpful.Tom"},{"Title":"Character in Action: The U.S. Coast Guard on Leadership","review":"This is an incredibly good book. If you really did not like it.... Re-read it! You missed something!If you think it is a primer on leadership, it is not. What it is... is a great book about an organization that serves incredible service to our country with very few people and very little money. Are people in the Coast Guard perfect? NO! And in spite of that, their HONOR, RESPECT, and DEVOTION TO DUTY help them pull together to make things work- often in spite of incredible odds!Anyone will learn something from this book. Most of us can learn a lot from it, if we are willing to draw the parallels from this agency to our own business. The lesson is Character are compelling. To succeed, we all need to put the right people in the right place at the right time. Seems simple, but in practice, is very hard to do!The book also provides analysis about today's Coast Guard Missions and their alignment with the purposes of the United States Government's purpose of being, as outlined in the preamble of the Constitution! The match between the two is startling! One can easily see why a Coast Guardsman is soooooo motivated as they are patriots and humantitarianists.Good read &amp; good sailing!"},{"Title":"Character in Action: The U.S. Coast Guard on Leadership","review":"As I read through this book, I did not encounter any case studies of conflict management between U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) personnal that required resolution, though there were the occasional references to \\"Coasties\\" who felt that they were really doing unimportant jobs (like looking after a power generator) - until a more senior man comes in and convinces them otherwise.The USCG prides itself in recruiting talent who can do more than one job and can take command in field situations on their own initiative without waiting for orders from on-high; basically, it has an \\"act-first-tell-me-later\\" approach, which appears to have served this two-centuries-old organisation well, including during the terrible events of 9/11.Yet, though Phillips and Loy, the co-authors, give the impression that the USCG runs like a well-oiled machine, they appear to have avoided any discussion of when it does not. Conflict resolution is part of any big organisation, yet no information appears in this book about it. Since the Coast Guard is a culturally homogeneous entity, there is nothing about any clashes of mentality or management styles or thinking.Like the other four main branches of the U.S. armed forces, the USCG is a full-time organisation, and all five do have their Reserve units manned by part-timers who have civilian jobs. It is common practice for selected military personnel to be sent on exchanges, not just within their own country, but also to other countries. U.S. Coast Guardsmen must surely be sent on exchanges, too, yet Phillips and Loy mention nothing about this.I would have liked to have read something about the experience of U.S. Coast Guardsmen temporarily serving in the coast guard of a foreign power, because it could say something useful about the differences in mentalities and in approaches to similar situations, and about any resolutions to disagreements or conflicts. Would the visiting USCG personnel have ideas and suggestions listened to and discussed and implemented - or would they simply be ignored?Armed forces are not the same as civilian corporations, of course, since they are concerned with national defense and power projection rather than profit-making, yet interaction between, say, western and non-western organisations sometimes results in clashes, and I think it would have served the book better, seeing that Phillips has written books on management, had there been examples of conflict and resolution."},{"Title":"Character in Action: The U.S. Coast Guard on Leadership","review":"I thought that this book was definitely worth reading. It was a very easy read, and offered some useful insight. It did a great job characterizing the organizational culture of the USCG.After reading some of the other reviews, I feel it is necessary to say that this book was written by an person who oversaw an organization on a macro level. It is a book about executive level leadership, not functional level leadership.In total, it consisted of nothing more than a typical book about leadership - touchy feely advice...shoulds and should nots...yada yada yada. There were some unique ideas presented in this book compared to other leadership books. Again, it was a really easy read...definitely worth a couple bucks and the few hours it takes to read it."},{"Title":"Character in Action: The U.S. Coast Guard on Leadership","review":"This is not what I would call a book on leadership. It is rather an inspirational book that primarily serves the Coast Guard, and even within the USCG a very small demographic. Mr. Phillips was hired by the USCG an as such offers little to no objectivity. If the people mentioned in the book are truely heroes (and many are) why not mention their names? This book is simply milking the leadership cow. Lincoln on Leadership, MLK on Leadership, Forefathers on leadership.... they're all pretty much the same.Mr. Phillips fails to mention how stagnant we really are. He has a very misinformed perspective on the &quot;real&quot; Coast Guard. The Coast Guard that we have to live and work in every day.We are and have been underfunded for years. It is a misstatement that we do more with less. This would imply efficiency. We may be able to mark more things off of our to-do lists but they are being done with less quality. ADM Loy himself called it the &quot;curse&quot; of sempar paratus. We have so many of our Reserves on active duty that we don't really have a &quot;reserve.&quot;"},{"Title":"Character in Action: The U.S. Coast Guard on Leadership","review":"A primer on naval leadership within the Coast Guard has been long awaited and perhaps we will have to wait some time longer. Mr. Phillips and Admiral Loy combined their collective skills to produce a small text of their personal visions of management within the Coast Guard.The book is well done and easily read in its outline form. The general layout mimics a school lesson plan. There are four parts, each containing four neat chapters and each chapter is laid out with managerial regularity. Each chapter begins, basically, with a quote or two, an introductory sea story or anecdote, the supporting concept information, a reinforcing sea story or anecdote to support the concept and ending with a list of reinforcing notes of do's and don'ts. It is the old formula of Tell \`em what you're going to tell them, Tell \`em and Tell \`em what you told \`em.There is nothing new or inspirational in this volume, nor was there any such claim. The introduction echoed many thousands of public relations releases and the work stems from the Coast Guard's \\"Williamsburg Charter\\" of 1990 introducing Total Quality Management (TQM) to the Coast Guard. Like the TQM system, this book ignores service culture. Some references to service history serve as examples, but these do not denote culture or exact history. It is difficult to teach any character action if all those who come later are operating in a cultural and historical void.The unpopularity of TQM in the Coast Guard was not because of its basic ideas but its implementation. The Coast Guard remains the top-down leadership hierarchical organization it was in 1790. The Coast Guard's leadership model has more in common with Cotton Mather than with Deming, Drucker or Juran. The Coast Guard's placement of TQM is not unlike the 1929 comments of Mao Tse-Tung. He also had difficulties getting his people with the party program noting;\\"There are various non-proletarian ideas in the Communist Party organization in the Fourth Red Army which greatly hinder the application's of the Party's correct line. Unless these ideas are thoroughly corrected, the Fourth Army cannot shoulder the tasks assigned to it in China's great revolutionary struggle. The source of such incorrect ideas in this Party organization lies, of course, in the fact that its basic units are composed largely of peasants and other elements of petty-bourgeois origin; yet the inadequacy of the Party's leading bodies in waging a concerted and determined struggle against these incorrect ideas and in educating the members in the Party's correct line is also an important cause of their existence and growth. \\" (Selected Military Writings of Mao Tse-Tung. Peking. Foreign Language Press. 1966)The correction of \\"incorrect ideas\\" is one purpose of the book yet creates another. The authors use the words \\"customer\\" and \\"employee\\" when referring to the military personal of the Coast Guard. One of the Coast Guard's largest difficulties since the end of WWII is the lack of identity as one of the nation's armed forces. The cultural norm for a military organization is to use proper terminology to instill the attributes of that service onto its people.A striking item missing from the work is failure. The book lacks examples of leadership failure and what the Coast Guard learned from it. Mentioned among the service's more notable historical leaders is Captain Mike Healy. Healy has become a service beacon of leadership example, but his lack of leadership qualities should be constant case studys at the Coast Guard Academy. Failures such as the Coast Guard's inability to establish consistent missions since the end of World War II, the MCPO-CG who yielded to a commandant's personal grievance, the failed leadership in the Simas Kudirka incident, the to raise non-heroes to hero status in the Coast Guard, an overblown awards system, and the debacle of the selection methods used for a prospective MCPO-CG.. In this vein, both authors failed to prove or show that the \\"Coast Guard is [a] superlative example of an organization with effective leadership.\\"This book's tone is of abstraction and theory in management leadership. Missing are the tested concepts and personal touches of Arthur Ageton, Attilla the Hun, Charles F. Shoemaker, Barbara Woodhouse and others. There is some disappointment that Admiral Loy did not include his personal successes and failures of leadership. This would have made the book more human, more authoritative, for future Coast Guardsmen with his personal touches. This work could be a first attempt by the Coast Guard to wage \\"a concerted and determined struggle against these incorrect ideas.\\" The authors claim this book is the first to use \\"an entire organization, rather an individual, as a model.\\" This indicates that both believe the Coast Guard is a homogenous organization where the same techniques and procedures may be used across the board. However, the Coast Guard cannot be pigeon-holed so easily. Therefore, the entire organization cannot conceivably be used a model. It must be viewed by its parts and sub-parts. The leadership of a Chief Petty Officer as officer-in-charge of an active station will certainly employ different techniques and principles than that of a Captain in Coast Guard Headquarters. The culture of the service has created several different Coast Guards and since the rise of careerism in the 1970s careers have been made to ensure they rarely meet.In the end, this Coast Guard commissioned work will be placed on official reading lists and office book shelves. Its use may be limited because the \\"leading bodies\\" are not being educated in the more base leadership principles of a naval service and their inability to remove the ideology that authority and responsibility can be separated. The Coast Guard should learn from this book that styles are not all inclusive and a variety of sources must be the goal. It may help some, but the Coast Guard must learn, or re-learn, that its core is that of a naval service - not a corporation."},{"Title":"Character in Action: The U.S. Coast Guard on Leadership","review":"This is a great book discussing the Coast Guard's characteristics on leadership. It gives examples, stories, and an outline of what seperates this organization from others."},{"Title":"Character in Action: The U.S. Coast Guard on Leadership","review":"I bought this book to prep for an OCS interview.

For my purpose, it was well worth the money."},{"Title":"Character in Action: The U.S. Coast Guard on Leadership","review":"A must read for anyone that wants to know more about this great service.Great insight into the workings of the US Coast Guard. Makes you appreciate what they do as the smallest of the military organizations. If you are considering entering the US Coast Guard, you have to read this!"},{"Title":"Character in Action: The U.S. Coast Guard on Leadership","review":"As a 26-year veteran of the Coast Guard (retired in 2003) who has served on small boat stations, a 378' Cutter (USCGC GALLATIN), and District and Headquarters offices, as well as authoring a fiction novel, I have a far different take than some of the reviews about \\"Character in Action.\\" I found the book to be an enjoyable read that espoused the type of dynamic leadership I suspect most people would appreciate in their organization. As one reviewer euphemistically stated, this book is \\"sufficient for someone who manages an office or a McDonald's.\\" I would agree. But the reviewer stops far too short. The book is also sufficient for someone who manages a Fortune 500 company, a Federal agency, or anything in between. The truth is, the leadership qualities described in this book - from encouraging frank communication, personal empowerment, adaptability to change, and the sheer courage to do the right thing at the right time - would be appropriate, and in fact, paramount to any organization that wants to both succeed in business and in life in the 21st century.Are there flaws where leadership has failed to rise to the standards described in this book, as some reviews have taken great care to point out? You bet. But fortunately those are the exceptions rather than the rule. The anecdotal stories that precede every section in the book are clear examples, amongst hundreds of others that could be told, of Coast Guard men and women rising to the occasion under the most duressing times to complete a mission that many would not dare engage in.I highly recommend \\"Character in Action\\" to anyone who wants to tweak their organizational leadership styles, and to those who enjoy good robust stories of real life adventure."},{"Title":"Character in Action: The U.S. Coast Guard on Leadership","review":"I just got through reading the book and was very pleased. I am sorry that the reviewer preceeding me was so dissapointed but for those who sit behind a key board and are not underway you should expect as much. I have not one negative thing to say about the book, the authors, or my beloved Coast Guard. We stick up for each other so I am going to stick up for ADM. LOY. I have deep respect for any one who dawns the coveted Working Blue. To Coasties everywhere, support this book because as you will read it is supporting you. Semper Paratus!"},{"Title":"Character in Action: The U.S. Coast Guard on Leadership","review":"This book is great Coast Guard Academy recruiting propoganda, nothing more. Not real accurate. If you seek an accurate view of Coast Guard leadership effectiveness, start by asking the people who actually make the agency run - it's Active Duty Enlisted forces. (Concur with \\"Ethically Challenged Management\\") To find out about how effective a service's leadership is, start at the deck plates. I found the innacuracies of this book extremely annoying. \\"Be, Know, Do,\\" or The Army Leadership Field Manual would better serve your money & time."},{"Title":"Character in Action: The U.S. Coast Guard on Leadership","review":"The Coast Guard has studied and attempted to teach leadership since the inception of the Revenue Cutter Service in 1790. What is missing in this treatise is the view from those being led. At the deck plate, this theory and feel-good tome does not resonate. Those working in Coast Guard blue respond to leaders of good moral character, who lead and care, and who show fairness and compassion. The past relationship between the Coast Guard and Admiral Loy's progeny lends serious questions about morality and nepotism. That the Admiral's progeny continues to receive preferential employment now from the TSA, leads any thinking person to question the credibility of the author. The Admiral's words ring hollow. Should we \\"judge one by his actions, not his words\\" or should we, \\"do as I say, not as I do?\\"Save your time, there is not much here."},{"Title":"The Hunter","review":"Somewhat on the dark side, Hunter is a book that will pull in. Amber and Hawk compliment each other. I especially enjoyed the banter between them - it eleviated the subject matter (human trafficking)of the book. I have already ordered Lily's story and look forward to reading it and other Gennita Low's books."},{"Title":"The Hunter","review":"I've always liked the fact that this author chose to place her heroines in the intriguing world of espionage. According to the book covers, these ladies were supposed to be kick-ass spies, going toe-to-toe with the men in their world. Yet I've been disappointed that the author hasn't really delivered on the promise. The heroines, who are the supposed focus of these novels, aren't very fleshed out. For example, in Into Danger, the heroine Marlena is supposed to be this revered assassin, yet she never assassinates anyone, and there's no discussion of anyone she assassinated. In this book, all we learn about Amber is that she \\"trades information,\\" is the child of missionaries, and is a contract agent for the CIA, whatever that means. We learn nothing about how she came to be involved with the CIA, exactly what she does for them, how she developed the talents and skills that she supposedly has. Indeed, except for one rescue scene, we see no demonstration of her espionage skills, but are repeatedly told what a good cook she is. In short, we're given no glimpse into her world before the hero, Hawk, landed in it. On the other hand, we read ad nauseum about Hawk's cardboard cutout Navy SEAL background. If I read one more reference to his SEAL \\"brothers\\" or his superior physical stamina and abilities, I thought I'd throw the book across the room. Thank goodness no one uttered the obligatory \\"hoorah.\\"I also thought the plot in this novel moved at a painfully slow pace. The writing was very repetitive. Hawk, in particular, simply had the same thoughts over and over. The plot was also a bit jumbled and, especially towards the end, made almost no sense. The sudden appearance of characters from previous novels was handled very clumsily and was not convincing.Another problem I have to mention was the author's inexplicably incorrect use of grammar. She repeatedly used the wrong verb tense, and there were several times when her sentences just made no sense. I guess editors don't actually edit. Interestingly, I didn't notice this shortcoming in her previous novels.As I'm sure the author intended, I continue to be intrigued by the recurring characters, Jed McNeil/Stefan and Alex Diamond. They and the elusive \\"T.\\" will probably keep me reading these novels. I just hope the plots become more revelatory and illuminating. I realize that the world of espionage is cloaked in shadow, but it's unsatisfying when the reader is kept in the dark."},{"Title":"The Hunter","review":"This makes the second book in the series that I have read and I think both books were great. I'm glad I read \\"Into Danger\\" first as the characters from that book were carried over into the next book \\"The Hunt\\". I feel the main characters in both books were complete and had total closure, The secondary characters were left with questions,but I wonder if this will lead into another book on them or possibly they may be mentioned again in another book Just can't wait to see. So far I'm completely pleased with this author and plan to read the two remaining books in the series."},{"Title":"The Hunter","review":"I absolutely love Gennita Lows books, from the first page your hooked, the way she writes just pulled you into the story, and what not hotter than a sexy, with a touch of humor and a sexy bodied SEAL?

The character development was also good and there was a good mix of romance, humor, and action that kept this interesting. The ONLY little issue I had was that I felt that some of the scenes were a little long winded for me. I found myself skipping over some paragraphs and even pages.

Though I had no way to know if the author's research about Macedonia was correct, I did have enough background to believe that her knowledge of prostitution trafficking was sound. While I questioned the possibility of a SEAL acting alone undercover in a foreign country, I still kept reading! Yes, the action was that good. Did I question, too, if other SEALs would operate undercover with their main squeezes? Yes. But I kept on reading! Great marks for the action, the characterization and the romance."},{"Title":"The Hunter","review":"This book was great! I couldn't put it down once I started. Not only was there romance but also action and suspense. Couldn't ask for any more in a book; only that it didn't end. I'll definitely have to read her other books!"},{"Title":"The Hunter","review":"oooh la la. This book was hot! The issue is a current one which every one needs to know more about (human trafficking), the political issues weren't too \\"HEAVY\\", the hero was very likeable and the heroine was \\"kick-ass\\". I love the fact that the love scenes were steamy and balanced the action. Loved the navel ring he wore. 5 stars indeed. And to top if off, the book was free!"},{"Title":"The Hunter","review":"I have read everything that Gennita Low has written. She is one of my favorite authors. This book did not disappoint in any way! I love the interaction between the 2 main characters, Hawk and Amber. Especially, at the beginning of the book when they were trying to out do each other. I could not stop giggling!! What girl can when the heroine leaves a souvenir on the hero's... I'll let you find out. But, this book is filled with action-packed suspense with very entertaining dialogue that had me laughing out loud at times.. Can't wait for her next book!"},{"Title":"The Hunter","review":"Since the other reviews give you a good idea of the plot, I'll tell you why reading Gennita Low's books is the best treat you can give yourself. Gennita Low is great at giving readers action pact stories filled with exotic and intriguing locales (how often do you read - or hear about - Macedonia), spies you are challenged to trust . . . or mistrust, SEALS who are closer to reality than fiction and heroine's you can root for. If you like books with action and adventure (think the Bourne series, but with kick-butt heroines deeply involved in rectifying wrongs) and enough romance to balance all the edgy tension during the ride, then The Hunter is the book for you. Heck, any of Gennita Low's books are for you. The women are strong, smart and someone you want by your side. The men are gorgeous, heroic, and the person you want to have on speed dial if you find yourself in trouble.With Hawk and Amber, Gennita did not hold back. She let their passion be just as dangerous as the people who are ch. . . nope, I won't spoil it for you."},{"Title":"The Hunter","review":"I've been a Gennita Low fan for years and it was this book that made it so. I am a big fan of spy novels and this was right up my alley with the different agencies. Hawk and Amber were hot, hot, HOT. The first time they make love? *fans self* But it's more than the hot sex - Gennita writes a real story about real issues - what Hawk has to let happen while working undercover is heartbreaking. I highly recommend this read and then do please continue reading more about Hawk's SEAL team and T's ladies and Jed's men. I am still holding out hope that one day we will see a novel all about T and Alex and how they came to be.Susan J"},{"Title":"The Hunter","review":"This book has been the buzz for awhile on the reader websites but I haven't had a chance to read it till now. Great book!So glad to finally read Hawk's story. Any hot guy with a nipple ring is my kind of guy! Amber is a fitting heroine for him and reading their story was fun.But now I want Jed's story even more than I did before. I can't wait to read his story. I hope it will be next."},{"Title":"The Hunter","review":"I loved this book! Gennita has woven a tale of hot, dangerous suspense that sucks you in from the very beginning! The way Hawk and Amber meet sets the stage for a passionately, mischievous romance that had me turning pages until 4 in the morning!Amber is a wonderful heroine who's wit and daring are a perfect match for Hawk, who is a dangerous yet deeply emotional man who is tormented by the mission he has been assigned, and the things he must witness... yet can do nothing about.When betrayal strikes from an angle unforeseen, and the mission and their lives are in serious danger, they have to team together to save their lives, and the lives of those they are sworn to protect.I loved Hawk soooo much, he has that intense, alive, Alpha way about him, with a deep magnetic personality and vibrant animal sexuality that absolutely HUMS off the page at you. I love how she brings back characters we have grown to love from previous books too. They show up in the oddest places....Wasn't my usual \\"flavor\\" of romance until I picked up her previous books, I loved them all, and this is definitely MUST READ! The sex is hot-hot-hot, the danger is a page turner, and I laughed out loud at the character interaction a LOT!"},{"Title":"The Hunter","review":"Ms. Low's latest effort \\"The Hunter\\" is a sensually captivating read that at times is a little dark but always entertaining. We hook up with the SEAL team from \\"The Protector\\" once again only this time we're treated to Hawk McMillan's story. This bad boy has finally met his match.Hawk McMillan is in Macedonia working along side an arms-trafficking creep he'd rather just kill and move on to the next, but this is not what his assignment is and so he has to gut it out. The fact that he likes to work solo is also an issue as he's just been assigned a \\"partner\\" but this partner is like no other. She can track, make a killer hamburger, get him hot in more ways than one, and she makes him laugh. Too bad they're not in Middle America living in the burbs. No they need to keep their wits about them, because not doing this could lead to one or both of them being killed. When you live and work in shades of gray it's hard to tell who's on the good side and who's on the bad side. But when the mission's over will Hawk be able to walk away from Amber or will something keep them apart?Amber is walking a very dangerous line and when she has to pair up with Hawk things become even more blurred. She can't over look the fact that he's yummy with a capital Y, she overlook the fact he challenges her in almost every way possible, and she can't ignore the feelings he brings out in her. But when things heat up with the mission will they be able to ignore what they feel or will it get in the way of doing their job?Ms. Low is an amazing talent! She has taken a different approach from others in the suspense genre and as a result has carved a very deep notch for herself. Her characterization is strong all the way around. It's nice to read a heroine who can kick tail but still be feminine and allow the guy to be strong. The heat and chemistry between Hawk and Amber is nuclear and this part of the storyline truly added to the nuances of their interaction. Scratching you head at the last comment? You'll just have to read the book to understand. I look forward to her next story in this series and highly recommend that you pick up any title by Ms. Low. You're in for a treat."},{"Title":"The Hunter","review":"Gennita Low writes with depth, passion and a sense of humor.The Hunter is intense and even humorous. Hawk, the hero, and Amber, the heroine, \\"meet\\" in a unique way. Hawk is an irresistible Alpha Male in action!! Can't wait for the rest of the team's story. Hopefully someday T & Alex's story as well as Jed's will be told."},{"Title":"The Hunter","review":"Gennita Low is definitely on my must buy list. This is her 4th book. Each and everyone of them is a keeper. I have already pre-order her next book \\"Sleeping with the Agent\\". She managed to write a romantic suspense novel with both male (mostly male) and female point of view, packed with action and adventure without cheating the romance readers."},{"Title":"The Hunter","review":"Gennita Low has written another great story - this time highlighting Hawk and taking off where The Protector ends. With a truly memorable opening, the book just gets better and better.Navy SEAL Hawk McMillan has an undercover assignment working for a crime lord in Macedonia, on the trail of illegal weapons. Amber Hutchens is a great heroine who is fulfilling an important mission of her own as well as becoming Hawk's tracker and is not TSTL - one of Low's great trademarks is the smart heroine and Amber is one of the best.Watching these two smart and sexy characters work together and fall in love while going on a thrill ride of a story was so much fun I read it twice in one sitting. A definite keeper.Now, I want to read about Jed!! Bring on JED!! Oh, and Alex and T, too. Keep 'em coming, Ms. Low!"},{"Title":"The Hunter","review":"Gennita Low has really outdone herself with THE HUNTER - - which should have been difficult to do, since her first three books were outstanding by themselves. THE HUNTER, featuring the very delicious Hawk McMillan, does not disappoint (and it may be my new \\"favorite\\" by this author.) Her characters have real depth here and she tackles some uncomforable real-life issues (such as human trafficking.) Of course her \\"trade marks\\" remain in place: A great story, a strong hero, a strong heroine and scorching love scenes. THE HUNTER made me laugh, sigh and say \\"Oh My God! What happens next?!\\"In my opinion, it would be best to read this book in order (after the first 3), but if you just want to try one of Gennita Low's books, try this one and you'll see why I highly recommend them all!Thanks Ms. Low for yet another \\"keeper.\\""},{"Title":"The Hunter","review":"Gennita Low has writing a mesmerizing, thrilling, hotter then hot tale in The Hunter.Navy Seal Hawk McMillan has been undercover for months on the most dangerous mission of his career.

He needs a local tracker in Macedonia and is led to caf&eacute; owner Amber Hutchens.Amber Hutchens has an agenda of her own. She is spiriting away young girls to a safer place, then at the hands of Dilaver. Her first meeting with Hawk is memorable. Amber realizes Hawk is more then what she sees on the surface. This is a first for Hawk that a woman is invading his thoughts on a mission.Amber and Hawk find a connection that goes beyond their mission. Their conversations are funny, steamy and deeply moving.Gennita Low writes with such depth, compassion and all out passion. It was a treat to revisit Hawk's Seal buds. Marlena and Amber's first meeting is a hoot...This book was a treasure to read from beginning to end. Can't wait for the rest of the team's story. Hopefully some day T and Alex's story will be told.

Still he knows the importance of the assignment to find the weapon of mass destruction that Dilaver apparently possesses.CIA operative Amber Hutchins has worked undercover for four years in Macedonia. She hosts the Last Resort, an American style caf&eacute; in which she obtains information that she passes on to her contacts.Amber and Hawk meet, but neither wants a partner especially one in which nether can control their desire for the other. Still they have no choice as they work together trying to bring down Dilaver and his cohorts while hoping to not fall in love.THE HUNTER is a terrific direct sequel to the fabulous THE PROTECTOR as the latter novel ends with Hawk joining Dilaver's team to bring him down. The story line is action-packed but Hawk's lament makes it character driven as he feels the taint of his assignment causing him to allow the slaughter of the innocent to occur that will haunt his soul for the rest of his life. Amber is his only light as his disturbed conscience ponders the end vs. the mean. This is a high quality thriller.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"The Hunter","review":"The Hunter is Book 2 in the Crossfire series. The book picks up where The Protector left off. Navy SEAL Commander Hawk McMillan is deep undercover trying to locate stolen United States' military grade weapons including a new special weapon with new technology that can avoid detection. His target is slave trader, weapons dealer, and all around bad mobster, Dragan Dilaver, a Kosovo kingpin. Hawk \\"saves\\" Dragan in Asia (book 1) and escorts him back home to Velesta, Macedonia. Needing help to navigate around this unfamiliar territory, McMillan is partnered with Amber Hutchens a contractor for the intelligence community.From the get go, The Hunter is a smart, suspenseful and sexy story - everything a reader would want in a romantic suspense. Hawk McMillan is not only capable, well-trained, and well-sculpted (after all, he is a SEAL), he is also intelligent, kind, compassionate and loving. As a dealer in information, she is not only a contract operative but a street smart, cheeky, smart-ass heroine. The highlight of the book is the give and take in their relationship. There is a balance to the relationship and it is fun. Did I mention that there interactions are also very sexy and hot? Yup, definitely scorching.This is also a story of the on-going exploitation of women and the white slavery trade in the world. Gennita Low writes about it in necessary and sometimes uncomfortable detail. Some of the scenes are bound to stay with me for months. Her characters spotlight the frustration at the complicity of international forces/organization in the proliferation of sexual slavery. It is an important story and one that needs and deserves to be told over and over again."},{"Title":"The Hunter","review":"A man has needs, and right now, Hawk McMillan wants a nice, big, juicy, American hamburger. He also wants a woman - not a brutalized one who has been tricked or kidnaped and then forced to service dozens of men each night - but a regular, everyday one neither of Hawk's needs are easy finds in Velesta, Macedonia. He's here on assignment, playing the kingpin's best friend, while in reality tracking his movements, waiting for his opportunity to take down this man that turns his stomach.CIA agent Amber Hutchens uses the cover of running her cafe, the Last Resort, to cover her real interest, the young women that are kidnaped and brought into Velesta. Amber and her friend, Llallana, spent the last four years gathering information on this illegal operation, and now Hawk's arrival signifies something bigger than any of them realize could be taking place.In order to test out the new operative sent by the CIA, Amber breaks into his room, and takes down Hawk with the help of an injection. Since he was naked at the time, she leaves her calling card attached to an unmentionable body part. The last operative the CIA had sent almost blew her cover, and Amber's not about to risk herself, her friends, or her operation to another idiot. Hawk is going to have to prove himself if he wants her help.Hawk can't believe he was so lax as to let down his guard enough to allow anybody to get the better of him the way his attacker did. He's just lucky the attacker obviously didn't mean him any real harm since he wakes up in his own room covered in blankets off his bed. Then, he discovers the craftily attached calling card left behind, and he knows a challenge has definitely been issued and it's one he fully intends to answer - as soon as he finds out who his assailant is. It's just possible he will find the challenger, as well as fulfill his other needs, if he pays a visit to the Last Resort.With a fast paced plot and witty challenges between the two main characters, THE HUNTER is a book sure to capture and hold you enthralled in the pages for hours. You can actually feel the emotional turmoil the characters experience, as they're forced to turn a blind eye to the corruption surrounding them as they struggle to take down the current kingpin, Dilaver. Yet, there were scenes so touching, I was on the verge of tears several times, as well as laughing out loud over the antics of Hawk and Amber as the tested each other. THE HUNTER is the second book in Gennita Low's CROSSFIRE series.Chrissy Dionne (courtesy of Romance Junkies)"},{"Title":"The Hunter","review":"This is a wonderful spy, adventure, love story of Navy SEAL commander Hawk McMillan and ace CIA tracker Amber Hutchens.

This book/series will probably appeal more to romance readers than A/A readers.It's more or less a romance wrapped around an action/black op plotline but there was more action in the bedrooms than out in the field.

NO! But, it does let others, who like me don't care for our romanace stories in this venue, know that this might not be for them. Therefore, the two stars tags, this as something you might want to consider before buying.I was about 30 percent into this book and I just couldn't go any further. It's content for me was slow, dark and very disturbingly dark; and the characters were just not interesting enough to further drag me into this story line. I perfer less action, more loving. If it's an action romance then just get on with the action and keep me going otherwise it just goes flat, for me at least.So my advise is, if you like action, in detail and don't mind wadding through all the gore and rape and such go for it. Otherwise, give it a pass and save your money.Remember reading is always subjective and everyone's taste is different. For me this one just didn't do it.

It is well known that he asked that it never be republished. So with this caveat made clear, I continue. This is a really good book. There have been other JD's that I didn't like, didn't even finish. This one was very enjoyable. I couldn't really figure out which scenes were the ones he felt were gratuitous. It's a gritty, swift-moving story about the pitfalls of the real world and someone who didn't avoid them, and why. I'd be negligent if I did not refer others to the following, though: the Travis McGee series (start with Deep Blue Goodbye and proceed in order; look forward to The Green Ripper); The Empty Trap; The Girl, the Gold Watch and Everything; April Evil; The Neon Jungle; The Good Old Stuff; More Good Old Stuff; Clemmie; Linda (novella found in Border Town Girl)."},{"Title":"Weep For Me","review":"There's no doubting this guy can write. I got onto him via a dustjacket blurb praising DennisLehaneas being in this sort of league. It's one of his earliest books, and I was bemused to read on the back cover two unflattering comments (much later) from the author himself about it:\\"It should die quietly in the back of used paperback booknooks,\\" and,\\"It's really quite a bad book ... imitation James M. Cain ... with some gratuitous and unmotivated scenes.\\"He does have a point. Two of the three women are particularly gratuitous at times, especially the (spoiler) ludicrous daydream exotic beauty of the last couple of chapters (a voluptuous sex slave, she falls deeply and we're supposed to think sincerely and mutually in love with the hero on the basis of him surprising her by not taking her when she's offered because, you know, we Americans don't use women in that way. Hey presto, she then gives herself to him in Mills and Boon sex, murders two of his guards, and vows to wait for the next decade or two until he gets out of jail. All in about twenty-four hours!). Reminds me of some of the absurdities of Peter Temple's similarly otherwise ableIn the Evil Day. The central woman, Emily, is a prototype of garish 80s (now, disturbingly, TV midday) erotic thrillers: too good to be true sexually aggressive stunners who turn out to be disturbed predators. There's a little more to her than this, but not a lot.Yet apparently MacDonald went on to great critical success, and even this book remains popular. I can see why. I suspect I'll enjoy later books more - and I will read some more - but even in this at times gaudy beginning, MacDonald places himself above the crowd (in this very crowded genre). He works much of his basic plot tightly and effectively, much as, say,Forsythwill take a usable idea and meticulously work it up into a story. It may be hackneyed, but MacDonald also manages some poignancy in the idea of an everyman faced with the choice between the classic grey, safe, suburban marriage and mortgage, and a fantasy bank robbery and escape with a bad girl. Rather than tie it all up neatly, there is some room at times here for seeing the pros and cons of each. The plot then, initially at least, is clever and has some interesting social commentary (however over time it becomes increasingly silly). Moreover this is clearly a book written in the late 40s, early 50s - and for all the positives of a far more innocent mainstream sexual time, we see that some of the sexual politics of suburbia, particularly for a nice girl moving past her nubility peak, can be quite brutal. Women here, from the masculine view, are still another species, perhaps here as virgin, whore and amazon.But more importantly, the style is just plain good. Engaging, spare, powerful - MacDonald can write, and I'm happy to spend some time with someone who can go to this place with words and stay there."},{"Title":"Changing Paradigms: The Transformation of Management Knowledge for the 21st Century","review":"This book achieves what it sets out to achieve in the preface - to &quot;synthesise the central shifts of management thought and practice in the late twentieth century and into the next millennium&quot;. The authors provide a convincing argument about the need to reconsider management thinking and practice. The topics discussed in each chapter are timely and relevant. These include globalization, digitalization and sustainability.In the final chapter, the authors state that an organization's ultimate goals should be based on sustainability and ecological approaches rather than profit and growth. For some managers this will be a radical shift.The book gets four stars rather than five as it is not the first book of its kind and there will be managers who have heard much of this information before.

Unfortunately, =this is not that book=. The layout is inconvenient, requiring one to move back and forth between a description of the animal and its photo- which often enough, turns out to be murky and not very revealing. The descriptions are brief to the point of being sketchy and forgetting some vital information, and there are some noticeable typographical errors. Though some of the information and citations are up-to-date, many are so old they verge on misinformation, and important books (Humann and DeLoach's book, for instance, are missing entirely from the non-annotated bibliography. Based on my personal experience diving with sharks and the data available during the last ten years, this book's information on sharks especially is misleading, out of date and overly alarming. Some of the island and dive site maps are crudely drawn- I have seen better drawn on white boards at dive briefings.Unfortunately, this appears to be THE field-totable book available at the moment on this topic, and that's why I have it.

This novel is considered young adult fiction, but the themes expressed here are for people of any age. The plot focuses on Toby. Toby attends a boarding school in England in the 1950's which he detests. But one year, everything changes because of a new boy in school, Christopher. Christopher is certainly different from the other boys at school, and he soon reveals to Toby that he has visions which tell him that he is the second coming of Jesus. Toby is picked as his first deciple.Michael Morpurgo uses his unique premise perfectly to comment on life on different levels. First off, he captures the life around the boarding school extremely well. The element of class warfare between the oiks (village children) and the toffs (boarding school children) is present. Morpurgo also captures the intensity of the relationships between the students and between the students and their teachers at the isolated school. The element of first love is also introduced, and the characters in the novel are all fully developed. Morpurgo is most successful at studying the nature of faith, though. He presents how difficult it is to believe in the face of convention, and he also shows the extraordinary powers that faith in something can bring. The novel is also very successful at commenting on what peoples' lives around the Jesus Christ must have been like.The War of Jenkins' Ear is a fascinating novel. Everything about it makes you think. Even the title can have a symbolic meaning. I think The War of Jenkins' Ear should easily go down as one of the great young adult reads of the century."},{"Title":"The War Of Jenkin's Ear","review":"The War of Jenkins' EarBy Michael MorpurgoSummary:There are lots of wars in this world, but one is very special. It all began in Toby's second year in the school of Redlands. He was a regular student, until a strange kid called Christopher came along. He wasn't really scared of anything not even of the headmaster. He then shared a humongous secret with Toby, Hunter, and the littleSwann. They were of coursevery suspicious of course, and were wondering if it was really true. They then truly believed him, and wonders began to happen. The four of then swore to never reveal the secret, but something unexpected came. It turned everybody's life upside down except Christopher's who had all along predited it.Why I liked it:It is an interesting book where you really wonder if it could be truly like that back in time. It really makes me feel like I was in the school of Reedlands when the author started telling about the school, Toby, and Christopher. One example could be, \\"Beside Rudolph, stiff in her graygreen suit with a butterfly brooch, stood Mrs. Stagg.\\" What made me like this book the most was that it makes me wonder if it could be true when Christopher revealed the secret, \\"It's Jesus, I know it is.\\" Normally I would be bored to death, but it really made it so it was not like a bible book. That's why this book was interesting to me in the first place when I was choosing a book to read.What part of the story was my favorite:My favorite part of the story was the ending. It had a great turn in which I never expected. It was the time when nobody had faith in Christoopher anymore, but then proved to everyone even the mean Rudolph that what he said was true. As a result, it strengthened the beliefs of Toby, Hunter, and Swann even more."},{"Title":"The War Of Jenkin's Ear","review":"&quot;If a grain of wheat does not fall unto the earth and die, it is but a single seed. But if the seed dies, it will produce many seeds.&quot; (Jn 12:24) A seed must fall to the ground and die if it is to give new life.

It is an incredible story of the Cuban pilots dedication to freeing Cuba from Castro's communism. You'll learn why the pilots of the Brigade felt compelled to devote their hard efforts, and some even their lives, to the cause of freedom. It is both filled with funny stories of pilot's in training with American instructors as well as heartbreaking battle drama as some of the pilots fall victim to combat. You'll also see how the CIA fits into the picture of the Bay of Pigs that is little known. I highly recommend this rare glimpse into the Air Battle of the Bay of Pigs!"},{"Title":"Operation Puma: The air battle of the Bay of Pigs","review":"Ferrer was a former Cubana pilot who flew C-46s and C-54s during the Bay of Pigs invasion. He provides a complete record of exile air operations. There are some poor quality, but interesting, photos. (For example, two types of eight-gun noses are shown on the exile B-26s.)Besides the well-known aircraft types used in the invasion, Ferrer mentions USAF Constellations with the insignia painted out. These were operated between the US and the Central American bases. He also recounts encounters with USN A-4s from the Essex, both marked and unmarked.He describes the exile air force's acquisition of F-51 Mustangs from Nicaragua as the invasion collapsed. There were no qualified fighter pilots in the exile air force, but one pilot read the manuals overnight and took a F-51 up the next day. Since the Mustangs did not have the range for a return mission, the plan was for this Mustang to accompany the B-26s. When his fuel ran out, the pilot was to bail out over territory held by the exile Brigade. This is reminiscent of British Hurricat pilots in WWII, who bailed out or ditched their aircraft near the convoys that they were protecting. When the Brigade surrendered, this mission was canceled.Ferrer's memoir begins with a recounting of his life in Cuba. Of interest to aviation buffs is an account of a Cubana Constellation flight to Argentina to pick up Ch&eacute; Guevara's family."},{"Title":"Operation Puma: The air battle of the Bay of Pigs","review":"Between 1959 and 1961 dramatic events unfolded in Cuba. The Batista government was overthrown and replaced by the regime of Fidel Castro. After the initial rejoicing it soon became clear that a communist, totalitarian form of government was being imposed. Many Cubans fled the island, but some were determined to fight back. Operation Puma is the story of that valiant but doomed effort known to us as the Bay of Pigs fiasco.Eduardo Ferrer and many other highly motivated young officers were trained, supplied and encouraged to invade Cuba and overthrow the Castro government. Unfortunately, the United States government wavered in its support and ultimately allowed the enterprise to fail. Perhaps there were good geopolitical reasons for this, but to those involved it was a shattering, bitter disappointment. Here the story is told from the inside, by an officer who took part in the whole incident from its inception to its collapse.The book is well written, taking the reader along from battle to battle. Everything that happens is personal to the author and this comes across in crisp, lucid prose that doesn't allow you to stop reading. The episode of the Bay of Pigs was current events in this reviewer's time but is now \\"history.\\" It deserves to be looked at again, and this little book is a good introduction. BTW, it was not hard to obtain a copy. I recommend it highly. Reviewed by Louis N.

This book is all about the women he's known, about how exquisitely sensitive he was and is to them; about men, his friends, and his life. It's full of bragging and posturing. He is pretty good at describing sexual acts, bodies, and female orgasm, but one of those orgasms -- fantastic, never-to-be-forgotten -- he believes he incited in one of the women he writes about was less impressive -- to this reader -- than he intended.

Its title heroine grows up spoiled and adored by her shopowning mother and mother's sister; indifferent to their ideas for her future (or indeed to just about anything else), Angel discovers her gift for fantastic fictions translates beautifully into the publishing world, where she becomes a bestselling author of contempibly popular potboilers. Angel accordingly re-invents herself as a glamorous author figure of the Elinor Glyn school, and we follow her through her successes, marriage, eventual popular neglect, and poverty.ANGEL is a cult favorite among many British novelists, including Hilary Mantel, but is only really transcendent when it allows Angel to strive (at the beginning and the end of her career) against difficult odds. The scene, for example, where she tells off her aunt for planning to make her a ladies' maid is enormously funny and satisfying. But when Angel is rich and successful Taylor seems too invested in scoring points of of her heroine, as if she, too, feared what Angel might do if not kept in her place."},{"Title":"Angel (New Portway Reprints)","review":"I loved this book when I read it a number of years ago It was my favorite of all of Elizabeth Taylor's novels.

You will laugh out loud reading this novel."},{"Title":"Angel (New Portway Reprints)","review":"I like this book because the protagonist is not really a very likeable person. But I certainly have a sympathy for her at the same time. She's an individualist and odd. Great!"},{"Title":"Angel (New Portway Reprints)","review":"Those who have loved author Elizabeth Taylor's Mrs. Palfrey at the Claremont (1971) will also be fascinated by Angel (1957). Less subtle in its black humor and obvious satire, Angel will strike chords among all writers and lovers of writing who have ever fantasized about producing a blockbuster novel, or even a moderately successful one. Taylor (1912 - 1975) lived her own life in relative obscurity, admired and praised by a small group of literati, including Barbara Pym, Ivy Compton-Burnett, and Robert Liddell, but she is now being republished by New York Review Books, and contemporary lovers of clever writing will celebrate this darkly humorous vision of what it takes to be a successful author of popular novels and her wry insights into why popular fame often fades.In 1900, Angel Deverell, fifteen, lives with her mother above the family grocery store in Norley. Emotionally, however, she lives on a completely different plane, imagining a life in which she is elegant, successful, admired by all, and, of course, wealthy beyond her most fervent dreams. Her mother and her aunt have made enormous sacrifices so that she can attend a private school and get the kind of education which might allow her to live a different sort of life from theirs, but Angel decides she has had enough and leaves to finish writing a romantic novel, The Lady Urania, on which she works almost around the clock. When she finds a publisher, he wants Angel to make some small changes to make the book more salable (such as giving the Duchess of Devonshire a fictional name), but Angel risks all and says \\"No.\\" Eventually, the publisher accedes to her demands, and the book is a huge popular success.Writing a bestseller a year for the next five or six years, Angel becomes wealthy enough by the age of twenty to move from the grocery store to The Birches at Alderhurst. Eventually, she meets Nora, the poetry-writing niece of Lord Norley, who becomes her companion, and her brother Esme, a handsome rotter who gambles, toys with the affections of young women, and lives only for himself, the male equivalent of Angel herself. As Angel's story continues with its ups and downs for forty more years, her personal life and her literary life experience dramatic changes. Always front and center in her focus - after herself, of course - is Paradise House, where her aunt once worked, the symbol of the aristocratic lifestyle Angel has sought from the beginning of her life.Written in the middle of Taylor's career, Angel sometimes feels like the kind of romantic melodrama that Angel herself writes, and lovers of serious literary fiction may be surprised by that style, at least at the beginning. Taylor is clearly mimicking Angel's own style, however, to give added irony and satire to her depiction of this completely egocentric character, who wants only one thing, her own happiness. Such a focus can become tiring, since it allows for very little character development, and Angel remains one-sided and shallow, unconcerned with the everyday niceties that make social life successful. As her fortunes change over more than forty years, Angel remains resolute, and it is in her resolve that she becomes more than just a satiric main character and becomes almost admirable. Similar to Barbara Pym, Penelope Lively, Alice Thomas Ellis, and Jane Gardam, Elizabeth Taylor may finally be getting the literary attention she deserves."},{"Title":"Angel (New Portway Reprints)","review":"I don't disagree with the earlier reviewer, but I think things are a bit more complex. After all, we have a woman novelist writing a novel about a woman novelist. While Angel is certainly a narcissist as mentioned, she is also a woman refusing to be bound by the unwritten rules of the English class system. She is also a person who lives almost entirely in her imagination and this raises the interesting question: how much imagination is too much? She picks as a husband a rather effete artist and they hardly have any life together so there are important questions raised about her gender identification. Her gothic and fanciful romances are hugely successful with the reading public, so she must have some talent, although where it comes from is never entirely clear. This combination of popular success with critical contempt brings to mind some other novelists of the post-WW II period in which Taylor wrote. How much of herself, these other writers and her own imagination went into Angel is worth thinking about.But the important thing is that this is a superbly crafted story which profits from Taylor's distrust of conventional narrative. Like so many of her novels, this is really \\"Scenes from Angel's Life\\", and this in a book about a very conventional writer bears some thought."},{"Title":"Angel (New Portway Reprints)","review":"Angel is delusional, narcissistic, proud; she makes her own reality, in comparison with which the true reality is rather disappointing. If Angel Deverell existed I'm sure I'd love her writing--ironically, of course. She's described as a popular novelist of little talent, her books filled with inaccuracies and melodrama, certainly never one to be accused of creating Great Art. Try telling that to her, though; she thinks herself peerless, important, believes the world knows her books by heart and can hardly stand the wait for a new one to appear in print.Early in the story, a doctor, seeing Angel's handwriting, renders the verdict \\"lack of character\\". Yes, delightfully, appalingly so. It's one hilarious thing after another, showing just how self-centred and bereft of compassion and understanding she is. The zings just keep coming, reminding me of nothing so much as my Bible, June Flaum Singer's The Debutantes, aka the Worst Book Ever Written. Both manage to consistently supply high quality humour, nearly every sentence a joke, with no signs of slowing down. It's awe-inspiring.Taylor's amazing accomplishment is that she makes Angel both a figure of fun-- and what fun!-- but also someone to feel sad for. Angel lives too much in a fantasy world to see herself for what she is; the reader can see, though, and from what they see can say it's for the best that the dreamer never wakes up."},{"Title":"Angel (New Portway Reprints)","review":"I'm sad I had not even heard of Elizabeth Taylor, the novelist, until last year, but then again, maybe that's great, because now I have much to look forward to in the months ahead as I make my way through her fiction. I started with _Angel_ and found that I could not put it down. The novel raises so many fascinating questions of identity and class, as well as the meaning of art. This is the type of novel that I would enjoy teaching in a literature class because it's not too long, and yet it is packed with significance on many levels that would engage students.Taylor's prose style is spare and effective; she does not waste words. Angel, the main character, does. She seems real, although I have yet to meet (thankfully) anyone as cold, calculating and selfish as she happens to be. The character who most understands Angel and makes her real, even sympathetic, to the reader is her publisher, Theo. His point of view becomes invaluable in the later pages of the novel when Angel and her companion (her sister-in-law, Nora)live out the Second World War in a house right out of Faulkner's Southern Gothic genre, but transported to England.Is Angel a victim of her own self-willed ignorance? The question stays with me and gives me something to think about."},{"Title":"Angel (New Portway Reprints)","review":"Elizabeth Taylor's Angel is a good read, as other reviewers have noted, hence my 4 stars, but Kindle users should know that the current digital version has not had the OCR errors corrected, and this detracts from the reading experience.

Bacchiocchi lays praise for the Sabbath on thickly, but stands in danger of missing the point entirely.

A chronology of America's past from the arrival of the first Americans to the present day, this book presents the events that shaped our country in a way that is understandable and compelling. Cheney's organization of the book-it passes through history in date order, with short summaries of events instead of complicated explanations-gives the reader a sense of context that is rare in history literature, yet essential for understanding our national story. I learned that in 1968 alone, North Vietnam launched the Tet Offensive; assassins murdered Martin Luther King, Jr. and Robert Kennedy; police used tear gas against antiwar activists at the Chicago Democratic convention; and women protested the Miss America Pageant, in that order. Understanding this national suffering is surely necessary if we are to appreciate the hope that Neil Armstrong inspired across the country when, in early 1969, he became first person to walk on the moon!Cheney has also filled the book with primary source quotations, images, and fascinating tidbits that, even as a college history student, I've never found anywhere else (for example, during World War II, Navajo Indians serving in the Marines used their native language to keep U.S. transmissions from being deciphered by the Japanese). Such rich information and captivating prose make A Time for Freedom the perfect gift for a student, a family, or (perhaps best of all), a busy adult who can't remember what she learned in American history class.

I am proud to be an American and have watched friends and family make sacrifices for the freedom of all, but I remain one of the typical victims of the history snobs (otherwise known as history professors and experts) who cared more about impressing students with their high intellect than instilling a love for the history of our country in their students.

As fascinating to the Dickinson scholar as they are to the casual enthusiast, Dickinson's letters -- along with those of Keats or Hopkins -- prove that this is every bit as legitimate a genre as fiction or poetry. Some of Dickinson's most gorgeous and enduring statements are here, and to read these in chronological order is to map the gradual development of America's premier woman poet. Even in a letter she wrote at 12-years-old, the idiosyncratic dashes with which she distinguished her poetic voice are abundant, and already have that effect of forcing the reader to savor clusters of words as they unravel down the page. Similarly, Dickinson's mind-blowing instinct for the staggering metaphor is in full gear throughout (\\"Vinnie came soft as a moccasin\\") and, for all her great death poetry, it is in a letter regarding the death of her father where we find perhaps her most vulnerable and moving confrontation with mortality:\\"Father does not live with us now -- he lives in a new house. Though it was built in an hour it is better than this. He hasn't any garden because he moved after gardens were made, so we take him the best flowers, and if we only knew he knew, perhaps we could stop crying.\\"Perhaps most fascinating of all, though, is the mixture of extremes Dickinson's personality manifests throughout these letters, a crude bluntness that mingles with the most tender innocence. She at once condemns a cousin's valentine as \\"A little condescending, & sarcastic, your Valentine to me, I thought\\" and begins another missive with the exuberant mysticism of a child speaking as if out of some fairytale: \\"I wanted to write, and just tell you that me, and my spirit were fighting this morning. It isn't known generally, and you musn't tell anybody.\\" Of course, this book also includes that characteristically bizarre and unforgettable final letter, which she wrote while suffering from the illness that would take her life just days later: \\"Little Cousins, Called Back. Emily.\\" Especially enjoyable about this particular volume are the endnotes with which the editor follows up most letters. These brief but informed observations offer a fascinating and thorough glimpse into Dickinson's reading life, while also helping to illuminate her more obscure autobiographical allusions. This book is as fascinating an odyssey as Dickinson's complete poems, and I think readers do themselves a great service by delving into these letters alongside that more celebrated aspect of her genius."},{"Title":"Letters of Emily Dickinson (3 Volumes)","review":"...If you are, like me, an Emily Dickinson's great admirer you will be genuinely drawn into this book.

This collection, unlike other books of the genre, such as Elizabeth Bishop's One Art or Keats's book of letters, do not reveal much of her poetry, as her mental struggle with the work, her intentions, or choice of words. Even so, the reader is allowed into her family relationships, into her care and love for her few friends, and above all into her deep-set feeling of solitude.

Johnson. 364 pp. Cambridge, Massachusetts : The Belknap Press of Harvard University Press, 1971. SBN674-25060-5 (hbk).Emily Dickinson was a great letter writer, in all senses of the word. In fact one gets the impression that she actually preferred writing to people, than meeting and conversing with them, and for her the arrival of a letter was a great event. A letter was something she looked forward to with keen anticipation, and which she savored to the full whenever one arrived.The present selection of letters represents only a small proportion of the letters Emily Dickinson actually wrote. She was an inveterate letter-writer, had many correspondents, and wrote thousands of letters. And people in those days collected letters just as today.Unfortunately it was the custom, whenever anyone died, to make a bonfire of all of their correspondence, probably because of its personal and confidential nature. In this way thousands of pages of Emily Dickinson's writings have been lost to posterity, and we would know much more aboute the details of her day-to-day life, and be able to date her poems more accurately, if it hadn't been for this tragic loss.Just how great the loss is may be gaged by taking a look at the way Ellen Louise Hart and Martha Nell Smith have treated her letters in 'Open Me Carefully : Emily Dickinson's Intimate Letters to Susan Huntington Dickinson' (1998). Whereas Thomas Johnson prints all of ED's letters as straight prose, which of course leads us to read them as straight prose, Hart-Smith give us their particular letters as they actually appear in the original draft - not as continous lines of prose but as very short lines with numerous line breaks - in other words, as poetry.It would seem that at least some of ED's 'letters' are not so much letters as 'letter-poems,' and when read as poems produce a remarkable range of effects that are lost when all line breaks are removed and the 'letter' is regularized as straight prose. The loss of her letters now begins to look much more serious, for there seems to be a growing feeling among readers that her letters were every bit as great an artistic achievement as her poems.Given this, the present book becomes something that should interest all serious students of ED, although before reading it they might (if they haven't already) take at look at the Hart-Smith, and keep it in mind while reading the Johnson. One wonders how much poetry may be lurking unrecognized in the regularized lines of 'Emily Dickinson's Selected Letters.'"},{"Title":"Letters of Emily Dickinson (3 Volumes)","review":"Like most customers of Amazon, I am always on the lookout for a bargain. You can understand why I salivated when I saw that a paperback edition of this mammoth collection of Dickinson's letters was available for only $8.93 -- far less than the expensive hardcover edition. Well, once again the adage of getting what you pay for is proved true. The book that arrived in the mail contains a small portion of the complete correspondence, and the format is not reader-friendly.

In fact one gets the impression that she actually preferred writing to people, than meeting and conversing with them, and for her the arrival of a letter was a great event. A letter was something she looked forward to with keen anticipation, and which she savored to the full whenever one arrived.Although the present collection of letters may seem large, the truth is that it represents only a small proportion of the letters Emily Dickinson actually wrote.

Johnson, the well-known editor of the first Variorum edition of 'The Poems of Emily Dickinson (3 vols, Cambridge, 1955), is the only person to have given us a fairly complete edition of the letters.As such, this becomes a book that belongs in the collection of all serious students of ED, although before reading it they might (if they haven't already) take at look at the Hart-Smith, and while reading the Johnson keep it in mind.

It is a year 2000 publication so it has up-to-date information on all types of fuel cells including an in depth chapter on Proton Exchange Membrane (PEM) fuel cells that most other books lack.The authors develop concepts and formulas in such a way that you don't have to have a PhD in electrochemistry to understand the subject. It also gives specific examples of the concepts and formulas to show how to use them.This book doesn't just cover the fuel cells themselves but goes into fuel reforming, pumps, electric motors and DC/AC inverters. It has many useful diagrams, tables and photos of fuel cells and their applications. I highly recommend this book to anyone who deals with any aspect of fuel cells."},{"Title":"FUEL CELL SYSTEMS EXPLAINED","review":"Fuel cells including their ranging balance of plant, are quite difficult to write about in usefully technical fashion, because the authors must have expertise across so many various disciplines: i.e. chemistry, engineering, materials, thermodynamics, systems theory, etc.Yet Larminie and Dicks are clearly up to the task, and we are the more fortunate for it. They've done the trick of not only writing a technically-inclined and broadly encompassing work for a fast-growing field (one that's much in need of such books now)--but they've also done it in a way that's surprisingly quite readable.This book could serve as an excellent self-instruction text for those new to fuel cells, or as a very helpful text for experts in particular fuel cell types who wish to brush up on other systems. And it could be used in any university level class. Should I be pursuaded to lend my copy briefly to someone I know well, then I shall also take care to ensure that I get it back promptly!It is quite reasonably up to date and highlights for instance Basic Principles; Efficiencies and Voltages; PEMFCs, AFCs, PAFCs; MCFCs; SOFCs; various possible fuel types; compressors, turbines, fans, blowers (etc); delivering FC power, among other topics.Remarkably, this book even happened to cover a very wide swath of topics that are of a personal interest--despite their diversity. I might suggest more discussion on just a few quite developing topics like sodium borohydride as an H2 storage/generation medium. Yet I note too that near-term emerging topics like that (and much farther off, potential blue sky topics like carbon nanotubes) are likely best left for a future edition of this excellent book.In sum, I highly recommend this book.

And, wives are to be in submission to their husbands. That's what the word of God says. This book is an intelligent discussion of questions that arise from this.However, there are problems. One is the authors' approval of John White's teaching on the Holy Spirit. John White is a major proponent of gross charismatic practices, laughing revivals, being \\"slain in the Spirit\\", spiritual drunkeness, prophetic divination, etc. White's teachings are intelligenty analyzed, reviewed, and exposed for being false, and his view of the Holy Spirit is exposed as being thoroughly occult, in the book \\"True to His Ways: Purity and Safety in Christian Spiritual Practice\\":True To His WaysSurprisingly, Piper and Grudem quote John White and endorse his teachings on the Holy Spirit, even saying, \\"John White is right when he writes, 'Some people believe it to be impossible that the power of the Holy Spirit could have unholy consequences in an individual's life. But it can.'\\" (at page 41). It is difficult to imagine any person who has had a genuine experience of the Holy Spirit asserting it might lead to unholiness. I would fear this comes close to unforgiveable blasphemy according to the word of God. That these authors read and approve of the teachings of John White raises serious questions.Another problem is this book's legalistic focus on protecting hierarchy in organized Christendom, to the potential loss of the freedom that could help the word of God, which after all is the light and life of God, go forth."},{"Title":"Captured Moment (Harlequin Historical)","review":"Rumor has it that the streets of the New World were paved with gold.

It had good ideas yet the story just didn't appeal to me at all. The main character seemed to have an attitude and many things were unexplained. The story has potential if it was extended into a series. I felt as though things were just beginning and I was just beginning to find things out when the story suddenly ended. Hopefully there is a sequel that I'm unaware of to balance this odd work out."},{"Title":"Moon Called","review":"i picked this book up at random when i was about seven years old, at a library book sale, for 25 cents. up till that point i had not been much of a reader; i'd read some laura ingalls wilder (little house on the prairie and so forth) and roald dahl, but i was nothing like an avid reader. then i picked up this book, and although many of the criticisms are valid (this book reads like one that perhaps ms. norton wasn't quite finished with but she needed something to give to her editor), it will always have a very fond place in my heart, because it opened up the world of science fiction and fantasy to me."},{"Title":"Moon Called","review":"I think &quot;Moon Called&quot; is for Norton fans only. It seems to have started out as fantasy, then switched to science fiction midway through the manuscript. The hero and heroine, who both practice white magic, ride to the rescue of one of their comrades in a hi-tech tank. Although Norton successfully combined magic and technology in some of the early Witch World novels, it doesn't work as well in &quot;Moon Called&quot;. Thora, the heroine is also a bit too prickly and too inclined to argue about religion to be likeable. Dialogue (never a Norton strong point) is exceptionally stilted and long-winded. Thora is given lines like, &quot;Him also do all who serve the Lady call enemy,&quot; and &quot;I am one with those who draw the Moon---though I was not yet brought to Her as one of the Three.&quot;The action scenes and the confrontation of white versus dark magic are vintage Norton, both suspenseful and eerie, so there is meat in &quot;Moon Called&quot; for the die-hard fan (I've read it at least three times). However, I would recommend &quot;The Crystal Gryphon&quot; or &quot;Year of the Unicorn&quot; as a 'starter fantasy' for those who are not yet familiar with this fine author."},{"Title":"Moon Called","review":"This was a boring book. Nothing happened! The descriptions of people, places, and events were really good-unlike the plot. Basically, Thora is from some community where if you're born with the mark of the goddess, you learn how to use a limited amount of magic, and don't have to get married or take care of the home. The community is attacked by pirates, but Thora and her dog escape. Thora finds a wounded familiar, and they travel together. They find an underground storage chamber thing, and go through it. There are all sorts of things there from the old days, where technology was above that of the middle ages. Thora and Malkin and Kurt go to the place where Malkin's blood-bonded person is, they fight some evil people, blah, blah, blah. The thing I didn't like about this book was that nothing really interesting happens. They have battles, but the battles aren't realistic, even for a fantasy/science fiction story. I mean, they don't know who they're really fighting, none of the bad guys ever say anything. Plus, Thora is _really_ intolerant of other people's religious beliefs and customs. If someone doesn't go with the code she was raised with, she pretty much gives them the cold shoulder. It got on my nerves. Again, nothing happened. I liked the furry people-the familiars, and their relatives in the woods-but the people were boring. Thora's is the only view point, and she never changes her mind about any of them. Basically, it's a boring book with boring characters. I've read a few of Norton's other books, and feel pretty confident when I say that this is definately not her best work."},{"Title":"Moon Called","review":"I can't say I liked this book. I found it was incredibly boring with no writing style whatso ever. And the plot could have been taken from a 'typical science fiction' receipe book. Honestly. I barely managed to finish it. Thora had potential. Nothing else did. She didn't even change in the course of the book. Leave this one in the bookshelf. Its not worth the time."},{"Title":"Moon Called","review":"MOON CALLED is no relation to Norton's Yiktor series; this is an \\"after the fall of civilization\\" novel more along the lines of NO NIGHT WITHOUT STARS or STAR MAN'S SON, though evidently not in the same setting as either. As in those stories, the protagonist of MOON CALLED was an apprentice being trained in relatively arcane, specialized knowledge - in this case, a priestess - who was cast adrift from her people before the story opens. Unlike the protagonists of several other Norton stories in this vein, Thora was not exiled; her native village was destroyed by pirates, leaving her to make her way in the world alone.Stumbling across an alien, injured stranger by chance, Thora is drawn into contact with Malkin's native society, wherein Malkin is familiar - lifelong companion, if you like - to a man of power in that society, wherein the gender roles are not quite reversed from those in Thora's own culture (down to serial polyandry in Makil's society, as opposed to polygamy in Thora's). Thora goes through some culture shock, but not much - Makil's society is only peripherally explored, mostly concerning those aspects that a hunter and sentry without strong family ties would see.With very little tweaking, the story could've been dropped onto either continent of the Witch World during the Kolder War; the new universe introduced here isn't very memorable, and the post-apocalyptic aspects aren't utilized beyond setting up a \\"cache of very dangerous stuff\\" that could've been almost any McGuffin without loss of originality. (Thora and Makil's people have to make sure it doesn't fall into the wrong hands, with some disagreement among Makil's people about whether it might be useful for *them* to exploit.) No suggestion that I noticed of how the now-dominant religions, magic use, and so on happened to develop; throwing \\"Set\\" in as the name of the deity worshipped by the forces of evil is a little jarring for that reason, because none of the other religious elements seem to have such a clear connection to present-day mythology (generic moon goddess, Lord of Light, that sort of thing for the other religions).While this book has its moments - I'll grant any of Norton's books that, though it doesn't quite make the three-star cut for me - I would recommend DARKNESS AND DAWN or SPELL OF THE WITCH WORLD over it for similar material given better handling. Elys' story in SPELL OF THE WITCH WORLD has some similarity to Thora's, but has a much more fleshed-out setting (though a more standard resolution of her relationship with Jervon than Thora has with Makil).Nitpicks:- It doesn't ring true that other survivors of Thora's native village scattered without trying to regroup, or that Thora abandoned them without more backstory and effects on her character. (Thora doesn't seem to know if there were other survivors, or care.) Norton offers some explanation for Thora's detachment, but it seems thin. She was being trained as a priestess and a major figure in the community, but feels no apparent responsibility apart from her duty to protect various religious artifacts. For her, being a priestess seems to be about her special Chosen status, not at all about her relationship with/responsibilities to other people. (While this is certainly one way to develop a society, Thora lost her home and everything she ever knew except her dog, and doesn't seem to have been affected at all as the story opens a few months down the line.)- Thora doesn't quite seem to have the responses of a trained fighter - on poking into a strange, darkened room, she remains silhouetted in the doorway, and generally doesn't seem to be as prone to moving cautiously (or not at all) as one might expect a lone wanderer to need to be.- Granted that this is a setting without efficient mass communication, it still seems that travellers' tales would've at least made Thora acquainted with Makil's people by rumour before she encountered them, since they're within a few months' journey at walking pace (a lot less, possibly) from her native village.The back cover blurb for the first edition is poor, by the by."},{"Title":"Moon Called","review":"are we talking about the same book i loved it and after 9 yrs still want it in my library my kids tore my copy in half and have been forlorn to replace it for years and yes if there is a sequill i want that too."},{"Title":"Tales told by fossils","review":"An introductory type of palaeontology book, aimed at younger readers in general.This first volume goes from the start of life until the time of the dinosaurs, which, of course, is the really cool part that everyone likes the most."},{"Title":"Rewriting History","review":"I only needed to skim this book to see that it was the usual inaccurate rightwing hack job.

Great Job Dick MorrisIndeed you are correct that America is being dumb down by the LiberalLeft Liars. Thank you for this eye opening masterpiece.It is this mindset that caused Americans to be caught so off-guard on September 11th.All of this is the expression of religion; President Bush is absolutely wrong!Why were American politicians and the American public so blindsided by the September 11th attack? Why were the FBI, the CIA, Congress, the Pentagon, the mayor of New York and the President of the United States caught so unaware? They were busy studying the politics of the Middle East, and not the religion of Islamic fundamentalism. As long as President Bush refuses to admit that Ground Zero for the war on terrorism is a religion called Islamic fundamentalism, we will not be able to win the war. It has been said that he who defines the terms, wins the debate.America has been in Osama bin Laden s murderous crosshairs since 1998 when he issued a fatwa calling on Muslims everywhere to kill Americans. No one in this country took him seriously when he wrote:The ruling to kill the Americans and their allies civilians and military is an individual duty for every Muslim who can do it in any country in which it is possible to do it, in order to liberate the al-Aqsa Mosque and the holy mosque [Mecca] from their grip, and in order for their armies to move out of all the lands of Islam, defeated and unable to threaten any Muslim. This is in accordance with the words of Almighty God, and fight the pagans all together as they fight you all together, and fight them until there is no more tumult or oppression, and there prevail justice and faith in God.We with God s help call on every Muslim who believes in God and wishes to be rewarded to comply with God s order to kill the Americans and plunder their money wherever and whenever they find it. We also call on Muslim ulema, leaders, youths, and soldiers to launch the raid on Satan s U.S. troops and the devil s supporters allying with them, and to displace those who are behind them so that they may learn a lesson.Yes, Islamic fundamentalism is a religion and it kills. The enemy is among us, and we can no longer define who that enemy is. Like the frog in the vat of water, we are perfectly happy to take our ease not realizing until it is too late that the pot reached the boiling point while we were lulled into a false sense of security.U. N. members are screaming loudly, entreating anyone who will listen to save the terrorist regime, Hamas. The organization has not only murdered Jews, but Palestinians as well. The world should be outraged, yet the silence is deafening, especially after 9/11.\\"Give me your passport!\\" I smiled and said, \\"Little boys, you should be playing with toys, not guns.\\" The two boys, about nine and ten years old, clicked off the safeties on their Russian AK-47s. I suddenly realized I was a dead man if I made one wrong move. It was on October 22, 1983 in Beirut, Lebanon. The following day two hundred forty-one U. S. Marines would be murdered in their barracks.The night before I had videoed the Marines' Christmas messages to their loved ones back in the States. What a shock to see children, or as the liberal media describe them, \\"innocent civilians,\\" waging Jihad. These children had been trained for years in a radical Islamic kindergarten terror camp.Yesterday, I met with Sderot's mayor Eli Moyal just one mile from the Gaza border where 7,500 Hamas-fired missiles have landed. The mayor's office is a bunker as are many buildings in Sderot. The children's play areas are filled with concrete playground equipment which can double as bunkers in the event of a missile attack.Hezbollah and Hamas, Iran's sub-contractors, have perfected the art of manipulating the media. This has been achieved despite the fact they are rabid, racist, terrorist organizations that make the Ku Klux Klan look like mere Boy Scouts.Some time ago, I debated Al Sharpton on Hardball with Chris Matthews. The topic was Israel's use of what the media labels \\"excessive force.\\" I said to Mr. Sharpton, \\"Would you defend the KKK if it fired thousands of missiles into Harlem, and the residents of Harlem responded with what the media perceived to be excessive force'?\\"The media does not want to show hundreds of Israeli trucks crossing into Gaza with medicines and food. Likewise, no one wants to acknowledge that Israeli hospitals in southern Israel continue to treat wounded Palestinians. Neither is it popular to acknowledge that the majority of the injured and dead are Hamas operatives and fighters who surround themselves with innocent civilians, often women and children.During the Hezbollah attack on Israel in 2006, I was shocked to see American liberal reporters stage shots on the roofs of 4- and 5-star hotels in Haifa. These reporters, attired in dress slacks and spit-shined shoes, had donned flak jackets and helmets in order to look as if they were reporting from Lebanon. Most often, their stories were about \\"innocent Lebanese civilians\\" being killed. These men and women refused to acknowledge that the missiles were being fired from Hezbollah garages hidden deep in populated areas. One cannot escape the truth that a person is just as dead whether killed by a woman or child, or an adult, male terrorist dressed in a quasi-military uniform.America's greatest threat is from Liberal Left liars and lunatics in the media determined to lull the American people into complacency. Most often, the victims of terror are castigated while the terrorists are lionized. The war on terror cannot be won unless media terror is exposedSecretary-General Kofi Annan and the United Nations Security Council is currently meeting and is working intensely with members and key leaders, both here and in capitals, to push for a resolution concerning the situation in Israel and Lebanon. The critical question is: With a consistently anti-Israel, anti-Zionist bias how can the UN, with a don t ask, don t tell policy when it comes to Bigotry against the Jews possibly be the savior of the day? Will this meeting be reminiscent of the UN-hosted World Conference against Racism in Durban, South Africa only two weeks before 9/11? Both the Israel and U.S. delegations walked out of the conference when racism was equated with Zionism. Yes, Iran, Hizbullah, and even Hamas are now encouraging the UN to act. I wonder why?Could it be a ploy to allow a group of about 60 Iranian volunteers that set out from Teheran to join fellow Iranian volunteers in Lebanon time to reach their destination?With yellow Hizbullah flags flying, Amir Jalilinejad, chairman of the Student Justice Movement, told the Associated Press, \\"We are just the first wave of Islamic warriors from Iran.\\" \\"More will come from here and other Muslim nations around the world. Hizbullah needs our help.\\"As if to stress the closeness of the jihadist terrorist alliance, the group gathered in a section of Teheran's main cemetery reserved for war dead and other \\"martyrs\\" and prayed before a memorial to Hizbullah suicide bombers. They praised Hizbullah leader Hassan Nasrallah and pledged their loyalty to the Islamist fanatics who perpetrated the 1983 bombing of the US Marines barracks in Beirut in which 241 US servicemen were murdered. A second bombing killed 56 French peacekeepers.The Iranian volunteers ranging in age from teenagers to men old enough to be their grandfathers are eager to join the Islamist death cult that both characterizes Hizbullah in Lebanon and Hamas in the Gaza Strip. It is an ideology that justifies brainwashing Arab children to become martyrs by blowing themselves up among Israeli children, that warrants using entire Lebanese villages as human shields, behind which to launch thousands of deadly missiles at Israeli population centers.And part of the shame of it is they are proud of this! As David Brooks wrote this week in The New York Times, there are Hizbullah victory markers strewn all over southern Lebanon, which tour buses would visit during happier times.One brightly colored sign, written in both Arabic and (rough) English, marked the spot where On Oct. 19, 1988 at 1:25 p.m. a martyr car that was body trapped with 500 kilograms of highly exploding materials transformed two Israeli troops into masses of fire and limbs.Busloads of tourists would take victory tours and stop at the prominent sights. Before the current war, there were gift shops and, in at least one place, a poster showing a Hizbullah fighter lifting a severed Israeli head. It all testified to the magnetism of a successful idea: that Muslim greatness can be restored through terrorism.It is not unlikely that Hizbullah hypocrites are even now preparing new victory markers for the hundreds of Lebanese civilians whose deaths they caused by using them as human shields, firing missiles at Israel from inside their houses and using their homes to store weapons. Israel inadvertently killed Lebanese non-combatants when being forced to strike back at Hizbullah in self-defense and that is the difference. Israel dropped leaflets and made radio broadcasts warning Lebanese civilians to flee the fighting, while Hizbullah has fired more than 2,000 missiles trying to kill as many Israeli civilians as possible.There is perhaps no better an example of how Islamist extremists memorialize terrorism than an exhibition held by students at An-Najah University in Nablus on the West Bank a few years ago. It commemorated the victory of a suicide bomber who blew himself up at the Sbarro pizzeria in Jerusalem on August 9, 2001, murdering 15 people, seven of them children. The students built a replica of the restaurant, complete with fake human body parts and pieces of pizza strewn around the room. It was very popular.The execution-style murder of Paul Johnson has been condemned by the Organization of the Islamic Conference. The OIC chief, Abd al-Wahid Bilqaziz labeled Mr. Johnson s death as a barbaric act , and went on to reassure the world in general and the American public in particular that Islam recommends the protection of foreigners and prohibits the killing of innocent people. How magnanimous of Mr. Bilqaziz!Apparently in an attempt to assuage world outrage, Saudi security launched a search for the body of the beheaded American. Why has that outrage not extended to the hundreds, perhaps thousands, who have been beheaded and tossed into unmarked graves over the past 30 years?According to Amnesty International, more than half of those beheaded between 1990 and 1999 were foreign nationals, and some were Christian missionaries. Why has the Saudi government not returned those bodies to their loved ones for proper burial?In Saudi Arabia, heads roll for sodomy, armed robbery, murder, and for being a Christian. Some Christians were beheaded after having been falsely accused of drugs or other crimes reportedly as benign as leading a Bible study or offering prayers. Saudis that convert to Christianity, or desert Islam , are subject to the death penalty, as well.Those condemned to death are taken to a public square, blindfolded after midday prayers; hands tied behind their backs, and forced to kneel facing Mecca. The police clear the square of all traffic and lay a blue plastic sheet, 16-feet square on the ground. The executioner swings the sword two or three times before jabbing the poor soul in the back to force him to raise his head. More than 100 people have been beheaded in Saudi since 9/11, and the vast majority were not members of al-Qaeda!We are told that the militants and extremists who committed the horrendous murder of Paul Johnson have been killed. Why are murderers, who have no regard for the sanctity of human life, called militants ? Why not label them exactly as what they are: Terrorists? And, if these so-called militants and extremists are going to be hunted down and killed or arrested, what awaits the entire House of Saud?I, too, am outraged, not only by the beheading of Paul Johnson, but by the Saudi PR-machine that has hypocritically expressed its disgust over this barbarism. It is, indeed, the theater of the absurd and a festival of hypocrisy.In 1991 during the Persian Gulf War, I preached the gospel in the center of Dhahran. U.S. military police grabbed me and screamed, Are you nuts? They will cut your head off, you fool! Days later, I shared Christ with General Khalid. He looked at me and asked, Are you trying to convert me? We cut off heads for that.Any thinking person knows that the House of Saud is the principal financier of the terrorists on whom President Bush has declared war. They export more than oil. About twenty-five percent of all those in the prison camp at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba are Saudi nationals. No country in the world has spent more to export bigotry and hatred than Saudi Arabia.Islam is portrayed as a religion of tolerance. How ignorant can we be? Women cannot drive cars in Saudi Arabia, girls are still circumcised, political parties and trade unions are outlawed, the Church and State are one in Saudi Arabia. Do not hold your breath while searching for a Christian church or Jewish synagogue in that country; you will suffocate. Television is censored to the degree that if Mickey Mouse gives Minnie Mouse a peck on the cheek, poor Mickey will be banished from the kingdom!Several years ago, I interviewed a U.S. Aramco employee. He told me he was tortured for having a video of The Love Boat in his suitcase. He was accused of possessing pornography. While in jail, he feared he might be beheaded.The Holy Grail of understanding is that there is nothing tolerant about Saudi Arabia. Shariah (Islamic law) shows no tolerance. No, it is no coincidence that 15 of the 19 terrorists who attacked America on 9/11 were Saudi Arabian. All were Wahabists, as is the Taliban, and the majority of the population of Saudi. If democracy comes to tolerant Saudi Arabia, Osama bin Laden would be elected in a landslide.We have been assured that Saddam Hussein was not involved in 9/11; on the other hand, we know with certainty that Saudi nationals were. For the House of Saud to try to distance itself from Islamic fundamentalism would be tantamount to Osama trying to distance himself from terrorism.The same can be said of al Qaeda. The general Muslim population thinks the evil empire of communism was not defeated by Ronald Reagan and the crusaders, but rather, it was Osama bin Laden and Islam that caused the Soviet house of cards to crumble in Afghanistan. They also believe there is just one evil empire in the world, and that Iraq will be to America what Afghanistan was to the Soviets.he war on terrorism is a war against bigotry. It s a war that cannot be won unless we deal with Yasser Arafat and the PLO. Bigotry is a terrible thing; no one appreciates being discriminated against. Imagine, however, someone hating you so much that they refuse to even recognize your very existence. Conversely, imagine being told if you did precisely as you were instructed, your right to exist would be recognized. Israel has faced this catch-22 situation since her rebirth in 1949.Millions of Arab bigots are propagating as true the diabolical lies quoted by Hitler from Mein Kampf and the Protocols of the Elders of Zion. Arab children are being taught that all wars are caused by the Jews, that the Jews invented AIDS, that Jews attacked America on September 11 th and blamed it on the Arabs, and that America went to war against Iraq to appease the Jews. While this sounds ridiculous to us, it is accepted as truth in Arab lands.The truth is the Baghdad Bobs of the Middle East feed these myths and conspiracy theories to the masses daily. These fabrications are believed as the Gospel, and used to inflame Palestinian children to commit violent acts against the Jews. Children play death games, collect terrorist cards (complete with pictures of suicide bombers), and fantasize about killing Jews to reclaim al-Quds (Jerusalem.)And it doesn t stop with pretense! At least two-dozen children under the age of 18 have perished as suicide bombers; children as young as 11 have been enlisted as mules to smuggle bomb-making supplies into Israel. The two young Palestinians who carried out the most recent attack in Ashdod were 17-years-old.In 1997, I wrote an opinion piece for the Wall Street Journal entitled, Where s the Outrage? The article outlined the fact that the world continued to tolerate Arafat s speeches calling for one million martyrs to liberate Jerusalem. Yet today, Arafat s Palestinian Authority uses the television airwaves to encourage children of all ages to become Shahada suicide martyrs.Money keeps Arafat in power! Since 1994, he has kept a tight grip on $5.5 billion dollars of international aid that has flowed into Palestinian coffers. He dispenses his wealth to would-be martyrs, as well as to purchase 50-ton shipments of weapons from Iran. Arafat s critics are either paid off, or murdered. According to Israeli intelligence, Arafat s personal holdings are reported at $1.3 billion. This includes a 23 percent stake in a casino in Jericho (estimated worth - $28.5 million), 20 percent of a Tunisian telecom company (estimated at $50 million), and a $55 million share of a firm that controls most of the cement imported into the territories.Every six months, President Bush has an opportunity to allow the Anti-terrorism Act of 1987 to become law. The time has come for Mr. Bush to refuse to sign another waiver on this resolution, and allow it to be enacted. This document places the PLO firmly where it belongs; on the terrorist list. This Act would hold Arafat and his entire terrorist cartel accountable, and stop PLO terrorists from entering the U.S. under diplomatic immunity. It is time for President Bush to freeze Arafat s $1.3 billion in PLO funds, and pay compensation to the survivors of Americans killed by Arafat.As far back as February 12, 1986, a letter was sent from 47 Senators to the U. S. Justice Department demanding that Arafat be indicted for the murder in Khartoum, Sudan, of Ambassador Cleo Noel, and charge d affaires, C. Curtis Moore. To date, no action has been taken; but there is no statute of limitations on murder. It must also be noted that the U.S. State Department has an audiotape of Arafat s order to have the American diplomats killed.God bless President George W. Bush for refusing to invite Arafat to the Bush White House. He has drawn a line in the sand on this issue. Now it is time to send Arafat to The Hague to stand trial alongside Milosovic.In order to win the war on terrorism, America must fight a war on bigotry. The same bigotry that kills Jews also kills Christians. We discovered that on 9/11. For all the Arab bigots who call themselves patriotic Americans , and who don t like the signing of this document, the President needs to refuse to recognize their right to exist as an American, and send them back to their countries of origin.\\"Will terrorism come to America, and if so, when and where?\\" \\"Yes,\\" he said, \\"I believe it will, and the most likely city will be New York...and the building, the Empire State Building in that it's the tallest.\\" Isser Harrel (who ran Israel's Mossad Intelligence network from 1947 to 1963) was correct the year he told me that the Empire State Building was the tallest building; however, the following year, the much taller Twin Towers were built. That meeting took place decades ago!On Tuesday, September 11, terrorists delivered two 189-ton bombs in the form of fully fueled aircraft. Yet as horrific as that demonic attack was, it was not the worst-case scenario.The 21 st Century terrorists have access to chemical and biological weapons that can kill tens of thousands in a matter of minutes. Extremist Islamic terrorist organizations nullify the need to have air power or Intercontinental missiles as delivery systems for an Islamic nuclear payload. The terrorists themselves will be the delivery system. In the worst of such scenarios, the consequences could be not a car bomb, but a nuclear bomb.Bin Laden issued a statement called the \\"Nuclear Bomb of Islam.\\" In it he said, \\"The international Islamic front for fighting the Jews and Crusaders is the duty of all Muslims.\\" He called on all Muslims to \\"...prepare for as much force as possible to terrorize the enemies of God.\\"This new 21 st Century terrorism now is a direct confrontation against \\"The Great Satan - America\\" who in the eyes of the bin Ladens of the world is desecrating the cradle of Islam. Bin Laden's network Al-Qa'ida (The Base) is a coalition of the most diabolical terrorist organizations in the world, all linked together with a common cause - to attack the kingdom of evil - America. The actions of bin Laden and his terrorist links could not be possible without a broad infrastructure of government movements and organizations that support terror directly or indirectly.Tuesday, September 11, 2001 was a day of celebration - like a sporting event - among the world family of terrorists. Like a team sport, terrorism is a team effort. To win--America must focus on the whole team of opponents instead of one player.After more than 300 suicide attacks in 14 countries through 17 organizations- just this year- it's time to deal harshly with the family of terrorists and their sponsors.Even in World War II, America was not forced to confront suicide bombers on its own soil. We never concluded, in WWII, we could win the war by shooting down one suicide bomber. The victory obviously required more systemic measures. Likewise, to truly defeat terrorism, we need to open our eyes to the obvious-that Osama Bin Laden is a card-carrying member of a terrorist cartel who is received with honor by the Saddam Husseins of the Middle East (terrorist states) - and, then direct bold efforts to stop him and aggressively stifle the entire scope and network of terrorist activity.Terrorism shows itself to us in 21 st Century makeover. Today, terrorist states generally don't take hostages. Incognito--they can pose greater psychological damage by paralyzing, confusing and diminishing the ability of a nation to retaliate.Young terrorists are used as Jihad bait by elusive terrorist states and organizations. It's a \\"don't ask, don't tell\\" world where the sponsors, with tears in their eyes, innocently express their condolences to victimized countries. Organized crime is about greed. Terrorism is about glory...the glory of humiliating \\"The Great Satan - America\\"...the glory of believing that all of the terrorists' family members are guaranteed a place in heaven because of their acts, and that, as young men, they will be greeted in Heaven with a room full of voluptuous virgins.Does it seem a little strange that Syria, Iran, Libya, Iraq, Egypt, Afghanistan, Lebanon, and even Palestine (the P. L. O.) have never turned a terrorist over to America, and have never had problems with the terrorists they harbor? This is the reason for the dancing in the streets. It's the theater of the absurd, and a festival of hypocrisy!The terrorist cross hairs are on \\"The Great Satan - America\\" that they see as the pig polluting the world with her prosperity, power and pornography and infecting the Islamic vision with her moral and religious perversion. Terrorists don't hate the West because of Israel; they hate Israel because of the West. Why the Twin Towers? Because it was a symbol of America's influence. The towers were 100 stories high and could be seen from 150 miles away. In 1993, a car- bomb failed to destroy the World Trade Center.Sheikh Omar Abdel Rahman, spiritual leader of the World Trade Center bombers in 1993 said, \\"The obligation of Allah is upon us to wage Jihad for the sake of Allah...We have to thoroughly demoralize the enemies of God by blowing up their towers that constitute the pillars of their civilization...the high buildings of which they are so proud.\\"The New York police found 47 boxes of Rahman's terrorist literature. Rahman, who was involved in the assassination of Egyptian President Anwar Sadat, came to America in 1990, free to set up his terrorist shop in New Jersey as if with our blessing.PBS, in a piece aired in 1994, described the terrorist team effort. The documentary revealed the threat of a quilt-work of Islamic groups and terrorist sponsors that have sprung up across America since the Iranian revolution. These groups include arms of Islamic Jihad, Hamas, and Hizballah with cells in New York, Florida, Chicago, Kansas City, and Dallas. The groups hide behind a smoke screen of small businesses and religious and charitable Islamic groups. These team members work in the U. S. to raise funds, recruit volunteers, and lay plans for terrorist missions for the ultimate battle against \\"The Great Satan.\\" Their primary objective is to succeed with the mission without being blamed, then to realize widespread media coverage, and to maximize psychological and economic damage through terror.It's past time that America drew a line in the sand. The conspirators of America's greatest terrorist attack in U. S. history walked freely in our streets. The truth is we have thousands of terrorist sympathizers and supporters living in the U.S. We must immediately take a hard look at our laws regulating and screening immigration and asylum seekers, and deal aggressively with terrorists who have already slipped through the cracks.Secondly, America needs to focus on the terrorist cartel and work aggressively with all western democracies to cut it off - like the head of a poisonous snake. As long as we allow organizations to harbor terrorists, and countries to empower them and reward them, the network will thrive. Syria poses a prime example. She received one billion dollars for providing a show of force during the Persian Gulf War. Syria is recognized by the State Department as a terrorist country. When the U.S. this week asked Syria to be part of the coalition against terrorism, they flatly refused.Thirdly, America must outlaw the businesses and fundraising groups operating legally in this country yet supporting terrorism; arrest and, at the very least, deport the groups and individuals.Fourthly, we need to freeze financial assets of terrorist regimes and organizations throughout the entire western world. Countries and organizations that harbor terrorists should not even be able to spit in the wind without it coming back in their faces.Once America makes up its mind to deal aggressively with terrorists through economic and military retaliation, the family of terrorism will fragment, and no longer will terrorism be a team effort.On the morning of February 26, 1993, Yigal Carmon, then counter-terrorism adviser to prime minister Yitzhak Rabin, warned the Pentagon that radical Islam was an imminent threat to America. At the end of his briefing, he was told by smirking critics that they did not consider a religion to be a threat to national security.Later that morning Carmon flew on to New York, where, while having lunch, a huge explosion took place nearby: Islamic terrorists had attempted to blow up the World Trade Center, killing six people and wounding 1,000.Last September 11, Islamic terrorists finished the job. No one wants to admit why Americans were attacked just by whom. But Osama bin Laden is only the vanguard of a religious hatred that originates in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and seeks to impose the will of radical Wahabi Islam throughout the world. The terrorist threat that bin Laden demonstrated on September 11 was just the opening salvo in the first world religious war of the 21st century.An earlier campaign in the same war began in Israel in 1987, called the intifada. From mostly stone-throwing, this violence has escalated into the horrific suicide bombing that has come to characterize the so-called \\"al-Aksa intifada.\\"From scenes of Palestinians dancing on West Bank rooftops during Iraqi Scud attacks of the Gulf War, we are now witness to Palestinian mothers celebrating and handing out sweets upon hearing that their sons have blown themselves up killing innocent Israeli bus passengers. In this grotesque dance of death, Islamic zealots who are murderers are revered as religious martyrs.On December 9, 1987, the Muslim Brotherhood met and issued a communique calling for the intensification of the Palestinian uprising. It was signed by representatives of the Islamic Resistance movement. Abdullah Azzam, Osama bin Laden's mentor, developed the theme: \\"There is no solution to the Palestinian problem except jihad.\\" The goal was simply to export Ayatollah Khomeini's \\"Islamic revolution\\" via the Hamas movement, and thereby Islamicize the Palestinian national struggle. Just as Islam had defeated the strongly pro-Western shah of Iran and shamed America, and just as Islam had defeated the communists in Afghanistan and led to the collapse of the Russian empire, so would the \\"Zionist entity\\" be slowly bled to death -- and so would the Great Satan, America.There were no expressions of outrage from leading Muslim clerics on September 12 -- a silence as deafening as that regarding Jews who are slaughtered weekly in Israel by the same type of Islamic terrorists. This same silence has greeted the deaths of Palestinians themselves, who were branded as collaborators and summarily executed for allegedly working for Israel. Just a couple of weeks ago, Ikhlas Yasin, 39, the mother of seven children, was shot and killed by executioners of Fatah's Aksa Martyrs Brigades in the main square of Tulkarm. An intolerant, radical Islam is striving to become the vocabulary of everyday life, reshaping the language of politics, culture, and traditions and taking no prisoners.WHY HAS America not succeeded in numerous attempts to implement a peace process between Israelis and Palestinians not in Madrid, not at Camp David, not in dozens of public and secret peace initiatives? The simple reason is that radical Islam does not negotiate with infidels; and if not with the Great Satan, then surely not with the Little Satan.US President George W. Bush has stated that he found it \\"strangely coincidental\\" that every time the US attempted to move toward peace there was a massive terrorist attack in Israel. But there is nothing coincidental in such attacks, for they are aimed both at murdering Israelis and at the same time humiliating the Great Satan. The only thing American brokering has done is weaken its greatest ally in the Middle East and open the floodgates to an ever more aggressive Islamic terrorism. When you reward Islamic terrorists with political or economic concessions, they can only assume that you fear them and that crime pays.The last thing that corrupt and shaky Arab dictators want is peace between Israel and the Palestinians. Their regimes are sustained by military power and they know they cannot justify having an army without an enemy. Without the Jews to blame for their poverty, illiteracy, and lack of democratic freedoms, their populations would turn on them, as did those of Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union.Rev. Franklin Graham, who prayed at Bush's inauguration and at the September 14 memorial service in Washington, said in his book, The Name: \\"The United States is engaged in a war against terrorism. But this war has a unique twist for Americans. We are not fighting to stop Hitler or godless Communism...Those who have attacked America invoke their God's name, Allah.\\"Radical Islam has given birth to a weapon that truly cheapens human life: the suicide bomber. But this will be as nothing compared to the weapons of mass destruction under preparation in Iraq and other radical Islamist states; weapons whose targets may begin with Israel but ultimately are aimed at the world's greatest democracy.(September 30) - On a September evening in 1980 in Tel Aviv, I sat with former Mossad chief Isser Harel for a conversation about Arab terrorism. As he handed me a cup of hot tea and a plate of cookies, I asked him, \\"Do you think terrorism will come to America, and if so, where and why?\\"Harel looked at his American visitor and replied, \\"I fear it will come to you in America. America has the power, but not the will, to fight terrorism. The terroris"},{"Title":"Rewriting History","review":"I have not had the opportunity to utilize all of the purchases I have made.

Hillary's political character has been hammered out in the smithy of late 20th century American politics. Dick Morris is a manufacturer of politicians and that is all the difference.Rewriting History is a sustained accusation of hypocrisy and moral turpitude, as all such \\"tell all\\" books are.A major complaint of Rewriting History is that Hillary Clinton didn't follow Dick Morris's advice, which was to \\"appear\\" to have a \\"better\\" character.But character is impossible to manufacture. In addition, a political character is easy to assassinate but difficult to fathom. In politics, character consists of keeping an even keel and a strong moral compass among people, most of whom claim to be \\"friends\\" merely so that they can get something from you and who will stab you in the back when they can't use you anymore. Abraham Lincoln, among many others, said \\"Nearly all men can stand adversity, but if you want to test a man's character, give him power.\\" No one is immune from all of the temptations of power and all are subject to the failures that such temptations sometimes provoke. It is in the balance of moral successes and failures that one must look for political achievement.Rewriting History ends by comparing Hillary to Richard Nixon and Bobby Kennedy. But similarities in character are not revealed by superficial qualities such as being an excellent and disciplined student. No two people could be more different than Richard Nixon and Hillary Rodham Clinton. Nixon came from a Quaker background and began life as a moralist who started his political career as a communist witch hunter. Bobby Kennedy was the son of an Irish bootlegger and womanizer. He too began his political career as a communist witch hunter. His arrogance and ruthlessness were tempered and finally subdued by the events of the 60's, including the assassination of his brother, but we can't know if he would have transcended his problematic beginnings and his uncertain character, and made even a good president not to mention a great one. There are virtually no similarities between Hillary Clinton and Bobby Kennedy.Hillary \\"is a flawed instrument. If she continues to hide behind the HILLARY brand, a second Clinton presidency would do vastly more harm than good. But the question lingers: Will she grow?\\"Rewriting History looks at the surface of Hillary Clinton's political character and not at its substance. I don't claim to know Hillary's heart and character but I can say that this book offers no help.I am not a political supporter of Hillary Clinton: From my limited access to, and knowledge of, the political characters of Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama I lean towards Barack Obama in the race for the 2008 presidential nomination. But to gain real knowledge of Hillary Clinton's political character, I can't recommend Rewriting History which seems to me to be essentially, \\"superficial.\\""},{"Title":"Rewriting History","review":"Political Consultant Dick Morris and his wife, attorney Eileen McGann, have offered America a sobering reexamination of the life and political career of Hillary Rodham Clinton; indeed it is a clarion call warning Americans of what might be in store for the country if Hillary Rodham Clinton is ever elected president of the United States. Theirs is an over two hundred page critique and rebuke of Clinton's novel disguised as memoir \\"Living History\\". \\"Rewriting history\\" demonstrates succinctly how Hillary is a zealous ideologue, overbearing tactician and dubious dealmaker. Hers is a Manichean view of the world divided neatly between the forces of good (those who support her political vision) and evil (anyone opposed to that vision) which may be substantially far worse than Richard Nixon's. Morris and McGann suggest that a Hillary Rodham Clinton administration may be one replete with dubious, ethically challenged dealmaking and settling scores with countless political opponents. Such an administration will certainly not be as visionary as Ronald Reagan's, or perhaps more appropriately, John F. Kennedy's.Morris and McGann demonstrate some begruding respect for Hillary's skills as a tactician and political operative. And yet, as they note often, that's truly all Hillary is, not cut in the same political mold as her mentor - and husband - William Jefferson Clinton. Indeed, she comes across as a political chameleon, shifting apparently to whatever is politically in fashion, without forsaking her zealous liberal ideology (One question which isn't raised by the authors is how Hillary transformed herself from a Midwestern Republican to an Eastern liberal dependent on the support of prominent liberals such as Ira Magaziner (Not only her husband Bill's Oxford pal, but also the principal architect of Brown University's \\"New Curriculum\\" - an academic environment which doesn't demand from its students a broad understanding of a diverse range of subjects from the arts to the sciences; an educational philosophy more akin to great British universities such as Cambridge and Oxford than fellow Ivy League universities like Columbia, Harvard and Yale.).). But to their credit, Morris and McGann offer ample proof demonstrating how disingenuous and corrupt Hillary is truly.\\"Rewriting History\\" is an invaluable look at what Hillary really is from a long-time associate of hers, political consultant Dick Morris. Its devastating critique of Hillary and her motives is one which can't be dismissed as part of the great \\"right-wing conspiracy\\". I strongly recommend this book to anyone - including supporters - interested in the real Hillary Rodham Clinton."},{"Title":"Rewriting History","review":"I bought this book to get an insider's view of the Clinton administration and the facts about the scandals, not necessarily to learn more about Hillary Clinton. This book does that exceedingly well, regardless of your political persuasion. This book is NOT a 'bash Hillary' book. In fact, the author many times mentions the strengths of both Bill and Hillary. I thought Bill was a raging liberal until I read this book. I thought Hillary had stuck by Bill so that Bill could succeed - this is not the reason, if Morris is correct. Excellent history and insight into the Clintons. Morris was Clinton's advisor for nearly 20 years. He knows them in and out. The satisfying thing for me was summing up all the scandals - what really happened, what was the final result, etc. I had forgotten hwo the Paul Jones case concluded, and that the whole Ken Starr thing would have not have happened if Bill Clinton settled in the first place.So disregard the politically motivated reviews of this book - it's incredibly interesting and is great reading. If you're conservative, the last chapter is going to depress you!"},{"Title":"Rewriting History","review":"Let's face it, all you're going to get from customer reviews are 1's or 5's. Are you a democrat? Then hit \\"1\\" and slam away! Readers of your review should know you haven't read it. If you're a Republican, hit \\"5\\" and slam away (at Hillary). I've recieved an advance promo copy, and I'm a Republican. Dick Morris is not a republican, or a conservative. Just a jilted lover (of the Clintons). Knowing this, the book is well written, researched, and detailed. If the guy's lying (if you worked with Clinton, you may have a long history of lying), he hides with good research and a commanding knowledge of the facts.He presents them in an interesting way."},{"Title":"Rewriting History","review":"Finally someone is trying to tell the story of the real Hillary Clinton. Sadly, I believe that he is preaching to the choir. No one who needs to read this book (i.e. -those who beleive in the &quot;vast right wing conspiracy&quot;) would ever buy it.One of the most telling items is a story that I have heard several people try and clarify, including Mr. Morris, but which the Clintons continue to tell and the public continues to take as gospel. I am referring to the story that Hillary Rodhams mother named her after Sir Edmund Hillary, the man who was the first person to reach the top of Mount Everest. Mrs. Clinton conveniently overlooks the fact that Sir Edmund was not famous at the time of her birth and did not make his famous climb until she was about six years old. How do they manage to keep getting away with that?This is a VERY revealing book about Mrs. Clinton and also gives the reader some insights into the former President as well. Definitely worth a look."},{"Title":"Rewriting History","review":"I just finished this book and it is well written. From a man who has known the Clinton's for over 25 years, has good reason to write such a book. Anyone who cannot see Hillarys' web must read this book and find out her true self."},{"Title":"Rewriting History","review":"Yes, Dick Morris is a political consultant who has worked largely for Republicans. However, he has more than twenty years of experience working with the Clintons on Bill's campaigns President as well as Governor of Arkansas. And, yes, it is appropriate to read what any political consultant says with a certain level of caution. However, I think that reading with active skepticism can actually increase the value you get from this book because you will be asking yourself what is real and what is pose. This internal debate will help you get to the important core of what Mr. Morris is saying.Because Mr. Morris is frank about Hillary Clinton's virtues and flaws the Hillary haters will probably not find the book harsh enough and the Hillary acolytes will become incensed at the criticism of their heroine. Remember, it is wrestling with every claim and analysis the author makes that will help you get at what the book has to offer. Senator Hillary Clinton is a real force on the American political scene. It won't do to simply dismiss her or to think she will move back to the Whitehouse by acclimation.The author provides ample evidence that Hillary is a talented person with a lot offer in our country's political debate. He also shows that she has certain character traits that make her brittle and some instincts that do not serve her well. Morris presents his view that the Whitewater scandals and the Lewinsky affair were made much worse by Hillary's immediate and continued tendency to shut down, deny, and stonewall. You may or may not agree with the author's views, but he offers them from personal experience on the inside of the Clinton operations. Some of his personal experiences with the Clintons will have you shaking your head.He then presents the concept of HILLARY as a personae, brand, or media creation. This is the lady that is carefully calibrated to political success. HILLARY is actually much different than Hillary the real person and Morris helps us see the difference and provides some insight so we can decode the way HILLARY is presented to us and what Hillary is actually after. Morris makes a lot of comparisons between Senator Clinton's \\"Living History\\" and a more candid presentation of the facts and events. This provides some very interesting reading that provides some real insight into what makes Hillary tick and how she uses HILLARY to advance her purposes.Morris thinks that Hillary is all but certain to be the Democrat nominee for President in 2008 and that the combination of the end of 8 years of a Republican President and a rather empty field of GOP stars that could actually be nominated and keep the Pro-Life base make a Hillary Presidency a real possibility. We shall see.The fact that the 2008 campaign is already beginning (watch the festivities at the opening of the Clinton Presidential Library and Museum and take note) makes this book more relevant than ever."},{"Title":"Rewriting History","review":"I just got this along with The Dittohead's Guide To Adult Beverages. Dick Morris paints the picture of a Hillary that Hillary doesn't want us to know. One of a woman so focused on her own political power that she will do anything. However he admits that Hillary is not all-powerful. She rarely learns from her mistakes, hides behind a false homemaker image in order to shield herself from criticism, and lacks the depth, intellect, political gifts, and charm of her husband who she has never properly credited for her rise in the political realm. A fascinating insider's look at the Clintons, although The Dittohead's Guide To Adult Beverages was more entertaining!"},{"Title":"Rewriting History","review":"This book would likely be uninteresting for people who are not truly interested in politics. The book is Dick Morris's view as to how Hillary has worked to create a loving wife and mother image for public viewing and opinions. If you are interested in one insider's opinion of Hillary it is worth the time to sit down and read the roughly 300 pages.In respect to the previous reviews that I have read, they are off the mark. It appears to me that the people who think that this is a hack job by Dick Morris on Hillary have not turned the first page and dislike Dick Morris. The book in my opinion displays Hillary as a world class manager and a capable politician. Any negative comments on Hillary are that she attempts to connect with the public by exaggerating her stories. Not what I would call going for the jugular. It appears that Morris does still have respect for Hillary but poses many questions as whether she could be president based on the fact she is very ideological and too vindictive to act as president. Furthermore she is more of a manager than she is a motivating politician. If you are looking for a partisan attack on Hillary, you are not going to find it here.Not a bad way too spend some free time whether you are republican or democratic. Partisan democrats who slammed this book should probably stick to books by Richard Clarke."},{"Title":"Rewriting History","review":"Morris tells it like it is. I couldn't put it down. Wonderful insight to a woman that will stop at nothing to get more power."},{"Title":"Rewriting History","review":"Finally a book about (...)Hillary by someone with the inside story. This is a must read for anyone who fancies themselves as being informed. Even as the left tries to distort and obfuscate Morris stands up and speaks truth.Read this if you want another view. A view that finally gets to the truth."},{"Title":"Rewriting History","review":"Amazon, it doesn't seem very fair to use the same comments from the same writer twice to rate this book. Why not use the comments of the writer giving this book 5 stars twice as well, this would be much more fair in rating this book, don't you think? Duplicating only the writer's comments which gave this book 1 star has skewed the results, or don't you see it that way? Obviously this duplication has dropped the Morris book down to 2.5 stars, not a very &quot;sporting&quot; thing to do is it Amazon? My rating of 5 stars will at least make this an even match again--unless you have some other agenda."},{"Title":"Rewriting History","review":"Dick Morris, after &quot;Off With Their Heads&quot;, follows up with this great book about Hillary Rodham Clinton. Morris carefully explains the emergence of the &quot;Hillary Brand&quot;, in which the former First Lady is undergoing a transformation before our very eyes, preparing for a run at the Presidency. Morris warns that Hillary wears a mask, and what you will hear from her is not what you will get. Deep down, she is the same old Hillary. Morris worked with the Clintons for 2 decades and no one knows their shrewd political plans better than Morris. I found the portion regarding Morris helping Bill in his Arkansas governor races particularly interesting, as that is when he first came to understand what drives Bill and Hillary Clinton. Everyone should read this before 2008!"},{"Title":"Rewriting History","review":"This book turns a scathing eye toward Hillary (and by extension) Bill Clinton. I'm not sure I would have ever bought this book but upon receiving it on loan I figured what the heck. I was blown away by the information in the book and by Mr. Morris's analysis. Any conservative would be happy with this book and any pro-Clinton Dem would be shocked--if they admit to themselves the true disaster that is Clintonism."},{"Title":"Rewriting History","review":"I'm assuming that what Clinton wrote in 'Living History' is entirely contrary to what Morris wrote in 'Rewriting History'. So, I chose only to read this one and take into account that her version would be the exact opposite of what he wrote. I hope dearly that she's not elected in 2008 or any other year and (God help us is if she is) that she's completely through a hormone-driven emotional menopause if she is. Having said that, this book is written with so much animosity. I wish Morris had just stuck to reporting the facts with a little less melodrama."},{"Title":"Rewriting History","review":"This book will put chills on your spine. So scary! If this beast could be president our country will be destroyed. A must read before 2008. Lets face it there will be no chat or talk like she thinks-she is a calculating dictator and must be stopped. Thanks Dick Morris for letting giving us this side of Hilary. This is a must read for every American."},{"Title":"Rewriting History","review":"The man was there. What else can you say for the credibility of the material. The book drones on at times, but the facts and incidents keep pouring out and you get a feel for who the Clintons really are, how Hillary twisted things in her own account (Living History), and how she probably had more impact in the Clinton presidency than Bill himself. So, if she's already been President for 8 years should she be allowed 8 more?"},{"Title":"Rewriting History","review":"For anyone who thinks Hillary should be our next president, I highly recommend reading this book. For anyone who thinks Hillary DOESN'T need to be president...you also need to read it! Dick Morris was an insider, he knows and writes the truth! Do you want to know the truth or do you choose to ignore it?"},{"Title":"Rewriting History","review":"On May 5th, the day after REWRITING HISTORY was released, &quot;a reader from St. Louis&quot; wrote SIX reviews (go back and take a look). They're mostly one-liners. Probably from the same person. And I'm relatively certain that he or she or they have even read one page of REWRITING HISTORY.Reading the one-star reviews, which are quick to discredit Morris and plug Air America or some media website, I can see that, once again, we probably won't see any sensible argument from the Vast Left Wing Conspiracy about this book.I plan on picking up this book, especially since each day appears to get us closer to another Clinton candidacy.And everyone definitely needs to consider everything if that's going to happen."},{"Title":"Rewriting History","review":"Nice to finally see someone associated with the Clintons that doesn't lie."},{"Title":"Rewriting History","review":"There are very few, if any, liberals who cause the kind of visceral dislike of them that the Clintons engender. Teddy Kennedy, for instance, is despised for his views and his unimpressive lifestyle, but the Clintons are even more despised. There is no way of proving this or making real sense of it, but one theory is that, like Kennedy's father, Joseph, the Clintons might not just be power hungry and bad for America, but actually bad in the most primal sense. It is hard to believe that the anti-Christ is an American, but when one looks hard at the faces of Bill and Hillary Clinton they see something dishonest, scheming and unrighteous that goes beyond the usual political machinations. America, watch out for these people.STEVEN TRAVERSAuthor of &quot;Barry Bonds: Baseball's Superman&quot;STWRITES@aol.com"},{"Title":"Rewriting History","review":"Much has been written about Hillary. Much she herself has invented. As I have stated in another review of one of Morris's books, I've had a hard time liking him simply because he worked for Bill Clinton (and, apparently, admires him.)In this book, it is quite apparent, on the other hand, that he is not equally enthusiastic about Hillary, and he seems to give given an honest appraisal of her, naming both her strong and weak points.He seems frankly fearful that she will be elected in 2008 or 2012, and that scenario does seem likely. She may even be the VP choice of Kerry, and would certainly strengthen the ticket this year. I personally think Kerry will lose even with her help. But, given the &quot;perfect storm&quot; scenario described by Morris, she could well be a shoo-in in 2008 (God help us!).Morris does not offer much in the way of quotes, evidence, or fact to back up his description of Hillary's paranoia and vicious streak, but enough has been written by other well-known and objective witnesses to make him believable, and his appraisal of her does seem balanced--even generous on occasion. And he writes from decades of intimate knowledge of the Clintons, having been one of their top advisers in both Arkansas and Washington, D.C. He may even have been one of Bill's unacknowledged procurers (only my speculation.).I have developed my own impression of Hillary's &quot;character&quot; from many sources, and I pray that she is never placed in a position of power greater that the one she presently enjoys. I view her (and her husband, jointly) as the worst pair ever to occupy the White House, at least in my seventy-five years as a native-born cirizen of this country.Joseph (Joe) Pierre, USN (Ret)"},{"Title":"Rewriting History","review":"Even though I keep coming back to Morris for his cunning political insight, I've for some reason or other never given his books an unqualified recommendation. No such reservations here. Rewriting History is well written, thoroughly researched, deeply interesting, precise, fair, and above all a lucid exploration of Hillary's personality and decades-long political evolution under her husband's tutelage, that will clear the haze for those who have been mystified by the motiviation of the Clintons.This is not an insider-tells-all book in the traditional sense. There are few juicy tidbits here that haven't already been widely relished elsewhere. Rather, the book was written as a reaction to the persona Hillary constructed and that was recently buttressed by her autobiography, Living History. Her cultivation of this persona is so complete and calculated that to distinguish it from the real Hillary he calls it the HILLARY brand.Based on his decades-long intimate experience working with the Clintons, Morris contributes an indispensible insight into someone who is, in some circles, seriously considered a potential future candidate for the presidency. Morris does not fall into the trap of treating Hillary as a clone of Bill, but drawing on comparisons with past presidents, he expounds both their strengths and weaknessess, and one of the great assets of this book is the honest and straightforward way he addresses both.Hillary is passionate, uncompromising, incredibly disciplined, and manages with an iron rule that tolerates no dissent or disloyalty. Her ideology is rooted in early connections with ultra-Left wing causes, and she takes any disagreement with those preconceptions very personally. Not an intellectual herself, she is easily led by left-wing radicals. Asked once by Morris for a character flaw that could be used to soften her too-perfect public persona, she replied that she \\"[couldn't] think of anything.\\" Like Ronald Reagan and George W Bush, she has a strong sense of good and evil in the world, but unlike them includes a very great many Americans in the 'evil' category.Steeped in self-righteousness, she will employ absolutely any means to meet her ends. She illegally kept secret the meetings of her health care task force, used confidential FBI files and employed private detectives and physical intimidation to prevent Bill's many affairs from becoming public. She cold-bloodedly fired and smeared the White House travel office staff and denied credit to the ghostwriter of It Takes a Village. Unfortunately, the shield of motherhood and domesticity she hides behind whenever her actions are scrutinized would be unavailable to her as president.Her deep sense of entitlement leads her to be mired in continual scandal, including (but not limited to) the Whitewater deal, Castle Grande/IDT, and her cattle futures trading. She had no qualms about using the resources of the White House for her personal Senate campaign, including pardons of fraudsters, drug dealers, and terrorists-- all in return for donations and votes. She brazenly solicited gifts from wealthy donors, including, of course the unheard-of $8 million advance on her book, right up until the minute she began her term as senator.Her yearning to be interesting yields some comical untruths. She claimed to have been named after mountain-climber Edmund Hillary (unknown until five years after her birth), made up a story about her daughter nearly being killed on 9/11 (Chelsea was nowhere near the WTC), and spun a tale about discrimination while playing high-school soccer (her school didn't offer that sport). The obsessive name-dropping seems designed to lend herself importance by association. She feigns love for New York, a state she knew nothing about.On the one hand, HILLARY overplays her role in welfare reform and international politics just as she downplays her work for American Communist party lawyers and the Black Panthers. She denies any culpability in the Hillarycare fiasco. She denies that her husband's position played any role at all in her own success, even though she was herself at best a mediocre lawyer and politician.HILLARY is a political brand calculated to appeal to her customer base, but offers no clarity about what kind of president Hillary would be. She takes credit for others' work and blames others for her failures. Morris concludes that a HILLARY presidency, characterized by paranoia and vindictiveness, would most closely resemble that of Nixon. Ironically, Hillary may finally have become what she detested most."},{"Title":"Rewriting History","review":"This book is anawesome read. Dick Morris has what many would kill to have: absolute inside information on how both Bill and Hillary lived and breathed. I think this lends great credibility to his account of things. I think this book was masterfully written and an absolute joy to read.To say this is a book written by a 6th grader is simple partisan blather to try and discredit a great book. I can begin to count how many times liberals shoot accusations bindly without any sort of logic or credibility. However, when something is written about liberals, the platinum strandard is somehow involved. Nice try, but those who read this book will come away with quite the opposite opinion.The first anecdote I thought was decisive in establishing Hillary's pathology of exagerration and lies. When she claimed her mother named her after Sir edmund Hillary...man! You have to be very, very insecure with yourself to have to make up such an easily verifiable story.Dick Morris, once again you have come up with a winner. If I ever run for public office, I would make sure you were on my staff. Too bad I can't get this autographed. Great job. Bring on some more..! See you on Fox."},{"Title":"Rewriting History","review":"Disclaimer: I've loathed the Clintons from the get-go.Do I respect Dick Morris? Not much. Does he offer us new information here? Not much. Is the book worth reading? Yes.Why? Because the author has been behind-the-scenes with the Clintons; he's seen her without The Mask (What-you-see-is-what-you-get with Bill, although that changes in a kaleidescopic manner). The Clinton apologistas - I consider them stark raving mad, but that's their perspective - are a lost cause. I'd urge readers who feel they are open-minded on the subject of the Clintons to read this book, and Ed Klein's. It should be obvious that, while many politicians will say anything to get ahead, Hillary leaves the rest eating her dust. Both books also do a good job outlining her pattern of sheer greed as well."},{"Title":"Rewriting History","review":"Funny how some on the left dismiss this book as \\"just a disgruntled ex-employee,\\" yet take Clarke and O'Neil as the gospel truth. As much as I disagree with Dick's political beliefs, he does have a unique perspective on the Clintons. This is a must read for all, especially before Hillary makes her '08 run."},{"Title":"Rewriting History","review":"I am half way done and I am laughing so hard. I have actually read Hillary's book and it is interesting how Mr. Morris has tried to proof his point by offering many facts that is hard to ignore. Hillary is biggest fake in the political world. Her lies about whereabouts of Chelsea on 9/11, her story about her experience with racism, and on and on..It's so sad to see how hard she is trying to be loved and reinvent herself. Please read the book, it's a great read."},{"Title":"Rewriting History","review":"I find it strange that the supposed party of tolerance and compassion have so much hatred in their soul. I'm a moderate democrat who finds this book right on target. The Clintons have done so much harm to our party; we should just cut em loose. This book takes a methodical look at what she wrote and debunks it all. Anyone who can deny the facts is just drinking their own Kool-Aid."},{"Title":"Rewriting History","review":"The book is mostly about Hillary Clinton, and shows how in her own book, Living History, that she has actually rewritten her own history. There is a lot of insight into Hillary's mindset here. Mr. Morris writes about how she manipulates and lies. From reading the book I get the idea that she is an inveterate liar. It also explains how her and Bill targeted different groups just to get their vote. The latest of these type deals was to win Hillary the vote in New York in the senate race. The Clinton's pardoned a number of criminals just before he left office. One group in particular was the 14 members of the Puerto Rican FALN terrorist group that were in prison, who had committed several murders, in order for Hillary to pick up the Puerto Rican vote in New York city, which in previous elections had been going to the Republicans.This confirms my belief that the politicians with their special interest groups are destroying America. Some others were pardoned to help Hillary get campaign money. The politicians are more interested in groups that can put them over the top, to be elected, regardless of what the majority of our citizens want.This book will open your eyes into the Clintons, as well as what is the strategy used today to get the vote to be elected. I'm sure glad my son bought me this book"},{"Title":"Rewriting History","review":"This book is a must read for anyone who is interested in American politics. Morris writes clearly and convincingly about the hidden sides of Hillary Clinton.

What Morris doesn't get is what Republicans fear from a Hillary presidency is not really her odious all too human weaknesses outlined here - stealing more china from the White House, installing her cronies in positions of power and demeaning the office through the garage sale of favors. That's a given. It's what her potential loony leftism might do to certain quaint ideas such as the first and second Amendments of the constitution......."},{"Title":"Rewriting History","review":"Something to balance the deluge of nihilistic left-wing pundit spin from Billary, Clarke and Koppel.

So every Presdent has a side they feel necessary to hide from public consumption, but what Hillary feels a need to hide is who she really is .... this along with her paranoia is very Nixon-esque!Who would know better than their personal strategist and confidant, Hillary's inherent proclivity for exagerration and lies when put on the spot, or when it's convenient to advance her image (which is almost constant). She claimed her mother named her for Sir Edmund Hillary...when in actuality she was born years before Sir Edmond was ever known.You have to be very, very insecure with yourself to have to make up such an easily verifiable story. Yet what this also demonstrated is the \\"pass\\" she seems to continuously get from the press. Her outright fabrication never made it's way into any press coverage.I found Mr. Morris' insider exposure very credible and insightful without anger or attck dog meaness."},{"Title":"Rewriting History","review":"I had a lot of fun with this stimulating and truthful look into the \\"real\\" Hillary. No doubt it is a stab in the back from Dick Morris who was once a close friend of hers, and that is something I would never commend, but Morris must be forgiven because his book as an insider's account is priceless in blowing Hillary's cover and showing how she basically deserves most of the negative criticism she gets. Both she and her husband are masters of the art of being *obviously* phoney, and taking whichever unethical path in order to satisfy their political thirst for political advantage and gain. This is highly unfortunate, becuase the Clintons didn't entirely start out this way. Back in the early years, like the 1980's, Hillary had what I see as honourable ambitions of being a sort of new Eleanor Roosevelt, and she made an admirable attempt with education and literacy, but her attempts, as with her 1990's universal health care debacle, were defeated. Understandably, it's this kind of crushing of her political ambitions and goals that have turned the idealist, well-intentioned woman of before into the hard cold cynic who has simply degenerated into a bitter woman starving for political power and popular validation. If the poles look right to her, she will run for president some day. But only if she is sure of an excellent shot at winning. She is not a woman of the temperamant to take defeat with much joy, and that is an understatement.David Rehak (...)"},{"Title":"Rewriting History","review":"Despite a very slow start-up due to a lot of repeated information, akward ordering (in fact, a complete disregard for chronology and rhyme of reason in places), and wordy composition, rewriting history does manage to entertain and inform on some levels. Dick Morris does prove that he is indeed the political savvy and Clinton insider he is, while also giving some impression onto what Mrs. Clinton could be if she were to perhaps actually get the democratic nomination and go on to take the white house. The method that he does this in is surprisingly almost balanced, although manages to get harsh towards the end of the book. The book could stand to be a little faster of a read though, but it does in the end deliver on being an alright political/tabloid book."},{"Title":"Rewriting History","review":"Dick Morris, political analyst and advisor under president Bill Clinton, offers a rebuttal to former first lady Hillary's Clinton's 'Living History'. Claiming the memoir is distorted and incomplete, Morris critically appraises the New York senator's potential for higher office. No better time to read it then now, as she is in the running for the Office of President.Mr. Morris was someone who worked very close with Hillary Clinton on a daily basis for years. He reveals both some of her hidden strengths and weaknesses, so the book reads as if it is objective. The facts just keep coming in this book, and it seems dull at first, but keep reading. I would rate the book four-and-half stars. This book is worth reading but does have some strong language."},{"Title":"Rewriting History","review":"As usual, Dick Morris lends his insight to someone he knows well.

Morris has worked with the Clintons for years and has soom unique insites some are more credible then others.If you want to have an informed mind and an open mind read this book and Hillaries and decide for yourself. Too many reviews on this page are left or right, but few are objective.Try to verify Ms. Clintons facts and Morris's facts and the one who can most often verifable will be closer to the truth. I beleive that reading a book that you may not like may open your eyes to things that you may want changed. A closed book out of stuborn partisnship is a sadness, both books should be read and judged.This is America there is room for debate, in my life I have been to places where the freedom to have a different opinon does not exist. I am happy that we can have our arguemnts in the US even if they are silly"},{"Title":"Rewriting History","review":"That is the question that Dick answers at the end of the book, and it is a good one.Dick Morris knows about the political life of the Clinton's more than any man (or woman) alive, having been employed Bill's advisor for much of the past 25 years. He point by point goes through Hillary's history and assess both her assets and the things that sould give anyone to think twice before voting for her as President.As evidence by prior \\"reviews\\", there are dye-in-the-wool Democrats who will go apoplectic any time they see someone say anything the slightest bit critical of a Democrat. However, if you truly look at this book, this is not a 100% \\"hack-job\\" by a partisan Republican. He heaps a considerable amount of criticism on Republicans in this book. However, Hillary has a history that is disturbing. Of course, any attempt at showing balance (either in the book world or cable news) is automatically attacked as right-wing. This is assuredly a sympton of decades of media dominance (but that is a topic addressed in other books.)Anyone who is considering voting for her in 2008 (I will vote absentee and I will NOT vote for Hillary) MUST read this book first. If you don't and vote for her, all I can say is that if she wins, you may well come to regret it within four years."},{"Title":"Rewriting History","review":"Has this man ever told the truth?"},{"Title":"Rewriting History","review":"This is another example of the conservative dominated media pandering to the public. Despite what he claims, Morris realizes that the country is conservative leaning today (despite being liberal leaning when you evaluate Americans views on each individual issue) and sees an opportunity to make money by giving the public what they want to hear.PS: Before you respond to conservative media comment, remember the primary purpose of the media in our capitalist society is to make money (not reporting the facts). Therefore, if you continually give consumers news that shows that they are wrong in their beliefs, they'll tune out (i.e. report the facts in a non-bias manner when the country is conservative leaning, especially since 9/11). In all fairness, the media was liberal leaning in the 60s because the country was leaning that direction. However, Reagan made sure that trend didn't continue (at least when he was awake a cabinet meetings)."},{"Title":"Rewriting History","review":"i don't care much for hillary, but i like to read, and after reading this book, all i can tell is that morris has a bruised ego. he's lucky anyone ponied up money to read his immature rants. i expected something real, valid, and well-written."},{"Title":"Rewriting History","review":"The fact that he's on Fox News - the al-Jazeera of American news organizations (or maybe the SciFi Channel of American news organizations) - says it all."},{"Title":"Rewriting History","review":"In an unintended Freudian slip Morris boasted on Hannity &amp; Colmes that his book contains &quot;a hundred and eight-six distortions, omissions, exaggerations or lies.&quot; Indeed!!Anyone thinking of taking this political diatribe seriously should take a look at the detailed exposure of the contradictions and falsehoods in this book posted on the web site of Media Matters."},{"Title":"Rewriting History","review":"Haven't we heard enough of this idiot??

Yes here in America if for whatever reason ( and the more sensational the better! ) if you find yourself as fodder for late-night televison hosts then by simply running to other end of the political spectrum, in an appaling attempt to save your very own extremely thin-skin, you too can be a best selling author. Just take a few potshots at any well-known Liberal and Conservatives simply will not be able to take their money out of their wallets fast enough!That being the case Mr. Morris has written, at least what I consider to be, the atypical hatchet job on Hillary Clinton. No dummy is Dick Morris! Our author is more then aware that Neo-Cons in this country simply love to hate our former first-lady and anything that demonizes her is apparently far too juicy to pass up. Yes, those loonies on the far-Right, salivating at the notion of 'getting the goods' on Hillary have snapped up this little sleazy tell-all ( written in the best yellow journalistic prose of your local 'National Enquirer' ) and with fingers pointing directly at us Liberals are smirking to their hearts content. All the while content in the notion that they truly know what is best for America. Ah yes, that warm, fuzzy feeling of superiority that Conservatives achieve while reading diatribes such as this ( and of course by being spoon fed their their daily dose of Rush Limbaugh! ) is simply far too delicious to pass up.Yes Dick Morris, not unlike patriot Paul Revere, has come to warn America to the dangers of this one woman and how, if not immediately stopped, may destroy our great country and all she stands for. Thats right, its apprent by this authors writings, that Hillary has a scheme to take over America and simply by purchasing this book ( and lining Dick Morris bank account! ) you can help prevent her dasterdly schemes.

She is a feminist icon but lets herself play the weak, credulous victimized wife of the man whom &quot;she knows better than anyone else&quot;(sic).

Like Regan, Morris had worked closely with the first family, and like Regan, it ended badly for him. So, what did he go? He went and wrote a mean spirited book about the people who made his name famous.Morris' book is so vindictive and meanspirited that it obscures some real concerns about the person of Hillary Clinton. He sees everything about her in a bad way, and I can only conclude that the Clinton's snubbing of Morris is the cause of this.Yes, Morris was an advisor to the Clintons at various times of their career, but so were a lot of people. It doesn't make him an expert on Hillary Clinton and his analysis is most definately not the final word.Dissapointingly short, this book is printed in large font with double spacing.

But what he tells you is shocking. Shocking, as in, \\"I'm shocked--shocked!\\" He says that Hillary has been carefully \\"branded\\" and that the woman who won the senate seat in New York is light-years from the woman who served as Arkansas' first lady and a big fish in the tiny pond of the Rose Law Firm. He tells us that what Clinton says publicly often does not jibe with what she expresses in private. He says that, overburdened by public appearances and other duties, her \\"face time\\" with her advisors is seriously limited and that she is overdependent on their advice for the actual nuts and bolts of her legislative and committee duties. He tells us that Clinton is a control freak, that she is suspicious of those who offer objections to her ideas concerning policy, legislation, and even office protocol. He says that there is a disconnect between the powerful Senator and former U.S. first lady and ordinary people. He points to her wealth and privilege. So what else is new? Is there really anything in here that tells us something we don't already know about 100% of the White House, 90% of the U.S. Senate and 75% of the House of Representatives? That they present a false front, groom their public faces, say what people and constituents and the media want to hear? That they have more wealth than the average person? That they're ambitious? What politician isn't ambitious? I'm not a Hilary fan, but this is less than a vicious attack.

I find it particularly irritating that he focuses so much attention on her re-making her image, physical and otherwise. . . . we all know this....we watched her do it! The more interesting places in the book have to do with personal information he has after spending so much time with the Clintons.

And to call Morris a knee jerk Bush supporter is downright hilarious- I have seen him repeatedly state that Bush's handling of the war in Iraq will cause him to lose the election.Morris currently believes that Kerry will actually win. So much for the bogus theory that Morris is a Bush sycophant. Then again those comments are coming from the lunatic lemmings of the left who actually believe bringing down the star ratings on Amazon is a form of political protest.Get a life losers.Anyone who refuses to believe that Hillary is one of the most self promoting, idealess frauds in the history of politics is either an ignorant partisan hack or reaaaaaaaalllly dumb."},{"Title":"Rewriting History","review":"A Balanced Deconstruction of the Hillary Rodham MystiqueDick Morris, the Machiavellian inventor of the process of \\"triangulation\\" and a \\"Clinton insider,\\" has written a sobering but a very balanced analysis of Mrs. Hillary Rodham Clinton. In my view it is the definitive deconstruction of the famous ex-First Lady's hidden public persona and mystique. The perfect antidote to her own \\"self-promoting,\\" but lifeless \\"Living History.\\"Unlike Barbara Olson's \\"Hell to Pay,\\" Morris does not get sided-tracked trying to paint Mrs. Clinton into, and then trying to keep her inside the lines of a \\"self-fulfilling Leftwing Radical Box.\\" He simply tells the truth, as he knows it, without hype, without anti-Hillary angst, and without failing to mention the ex-First Lady's good side.The good news is that Hillary Clinton is a normally intelligent (but not brilliant like her husband, or as the media has portrayed her to be), well-organized person with a genuine interest in children and women's issues. She is an excellent linear thinker and problem solver, but not a creative one. She can be single-minded and driven, despite often not knowing where the end-states are, or from where the results might come.The bad news is that she is intellectually shallow, not a deep thinker, mean-spirited, secretive, paranoid, vindictive, inclined to lie for no apparent good reason other than to elevate her own self-image. She carries herself with an unearned sense of her own importance and entitlement. She is driven by grand utopian theories and loses focus easily when they must be translated into practical outcomes - as was the case with the single issue assigned to her during her husband's tenure, healthcare.Although her \\"resume\\" is superficially impressive, her \\"actual accomplishments\\" are meager in the extreme. And finally, although Hillary is inner-directed, she needs a Guru or a leader and seems unhappy and insecure in her own skin. Said another way, although Hillary is uneasy with others, she also appears to be in bad company when alone. Her formative experiences seem to have twisted her character in such a way, that of the two politicians her career most resembles and parallels, she is more like Richard Nixon than RFK.Morris' conclusion: that electing Hillary (to reuse her husband's Charley Rose metaphor) would be a \\"true roll of the dice.\\" Her professional attributes and her character make up a potent and potentially fatal witches brew of defects - so much so that to take a chance on her for the challenges of the 21st Century would indeed be a risky proposition for this nation.

Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Rewriting History","review":"Dick is one of the best political writers of the day. Tells exactly what is going on and you will feel like you are living it. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Rewriting History","review":"I bought the Dick Morris book Rewriting History a couple of years ago, but have only recently found the time to reading it cover to cover. I must admit that knowing about the mutual hostility between Morris and the former first lady, Hillary Clinton, I wasn't sure I wanted to read one of those \\"he said, she said\\" books that are so popular these days. This book is so much better than that.There are a variety of opinions on why Morris wrote this book. They seem to range from a \\"vicious personal attack\\" to a \\"get-you-back book\\" for his being fired. After noting the title, I think it is clear why Morris wrote Rewriting History. As I stated, the book title pretty much gives it away. He wrote it in response to what Morris views as Hillary's fictional accounts in her bestselling autobiography, Living History. Morris contends his book was written to set the record straight. And few can argue that he definitely had special opportunities to interact with and observe the Clintons in both Arkansas and the White House in a very up-close and personal way.Though it is clear that Morris has little use for Hillary's brand of politics, her propensity to run fast and loose with the truth, as well as her constant insistance that whenever something goes badly...\\"It's not my fault,\\" he still gives her credit for her personal strengths and those occasions when she did help her husband and his administration. Some may view his compliments as gratuitous on Morris' part, but I don't think they come off that way. I think he genuinely thinks Hillary has some admirable qualities. Why she can't just admit it and present herself according to the way she really is seems to be a mystery to Morris. In all fairness though, Morris' criticisms of Hillary definitely outnumber his complements. Nonetheless, the complements are still there and seem to be genuine.Morris has obviously scrutinized Hillary's book page by page, letting no exaggeration, misstatement, and falsity slip by. What he does most effectively is bring to light what the first lady chose to omit from her autobiography. He carefully summarizes what he says actually happened or what was actually said in a particular situation, and then points out that she omitted the facts and, according to his \\"HILLARY brand\\" thesis, why it was omitted. Though the Clinton's have, of course, openly objected to Morris' book Rewriting History, they haven't, to my knowledge, been able to provide substantial evidence discrediting what is in this book.Some of the reviews of this book a really interesting (I'm only jesting here). One individual summarizes Morris' book as completely \\"vindictive\\" and \\"mean spirited.\\" Then later in the review complains, \\"Disappointingly short, this book is printed in large font with double spacing. A good short in-flight read that should be taken as seriously as a tabloid rag.\\" Why would you want to spend your time reading a \\"really long\\" tabloid rag? At just over 300 pages, including Notes and Index, the book is more than long enough for Morris to present his case.This is not intended to be a weakness of the content of the book by any means, but I'd really like to know why it has such a completely useless and unusually configured set of Endnotes. I've never seen anything like it before. The traditional method of adding footnotes at the bottom of each pertinent page, or the standard college-level method of end notes would have been much more useful and greatly appreciated.Like this book or hate it, Morris has, without a doubt, packed it with a filing cabinet full of people, places, statements and events, all drawn from a variety of documented sources. Was the book necessary? Considering what Bill Clinton did to the American presidency, and how close Hillary Clinton came to the Democratic nomination last year, I think it is definitely both a timely and worthwhile analysis of a possible future presidential candidate. I, for one, wish the two actual presidential candidates had been scrutinized this closely. Knowing the real integrity of a candidate is more important before you enter the voting booth, than afterward.I would strongly recommend that anyone who is interested in reading Hillary's book, Living History, and wants to get the whole story, should include Morris' book, Rewriting History at the same time, or at least read one right after the other. Morris does an excellent job filling in \\"the rest of the story.\\""},{"Title":"Rewriting History","review":"Dick Morris was inside the campaign machine known as the Clintons. He saw first hand what kind of conniving, backstabbing political con artist that Hillary Clinton really is and he documents it in this book.It's scares the hell out of me to think that someday Hillary Clinton (or Hillary Rodham Clinton or Hillary Rodham or whatever she's calling herself today) could be the president of the United States. With her far left liberal views and her lust for power for power's sake, I believe her presidency would make Billy Bob's look like Abe Lincoln's. Can we look forward to more of her Nixon-esqe dirty tricks (like hiring private eyes to dig up dirt and threaten your political and social [read other women Bill had sex with] enemies) and the continual disappearance of documents plus accusations of the great &quot;right-wing conspiracy&quot; every time she stubs her toe in office? Do we really want to have to ask what &quot;is&quot; means again? Can't wait for each time an attack on her is really &quot;an attack on all women&quot;.Read this book. Don't let Hillary overcome you with her spin on Travelgate, the commodity trading, the private eyes, health care reform, the many lies she has told, etc. Read this book and open your eyes for once."},{"Title":"Rewriting History","review":"Dick Morris has painted a chilling description of the junior senator from New York. Having worked with the Clinton's for over 20 years Mr. Morris was in an unusual position to view the Clinton's from the Arkansas governorship to the White House. He details how Hillary was always there to cover up the self destructive scandals that Bill would continue to bring on himself. Mr. Morris disputes the image of a concerned and loving First Lady that she pitches in Living History. Rather Mr. Morris paints Hillary as a cold and calculating mastermind of the Clinton White House. He exposes Hillary's only two loves in the world - power and money. He disputes Hillary's claim of being shocked when she found out about Monica Lewinski. How could she be shocked? Bill had repeatedly cheated on her year after year. I never liked Hillary before reading this book but now I am as afraid of her as I am Satan himself. And to think that her ultimate goal is to be the President scares the living heck out of me."},{"Title":"Rewriting History","review":"I doubt the reviewers who complain about Dick Morris' affiliation with Fox News are bothered by Al Franken's stint with very liberal Air America. Get over your Fox News obsession, liberals. You are mad because a network actually presents a conservative side ALONG with a liberal one. Ask Alan Colmes.Morris' book has a great cover and great insight. I have observed many of the things he talks about -- especially the makeover of Hillary into a chatty, giggly everywoman. He personally advised and worked with the Clintons for years. He is supremely positioned to give an account of his years and this is an interesting read."},{"Title":"Rewriting History","review":"As a long time political manager for the Clintons, Dick Morris has come to know Hillary Clinton very well. According to Morris, \\"All public figures use makeup to cover a blemish or two. But only Hillary wears a mask of so many layers, one that hides her true face altogether.\\"According to Morris, Hillary Clinton is an even more accomplished liar than her husband is. One such lie is the claim she made on the Today Show that daughter Chelsea was in harms way at the World Trade Center. Hillary is an extremely materialisic woman who is extremely greedy. As such, there is a strong likelihood that Hillary will one day become embroiled in a politically suicidal financial scandal.According to Morris, Hillary has a strong propensity to use private eyes and skullduggery for political purposes. If Hillary were to become elected in 2008, it would be like Richard Nixon all over again.Essentially, Morris's argument is that Hillary Clinton is a fraud who lusts for supreme political power and who, if she should ever attain it, will be the biggest threat to democracy in America since the days of the Nixon presidency."},{"Title":"Rewriting History","review":"This is an excellent book about the couple who resemble Macbeth and Lady Macbeth, although in this case Hillary is more like Macbeth.

The Clinton's are very much like the casinos. They always have that edge!"},{"Title":"Rewriting History","review":"Insightful read from Mr. Morris. Who better to uncover the real Hillary than the man who would know the behind the scenes woman. Dick Morris has always been equally critical of Republicans and Democrats. In this book he details Hillary's true persona and gives us all the real deal. Like her, love her or hate her with this book at least you have the truth."},{"Title":"Rewriting History","review":"Dick Morris as a pollster and strategist is unequaled. I think many try to minimize his analysis and insight but his track record is unparalleled. He is always dead on and he usually tells it frankly and uncompromisingly. He knows both Hillary and Bill Clinton better than most. Of the crowd who has been up close and personal with the Clintons, Morris is probably the only one who will tell the unflinching truth. People like Begala never will.With that in mind, I highly recommend this book. Morris takes Hillary's flattering version of herself to task in this work. He refutes the public image she has carefully honed and penetrates to the real Hillary, particularly the political chameleon that she has been over the past 25 years. He provides specific examples, which have weight because they will stand fact checking and scrutiny. He writes in a conversational, easily readable style.For example, he shows how Hillary took pains to morph into a Martha Stewart housewife and mother, when some of her feminist comments alienated a large portion of women in this country. Morris discusses her role in the firing of civil servants at the White House Travel Office and a host of other lesser and greater scandals engulfing the Clinton presidency. By taking apart Hillary's version of herself, the public persona she wants you to accept and which is endorsed by and promulgated by willing synchophants, Morris accurately predicts what Hillary will be as a U. S. Senator and possible President.Besides being an unflinching look at Hillary's past political life, the book is prescient in its anticipation of Hillary's future political steps. Recently for example, Hillary has staked out a more conservative position on immigration reform than most conservatives. How's that for beginning another transformation? After reading Morris' book you will know that is fully in keeping with her character. Become what the polls and the public expect. The facade is not real."},{"Title":"Rewriting History","review":"It is such a refreshing breath of fresh air to read the truth we have all known but to date no one has been able to do a \\"TELL ALL\\" about the two people who resided in the White House........much to the shame of this nation.

Wish more of the spineless Clinton staffers would step forward and complete the job. Unbelievable to me that people of the Clinton(s) caliber could ever be put into the White House once and then the shame of letting them spend another term there is a blightand disgrace on the nation.

Isn't it funny how when Morris was trying to construct Clinton's image on family values Morris (a married man by the way) was having an affair. Rowlands told the press about how Morris had let her listen in on conversations between himself and the president. Most embarassingly she told of Morris's rather kinky preferences. Clearly had Morris not resigned Clinton would have fired him. And now Morris, the family man, is attacking Hillary for trying to \\"construct a false image of herself\\".

An attempt to mainstream a minority point of view, and discredit the broader range of debate. It is as un-American as the McCarthy tactics of the 50's, that Ann Coulter has recently championed. It is as un-American as the abuse of Iraqi prisoners, that Rush Limbaugh has recently championed.I can't tell you folks not to quit your day job. I can only ask that you get one. One that respects democracy as fertile ground for a diversity of opinion. One that rejects the furthering of a narrow point of view, by whatever means necessary."},{"Title":"Rewriting History","review":"I received the free Chapter 1 by email, and read up to the line: \\"When Al Gore claimed to be the father of the Internet...\\" What?

I felt as if I had wasted precious hours that could have been spent otherwise grouting tile. Morris seems to rewrite history himself, and does so in a most uninteresting and dull fashion. Essentially, Rewriting History is nothing more than Morris recounting things we already knew, and adding his bitter spin on it. It doesn't come off as insightful, interesting, or indepth. It comes off as sour grapes. Just completely dumb.And, on another note, I gotta admit that I found the use of large type to be vaguely reminiscent of the tactics I used in high school when typing term papers or essays that were not fully developed or fleshed out. Large print?!?!? I'm sure the margins are smaller, too. Aside from the lack of interesting subject matter, it's as if we are additionally duped into think there is subsance, becaue the print, I'm sure, added several pages to give the appearance of substance in more pages.Senselessly, too many trees had to die to publish this book.

Clinton will continue as an effective politician and Morris, as fly on the wall will fade with time. This book is a popcorn partisan read - Those at Fox would welcome such a book!!"},{"Title":"Rewriting History","review":"Dick Morris currently makes a good portion of his living hawking erroneous predictions about Hillary Clinton. But don't take my word for it; look at the record!In late 2003 and early 2004, Dick Morris was quoted in (and wrote) a number of newspaper columns predicting Hillary Clinton would run for President on the Democratic ticket in the 2004 General election. Look for titles such as \\"Hillary's Hat in the Race?\\" (Aug 2003), \\"As Dubya Sinks, Al & Hill Scheme\\" (Sept 2003) \\"Hillary Operative Eyeing Soft Money for Prez Race\\" (Oct 2003), Although the 2004 election is still in the future, I think it's pretty safe bet that all those predictions are wrong.When it became clear that Hillary wasn't running, Morris started predicting Hillary was angling for Vice President \\"Hillary's veepstakes\\" parts 1 and 2 (Feb 2004), and \\"Will the Hildabeast Run?\\" (March 2004). Again, we don't yet know Kerry's choice for VP, but it's likely to be either Senator Edwards or a governor from a swing state. Since Kerry wrapped up the nomination, there's been relative silence on the \\"Hillary 2004\\" front.Now, into that void, Dick Morris drops his latest tome, predicting Hillary will run for President in 2008. I have to admit, this book is a better idea than some of his earlier columns, because it will take about four years for events to prove him wrong. Will Hillary run in 2008? I haven't any idea. More to the point; Dick Morris has no idea either. What's more, he has a pretty lousy track record on his Hillary predictions. But he'll still make them, because there are plenty of suckers out there to buy them.OK, enough commentary -- time for more fine erroneous Dick Morris predictions. Check out \\"She'll Never Leave the Starting Gate\\" (July 1999) in which he assures his readers the Hillary will never be elected to the Senate in New York. Oops! Morris sure blew that one! For more laughs, check out the Jan 2004 quote \\"John Kerry's misguided campaign will probably come to an end in New Hampshire.\\" Oops! Looks like Morris doesn't restrict his errors to Hillary. For what it's worth, Morris also picked Dean as the likely Democratic nominee. Sorry; my fingers are getting tired of typing in Morris's errors.But hey, the truth is there's a religion out there called \\"I hate Hillary Clinton.\\" And Dick Morris is its Pope. And when your Pope publishes a book, you'll go out and buy it, regardless of how wrong he's been in the past. Well, you know what they say about a fool and his money..."},{"Title":"Rewriting History","review":"When I read Morris's book, I felt like I was reading a 6th grader essay: A lot of claims with no real evidence to back it up. I would like to actually read something where Morris can make an argument and actually have references to validate what he's saying. That's my major complaint which left me unsatisfied with the content in the book."},{"Title":"Rewriting History","review":"A May 4 Media Matters for America analysis identified several examples of misinformation in Dick Morris's new book, Rewriting History. On May 4, FOX News Channel political analyst Dick Morris appeared on FOX's Hannity & Colmes; on May 5, he was on that network's FOX & Friends. On both shows, Morris continued to deceive his audience: He made false claims about Senator Hillary Clinton's book, about his own book, about what President Bill Clinton told him about Monica Lewinsky, and about what Chelsea Clinton said about September 11.Please visit http://mediamatters.org/items/200405060002 to review the following claims Morris made on FOX News Channel on May 4 and May 5, followed by the facts."},{"Title":"Rewriting History","review":"This is a poorly told story, and it certainly does not reveal anything that has not been fully covered all over the internet and in the press."},{"Title":"Rewriting History","review":"I read half the book so I cannot give a full review, but thus far, it is mostly garbage.

Morris posits many judgements about Mrs. Clinton that appear to have been inspired by personal pique rather than political/personal truth. Another example for this society that truth has been the biggest victim of this generation of writers."},{"Title":"Rewriting History","review":"this book is full of nothing but lies. You can't trust Dick Morris any more than you can trust the likes of Sean Hannity or Rush Limbaugh. No facts in this book, just bogus material."},{"Title":"Rewriting History","review":"Contributing to the hate Clinton oeuvre must be considerably simpler now than it was just a few years ag. There have been so many publications (one hesitates to call them books) dedicated to the proposition that Bill and Hillary Clinton are devil's spawn or worse that it is now a simple matter to create another. Just comb through the others, rearrange the charges, insinuations, and generalizations, add a few more if you are so inclined and voila, Regnery or Newsmax or some similar publishing company will be lining up to print it.All this is by way of saying that Rewriting History is yet another hatchet job on Senator Hillary Clinton. She can't do right, every thing she does do has a political motive, she is treacherous, etc, etc. Most of Rewriting History is devoted to categorizing the numerous times Senator Clinton has not told the truth. Now it seems to me that being a politician more or less precludes honesty, I'm sorry to say, but having said that I also need to point out that nothing Hillary Clinton has said that is supposedly untrue is all that important anyway. Who cares if she played soccer in high school or not? Yes, it would be wonderful if she always told the truth, but I don't see anything too unusual in these supposed misstatements. In fact, I would be willing to bet that any other politician (even the sainted W himself) would be found to have a pretty long record of untruthful statements if he were subjected to the same sort of sanctimonious, self-righteous scrutiny the Senator and her husband have been under for the last quarter century or so.This brings up another charge made against the Senator, that she is paranoid and highly suspicious of The Vast Right Wing Conspiracy. Well, pardon me, but isn't there a pretty large amount of evidence to substantiate a certain feeling of &quot;they're out to get us&quot; on the part of the Clinton family? And if paranoia disqualifies one from public office, then a large portion of the Extreme Right Wing in this country is therefore unelectable (would that it were so!)Another aspect of this work worthy of mention is the cleverness with which Morris makes dark insinuations against the Senator. For example, he mentions that she worked in the law offices of Robert Treuhaft for a time in the 1970s, and Treuhaft and his wife Jessica Mitford were (gasp) COMMUNISTS back in the 1950s. This is no big secret, Mitford having written a couple of books about her political activities, but mentioning it in this book is a tactic worthy of old Tailgunner Joe McCarthy himself. This Mitford connection, by the way, could also be used to claim that Senator Clinton wants to be in with the British aristocracy or with Fascists (Mitford was daughter of a Lord and sister-in-law of a Duke and of the former leader of the British Fascists.) Mr. Morris overlooked these insinuations, but perhaps he can work them in to a second edition, if there is one.Personally, I have no strong feelings about Senator Clinton's fitness to be President. If she ever runs for that office, I intend to spend a lot of time examining her record and evaluating her campaign. But one thing that inclines me to be sympathetic to her is the volume and odiousness of the campaign against her as exemplified by works like Rewriting History. There is an old saying that you are known by your enemies. Senator Clinton is undoubtedly proud to have enemies like Mr. Morris and his ilk."},{"Title":"Rewriting History","review":"Wow, here's an eye-opener from the ultimate professional hack, Dick Morris, a man who will skewer the opponents of anyone who is paying his salary.Wow, I was blown away by revelations that Hillary Clinton, lawyer-turned-politician, is ACTUALLY at times two-faced, manipulative, self-serving, and basically behaves LIKE A POLITICIAN.Wow, I needed this fat blowhard to tell me what anyone with a working brain can figure out. Actually, if you took Dick's framework here, you can apply it to a good chunk of politicians, in general.So hmmm, you say Hillary is no longer like that Arkansas first lady of years ago?Whoa.Morris is a favorite guest of Hannity & Colmes, where his smarmy, Jon Lovitz-esque look fronts a hired one-man PR, political 'advisor' machine. I can only hope to achieve greatness in my own life by becoming a 'political advisor', which is a nice term for a professional hack. His Clinton obsession must be paying off nicely. So nicely that Bubba himself donated all of two lines to Dick in his 9,000 page book.A waste of your time, and if you have any brains left, that, too."},{"Title":"Rewriting History","review":"Dick Morris is tough to figure out; I honestly don't know where he is coming from, or what motivates him. He is definitely not a conservative Republican. But I doubt he is welcome in any Democratic circles these days, either. What Morris is, as far as I can tell, is a very astute, insightful observer of human behavior. He also has a great sense of humor. Having his own foibles exposed in a very public manner, Morris has little to lose...he seems ready to expose others who have dark secrets. He is tenacious and a survivor, which makes him seem more human than he did before his fall from grace. Perhaps Morris is a gossip. But he is an oddly credible one, and he is definitely entertaining. Both Hillary and Bill could have used his sense of drama and storytelling in their own weighty BORING autobiographies. Even when I disagree with Morris, which is often, I find him compelling and interesting. This book does provide some uniquely personal--and, I believe--important insights into the character and behavior of Hillary Clinton. Though she is at least four years away from running for the Presidency, she is already hard at work laying the foundation for her candidacy. Thus, every action she takes right now is in preparation for that day...which makes Morris' book timely and important indeed."},{"Title":"Rewriting History","review":"It is funny how this book hits store shelves on May 4 and by May 5, there are about 20 reviews. I really wish that Amazon would not allow this type of thing. Many of the reviews are like this line: &quot;Haven't we heard enough of this idiot??&quot; Sorry, but that is not a book review and political books are never reviewed fairly. The fact is, if you want to hear from someone who has known Hillary for 25+ years, as a friend and advisor, then read this book. The only other books written about (and for) Hillary were written by people who do not know her personally. Those that know her personally would not dare write a book about her. This is the same guy who helped Bill get elected and re-elected governor and president. Sure, he's out to make a buck, but every author is and maybe, just maybe this could be true. Hmmm? If you believe Hillary is nothing more than the image she projects, then you are a fool and are being used by her, just like most other politicians use the public with PR people and images. There is always more to it than that, and a book like this shows the real ambitious human behind the mask. If nothing else, it is interesting reading."},{"Title":"Rewriting History","review":"So much vitriol from the idealogues! Regardless of your political persuasion, this book is fascinating. The things Morris has seen and participated in while acting as Clinton's prime pollster and political strategist going all the way back to his Arkansas years lends tremendous insight into the political lightening rod that is Hillary. Depsite the personal attacks from those who know only how to hate someone they disagree with, it is difficult to discredit Morris' first hand accounts of his interactions with Bill and Hillary. This is not a book citing vague references or unnamed sources, but observations from an insider who did everything he could to help the Clintons ascend to power for more than a decade. Morris is not a right-wing idealogue. In fact, he's not even right-wing as he admits to voting for Gore in 2000.This book is a much needed, rational, and factual assessment of a woman clearly on the political rise. Morris' inside view into how Hillary operates is a fascinating story and very important debating stuff as voters will likely have to reevaluate this ultra-ambitiuos woman as she strives for more power."},{"Title":"Rewriting History","review":"I always thought Hillary would be the first female president. That was until I read this book. Mr. Morris does a great job providing the public with another view of Hillary Clinton that differs from the image she paints of herself in her own book. True...there is always two sides to every story, but at least now we get to see that other side. Morris provides an insight into the former first lady that we haven;t seen before in any other books about her... insight from someone that worked very close to her on a daily basis . This is worth checking out, and as usual... make your own mind up!"},{"Title":"Rewriting History","review":"Unlike Christopher Anderson's didactic and misbegotten \\"American Evita\\", political insider-turned-outsider Dick Morris takes a more full-blooded tact in dissecting Hillary Clinton that by the end of the book, represents a more balanced view of her public and at least semi-private selves. I'm sure this incisive portrayal is causing rancor among extremists on both sides, most particularly among those who see her as the only hope for the Democratic Party should Kerry face defeat, Edwards notwithstanding. But by peeling her layer by layer like an onion, Morris effectively approaches his subject as a more complete person than she does herself in \\"Living History\\", which in hindsight, seemed too simplistic a portrait of a woman caught in the course of history and unforeseen personal struggles. Given the comically spliced cover photo on Morris' book, I was fully expecting a complete trashing of her autobiography. Instead, it felt more like an unabridged version of her own book, the warts-and-all version that would have never saw the light of day had her political advisors gotten a hold of a draft.In what Morris views as her intensely focused quest to become President, Hillary Clinton is shaping her own destiny in spite of the highly unusual circumstances that have led to her current success. As we know, she achieved her greatest fame as a professionally emancipated, then personally scorned First Lady. Despite living in the constant shadow of her far more charismatic husband, she was elected U.S. senator for a state with which she had little previous familiarity or interest, having seized a prime opportunity when Rudolph Guiliani's health forced him to drop out. But through her own talent in creating an image of a powerful leader and decision-maker, she has flourished as the next Democratic presidential contender, even though she remains a cipher to us when it comes to her vision and values. She is obviously devoted to the party line and continues to back her husband, but we don't really know her. Judging from this book, we never will. And therein lies the rub that Morris is trying to exacerbate in this book. He exposes an insecure woman who exaggerates and fabricates stories on the national campaign trail, but at the same time, he praises her professional acumen, leadership and organized management skills. The combination of her talents became the ideal complement to her husband during their White House years, and one at least understands why they are so well partnered politically if not personally. Having known the Clintons for over 25 years, Morris has credibility, and he exhibits this throughout by being as upfront about her positive qualities as well as her negative traits.Although by no means a flattering portrait, it is also not a completely unfair one, as Morris makes greater sense of her complexity and ambition and goes further than anyone else, including Hillary Clinton herself, in explaining why she induces such extreme reactions. With sometimes piercing insight, a good sense of humor and a little dime-store psychoanalysis thrown in, Morris actually makes his subject a more fully rounded person and perhaps unintentionally, not necessarily an unfavorable one compared to many of her colleagues. Given the limited truths and skewed perspectives that surround our current presidential candidates in other best sellers, that's probably a good thing for the rest of us to know as we consider our options in the 2008 election."},{"Title":"Rewriting History","review":"There is some good news and some bad news with this book. The bad news is it seems like a decent magazine article which has been padded out to fill a book (some of the same concepts and sentences are repeated). The good news is it appears to be about as fair an assessment of the complex person that is Hillary Clinton as we're likely to see. The Hillary lovers might not like it because it does discuss her not so nice side (a ruthless paranoid who can not see that others might not share her points of view). The Hillary haters might not like it because it does discuss her good points (she is a good manager and is trying to help people). I would recommend this book because as Hillary primes herself for a run at the Oval Office every potential voter should know as much as possible about the woman who would be president."},{"Title":"Rewriting History","review":"I wonder if all the top leaders of the Democratic Party and the Senate are all giving out orders to give 1 star reviews to every single right-wing book. Look at the average number of stars on Left-wing books and then look at right-wing books. Maybe the amount of liberals outnumbers conservatives on this site but it seems to me they're a mission to give 1 star reviews to EVERY conservative book out there. Being the supposed party of \\"tolerance\\" look at the names liberals give Republicans and Conservative. Well, I guess if you're in the majority then tolerance no longer applies to you. I commend Dick Morris for revealing Hilary's reign of terror whether it's piggy-backing her \\"hubby\\" Bill or using New York to get further. If anyone wants the truth (or for what most of us know as the truth) read \\"Re-Writing History.\\" By the way love the cover!"},{"Title":"Rewriting History","review":"First let me say I don't like Hillary and I have never trusted Dick Morris. But I found this book very believable. The book gives insight into the innerworkings of the Clinton Machine. Morris makes a fair case of what could happen as time unfolds to make Hillary president. The thing that suprised me was Morris' insight into other presidency's, Hillary's personality and comparison to other high profile politicians that were extremely paranoid. I hope this helps."},{"Title":"Rewriting History","review":"Rewriting History is a surprisingly riveting read. It is far better than Morris' previous book, Off With Their Heads, which was good but dry. RH contains information, anecdotes and theories that are insightful, thought-provoking and all around juicy. The theme of the book is whether or not Hillary will end up being an RFK or Nixon-type presidential candidate. Such an original and interesting debate. Morris skillfully argues his theory based not on his own opinion but on facts and eye-witness events. If you don't care for Hillary, or even worry about what kind of president she would be (God forbid), this book is for you. It will enlighten and entertain!"},{"Title":"Rewriting History","review":"Do not allow the haphazard one-star &quot;reviews&quot; of this book to sway your interest in this book. There is a distinct and irrefutable reason why this book is currently the 2nd best selling book on Amazon: it provides direct enlightenment on an issue that is unclear to many. I would suggest that most Americans know very little about Mrs. Clinton, and this book provides credible insight about the most politically-motivated woman of our time. I would undoubtedly recommend this book to anyone interested in the developing national politics."},{"Title":"Rewriting History","review":"Dick Morris worked with the Clintons for over 20 years. Yes he was a political consultant and worked for both sides of the fence, so to speak, but he did actually like the Clintons. I feel it even comes out in this book as he tries to give Hillary Clinton some advice about the HILLARY brand name that she has created.I think he is dead-on in his analysis based on the events during the after the Clinton White House years. From his position he obviously has some insights that WE, the general public, do not have.Sure politicians are still politicians and always trying skew what they say but Hillary (and Bill) have taken that \\"art\\" to a whole new level and it is clear in this book why some of their problems became so big and public and how they could have handled them better. I think it is also clear that as a populace, we do NOT want HILLARY for President.Read the book all the way through and with and open mind!!"},{"Title":"Rewriting History","review":"Surely Dick Morris describes the devious morally depleted, psychological and political mind set of the Clintons better that then anyone, especially Hillary. Clearly, Morris knows the Clintons, perhaps better then anyone except those in Clintons inner circle of Mandy Grunwald, Harold Ickes and the almost invisible, Bruce Lindsey, the forth lawyer from the Rose Law Firm. I would guess these people are privileged to the IOUs, payoffs and hit lists any may even know were a few of the bodies are buried, figuratively speaking.It seemed that Morris was holding back on some of the shenanigans the Clintons had pulled. Would not be at all surprised if Morris knows more about wrong doings then what he put in his book? Perhaps some events were glossed over out of some kind strange self honor, fear or to avoid self incrimination. Whatever, it was still a great book."},{"Title":"Rewriting History","review":"I'm a conservative; no doubt what the New York Times would call the extreme, right-wing fringe.However, I found Dick Morris' book a tome that didn't want to \\"dis\\" Hillary as much as a man seeking to find reasons to praise her.He comes across as a true left-wing moderate, one wanting for Hillary to be bold in her espousal of left wing causes and honest in her past history.This, he reveals, she has sadly failed to do. In her laser-like focus on gaining political power, she shifts with every political poll.He reveals how she has thrown away every core principle except her pursuit of her own definition of women and children's rights.It portrays her not so much as political savant as a desperate woman seeking to validate her own life and her many ambitions.It's a difficult read for the true right wing, such as myself, however it's an entertaining discussion and Dick Morris carries the story well.It's also a telling insight in the woman who would be president."},{"Title":"Rewriting History","review":"Good book!

I was surprised and impressed with the depth of information he provided, as well as with the objectivity, and even compassion, with which Dick Morris laid out his story. It is not a Hillary bashing book, but a probing look into the woman herself, her own words and actions bringing to life the book's premise. Dick Morris gives examples of lies Hillary herself writes in her own autobiography and refutes them. Mr. Morris provides a balanced view of Hillary, pointing out her strengths and gifts, as well as her weaknesses. His analyses are based on sound thinking and experience and enhanced by revelations of his own deep humanity. This book is not a book necessarily of wide range or scope but succeeds in what it attempts to do. It is well written, and not encumbered byrhetoric or extraneous facts, but concisely and interestingly makes its point."},{"Title":"Rewriting History","review":"What a great read. Dick Morris does a terrific job in breaking through the brand that is \\"Hillary\\" with a factual portrayal of Sen. Clinton. Like so many pols before her, Ms. Clinton has put out a work of fiction in an attempt to advantageously position herself for future campaigns. Fortunately, for those of us interested in the true story, Dick Morris has really delivered it here.(...)If you're truly interested in getting the real story and not just spin, you won't be disappointed with Rewriting History."},{"Title":"Rewriting History","review":"She's got more brass than the Pentagon. I actually read her book \\"Living History\\" and laughed all the way through. Okay, Hillary - if you say so *lmao*Now we get the truth. And it's even plausible! Everything Dick Morris writes about our Hil either sounds like her or we got to actually watch her do these things through the magic of the media. Be honest - you guffawed right along with me when Hillary would describe some sweet domestic scene, with her playing the dutiful housewife. We knew better when she was trying to dish it out and now Dick Morris gives us the details.And who would know better than Bill Clinton's chief strategist? Contrary to what some other reviewers have said, Morris has no ax to grind. Intellectually, we know that. He made a lot of money getting Bill elected Governor, then President. Why cut off the gravy train when Hil's getting ready to make her big move? There's more to be gained by him selling his services to her to get her elected than he probably made off this book.Others have said that there was some falling out between Morris and the Clintons, and that's why he's coming out with these slam books. And they're right - Morris got in the doghouse because he refused to lie under oath in his Grand Jury testimony.RULE #1: Don't alienate the guy who knows where all your bodies are buried."},{"Title":"Rewriting History","review":"Buy the book.

As I read more and more of this book I got more and more excited about reaching the conclusion. I was not disappointed.This book does a remarkable job of fairly cutting through the fake persona being created for Hillary Clinton the politician, verses telling the story of the true Hillary Clinton. It is easier to respect the tough political activist for women and children's rights than it is to respect the \\"Betty Crocker\\" Clinton of \\"Living History\\" or \\"It takes a Village\\". I found the book riveting and highly informative. I believe anyone reading this book will come with a better understanding of the current national political situation. This book allowed me to understand the importance of things I already knew. The breath of the information is amazing. The extreme right readers may come away with a greater fear of the changing demographics of this nation. The extreme left might realize the damage of ridiculous rhetorical attacks.

The Clintons are the scariest, greediest and most arrogant politicians of our time. Exposed are her shady land deals, her lies, her numerous coverups and her private neuroses."},{"Title":"Rewriting History","review":"Dick Morris has written a great expose on Hillary Clinton. It is about time that WE THE PEOPLE see Hillary for who and what she really is."},{"Title":"Rewriting History","review":"Face it, fellow Americans: if Hillary Clinton did not exist, it would be necessary for us to invent her.With 'Rewriting History', former Clinton campaign heavy Dick Morris plows into what he saw while doing hard time at the Clinton Oval Office, and what he concludes about uber-pol Hillary Rodham Clinton isn't pretty, folks: She's into Power. Raw Power. Raw, unbridled, absolute Power.From the time the Hellmouth spat her up as an infant on the rocky slabs of Golgotha (complete with molten magma caul)---or, if you prefer, from the time Mighty Poseidon raised her up from the waves, a virgo intacto in a half-shell!---Hilary has plotted, cajoled, lied, triangulated, and maneuvered with a restless, hungering glee that would have made a Borgia pope blush.Well, Duh! Look: it has become almost stupefyingly boring to observe that politicians don't really care about their constituents. They want the perks of office: the long 5 martini lunches with bigwigs, Hottentots, and sultans, howler monkeys; the chauffeured limos; the many invitations to get all liquored up in the Green Room and go mano a mano with Hannity, Mathews, or O'Reilly. Wouldn't you? Sure you would.With that in mind, let's worry less about ethics, character, and competence, and focus on the one trait in our 'Leaders' we should value most: sheer Entertainment Value!In that regard, then, Ladies & Gentlemen, my fellow Americans, through the pages of Dick Morris's peerless little sordid potboiler---you know her! You love her! You can't live without her! The next President of the United States----HILLARY CLINTON!Don't groan. I'm throwing my vote for Hillary come 2008 because---well, for deeply personal reasons. Chiefly because I have a fiendish plan. Mainly because we need an interregnum of such beastly political malfeasance, something so utterly hellacious, as to---well, but I'm tipping my hand. It's not that important.Anyway, Hillary will be more entertaining than anyone else. As Morris observes in what amounts to a collection of bile-dripping epistles devoted to all things Clintoniana, Hillary is a Nixon character: furtive, incapable of bonding with human beings outside her phalanx of titanium-faced harpies (scarier than she is, actually, which is probably the point), willing to sell her grandma into white slavery just to see the look on her face, more than capable of having subordinates or even intimates whacked (I'm lookin' at you, Vince Foster), and very, very paranoid.The Clintons have sheer moxie, magic & unbridled audacity on their side. Why shouldn't they have Power as a kind of garnish?Check it out, dawgs: Bizzle and Hizzle pretty much carried out rapine in the Ovum Office, turned the Lincoln Bedroom into a free-standing bordello, looted the White House of everything that wasn't nailed down, and stole the flotation devices & oxygen masks off Air Force 1---and all of this is just their final 2 hours in office alone---and yet still, despite it all, bazillions of registered American voters adore them! If that's a mandate for Divine Right monarchy, what is?It's true that Morris, a man so feverishly ratty even his literary style sounds like Templeton Rat, has an axe to grind. Morris has a---well, *complicated* relationship with the Clintons. It's like a sort of perverted umbilical cord, and this one works two ways, only instead of feeding precious nutrients it spews out black bile and political poison. That's why \\"Rewriting History\\" is so much devilish fun.Anyway, the point here is that Morris's little exegesis on the Arkansas Power Duet never fails to amuse: pound for pound, it's a truly wicked piece of political skull-duggery. The Portrayal of Lady Clinton is truly warts and all, though mostly warts. Big, nasty, blackish warts, with little scraggly hairs growing out, truth be told.This might lead you to conclude, as Morris does, that 1) Hillary will do literally anything and everything to get elected Grand Poobah of the Republic; 2) given her brand name, she's likely to take the Prize---beware Obama, there can be only One!---and will, yet again, have those keys to the exhausted Lincoln Bedroom, where in the last Clinton Regime they were lining up overnight donors like 747s at O'Hare; 3) this will be a Great Tragedy for the Republic.Not so! The Clintons, if not national treasures, are certainly national fixtures, like big, comfy, ratty barco-loungers. We want the Clintons because, unlike JFK, they're America as we see ourselves, not as we ought to be. For better or worse, they're our Ozzie & Harriet, our Augustine & Livia, Lucrezia & Cesare, Kermit & Miss Piggy, Big Bird and Snuffleupagus, Lord & Lady MacBeth.And it can be said, as Morris someimes does, that Hillary is the supoerior in the political firepower arena: where Bill could tailor his views to every push poll or audience, the Hill can acually adjust her deeply held views (she's hawkish! she's dovish! she's right, left, cleaning up, flying right! she's the King of the Sea!)---better still, she she can also completely alter her dialect and voice! A human Transformer! Marvellous!Plus, we'd have Bill back. Bill is the gift that keeps on giving: he could jam it up on the sax with Guy Ritchie and Madonna in the Lincoln Bedroom. You know you want it.Anyway, Morris's book is, as usual, trenchant, nasty, caustic, bold, and deeply amusing. Election 2008, might yield us a national disaster (though it would be hard to imagine trumping the current White House denizen in that regard) but she'll be fun political theater.As for Dick, though: if Hillary wins, he might find himself rewriting---well, if not history, at least his travel itinerary. Somewhere without extradition laws? Hell hath no fury, and all.JSG"},{"Title":"Rewriting History","review":"This has to be one of the worst books I have ever read.

McCullough was much more kinder to Truman than this book. With exacting detail the author really dives into the \\"tumultous\\" second term of Truman's presidency. Like many presidents before and after there does seem to be tough times in President's second terms. Since Truman made so many tough and correct decisions in his first term it was almost certain the second term wouldn't go so well. This book is a no nonsense look at the fine details of those years. I wish I could say it was riveting and extremely interesting but it wasn't. I'm not sure if there are other books that go into this deep of detail but for anyone interested in getting a dense understanding of Truman's second term, this is a solid book."},{"Title":"Lies My Teacher Told Me About Christopher Columbus: What Your History Books Got Wrong","review":"Everything by the author is well researched, thought provoking, and tells us things we don't want to hear but need to."},{"Title":"Lies My Teacher Told Me About Christopher Columbus: What Your History Books Got Wrong","review":"Ditto headline.

The words really take you to the place--England, the court, the countryside, through the plague. There isn't a likable character in this book. Every last one of them will make your skin crawl.

I found the book to be interesting from a historic point and loved the \\"twists and turns\\" - I never could predict WHAT Amber was going to do next. I found her to be a selfish and unlikeable creature yet very fascinating (very much like Scarlet O'Hara from Gone With The Wind).

It begins with a prologue about how Amber was born and then fastforwards to the future, where Amber is a beautiful teenager in a small country village... and there she meets the man who she will be in love with the rest of her life. She follows him to London and then has numerous experiences with him, without him, with other people...This book was definitely researched well - I learned a lot about the history of England and London by reading it, and the writing style is just beautiful! Amber is such a little vixen in the book. At times, you love her and sympathize with her (such as being with a spiteful man and having no power as a woman), and other times you hate her and are wishing for her to get what she deserves (like when she uses other people for her own benefit). You love her and hate her at the same time; the author is a genius at how she brings the characters to life. No one is only good or bad but all sides of people are shown.To give it more historical credibility, parts of the book take place in the palace, without Amber around. It's almost like a comparison between royalty and non-royalty - and neither side is truly more moral than the other. You also get a taste of the time in which they're living.The book spans years and at the end, you know what's going to happen but still are left wishing for a sequel. I would have loved to see how it all actually played out at the end, but even the ending doesn't detract from the overall genius of the book.Don't be put off by the length of this - it will hook you and you won't be able to put it down. I finished all 972 pages within a few days. And while the book is definitely quite sensual (Amber takes on a number of lovers and ends up pregnant out of wedlock a number of times, many of which end in abortions), nothing is too overt. The love scenes are mainly left to your own imagination and you are truly drawn into the characters and not just the actions.I highly recommend this to anyone looking for a beautifully written love story spanning a number of years. This book will not disappoint in keeping your interest. I've already loaned out my copy to a friend but will be rereading it when I get it back.

Although Amber does make several bad choices and uses everyone around her as a way to get what she wants, she still loved all her children and decided, finally, to go back to the country where she truly belonged. I did not much care about Charles and his family - I just wanted to hear about Amber!

I read this book about 35 years ago and never forgot the mental banquet I feasted on while immersed in its historical pages and life of Amber.Kathleen Winsor was smart as a fox NOT TO WRITE A SEQUEL to &quot;Forever Amber&quot;. We would all have loved (I think) to see Amber fair better, especially in matters of her heart (where Bruce Carlton was so hopelessly &quot;enshrined&quot;).Remember, readers, this is fiction. Winsor draws us in, effortlessly, honing our own hunger for &quot;everything in its right place&quot;, and &quot;all lived happily ever after&quot;. Amber's determination to win Bruce's heart for all time, and all the bitter disappointments that unrequited love brings to her is what makes ourselves, as we read, unable to put this book down.

Otherwise, I didn't care for it at all. It's very long - which is fine if the content changes to keep your interest - but how many times can one really stand to read about Amber's ongoing infatuation with Bruce Carlton? The man clearly has no intentions toward her being anything more than his mistress, and yet she chases him and chases him and acts like \\"a silly whore\\" or \\"a useless jade\\" for the entire novel. A poor female character, Amber embodies every stereotype of an ill-bred country innocent. I felt sorry for Bruce Carlton, not Amber, to the point where when he strikes her, I actually was on his side. Enough with her stupidity already!"},{"Title":"Forever Amber (The Greates Historical Novels)","review":"Yeah right, like we all know that's never going to happen don't we?Amber St. Clare never felt she belonged with the poor family who raised her, and when one day a troop of cavaliers ride into her village she's swept away by Lord Bruce Carlton. Well, actually its more like the other way around - Amber won't say no and begs Bruce to take her to London and against his better judgment he agrees - although lust for the beauteous Amber might have something to do with it. Bruce makes it perfectly clear he'll never marry her and when his privateering ships are ready to sail she's on her own in the big city. Amber accepts Bruce's terms and they're off to London as Charles II is crowned and his bawdy court and courtiers are in full swing. As he warned, Bruce soon has to leave and it doesn't take long for a pregnant Amber to get herself royally swindled (what a fool) out of every farthing Bruce left her and thrown into Newgate prison for debt. Not one to be down and out for long, Amber soon hooks up with a notorious highway man and he breaks them out and the game is on......Until of course Black Jack Mallard is caught and hanged and finding herself in another pickle she goes for the stage - but she still needs to find man to keep her in the style in which she wants to become accustomed to - and handsome Captain Rex Morgan will fit the bill quite nicely. That is,as soon as she can take him away from his current mistress. Of course, once Bruce is back Amber manages to screw things up nicely (what a fool) and fresh out of likely prospects (young men with money) in London Amber finds herself an older one to protect her from life's little problems. But then older men don't live forever and when their family doesn't like you well, then she's off on the hunt yet again....Amber's story takes her through all walks of Restoration England, from prison to theatre to the decadent, conniving court of Charles II (loved Castlemaine and Buckingham's antics), from the plague (A.W.E.S.O.M.E.) to the Great Fire and from man to man and bed to bed. Amber is most definitely one of fiction's most flawed heroines and despite the many lessons life dishes out do you think she ever learns from them? Not on your life, nor does she ever figure out that Bruce is never ever going to marry her - sleep with her, yes. Don't worry though, as busy as Amber is in the bed chamber and despite the fact that when published in the 40's this was so scandalous it was banned in Boston, the sex is pretty tame and left to the reader's imagination (how refreshing). Watching Amber is like watching a train wreck - you can't take your eyes away for fear of missing what's going to happen next. As for the ending? Kathleen Winsor dishes up the most delectable bit of Just Desserts at the end - I can't recall ever seeing better . A grand and glorious romp through the court of Charles II, don't miss it."},{"Title":"Forever Amber (The Greates Historical Novels)","review":"I'm a male reader of \\"Forever Amber\\" who is interested in popular culture and the best sellers of other decades. I had often seen the rather poor but colorful 1947 movie version of this book, and I knew the novel was a huge and scandalous seller in its day. I had always been curious about it.Now I have read it and feel I know what all the fuss was about, particularly throughout the '40s when it was phenomenally popular. Kathleen Winsor was clearly an intelligent woman who was nevertheless a poor writer. She did an enormous amount of research on the Restoration period and there are many wonderful details of life in the England of Charles II. What she excels at is the accretion of period detail, as well as an endlessly inventive (and sometimes just seemingly endless) number of interesting plot twists. She was clearly a supreme editor and synthesizer.And where I think she was a kind of pop genius was in her timing -- she realized that the WWII years were the right time to create a heroine of spirit, resourcefulness and sexual forthrightness. If Margaret Mitchell showed the way with Scarlett, Winsor does her several better by having Amber actually enjoy sex, completely unencumbered by Catholic (or any religious) scruples about what she has to do (and often WANTS to do) to rise in society. Winsor realized that young women were much less prudish than they were assumed to be, that they would welcome a fantasy about a women living for her senses and by her wits. This was extremely shrewd of her. So is the fact that she rifled many other books for her novel, cynically understanding that few women of her generation would be familiar with the original sources she studied and copied. And where Mitchell's book was elaborately written and detailed in the way of 19th century fiction, \\"Forever Amber\\" has minimal description but lots of headlong action just like the pot boilers that were to follow, right up until today.At its best, Winsor's writing is straightforward, but it is more often plodding, and her dialogue is mostly dreadful. The single best passage (as was noted even at the time) is the long, tense, claustrophic plague sequence where her lover Bruce and then Amber herself succumb to ghastly illness. Tremendously atmospheric, it is the best written part of the novel, and is worth a whole extra star for the book's overall rating. But as vivid as Amber seems, she is just as two-dimensional a character as most of the others in this book. Amber never grows, never changes, just ACTS, and the fact that she is a creature of action rather than thought or reflection makes her modern, but never memorable, except as a symbol of the feminism and sexual revolution that was to come in later decades. In fact, for long stretches, she is a supporting character in her own novel, taking a back seat to the machinations of Charles II and other historical figures in his orbit, all of whom seem more lifelike than Amber ever does.Winsor would have made a better screenwriter than she ever did a novelist. She excels at plot and action, period. In this too she was prescient. \\"Forever Amber\\" remains an interesting and entertaining read, if not a nourishing one. It was definitely a signpost on the pop culture road, and I'm glad I read it. I'm sorry that Winsor died just this week. I would have loved to talk to her about her infamous book."},{"Title":"Forever Amber (The Greates Historical Novels)","review":"I read this book when I was a teenager, 50 years ago and I enjoyed it as much, if not more, this time around.I think it's a must read, especially if you think Fifty Shades is good. This is so, so much better!!"},{"Title":"Forever Amber (The Greates Historical Novels)","review":"I was first introduced to this book in-utero. My mom read it while pregnant with me. I was told about it most of my life, but was only able to find a copy at age 20. I have since read it at least once a year and have gotten over being angry with my mother at having named me after a woman of ill-repute. I now realize that Amber did nothing any woman would not have done in order to survive and take care of her son while wooing the man she loves. A great read for anyone who believes in love and its healing powers, as well as the power of women."},{"Title":"Forever Amber (The Greates Historical Novels)","review":"Kathleen Winsor's 1940's novel of Amber St Clare and Restoration England remains one hell of a book. She runs away from her adopted parents and village with a handsome Cavalier whose love she will pursue throughout her eventful life. 1660's London springs a multitude of up and down surprises for the novel's irrepressible heroine. The historical accuracy : the court and loves of Charles the Second, the theatre life, the plague and the fire of London, is particularly entertaining. Personally think that this book shadows &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot; - and it calls to be made into a TV mini-series"},{"Title":"Forever Amber (The Greates Historical Novels)","review":"Forever is exactly how long this book seems to last. It is the tale of the beautiful and ambitious Amber, who sleeps her way to the top of Restoration society in London. Amber lives through husbands, lovers, plague, fire, etc; but she never seems to grow up and does not change. (Even the oblivious Scarlett O'Hara had an epiphany at the end of GONE WITH THE WIND) I could not identify with any of the unlikable characters, and did I mention that the main character, Amber, learned nothing in her journey? Look for my copy at your local Goodwill store."},{"Title":"Forever Amber (The Greates Historical Novels)","review":"I read Forever Amber on the recommendation of a dear friend who adores the book. I'm sorry to say that while I can appreciate the difficulty of weaving actual history into a romantic tale, I cannot understand the attraction so many people have to it. Yes, life could be miserable for women then. Yes, women had few options to survive in the world. But it was done. And not necessarily in the way Amber chose. My biggest problem with the book is with the characters. As other reviewers have noted, it's difficult to relate to them. For me, it especially holds true for Amber, the \\"heroine.\\" Amber believes herself to be bigger than her small town life and is unwilling to settle for the unexciting life that awaits her there. So, her only option is to act without any common sense and then skip off to an open field with a complete (albeit handsome and charming) stranger? Then act perplexed when he has no interest in immediately making her his wife? And then spend her adult life seducing and lying her way into royal court life, only to find that it's lonely (and precarious) at the top? This may be someone's romanticized version of a woman struggling in the face of conflict, but I don't feel it speaks for women of that time, nor rang true when written in 1944. It certainly doesn't ring true now. Life is partly what you are confronted with and partly what you make of it. Amber's choices demonstrate that her plight is not a product of the times, but her own narrow-minded decisions."},{"Title":"Forever Amber (The Greates Historical Novels)","review":"I have heard this book described as the grandmother of all bodice-rippers, but it is also an accurate and colorful depiction of the Restoration in all its bawdy glory. You may not exactly like Amber (she is a tart), but you can't help getting caught up in her story as she contends with plague, fire, treacherous courtiers, murderous husbands, and Newgate Prison. \\"The Other Boleyn Girl\\" is the best 21st-century comparison I've read."},{"Title":"Forever Amber (The Greates Historical Novels)","review":"This book was one I could not put down. There isn't a single boring moment and as you read on you only want to read more and more. Amazingly this book was written in the 1940's and the city of Boston actually banned the book from being sold in book stores becausse it was considered too risque'. Right from the get-go I was addicted to the book. I found myself almost too emotionally involved in the story, feeling so sorry for Amber, and hating Bruce Carlton. I was furious that Amber let Bruce take their son to America when Bruce was never a father to him and he left Amber to give birth alone! Excellent read,you'll enjoy the story, but....be aware, the ending will make you want to throw the book at the wall!"},{"Title":"Forever Amber (The Greates Historical Novels)","review":"This novel was one of the most absorbing historical romances I have ever read. Winsor's style is brilliant in that she conveys so much historical detail in the most lively, utterly engrossing way. The story jumps out at you and takes you for a ride through Restoration England that you'll never forget, from the quiet village countryside to the noisy, boisterous streets of London, from Newgate prison to a stroll through St. James's Park, from crooked alleyways of horologists and highwaymen to the corrupt, decadent court of Charles II. Historical fiction readers of all types will appreciate the stunning insight into such events as the Great Plague of London and the Great Fire, as they mirror the personal travails of Amber St. Clare.The characters in this book, just as fascinating as their surroundings, nevertheless may repel many readers. Almost all of the main characters (with a few notable exceptions), including Amber, are selfish and at times cruel. Approach this book with the knowledge that you will probably be disgusted at times by their actions and their lack of growth, but that their purpose is not necessarily to be loved or even liked, but studied as reflections of the period, brimming with a sort of unstoppable audacity. And you might even secretly admire some of them, too, like the ruthless, clever George Villiers or the tempestuous Barbara Palmer. Amber herself is immature, conceited and often far too impetuous, but these qualities also seem to make possible this incredible capacity for perseverance, ambition and audacity that I found fascinating. She has little sense of boundaries and, for good or ill, breaks through them again and again. And she is unapologetic every time. She possesses all of the characteristics that are necessary to thrive in Restoration London, and she uses them to the hilt.Amber's love for Bruce Carlton, whom she first meets in her hometown of Marygreen and soon runs away with to London, is born almost from the beginning, and only grows alarmingly, becoming an obsession that heightens her already reckless nature. It is a great irony that Amber gains so much through her selfish climb for wealth and power, using man after man, but the only man she truly deserves, for whom she gives surprising selfless care and concern, is the one man she cannot have. Their relationship roller-coasters from angry separation to lusty reunion, from Amber repelling Bruce, then once again flinging herself at him. This may prove tiring and unsatisfying for some; so, be warned that this cycle continues to the end and does not come to a clean conclusion.I've read that Kathleen Winsor meant to write a sequel, Amber in America, but never did. And it is a shame, because without the sequel, this book seems slightly incomplete and unsatisfying, especially in the romance department. But aside from that, it is a well-researched and compelling read. Though it is almost a thousand pages long, the pages fly. I can well understand how it was banned in the 40's; it wasn't for graphic sex scenes, as there were very little, but for the shocking immorality of the characters and their cutthroat behavior in an era that is portrayed as licentious, corrupt and, like Amber herself, hungry for life. It's easy to see how it would shock people of a more conservative decade. It is rare to find a book that brings forth so many strong feelings, both ugly and beautiful, but this one does."},{"Title":"Forever Amber (The Greates Historical Novels)","review":"I first read this novel way back when and have reread it several times over the years. It never ceases to amaze me. Amber is at once ruthless, ambitious, determinded to survive and prove to the love of her life that she is now good enough for him. Her love for Lord Carlton and the lengths she goes to pursue him have a singlemindedness of purpose that is at once ironic and tragic. Had the circumstances of her birth become known she would have almost certainly have married him.That she never knew her birthright, and he wouldn't marry beneath him, have always held a certain sadness...what if....quality for me. The writing is so vivid that you can almost smell the flames of the Great Fire of London, and the stench of the plague wagons. The characterizations of Charles II and the corruptions of his court make them practically leap off the page. The triumphal entry of the restored Charles II to London has to be read to be believed. The intrigues and characters surrounding his court (most of whom are Amber's enemies) are as vivid as you can get without actually having been there.Amber very much reminds me of Scarlett O'Hara of Gone with the Wind fame. And like Scarlett, one is left hanging, wanting more. Will Rhett ever return, will Amber's passage across the ocean to be reunited with Bruce Carlton ultimately destroy her?This is truly a classic of historical ficton."},{"Title":"Forever Amber (The Greates Historical Novels)","review":"Just finished reading the book, 972 pages long which I usually don't mind but in this case I found myself thinking\\" 972 pages for amber getting duped in the end by two selfish plotting men, wasn't Amber supposed to get her way at the end?\\" Some of you might actually think me naive or just a hopeless romantic but I truly expected Lord Carlton to marry Amber, at least some day when they were 90 something like that. Getting to the basis of my review, from which I have drifted, the book is just as intriguing as any contemporary historical romance novel it seems to be the foundation for all those great historical romance novels that are hugely popular today. It has rich descriptions and truly gives the sense of one actually living in 17th century London. Amber is a great character and I was rooting for her from the beginning, we all have a little side of Amber's evilish thoughts. On the other hand the book is too repetitive, two bad husbands is enough in my opinion, and most times I had to put it down just to simmer my anger at Bruce for being so cold to her and at Amber for being too pleading with him often asking myself \\"where's her pride when she needs it?!\\"So basically my disappointment is that Amber got greedy and Bruce got married and even more cold towards her, and they didn't end up together. I was also disappointed in the fact that throughout all the novel I saw how Amber rose above all obstacles and later she gets tricked because of her only weakness, the novel completely lost oomph for me I wanted her to rise above EVERYTHING including Bruce. And finally the only thing that I would criticize about Amber's attitude is that she wasn't such a devoted mother, I don't know but my maternal instincts kicked in and I kept wondering about her kids all the time, and Lord Carlton was always a bigger priority than them.Still got to say props to Kathleen for writing such an amazing book (which is today considered a classic) in such a conflicting time for women specially. I give it 4 stars for the ending, but truly i have read worse, much much worse, its pretty good!"},{"Title":"Forever Amber (The Greates Historical Novels)","review":"This is the story of Amber, a smart driven woman who is bound and determined to rise above her circumstances in life...by whatever means necessary. Raised in the country as a farm girl, the only means Amber has at her disposal are her beauty, wit, and a pair of cajones that the toughest man would envy!Early in the story Amber meets Bruce, falls head over heels, and uses him as her ticket to London and a better life. Bruce thinks Amber is good enough to use and toss aside whenever she becomes an inconvenience to his plans. As Bruce drifts in and out of her life, Amber claws her way to the top eventually becoming the King's favorite mistress.No matter who she marries or takes up with, her heart belongs to Bruce. Amber's enemies think she has become too powerful and ultimately use against her the one thing that causes her to take leave of her senses....her obsessive love for Bruce. The ending was priceless, I wanted to scream to her \\"No, don't do it!\\".All in all this was an amazing novel. The decadent life of the rich contrasted with the miserable life of the poor. It had brilliantly detailed history, beautiful writing, and so many twists and turns that would each make their own stunning novel.I absolutely loved Amber! Some of the time I wanted to cheer for her, other times I cringed at the choices she made but I just couldn't help but feel sympathy for her. She was a woman living in a man's world who wanted more than her lot in life would allow. She did what she had to do to get it. It may not have been \\"moral\\" as dictated by the times, but who in the novel was really moral? Bruce used and discarded Amber as a whore knowing that she really loved him, two of her husbands were more evil than Amber could ever dream of being, plots and schemes were everywhere, everyone stepping on everyone to get ahead. Wars were fought, people died and suffered to advance the schemes of the rich and powerful. Is it really all that different from today?

Although by today's standards it's pretty tame, &quot;Forever Amber&quot; must have been quite shocking back in the forties when it was first published. But it's not the racy tidbits that will keep you reading--it's the astounding historical details and just plain old good storytelling.

While the author makes use of many sexual references, they are novel because they told from an independent woman's perspective. Amber does what she wants, and gets it in a male-controlled world."},{"Title":"Forever Amber (The Greates Historical Novels)","review":"Even though Kathleen Winsor wrote \\"Forever Amber\\" in 1944, the willful self-possession depicted in her protagonist, endows the she-devil courtesan Amber St. Claire with a permanent ranking as one of the all time most unforgettable divas of the historical romance genre. Over 900 pages long, \\"Forever Amber,\\" stands the test of time, portraying the Restoration court of Charles II with a well-researched authenticity and pragmatic candor that needs not rely on the bodice ripping details of more modern romantic classics. Rather, Winsor's novel moves with the swift frenzy of the author's featured venues: the Great Fire of London and the undiscriminating Black Plague. Her main character glides toward her goal with the unstoppable force of a hurricane and whether worthy or not, the reader cannot help but applaud her ascent and breathlessly await and bewail her ultimate failure to learn life's greatest lesson.Sounds familiar? Change the venue to plantation America and another Civil War and you just might be skimming the pages of \\"Gone with the Wind.\\"Humble, Amber is not. She follows the archetype of Scarlett O'Hara--the beautiful woman who can have anyone but nevertheless relentlessly pursues her man no matter how badly he disappoints her. Lovely, ruthless and clearly conscience-free, she embodies the mores of a time when the most essential asset for a woman was not only her beauty but, her ability to utilize her brainpower under its guise. Instinctively knowing that a thrilling destiny lies ahead within the capital city, sixteen-year-old Amber gambles running off with cavalier Bruce Carlson whom she loves unconditionally from the very start. Whether or not her obsessive and sometimes reckless love for him self-serves to achieve further aggrandizement of the most esurient nature, the reader cannot help but applaud her expectations, revel in her successes and yet simultaneously understand her desire for the one thing she cannot obtain. Everyone admires and cannot help be fascinated by the beautiful villainess who will stop at nothing to achieve her goals.From the get-go, the reader knows all too well that Amber like Scarlett may get her man when the convenience of time and place is in her favor. The long run, however speaks for itself. The published novel supposedly is only one fifth of that which Winsor originally intended. At the end of the novel, Amber remains, at a few years short of thirty, at the top of her game. Winsor keeps her the one constant in her illustrative equation depicting yet another age of corrupt morals and wildly schemed machinations leading to the accrual of wealth and power. Her motivation steers her steadily toward what she thinks she desires most, position and privilege that will elevate her status to that acceptable for a marriage with Lord Carlton. In the course of the novel, Amber rises to the top of her materialistic world, but fails to change within; her soul does not transform in any way--she remains forever the hard yet outwardly beautiful substance for which she is named. For this reviewer, this is why Forever Amber, although a delightful read for many reasons fails to fully engage the emotions. Allowing Amber to realize her folly through some cathartic moment rather than continue along the same self-serving reiterative drive would have allowed some empathy to enter what is only an arena of self-destruction and disappointment. Better to have had Amber see Lord Carlton, as Scarlett eventually sees Ashley, for what he is--an unfulfilled dream with little substance. What is needed in Forever Amber is the Rhett Butler archetype--a man of character entering her life to show her what she needs to know for further inner development. Forever Amber fails to capture the full story of Amber St. Claire in a more satisfying literary way despite its historical accuracy and insightful portrayal of the ultimate in scheming females.Bottom line? \\"Forever Amber\\" will entertain on many levels and in many respects remains a classic of historical romance. In terms of story structure, it fails in that its main character, the at-times despicable and all-times superficial, Amber St. Claire really does not grow inwardly in any outstanding way. She remains a fixed entity in which the wonderful kaleidoscope of Britain's Restoration age wheels about her providing for her an illusory smorgasbord of all things material from which she can grab. Author Winsor creates a huge tome of a book of page-turning enjoyment that stands the test of best-selling time. Recommended.Diana Faillace Von Behren\\"reneofc\\""},{"Title":"Forever Amber (The Greates Historical Novels)","review":"The book was absolutely captivating. I passionately hoped that Amber and Lord Carlton's would persevere and they would marry despite the fact that she was supposedly the daughter of a country man. Which she was not, she was actually the offspring of great and powerful people, this was never discovered by Amber or Lord Carlton which disappointed me. But i still had hope that they would still marry but this was diminished when he married another girl that he met in Virginia while Amber slowly climbs the ladder of high society. She becomes wealthy and gets the title of a duchess. She is loved and envied. The only man she ever truly loved, Lord Carlton is now married, but i still have faith that they will be together. All my hopes shatter in the end of the book. It's a great book but the ending is wretched."},{"Title":"Forever Amber (The Greates Historical Novels)","review":"i'm actully rather conflicted. There where parts of this book i liked, but the \\"heroine\\" was not one of them. I found Amber St Clare to be selfish and hateful. She's the daughter of two noble people, who, due to the civil war in england, never married. Her mother died in childbirth, and her father vanished off the face of the earth.Now don't get me wrong, the book was well written. It kept me reading almost to the emd. I say almost, i couldnt stand the repetiveness any longer. there were no sex scenes to speak of.What i did like . The way Bruce and Amber struggled to get through the plague together.What i didn't like. An event like that should bring two people together, it does not.The book ends rather abruptly, with no real resolution for either the charatrers, or the reader."},{"Title":"Forever Amber (The Greates Historical Novels)","review":"This book really is like a British Restoration-era GWTW, minus the racism. This is what a historical romance really should be--a love story told in the genre of historical fiction, not just a romance novel where a setting in the past serves as little more than a costume drama. I have an old hardcover copy from 1945 (in surprisingly great condition!), with the text on two columns on each page, running only 652 pages as opposed to the 976 pages boasted by the current paperback issue. Like Scarlett in GWTW, Amber is also a feisty woman ahead of her time, not caring whom she may hurt, use, exploit, or cuckold on her way up to the top or in pursuit of the man she loves best above all. I really understand why the name Amber became so popular after this novel came out--sure, like Scarlett, she's not the type of woman you'd want your daughter to emulate in terms of their morals, but I think it's her determination to get what she wants and how she continually rises above and triumphs over things that would have totally destroyed many another person that made so many women name their daughters after her. And unlike Scarlett, Amber loves sex, and goes through a lot more lovers, marries four times (and probably would have married five times had it not been for what happened with the handsome and caring Captain Rex Morgan), and has three abortions in between having her first and second child. What woman in the 1660s, indeed even today, would have been able to rise as far as Amber does, from an illegitimate orphaned child, to an unwed mother herself, in and out of debtors' prison, a life of crime, living with unsavoury elements, a career in the theatre at a time when female actors were considered very disreputable and low-class, two horrible husbands (Samuel Dangerfield, her second husband, and Baron Gerald Stanhope, the fourth, were the nicest of her four husbands), the Plague of 1665, the Great Fire of London of 1666, the Dutch invasion, a meddling jade of a mother-in-law (by her final marriage), to becoming a Lady of the Bedchamber and King Charles II's top mistress, displacing Barbara Villiers Palmer, by being meek, passive, and submissive? If Amber were a doormat and typical woman of her day and age, she would have stayed in Marygreen and never had the half of the adventures and experiences she had.I was surprised the book didn't live up to its reputation as being shocking, sexy, and scandalous. How far we've come from 1944, when a book with sex scenes which are only hinted at and a woman who sleeps around and behaves in the manner Amber does is now considered tame and doesn't even raise an eyebrow. This is no longer the type of book you'd hide under the mattress or punish a teenage daughter for reading. The only thing I didn't like was how it ended almost in media res; also like GWTW, it was begging for a sequel, though given the mixed reviews the so-called sequel to GWTW has gotten, maybe it's a good thing that there was no sequel to 'Forever Amber,' with Amber in America trying to win Bruce once and for all. How can you compare a sequel, by the original author or by someone else, to the brilliance of the epic story that came before? Most fans probably have a picture in their head of what happened after the final page ended, so why ruin it with something that may not go along with our fantasies?"},{"Title":"Forever Amber (The Greates Historical Novels)","review":"Amber St. Clare's rags-to-riches story is to England what \\"Gone With The Wind\\" is to the American South....a spoiled young girl uses her wits to survive and wins at every game but love. From the London stage to the court of King Charles, Amber gets herself revered, loved, admired and loathed all at the same time. Winsor's knowledge of the period is evident and she weaves real characters - especially Charles, his mistresses and Queen Catherine - in with her fictional characters so convincingly that we almost believe Amber is real. THe only disappointment is the ending....like \\"GWTW\\" there is, frustratingly, no sequel.

I love period pieces and a little romance on top; you really can't go all that wrong.....Unfortunately this book was a MASSIVE let-down. I read it before bed, in the morning before work, on my lunch break, I got about 300 pages in before i realized it wasn't really going pick up interest. It hit a plateau that was just bearable enough to stick out hoping it all turns around but not enough to EVER recommend to a friend. Trust the negative reviews..!!THIS BOOK IS NOT WORTH THE READ!!HERE'S WHY...PROS:+ the authors writing style & imagery is written very well; it's one of the main reasons i finished itMAJOR FLAWS:+ CHARACTERS: The main character is wretchedly one dimensional; she's selfish, immature, and really obnoxious and although I still felt bad for her at the end of the book, she absolutely gets what she deserves. The author at least should have given her one area of improvement, she doesn't even end up being a good mom. I'm not even a mom & I felt there was NO relating to her as a character.+ PLOT: The story is on a merry go round, taking you basically in a circle over and over and over and when it ends nothing has changed AT ALL. Nothing.+ ENDING: completely obvious & it feels rushed! The only thing that happens, does so within half of a chapter; the author should have built it up more, made it more mysterious. I've seen endings of Spongebob that are less obvious.+ LOOSE ENDS: They leave you with cliffhangers... I mean seriously?! In 972 pages you couldn't tie up those loose ends?- EX: In the 1st part of the book her aunt & uncle are talking about never telling Amber who her parents are hinting she might come from royalty & then when she marries her 3rd husband he comments about how similar she looks to his 1 true love, a princess he was supposed to run away with who looks JUST like Amber, and when Amber wears the woman's wedding dress it fits perfectly \\"like it was made for me\\" and then it goes NOWHERE with that. lol Perfect time to stop the merry-go-round & take this story to different levels! but nope.+ even the exciting parts (ex: she becomes the kings mistress) are kinda dull. Nothing really special happens to her as the kings mistress. She has a bastard with him, but literally he's no different than every other guy she sleeps with."},{"Title":"Forever Amber (The Greates Historical Novels)","review":"I began reading Forever Amber last week (hoping to find a book I might like while I waited for another one to come available at the Library) and from the first I wasn't sure I was going to enjoy this book. But I am one of those readers that feels if a book is started then you should finish it. Upon finishing it I feel cheated.The book isn't all that bad. There is a lot of movement, intrigue and history in it. But I couldn't feel for the characters. The main character, Amber, was not someone that I would like and even when things went wrong for her, I still felt that way. I assume that no one is supposed to like her. And although I didn't like any of the characters in this book, I guess I did feel something for Amber because I felt like she should be with Lord Carlton...up in until the last part of the book. Then I realized that she shouldn't be with anyone.The reason for the two stars is because of the ending. I hated that ending. I felt totally cheated after reading the whole 700 plus pages and then the book ending so abruptly. I agree with others who have left reviews here, it seems that the author decided that she either didn't want to write anymore of this book or she ran out of things to write about.Anyway, it was an okay book to keep me occupied until the book I have been waiting for becomes available but I would never recommend this book to anyone. It's really not worth the time.I guess you either love the book or you hate it.

I can honestly say that otherwise, I would not have read it. Thank God she did tell me about how amazing it was...this is NOT a story to be missed! I could not believe that this was written back in 1944...it felt so fresh and not at all old fashioned.I thought that the authors writing style was brilliant. The book is mainly about the life of a girl called Amber St. Clare. The thing about Amber is that she is not easy to like..in fact..I was appalled by her often, but at the same time I found myself admiring her determination, rooting for her, and pitying her as well. The book goes on for 972 pages and at the end of it all I actually wanted MORE. The descriptions were so vivid that I felt like I could see, smell, TASTE London as it was in the 1660s. I am so happy to have experienced this tale. I plan to look for more of Kathleen Winsors work and I wholeheartedly recommend this book to any lover of Historical Fiction."},{"Title":"Forever Amber (The Greates Historical Novels)","review":"If you are a reader who loves to be transported inside a novel to one of the most interesting eras in British History; if you love reading books whose words literally cause you to feel, taste and smell as you read; If you love Adventure, Drama, Color, and relationships, Forever Amber is the book for you.I first read this book when I was 17, over 32 years ago, having received the book from my mom who read it when she was in her early 20's. Since then I have read it again and again every year, sometimes reading it twice within a year, especially during periods when I needed to go into another place and time away from my real life.I neither condone, agree nor disagree with all that is written by Ms. Winsor in this book. It is what it is, a spider web of interesting places, facts, people, cultures and society during the reign of King Charles II. I am a reader that wants to be entertained; wants to be enveloped inside a story or novel, and I believe any potential readers will experience this by reading it.Forever Amber was the catalyst to my developing interest in England, in all things British. I love reading about England and have studied it extensively since first reading the book in high school.I traveled to England in 1997 to fulfill a lifelong dream of visiting the places written about in the book. I wanted to see the green countrysides and English village towns, the tower of London, Whitehall palace, the beautiful flowers, the architecture, paintings, Royals, food, and people, so vividly described to me in her book. I am and will probably always be (ask anyone who knows me) a lover of all things British, an Anglophile and serious Royal researcher and London enthusiast because of Forever Amber.The novel is not trashy, it is not preachy, nor is it like any of the modern day historical romance books you may have read. It is simply an interesting story, well embroidered, well structured, about a young woman's journey, trials, tribulations, love, death and triumphs in life during 1600's Restoration England.You will at times find yourself loving Amber and her life, then find yourself despising her for her unchanging, immoral, self serving and ignorant characteristics. Either way the book is worth its weight in gold. ***** FIVE STARS"},{"Title":"Forever Amber (The Greates Historical Novels)","review":"Amber St. Clare is my all-time favorite romance character--even moreso than Scarlett O'Hara. Sure, Amber's unscrupulous at times, but she's not afraid to go after what she wants. She is definitely not a wimp, unlike so many modern-day romance heroines. Never, EVER did Amber really cave to a man's will. She might do it for a while, but only for as long as it suited her (or to ultimately gain the upper hand).The historical detail in this book is astounding. No history book has ever made the period so gloriously alive, warts and all. Few books provide a better understanding of the Restoration, of the way its people thought, lived, dressed, ate--everything.One other thing that I liked about the book was the sexuality without the gory details. I read this book nearly 20 years ago, and I can STILL remember the veiled reference to a night Amber spent with the Duke of Buckingham. No details were provided, just that even Amber was disgusted with what happened (which means it must have been really perverted). It was left to the imagination what really happened, which is much more effective than spelling it all out. I can't say that I remember ANY sex scene from a modern romance novel, not even the one I finished this morning. After a while, they're all pretty much the same--and they're boring.For those who clamor for a sequel, one was written, but I can't remember the name of it (I found it in a South Dakota library about 15 years ago). Amber followed Bruce to America, and I believe she finally got him. The main problem with the book, as with Winsor's other subsequent efforts, was that it just didn't live up to Forever Amber. There is something about this book that is simply magical."},{"Title":"Forever Amber (The Greates Historical Novels)","review":"I first read Forever Amber about 10 years ago and was flabergasted at the historical detail entailed in the story. Generally books that contain this much history can tend to be a tough read, sometimes boring. Not the case with Forever Amber. The characters are rich and true to the period, the background setting is exciting and realistic. The main character Amber St. Clare is certainly exciting, maddening, funny, and outragious. She is a survivor that you can not help but admire despite her flaws.I have just finished reading this book once again, which, for me is very unusual. I am an avid read of historical books but there are not many that I make a point of keeping on my bookshelve. This one is there to stay in my collection!I would appreciate some HELP in finding out if Kathleen Winsor did write a sequel to Forever Amber, and if she did what is the name of this book? Possible sources for tracking books out of print, etc.? Any information would be helpful. Thank-you."},{"Title":"Forever Amber (The Greates Historical Novels)","review":"I first read the book when I was 18. Naively, I thought ALL books called &quot;romance&quot; would be of this quality, but of course, I was disappointed! Since then, I have read the book once during each subsequent five years of my life, most recently re-reading it at age 47. Ms. Winsor's recreation of Restoration London is accurate and her writing style much like that of Margaret Mitchell. It's an absorbing book, but not simplistic, not &quot;light.&quot; It's an excellent introduction to the Restoration period. Forever Amber started my interest in this period of time and, many history books later, I can say that Winsor's depiction is accurate and complete. I understand Ms. Winsor filled about 40 notebooks with research notes before she wrote the book. Amber does it all! And while she's unscrupulous, she's young, and so real, I think every woman can see herself, only in part (I hope), in Amber's psychology. The most poignant part of the story, for me, was when Amber marries Lord Radclyffe and never realizes that Radclyffe was once engaged to Amber's own mother 20 years earlier, and Radclyffe never realizes that he has married the daughter of the woman of his dreams, whom he lost during the civil wars. When Amber tries on an old wedding dress, that was made for her mother and it fits her almost like it was made for her, I almost cried because she never knows. Amber also never realizes she is really of the nobility and one, just one, of the reasons Bruce Carlton doesn't marry her is because he believes Amber's parents to be farmers, when actually, they were of a higher station than Carlton himself. The irony was subtle but almost painful to me when I realized these things --(after the second reading!). I found the scene when Buckingham pays Amber 200 pound to have sex with him, and Amber is disgusted (although we never know why) to be one of the most creepily memorable &quot;kinky sex&quot; scenes I've ever read; much more effective than if the perversions had been spelled out. One reviewer says there was a sequel to Forever Amber. I would love to know the title! Although, I can't believe there could be a satisfactory sequel to this story. ... it's too sad to say how, just couldn't be any better. Just like when Scarlett loses Rhett. There can't be another ending, (despite &quot;Scarlett&quot;), but I'd love to know if Winsor had more in mind for Amber. I recommend, buy a copy of Forever Amber and enjoy! This is NOT a romance novel!"},{"Title":"Forever Amber (The Greates Historical Novels)","review":"I initially read Forever Amber at the age of 15 after borrowing the book from a friend. Years later I was able to get hold of a publication for myself and since then the book has become torn, tattered and discoloured at the many times I have read it. I am very much interested in the English Restoration period which has Amber's story interwoven into this period of time. I become so involved in Amber's love for Bruce and her determination and need to better her station in life, even at the risk of losing her own soul, that I actually feel I am transported back into that period of time. On a visit to London, I made sure I paid a visit to all the historical places mentioned in the book, which made the story come to life. Forever Amber takes pride of place in my bookshelf. I have never lent it out for fear of losing it forever. I simply love it and wish there was a sequel made."},{"Title":"Forever Amber (The Greates Historical Novels)","review":"I cannot say how much I loved this book. This is THE original work of true historical fiction and it also has the distinction of being banned and referd to as \\"Forever Under\\" in the United States for many years because of its sexual content. Not that that makes sense, because there is no descriptive sex in this book. There is, however, a lot of non descriptive sex and people \\"sliding into bed\\" and \\"slipping off their dress.\\" So if you're a prude, have no fear. There is no real raunchy sex here.This is a novel about the restoration period in England, right after King Charles II is invited back into the country. Amber is a small village girl (really she's the daughter of two nobles who were unmarried and so the girl ran away because her lover was for the parliament and her father was for the king-but she died giving birth) who has never left her little town. All the town girls hate her because all the boys love her, and so when the handsome cavalier Bruce wanders through, it takes no time for her to decide to head to London with him.But Bruce can't stick around and so Amber spends the next few years scheming for money, either by marrying into it, stealing it, acting for it, or sleeping with the king for it. Bruce shows up occasionally and while he and Amber have children he makes it clear his life is in the American colonies and he can never marry her. What's a love struck hard as nails courtesan to do?This book is amazing. Every scene is so descriptive you'll think you're in London during the plague, or the great fire (incidentally the Lord Mayor of London who refuses to fight the fire because he said \\"a woman could piss it out\\" is my ancestor) or strolling across the endless green field in summer. The description is amazing because the author had never been to England when she wrote it. The dialog is perfect and every character is a real person with huge faults. And like real people, some of them never change. Some reviewers on this site seem to hate Bruce, and I would say that that's a little judgemental, considering that he never promises Amber anything.*********SPOILER-DO NOT READ IF YOU HAVN\\"T READ THE BOOK******I do think Bruce was a terrible person at one point in this book-something to do with getting Amber and her 16 year old unmarried step-daughter pregnant at the same time. I mean god, thats just insulting. So what if Amber was married-it was cruel and terrible of him to do that. He knew Amber really loved him, so so what if the girl had a crush on him? He didn't have to sleep with her!Anyway, this is one of my favorite books of all time. I read it every year, and every year I bemoan the fact that there was never a sequel to it. I suppose someday someone will write one, just like \\"Gone with the wind\\" and it's very inferior sequel by another author \\"Scarlet.\\" Who knows, maybe I'll write the \\"Amber in America\\" sequel myself. I know I everyone who reads \\"Forever Amber\\" has some ideas on how that book would go...I feel this book has been wildly insulted by another reviewer who suggested going to Nora Loft for less \\"Bodic ripper\\" type historical fiction. Please. The reviewer clearly does not know their historical fiction. Ignore the sceptics who didn't like, no didn't love this book.

Her 1944 novel, which was made into a high-profile film directed by Otto Preminger, was a thousand-page fictional romp through Restoration fashion, politics, bedrooms and public disasters, among them the plague and the Great Fire of London. It was a love letter to a London she had read about in Defoe and Pepys, but had never seen.Forever Amber was published in New York by Macmillan, the firm that had sold 4m copies of Margaret Mitchell's Gone With The Wind in 1936. Alert to the possibilities of Winsor's manuscript, which ran to 2,500 pages, their editors set about carving something commercially viable from the sprawling story.In a pre-emptive move to scare Hollywood away from such a sexy novel, the book was denounced by the powerful Hays Office, which offered guidance on morals to the studio bosses. Combing the text, the Massachusetts attorney-general found 70 references to sexual intercourse, 39 illegitimate pregnancies, seven abortions, 10 scenes in which women undressed in front of men who were not their husbands, and nearly 50 \\"miscellaneous objectionable passages\\" - and announced that the book would be banned (an action overturned on appeal). Other states joined in the condemnation, and the critics, joyless and hostile, were led by Orville Prescott, who denounced the novel as \\"a crude and superficial glorification of a courtesan\\".Winsor denied that her book was particularly daring, and said that she had no interest in \\"anatomical scenes\\". \\"I wrote only two sexy passages,\\" she remarked, \\"and my publishers took both of them out. They put in ellipses instead. In those days, you could solve everything with an ellipse...\\"Of course, the bans were coded messages to the American reading public, which concluded that the book sounded like fun. It was, and 100,000 copies were snapped up in the first week. Altogether, Forever Amber sold more than 3mil. copies and was translated into 16 languages. It was the bestselling US novel in the 1940s. Books about the war, such as John Hersey's A Bell For Adano and Ernie Pyle's Brave Men, did not stand a chance against its narrative verve, colour and refreshing absence of earnestness.Preminger's film adaptation, given a moral ending on the insistence of Darryl F Zanuck, was thin stuff, however. Linda Darnell was brought in to replace the British actor Peggy Cummins when it was found that she did not do blowzy with sufficient conviction. The screenplay was written by Philip Dunne and Ring Lardner Jr, who was later blacklisted and sent to prison as one of the Hollywood 10.Born in a small town in Minnesota, Winsor was raised in Berkeley, California, where she attended university. At the age of 17, she married a campus football star, Robert Herwig. It was his senior honours thesis on Charles II that attracted her to the Restoration period, and she later claimed to have read 356 books on the subject.For an unknown and unpublished young author, she was as determined and well organised as any of her fictional heroines. She began Forever Amber in February 1940, at the age of 20, and the novel went through five drafts over the next four years. Her manuscripts, held at the University of Texas, include each one carefully dated, as well as abundant notes on her reading, on fashion, and an outsized map of Restoration London."},{"Title":"Forever Amber (The Greates Historical Novels)","review":"A friend of mine, a self proclaimed non-reader,introduced me to Forever Amber and I am so glad because I LOVE this book!

She is a phenomenal character that is driven and will do anything and everything she can to get what she wants. We watch Amber grow from a young, farm girl to a \\"mature\\", determined woman who uses her beauty to manipulate her way through life.As much as you may find her behavior to be deplorable at times, you can not help but to root for her. The book ends suddenly and each time I read it I am sad it is over. Forever Amber is a fantastic story and opened a whole new genre up for me."},{"Title":"Forever Amber (The Greates Historical Novels)","review":"Forever Amber takes place in the 1660s, immediately follwing Charles II's (\\"the Merry Monarch\\") return of the Stuarts to the English throne. The book features Amber St. Claire, a young woman who starts out as a sixteen-year-old country girl, naieve to the workings of the world. She immediately meets Bruce Carlton, a dashing young Cavalier, with whom she has a passionate love affair in choppy intervals throughout the book. They have two children together, but Bruce won't marry her for the reason he tells his friend Lord Almsbury: that Amber just isn't the kind of woman one marries.Upon following Bruce to London, he goes to Virginia, leaving her to fend for herself. What follows is a series of affairs and four marriages, with Bruce coming back from America now and then. Amber's marriages are imprudent: her first husband is a gambler, her second is an old dotard, her third locks her up in the house for days and won't let her out; and the last is a fop who allows himself to be cuckolded. Amber starts out in jail for debt, then becomes a thief, then moves on to the theatre, entertaining the college-age fops who attend. Her ambitions only rise from there as she sleeps with some of the most influential men in England.Eventually Amber follows her ambitions using her two strengths: her personality and beauty, ending up as the mistress to King Charles himself. The last quarter of the book involves itself in the court scandals of the time, not the least of which were sexual. Winsor is a little prudish and shies away from the sex that occurs in the book, but she places most of her focus on the clothes the people in London wore in the 1660s. The detaisl are lavish and gorgeous, and made me wish I'd lived in that time period.Amber is NOT supposed to be a likeable character. She is probably has the most character flaws of anyone who appears in this book. Her desperate love for Bruce is the cornerstone of the story, and Amber seems almost too desperate. Even though she insists that next time she will act aloof and sitant, she throws herself at him like a puppydog. When she finds out that Bruce has a wife, whom he met in America, Amber becomes hysterical with rage. Eventually she and Lady Carlton will become acquainted at court--and the outcome is not good.Once King Charles finished with one of his mistresses, her never gave up on her. That is, he never turned her out of Whitehall Palace. Amber quickly becomes one of those mistresses, liked by absolutely no one at court. However, she continues to hang on. The plan that Buckingham devises to get rid of her for once and all is clever and leaves the reader hanging on the edge of thier seat in the final pages of the novel. It was a beautifully written book that I will probably re-read over and over again. It gave a great insight into the lives people led at Charles's court, one that was decadent and sinful in comparison to the Puritans who had preceded him. A must for those who love this period in history or historical fiction in general. I also recommend: the works of Anya Seton, especially Katherine and Green Darkness; Slammerkin; and The Crimson Petal and the White."},{"Title":"Forever Amber (The Greates Historical Novels)","review":"It's a great read of times gone by.

But don't get me wrong the book is GREAT and I will totally recommend it I just so disapointed that it was sad I really wanted Amber to find out about her past and get a future she wanted."},{"Title":"Forever Amber (The Greates Historical Novels)","review":"I was fourteen and while my friends splashed in the swimming pool on a hot July day, I was shut in my room, completely lost in the last pages of Forever Amber. I have since read a quantity of books--a thousand or more--but only a few stand out so sharply as this one. Granted, Amber is not an inspiring character per se. She is not someone you would want as a friend for your daughter. But then place yourself in an era where a woman in her position could not survive on goodness alone. With Kathleen Windsor's writing skills, the streets of Restoration London come so alive that you slip into Amber's shoes effortlessly and they carry you through the heroine's trials in an almost three-dimensional world. Whether you like her or not, you are Amber and only when her ship sails away to America, you are released from the story. Why does the often irritating Amber persist in readers' memory while scores of more deserving heroines had long faded away? Because she rings true. Because she has touched the darker half of our heart. And because she is the ultimate survivor. Oh, and I remember feeling sorry for poor Captain Morgan, Bruce Carlton, and other male victims..."},{"Title":"Forever Amber (The Greates Historical Novels)","review":"This book was recommended to me by someone who knew of my entrancement with Gone With the Wind. All I can say is Amber is no Scarlett O'Hara. I would have enjoyed the book far more had it just been a work of historical fiction without the lovesick heroine who I did not feel anything for other than pity involved. There were storylines in the book that I thought should have been explored and weren't. I forced myself to finish the book, because I don't like to leave books unread but this is one book that I am severely disappointed that I purchased and didn't just take out from the library."},{"Title":"Forever Amber (The Greates Historical Novels)","review":"This is by far the best book I have ever read. It is an epic novel much like Gone With The Wind, with characters just as unforgettable. The book reads like an action packed movie, and you just can\`t wait to get to the following page to find out just what has happened to Amber!"},{"Title":"Forever Amber (The Greates Historical Novels)","review":"This is an epic disappointment. It made me suspect that the author had tried to write a European version of Gone With the Wind and failed miserably. I was generous with the 3 stars only because of the historical content. Amber is a hedonistic version of Scarlett O'Hara. The only reason I kept turning the pages was because I hoped to see her wake up and achieve some level of maturity.The novel spans a decade, and yet Amber's character spirals to levels of degradation that leave us nothing to root for. For all of her worldliness and sophistication she only gets more dim-witted. As I got closer to the end I realized there weren't enough pages left to make Amber into anything better. But again, like another reader I had invested so much time in this book that I kept on going till the bitter end. Afterwards, I closed it and threw it beside the bed and thought it was an incredible waste of time.If you want to read a wonderful historical romance, may I suggest the Outlander Series by Diana Gabaldon. The first book, Outlander, is a keeper and I read it over and over again. The characters are smart and likeable. The historical context, remarkable. Almost everyone I've given Outlander to has read all the books in the series. The second and third in the series, Dragonfly in Amber and Voyager, are to me, as good as the first.Another is The Pillars of the Earth by Ken Follett. When I put this book down it was like saying good bye to a dear friend.But this book, Forever Amber, will be forever forgotten"},{"Title":"Forever Amber (The Greates Historical Novels)","review":"I read this book when I was in high school back in the 60's. I recently bought another copy of it to give to a wonderful student I now have in class whose name is Amber. She's a bright, intelligent girl with a lot of spunk who made me remember the novel of my long ago days as a teenager. At last report, she was devouring it as the beginning of summer vacation has arrived. What a fabulous read, an old favorite, and now for the next generation. Thank you!"},{"Title":"Forever Amber (The Greates Historical Novels)","review":"I am in the process of reading this book and am almost finished. I started it when I was snowed in and have since neglected my laundry and most everything else to get more time to read this captivating novel. It is well researched and well written. Yes, the characters are selfish, immature and cruel to their spouses and most everyone around them, but I love to hate them! Amber is instrumental in destroying everything she has of value in the world and then she sits and whines about her great misfortunes. She complains about situations she creates by her selfish actions, but I can't help but cheer her on and can't wait to find out what happens next. It takes a great author to make you feel such a range of emotions about a particular character. It's well done and I highly recommend."},{"Title":"Forever Amber (The Greates Historical Novels)","review":"If you think about this book as a fun, fictional, wild ride through 1600s London and England, you'll like it. I feel I know SO much more about the time period, King James II, the craziness of the time period, and the way of life for courtiers. Seeing this world through Amber's eyes worked really well. From what I can tell, Kathleen Winsor really did her homework and tries to be as accurate as possible in capturing events of the times, with some imagination to bring them to life as they may have happened.If you expect this book to be about a complex protagonist you fall in love with, root for, and care about, you may be disappointed. This is what I expected, but she's more of a satirical character and vehicle for delivering a story than a multi-faceted character readers will relate to... at least I hope readers won't relate to her unless they are remembering their middle school selves!Amber St. Clare is totally unlikable from the very beginning of the novel. She probably has narcissistic personality disorder, and by the end of the book I was more interested in other characters than I was in her. That said, her rags to riches story is a nice vehicle for exploring mid-1600s London in all of its glory, tragedy, and rich history."},{"Title":"Forever Amber (The Greates Historical Novels)","review":"Just got this on Kindle (I've been waiting for 2 years lol) I'm only 1/3 of the way in. If I end up not liking it as much I'll adjust my review. Man I haven't had a book grab me like this one in a very long time. I even considered taking a vacation day from work to stay home and read all day! Super Juicy.."},{"Title":"Forever Amber (The Greates Historical Novels)","review":"Why isn't this book availabe on Nook and Kindle? Who wants to carry around a heavy book when it can be so pleasurable to read electronically?"},{"Title":"Forever Amber (The Greates Historical Novels)","review":"The book is interesting, but the Heroine is horrible. People who pick this up because they think she is like \\"GONE WITH THE WIND\\"'s Scarlett are going to be disappointed. Scarlett is a survivor, who (IMO) does experience some personal growth and at times was unselfish, in spite of herself. The only time Amber thought of anyone other than herself, was when Bruce was sick. Otherwise, she caused many deaths because of her stalker obsession, and only one guy really deserved it. Awful, terrible woman and the ending was not good.That said, If you like to read about Princess Diana's great great great (whatever) grandmother Barbara and Restoration England, it's a page turner-- for at least that."},{"Title":"Forever Amber (The Greates Historical Novels)","review":"Kathleen Winsor's Forever Amber was surprisingly repetitive and disappointing. I had to force myself to finish reading simply to finish. The ending left much to be desired, not because I want a sequel, but because the it was abrupt and pointless.The historical aspect of the book was acceptable, although it dwelled mainly on the decandence and corruption of the court. The only amusing parts I found were the spaniel puppies following Charles around in various scenes. The book made no mention of the rise of the political parties (Whigs and Tories). It did make reference to the restoration of the theater, abandoned from Cromwell's time. Yet the focuse was on the actresses and not on the types or depth of the plays. It would have been acceptable if the novel was purely from the viewpoint of Amber, but the storyline swapped back and forth from Amber to Charles or other memebers of the court. Inspite of that, the level of wit and intelligence did not change from the low-class girl to the king of England.The storyline was predictable and uninspiring and the characters were all two-dimensional, flat, and lackluster. Everyone in the story, except for a few obviously negative characters, were all beautiful and handsome. Calling Amber a heroine would be a far stretch. Her \\"faithfulness\\" to her perceived love was annoying and downright humiliating. In modern day, she would be characterized as a stalker. The speed at which a complete illiterate like her learned to read and understand the likes of John Milton was unbelievable.I completely agree with Lady Carlton's assessment of Amber based on her crude and low-class background.I'd much rather read a history textbook to get the historical information than read Forever Amber again."},{"Title":"Forever Amber (The Greates Historical Novels)","review":"this book has some interesting parts but for the most part it was a bore. the book is too long with many unintresting details. it's pathetic to see the main character's desperation for a man who only sees her as a whore. i usually keep all of the books i buy but im willing to give this one away for free to anyone willing to spend hours on a story that really ends up nowhere. what a useless ending it was. im not usually this pessimistic about books but thats how much i dislike this one!"},{"Title":"Forever Amber (The Greates Historical Novels)","review":"**don't read this unless you have already read the book**I thought it was a well wrote book, however I loved and hated Amber. I loved Bruce till he married someone else. After the plague I thought that was it they would finally get together, but he left her again. She made so many mistakes, if she only had gone back to where she was raised and at least talked to them. Geez, I was just constantly hoping the whole book she would, which never happened. I guess it is always good to have a book in there that the ending is not what you want. But it is so heart breaking when they don't. It was definatley a classic, but not one of my favorites, my favorite will always be the Liz Curtis Higgs series Thorn in my heart. However Through the glass darkly was a lot like this book, it was also good."},{"Title":"Forever Amber (The Greates Historical Novels)","review":"Forever Amber was a book that I became so engrossed in. I fell in love with Amber's personality and love for Bruce. Although the author used explicit details, I found the ending to be a great dissapointment. The book simply ended leaving the reader unfullfilled. (At least in my circumstance.) With how much love Amber had for Bruce, and for how well the book was written I felt it left me angry with the outcome."},{"Title":"Forever Amber (The Greates Historical Novels)","review":"I loved all the descriptions, details, and one-of-a-kind situations, but couldn't get over how annoying Amber was. Ugh!"},{"Title":"Forever Amber (The Greates Historical Novels)","review":"Forever Amber was a complete disappointment! The book was interesting and the history intriguing, but I was utterly thwarted by the absolute lack of character development. The author never explains or alludes to the reason Bruce won't marry Amber. The book lacks a climatic ending. What happened to Amber's family, her father? She never finds out about her mother? These questions were never answered! I was so frustrated!!! I also got bored with the repetitive story...it was so long one would expect Winsor to answer these unanswered questions. She simply did not complete the story and I was left feeling relieved that it was finely over and aggravated with the crappy ending."},{"Title":"Forever Amber (The Greates Historical Novels)","review":"Forever Amber may be historically accurate, yet it is not a satisfying novel. Winsor has an elegant writing technique and conveys her words well, but, at times, I have asked myself &quot;Why didn't she end here?&quot;The entire novel would have been classical if a few of Amber's husband's were deleted and her escapades overlooked. But, instead, reality fades away into an absurd amount of &quot;fluff&quot; and unreal situations.Overall, I enjoyed the novel for I wanted something just to read. Yet, the familiar sense of satisfaction that envelopes me after reading a wonderful novel had slipped from my grasp after reading this selection.I shall recomend this book only if one has time on their hands and desires a book that will merely be for idle reading."},{"Title":"Forever Amber (The Greates Historical Novels)","review":"I had fun reading it but I couldn't bring myself to like an empty headed gold digger heroine.
