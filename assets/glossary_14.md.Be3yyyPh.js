But in my many years of reading, it is plainly the most boring book I have ever read. That list of boring books includes many of the so-called classics we were forced to read in grade school. I kept trying. I got three-fourths of the way through when I gave up. The footnotes did not bother me too much, I have seen that happen in some very good textbooks and classics. It was just that nothing much happened. There would be something happened and some 100 pages of nothing much. Just a lot of \\"explanatory\\" text. I am sorry, because I wanted it to be good. Even the characters were boring. Mr. Strange was somewhat interesting, but that did not help much. As far as I am concerned, it could have been half as long, and been a much better book. If you enjoy long expositions of society and life and how magic is not around, then you will enjoy the book. Otherwise, skip it."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"I picked up this book because it won the Hugo award, but it was boring, boring, boring!I gave up after chapter seven, the story goes nowhere very fast.The only thing that I found interesting about this book was that is actually sounded as if it had been written in 1808. It reminded me of The House of Mirth.Update - I thought that I would give this book a little more time to grow on me. I am now at Chapter 31, and it is still as boring as ever, if not more so! The Harry Potter of adults my eye.Another update - after investing so much time in this book I thought that I might as well finish it. It ends as it begins, meandering along a road of pretty prose with no real end in sight.Apparently we are being set up for a sequel.If you like Dickens, read Dickens, and if you like Melville, read Melville, but don't call this a classic just because of the lovely way it is written."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"After all the 'hype' of this successful 'first novel' in England, I couldn't wait to get it. Ms. Clarke took ten years to research the early history of England and the magic they used, uses a lot of detail and long footnotes. It just had to be good -- too good to put down, right?I found it to be along the lines of Harry Potter only for adults. This involved \\"masterpiece\\" is about two magicians in 1806 seeking the wisdom and abilities of the Raven King, purportedly taken by fairies as a child and grew up to become King of England & Fairie in the twelfth century. He was considered to be the forebearer of English magic.Too good to be true, I soon learned as I tried to plow through all the non-magic inessential mismash to find the truly magical. First, two non-practicing magicians seek out one whose reputation had become known, a Mr. Gilbert Norrell, at Hurtfew Abbey, 14 miles from York, where a band of old gentlemen met only to discuss (but not practice) magic.Mr. Norell has an extensive library filled with the ancient magic manuals, but his discussion group of elderly men are only interested in reading and talking about magic, that is, until young Jonathan Strange arrives on Norvell's doorstep. Because of his enthusiasm at the sight of all the out-of-print writings of scholars of long ago, Jonathan persuades Mr. Norrell to teach him the old practices; as a consequence, they became involved in the wars, using supernatural skills summoning ghost ships and such.She tells good stories unknown to Americans, but from English lore. In Camelot, we discovered Merlin as Arthur re-lived his strange childhood through memories of the magic. In eleven years (1806-1817), much confusion and misconceptions occur between these partners in crime, as illustrated at intervals throughout the long, wordy history of English wars and fairy intervention. I counted twenty-four shadowly sketches, few and far between which added a slight diversion, but nothing else.It took Rowling five volumes and movies to get Harry Potter to his potential. Ms. Clarke spent ten years and only one very wordy volume to show the potential of Jonathan Strange with Mr. Norrell's direction to learn what he could do.This has been accepted as a 'piece of wonder' in Britain, but I really doubt its popularity in the States. Only to the faithful who read all five Potter novels would some of this make sense. Had she divided this tome into five books to let the gory parts subside in between, it might be palpable. The difference is that Harry Potter was supposedly written for children but even educated adults could enjoy the simplicity, this book of adult magic makes our Civil War seem like child's play.It was just not my \\"cup of tea.\\""},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"It's hard to fathom why so many of you love this book, to say nothing of the inference that A.S. Byatt would appreciate it. I gave up around page 200, as this was too simple a work, and too tiresome for further perusal. Having just finished a couple of really well written novels, I can also say that there was nothing special about the author's prose whatever...Who is reviewing this work-fans of Harry Potter? Finally, if you want to read an intelligent, throw-back kind of novel with real drama, well drawn characters and a truly epic feel, pick up Palliser's \\"The Quincunx\\". Light satire and pale imitations of Jane Austen do not a classic make."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"I read quite a bit. I'm always looking for an original idea or clever twist in the pursuit of entertaining fiction. I tried this book based on a few reviews I read. I also thought the premise held promise and (shame on me) what a nice cover.Of course, this book had no original ideas or clever twists. The prose is long winded. The author uses either archaic spellings of English words or just makes them up as she sees fit. This makes the read that much more difficult with little or no value to the reader. For instance, connexion is used instead of connection. The author make copious use of footnotes. Often running for pages at a time. I couldn't decide if she was trying to mimic a style akin to corporate reporting or a highly technical research paper no one will ever read. So here's my summary:Boring storyOverly complex sentence structure to confuse the reader.Bizarre use of footnotesNo emotional attachment to any of her characters.Stay away. I'd like my money back."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"I was rather intimidated by this audiobook, which comes on 26 CDs. It was slow to start, but it intrigued me, so I kept going. I'm glad I did, though I didn't feel like the ending finally wrapped up as much as it should: I had hoped it would explain more about how things came to be as they were at the beginning. Regardless, I enjoyed its rather rambling story with its engaging characters, moments of laugh-out-loud humor, fanciful footnotes of magical history, and magical descriptions of magic. And the narrator did an excellent job of bringing it all to life, with distinctive voices for each major character."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"I can think of other books I've read that were more thought-provoking, more multilayered, more \\"important\\". But I'm hard pressed to think of any that were more enjoyable. \\"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell\\" is 800 pages of sheer delight.Susanna Clarke spins an enormous tale of magicians, fairies, and Napoleanic battles and weaves them together like one big wonderful magic spell. Strange and Norrell are magnificient characters, vivid and three-dimensional: two men who need each other badly, even when there's no one else in the world they'd prefer to avoid more. There are wonderful discoveries to be had and fascinating inferences to be mad (such as the true, unspoken identity of \\"the Raven King\\").But what's most surprising about the book is how realistically (or at least reasonably) it depicts magic. You can't help thinking that if magic really existed, this is very much the history it might have. Even the footnotes provide entertainment, sometimes melding ironically with the text that follows, as if the characters were reading the footnotes right along with us.In terms of glee and sheer scope, I'm reminded of Pynchon's \\"Mason & Dixon\\". But this book is much more fun and, not incidentally, a lot less work. I cannot recommend it highly enough."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"Both my husband and I were captivated by this story! We listened to it on audio CD, which for me, made all of the footnotes easier to bear. (I don't know if I could deal with jumping back in forth between the footnotes and the story in the book version) We loved the story and it kept our interest to the very end."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"I used to say that no book should be longer then 300 pages, and that even a good 500 hundred pages book can turn into a great one in the hands of the right editor. However this book changed my mind, i wouldn't change a word or leave a chapter out of it, even though it is very long.It felt at time that this book was written especially for me, since it combined 3 genres I love - Jane Austin period novel, fantasy that's involves a twisted version of this world, like Phillip Pullman's \\"his dark material\\" or harry potter and books about magic, like \\"the history of magic\\" by Alihpas Levy or \\"the book or black magic\\" by Edward White (in parts of it it was even a book of magic, but you'll have to read the first few chapters to know what the difference is between books of magic and books about magic).I loved the pace of it, the way the plot very slowly develops over time, the way that though most of the character aren't very likable and all have many faults, you do get very attached through reading, Sussana clarke sense of humor and wit made me burst in laughter in very strange public places and i got very observed in reading.My test of a good book's what left with me after the plot's done, and I think this book showed me a few very interesting point concerning being a magician, being honest and finding a person's original way through life and his \\\\ her art.This addition's very beautiful it's probably one of the most handsome books i own, the design's minimalist and pretty, the paper's really superb and the uneven pages cut's amazing, however since i read mostly on the bus, it was quite a load to carry for a month and a half and nothing else fits in my backpack. However, it was so worth it!"},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"It's London at the turn of the 19th century. Governement ministers in powdered wigs argue about how best to defeat Napoleon on the continent. London socialites shop for the latest fashions and fill the city with whispered gossip. Servents polish silver and stay in the kitchen. The roads are muddy, and the countryside is perpetually wet, cold, and filled with dark and twisting trees. Enter Mr. Norrell, a fuddy-duddy extraordinaire who, it seems, is a capable \\"practicing,\\" and not just \\"theoretical\\" magician. Along with his dodgy servant Childermass, he seeks fame in London as a \\"professional\\" magician, something not seen in England in many hundreds of years. He soon encounters Jonathan Strange, a gentleman whose lack of knowledge about magic is surpassed only by both his natural talent for it and his obsession to rediscover the dangerous English magic of the great Raven King of the past.With this set-up, Susanna Clarke has written a unique work of fiction. As noted in the title of my review, it is 1/4 fantasy and 3/4 Jane Austen, a fact which might surprise some readers looking for a more traditional work of fantasy. The practice of magic is merely the backdrop for the story, not its essence. Rather, dry humor is the order of the day, and Clarke has an ear for it. A great example is when Strange confronts a dislikable social outcast in a tense scene, threatens to transform him by magic, and then yells \\"Abracadabra!\\" and falls down laughing as the man shrieks in fear from this phony \\"magic.\\" Very funny. This was the main pleasure of the book for me: a story concerning magic that read like a witty upstairs-downstairs Victorian comedy of manners. The characters (and there are a lot of them), are fully fleshed-out (as much as a Victorian can be fleshed-out), and their actions are not undertaken to serve the plot. Rather, they act like they, as characters, would act, and this is very gratifying. The relationship between Norrell and Strange, which obviously drives the narrative, is particularly well done.That said, the book is long, and sometimes felt needlessly so to me. I was not always compelled to read it. There are a lot of interesting narrative lines which do not seem to lead anywhere, such as the shopkeeper in love with Stephen Black (a prominent character). There were a few chapters of this story, and then \\"poof,\\" like magic it was gone. Further, while the many invented footnotes are a nice touch, they are sometimes a bit tedious and I'm not sure its necessary to insert multi-page footnotes just for atmosphere.In sum, however, Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell is a fine book and I thoroughly enjoyed it. It is written in a unique and fascinating voice, inhabits a fully-detailed world, and tells a great story. Not five-star worthy, but definately a solid four-star effort that will repay your time in reading it."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"To compare this book to the Harry Potter books does it a disservice. Quite simply, this book is the best fantasy novel since Tolkien.The characters are deep, complex, and believable. But despite the fact that the book is character-driven, there is a sense all the way through the book that they are careening towards some unavoidable fate.The author uses \\"fake\\" footnotes to give a sense of verisimilitude. In this respect, it is very similar to something by Borges (who also used this literary device).She adeptly weaves her characters into early nineteenth century English history.By the time I hit the last 200 pages I could not put the book down."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"It was interesting reading the reviews for this book to discover the divergence of opinion. I personally loved this book! It captured my interest from beginning to end. I thought it was an engaging story which captured the human condition with well developed characters, and well-researched historical references woven in. I do agree that the footnotes become tedious, and are not always relevant to the story line; however they are not intended to be. As supplemental information, they did a good job of drawing me into the illusion of an alternative history.You don't have to be a fan of the mystical to enjoy this book, just a fan of a good story.To be fair, this is a long - and large - book - definitely not for the plane."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"A previous review stated that it takes some patience to read Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell. I have to agree with that individual. The book starts off rather slow. The author takes her time before she gets into the real thick of things in the plot. She wants the reader to be comfortable with the alternate version of England that she has created in her fictional world. But after one is comfortable with the world, things really start to get interesting. Byt the end of the novel I was practically eating up the chapters. I definitely recommend this novel!"},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"Reading JS/MN is an investment, and one that pays you back fivefold. It's a carefully paced book, not your typical page-turner. Each scene is beautifully crafted and her prose is a delight, but what I love best about this book is how what seems silly and comic becomes slowly more deep and complex. Both Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell are changed by their adventures in ways that will feel real, even in a fanciful landscape. And Clarke is absolutely brilliant at showing you what's coming in ways you don't understand until it arrives.I have one complaint: the book is too short. Yes, I know that those who don't like it say it's too long and slow, but once you're in it, you won't want it to end. Like Moby Dick, the slow build is one that refuses to let you go. If you're an adult who liked Harry Potter, you will want to kiss Susanna Clarke's feet for capturing the magic in an even more mature form. If (like me) you wanted to like Harry Potter but found it too emotionally flat, you'll be even happier."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell is a wonderfully crafted novel. Clarke creates a magical history in England and deliciously, perfectly carries out its every aspect.

She brilliantly intertwines Strange and Norrell into the early 1800s, and makes it flawless. As for the excessive use of footnotes - I found them very entertaining and enjoyable to read . . .

I have read many fantasy books of quality over my 52 years, as well as a lot of pure junk, and this was a book I found to be nothing short of pretentious the more I read it. Those footnotes are just plain ridiculous and ANNOYING, as they serve no real purpose. The attempts to sound Dickensian do not work and the premise is bogus, especially in a world going through horrible battles with certainly NO magic in them at all!

Much better than the Bible, Talmud or Koran."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"I can remember few novels reviewed with such discrepancy as this one. Most books tend to cluster around a certain star rating with a few disenting outliers. This book seems to get equal 1 star and 5 star reviews on several sites and paint all ratings inbetween. I feel the truth lies in the middle. The novel is not great and groundbreaking, nor is it a terrible piece of fiction. About half of the reviewers who give this work 1 star state they did not read the entire novel. I find such reviews worthless. Half a movie or half a painting is as inadequate a review as half a book.This novel is not typical modern fantasy. It is not action packed or fast paced. It is not shocking in its violence. A reader who's palate is completely satisfied by orcs and elves fighting their way across a strange landscape will be bored here. If you require the harsh worlds of Glenn Cook or George Martin to be engaged, you will find yourself wandering in this landscape. This novel is subtle and well written. The prose and settings captures the imagination.That being said the book is long and there were substantial portions of the story where I had no feel for where the book was going. I dont require swordfights and damsels in distress to keep my attention, but this novel frequently lacked enough conflict and strain to keep me interested. I have heard this novel compared to Dickens. Perhaps the setting and some of the prose are similar, but one chapter of Dickens contains more engagement in the story than this entire novel. By the end of the novel, I had only minimal interest in the fates of Jonathan Strange and Mr Norell. After 782 pages of characterization, I felt I should have cared more. I recognize and appreciate the moral ambiguity of the two protagonists. I dont require black and white characters to cheer for them. But it is far easier to care for Martin's Tyrion Lannister or Abercombie's Glotka, with all their disgusting and impish ways, than it is for either of these characters.In the end, this novel is very different from typical fantasy. Different does not equal genius or groudbreaking. Different does not equal boring drivel either. The refreshment of seeing a new story arch in a regonizable world was tempered with the lack of engagement in the story and characters.I think its worth reading for fantasy enthusiasts with a broad palate looking for something new and fans of Dickensonian era historical fiction."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell is a gem of a book, written in the style of Victorian fiction but with modern sensibilities and literary references. Ostensibly the story of Mr. Norrell, the first practicing magician to emerge in centuries, and his apprentice/rival, the magical prodigy Jonathan Strange. Their story spans the book from their first meeting to their friendship, rivarly and beyond. Napoleonic Warfare and English politics are both equally explored.However, the real gem of the book is its extensive footnotes. Scattered liberally throughout the book, these notes make references to the magical history of England, as well as foreshadowing and commenting upon the events of the story. Some of the footnotes refer to the future of the characters long after the story ends, and others make references to the various disputes among historians on the accuracy of the story of Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell.The book moves slowly, spending a large amount of time creating a compelling world at the expense of the story, but it picks up quite a head of steam by the last third. It is full of well drawn characters who stick with you long after the book is over, making one wish to continue the friendship one feels with such colorful people as Childermass or the gentleman with the Thisledown hair.While the style might seem overly arch in imitating Victorian prose, Clarke does occasionally let herself have some leeway and when she does she proves that she has a real gift for poetic prose. Hopefully she finds a way to tap the magic again without simply drawing from the same well."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell is founded on the same principle as the Harry Potter series - magic really exists, it is simply hidden from the experiences of the normal person. There is little else that is similar in tone or style between this book and the Potter series (except that both are thoroughly English in nature). Instead, the book is most like Jane Austin in both content and tone - it is sometimes very funny, is firmly rooted in the stratified English social structure, and its plot is simply a skeleton upon which to build a dense and enjoyable world. We grow to love the characters and take an almost personal stake in their trials and tribulations.The plot: Mr. Norrell is the first person in 400 years to successfully perform a magic spell. Unfortunately, he is bookish and extremely jealous; for example, he buys every copy of every magical book written in English and hoards them to himself. Along comes the prodigy Jonathan Strange, who becomes the second practicing magician. Instead of trying to destroy him like all his previous rivals, Mr. Norrell actually takes him under his wing to teach him magic. The collaboration is extremely beneficial for England and for the two magicians. Strange accompanies Wellington to Spain and later Waterloo to fight Napoleon. Norrell sets up a magic coastal zone into which no enemy ships can pass (and moderates the weather within it for English ships). But the two have a falling out - used to the independence granted him by Wellington, Strange chafes at what he sees as artificial restraints put on him by Norrell. The central issue: the magical world of Faerie and its magical Fairy inhabitants. Strange wants to call forth Fairy servants and helpers like the old Magicians of England. Norrell knows they cannot be trusted (based on a personal experience that he must keep hidden from the world).To give any more of the plot away would be a disservice to the book (besides what I've said already covers about 500 pages of this 1000-page paperback edition). Besides, the plot is not the point. Instead we are treated to a rich and colourful world of alternate-Napoleonic Europe. Real characters are seamlessly interwoven into the story, including the Duke of Wellington, King George III, and the poet Byron. We have people of low birth, servants, free gentlemen, and nobility all trapped by their training and upbringings. Ultimately, this is the genius of Clarke's novel - everyone acts exactly as they should, and the trials suffered by the main characters are exactly what they deserve because of their particular personal foibles. Shakespeare himself would be pleased, no doubt.It is not a fast-reading book. It is not an action-packed book. Neither is the Lord of the Rings series, but that hasn't stopped millions from reading it, nor should it stop you from reading Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell. It is a fun and well-crafted book from beginning to end."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"I haven't read a book in a long time that was as delightfully original as this one. Magic isn't just waving a wand and crying out some magic words. It is at times as fresh and beautiful like an English garden, such as a street in London transforming into a Faerie forest, and the little box \\"the color of Heartache,\\" and at times fascinatingly dark and macabre, like a bottomless Tower of Eternal Darkness following the magician, or the Faerie's nonchalant murders, like when he was extracting the essence of a kiss from women's lips.The author also added depth to the background of the story with all her footnotes which I found to be interesting.All in all a GREAT book, although it may take a bit to settle into it. For me I loved it from beginning to end. Witty and original all the way through. You might be bored because you don't enjoy the Jane Austen/Bronte Sisters style of 19th century English language, but never because the author's ideas were unoriginal."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"Some decades ago I minored in Literature because I could indulge my love of reading and actually earn credit for it.

In other words, Jane Austen vs Tolkien.So I should have known better when the major critics gushed all over this book. I confess, they suckered me with descriptions like \\"dark mythology,\\" \\"thoroughly enchanting,\\" \\"absolutely compelling,\\" \\"practical and magical,\\" and \\"rivals Tolkien.\\"This book is not absolutely compelling, and it does not rival Tolkien. It is a labor to read, which even many of its 5-star reviewers concur with. The Christian Science Monitor's description of it is most accurate: \\"...(a) historical novel, told with a dry wit that will appeal to fans of Jane Austen.\\" (The part about Jane Austen should have warned me!)So, is this a bad novel? Absolutely not. If your taste runs to Austen, Dickens, and the Bronte sisters, you will be delighted with this book--it is excellent literature. If you prefer the action, pace, and plots of today's major fantasy authors, you will be disappointed."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"It is hard to find the right words to briefly describe what this book is and who could or could not enjoy it.Regarding the storyline and main content of the book, it is a truly original piece of work. Clarke was able to blend historical facts with the notion that magic is so real and possible that magicians are considered \\"professionals\\". In Clarke's universe, magic does not bring surprises; actually it is mundane. Sometimes it works, sometimes it does not, and sometimes it works half-way and brings unexpected results. In Clarke's universe, magic is practical: it can be used in wars (to scare, confuse or create obstacles for the opponents), it can be used to improve weather conditions, and so forth. The fantasy aspect of this book is so cleverly built that it does not feel like fantasy. (I personally am not too much into fantasy - but this book made it all so believable that I never got to question anything. Everything was natural)In case you do not know yet, the book (paperback version) has 846 pages. It's a looong book. And Clarke, well, she is not Clancy (or what Clancy used to be). Which is not to say that the book is not exciting. It is. But it takes a while to get its rhythm. Clarke did a meticulous job and even took the care of putting hundreds of footnotes that allude to historical facts in this alternate history/universe that she created. She also wrote the book in what seems to me as nineteenth century english (and it's not only her vocabulary but her prose that reminds us of those times). These facts, plus her own style, in which she slowly builds the story, make the first 100 or 150 pages a little bit tedious. However, the book later accelerates its pace.There are some comparisons to Harry Potter. They're not quite correct. As I said, magic here has a different tone. And Clarke's writing style is so different from Rowling's that I never felt while reading it that it was similar.Its hard to say who could enjoy or not this work. I will put it like this: if you are a patient reader (can surf the first couple of hundred pages) and you enjoy thrillers, you will probably love this book (as many others have). You will need, however, turn aside any pre-conceptions you may have about \\"magic books\\" or \\"fantasy books\\", for this book looks like them but it's not exactly like them. If you enjoyed Dickens, your chances of enjoying it are higher.I will finish by saying my 5 star rating is an understatement. This is one of the most delicious books I've ever read. It's been a long since I read something as creative, original, funny, thrilling, or well-written book."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"The year is 1806. The British are fighting Napoleon's French army. And magic is long gone from England. The only society of magicians in York is purely theoretical and never so much as contemplated performing any magic. Then the society stumbles upon the fussy, bookish, reclusive Gilbert Norrell, who proves to them he is the only practicing magician left in England when he causes all the statues in the York Cathedral to burst into song.Propelled to fame by what Norrell considers rather modest magic, he is soon called upon to aid the British government against the French and to resurrect the deceased bride of a cabinet minister -- an act which prompts the appearance of a strange gentleman from the land of Faery who begins laying a plot for the downfall of English magic.Norrell is soon displaced from his position of notoriety by the arrival of Jonathan Strange, a young and eager upstart with a gift for practical magic. Strange and his young wife, Arabella, are beautiful, intelligent, and quickly popular in York society. Norrell takes Strange on as a pupil, hoping to control Strange's access to magical knowledge.However, the day comes when young Mr. Strange is ready to branch out as an independent magician, leading to a rivalry between Strange and Norrell that increases along with the threat from the land of Faery. Finally, when tragedy befalls Jonathan, he and Mr. Norrell must learn to set aside their differences and work together to save Britain.This book was a real first for me. It's the first time I've seen a novel with such lovely prose and delightful wit that was this badly in need of an editor! I could appreciate the idea of a satirical history of Britain, but an otherwise fun tale is bogged down in footnotes that go on for pages and a tedious amount of unnecessary detail."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"This book comes recommended from a wide variety of sources, including the infamous, \\"Everybody seems to like it, but I just couldn't get into it.\\" (Because I'm a difficult person, those kinds of anti-recommendations are sometimes the most effective; it's as though I have to prove that I can get it. That's why I gave Twilight a try. Couldn't get into it.\\") It's a lengthy tome, to be sure, and full of the all the period nuances one could hope for, meaning loads and loads of people sitting around talking and expressing polite disdain and doing nothing. But it's also probably one of the most original (if retrospectively obvious - you have to love that) and tangible fantasy/alternate history books I've ever read. \\"Tangible\\" probably isn't the right word, but there's real, worldly substance in a Jane Austen novel, and this story has the same kind of flesh one can sink their teeth into. (Oh, go on with you, people who will argue that Jane Austen portrays a completely unrealistic, white-washed British society that sweeps aside all of the injustices and violence and cruelty inherent in the period. Just give me a little slack.)Mr. Norrell and Mr. Strange are magicians, and perhaps more importantly, English magicians (what other kind of magic is there?) reviving magic after a very long drought in which magic has become largely theoretical. The renaissance of magic starts rather slowly, as one might expect (in fact, it starts even slower than one might expect, since the first of the new breed of practical magicians is the jealous sort), but picks up steam until it is barreling toward a conflict of monumental scale, and the book is essentially the same way.What works: If you give it enough time, almost everything works. This book is the \\"but SHE did it\\" object of fingerpointing from many future fledgling authors, I'd expect. Start with a bang, in media res, as everyone says you must? Not so much here. Must every sentence characterize or lend to the plot? No - there are many wandering divergences that amount to painting individual leaves on the trees in the background of a painting. One of the first major characters we recommend doesn't seem to have a stated desire (Mr. Secundus, for those following along in the book), and yet he's a perfectly acceptable blank slate character to do the things that need to be done to move the story along where it needs to go. He's accommodating that way. The magic that is done is unexpected and momentous, much more fairy tale than dungeons and dragons. There is no system. The characters have all of the complexity one would expect of a person in a good novel - that is to say, their unrealistically focused nature is applied to the plot in thorough, surprising ways. (I suppose that is rather vague, but I'd hate to spoil the plot.) Needless to say, there are fairies and enchantments and towns cast in Perpetual Darkness, when they aren't being relocated here and there on the map to frustrate Napoleon.What doesn't: It's dreadfully, despairingly long. When one is just beginning and the boulder of the novel is barely shifting, just beginning to roll, it's easy to see that there's still 98% of the novel to go and wonder if anything is ever going to happen. When one decides to go another 10 or 15 pages or so and then sees that they're STILL at 98% and STILL nothing has happened, there might be a bit of teeth-gnashing and hair-pulling, if one were the ashes and sackcloth type. But the boulder does roll, and it does pick up momentum, and soon enough it is crashing along at a wonderful rate and one just can't put it down, even when there are still thirty chapters to go. Also, as delightful as it is that there is no \\"magic system\\", magic still does seem extremely vague for the first two-thirds of the book.The Takeaway: If you read this, be willing to devote some time to it. Not just a weekend, but a month. Have another book to read at the same time, so you can alternate until Norrell and Strange begin to pick up steam. (Really, until Norrell begins to pick up steam. Strange is all steam from just about as soon as he appears.)"},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"This is a great book. Unfortunately the Kindle file does not live up to it.The Kindle file is full of missing letters (for instance, \\"a ery unfriendly letter,\\" instead of \\"very\\") and leftover hyphens from where words were broken across lines in the print edition. It suggests it was insufficiently proofed by the publisher, which is a shame.(Also, while the footnotes are hyperlinked _from_ the body of the text, they are not hyperlinked _back_ to the body of the text, which is an inconvenience if you are browsing.)"},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"I started out being completely delighted and enchanted by Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell. Author Susanna Clarke has perfected a narrative voice that is thoroughly 19th century yet has a modern dry sense of humor. Likewise, her use of copious footnotes to give the reader background on magical history (making the book feel more like a historical novel than a work of fiction) are initially charming. After several hundred pages, however, things start to drag. The essential plot line concerns Mr. Norrell, a fearful, secretive magician who wants to return magic to England but be its only magician. He makes his name by restoring the beautiful young bride of Sir Walter Poole to life. However, no one knows that he has done so by enlisting the assistance of a fairy, known as the gentleman with thistle down hair or just \\"the gentleman,\\" who takes his payment for aiding Norrel by enchanting the Lady Poole and essentially keeping her a slave in the balls he throws every night in Faerie land.Enter Jonathan Strange, a young man who, rather than choosing magic, has had magic thrust upon. He becomes Norrell's pupil and, as is only fitting, soon surpasses his master. There are a number of intertwining story lines and characters, but the main thrust is the the rivalry between the two magicians and the increasingly malicious doings of the gentleman with thistle down hair. I found that the pace picked up in the last two hundred or so pages, when the plot becomes driven by higher stakes. Clarke and her editor should have stepped back and done some judicious cutting of the text. They could have done so without doing damage to the narrative voice or the plot, and it would have prevented more than one reader from wanting the throw the book across the room on occasion.Clarke is a fabulous writer just, apparently, not so fabulous a re-writer/editor. This is a book that definitely requires some patience. The pay-off was not entirely satisfying to this reader, hence four stars instead of five."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"While telling the tale of two magicians with differing and conflicting personalities, their supporters and detractors, Susanna Clark weaves a story of admiration, animosity and ultimately, friendship. Stylistically reminiscent of early 18th century literature, Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell weaves the History of English Magic (lots of incredible footnotes) with magical acts that will leave you surprised, dismayed and more than once, holding your breath."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"Unlike most fantasy stories that create a separate magical universe, this story uses the real world--England in the early 19th century--as its setting. The \\"history\\" of English magic and the real history of England are weaved together so constantly and seamlessly that the reader begins to think that magic is real and an actual part of England's history. This is Clarke's triumph, made even more delightful through a graceful writing style.Unfortunately, the story itself is tedious and ultimately disappointing. Clarke narrates one promising episode after another, but too often these disparate scenes are neither elaborated nor brought together. The reader is left wondering why entire chapters are even in the book. Perhaps Clarke is intending to undermine any notion of providence (the accidents of life coming together to create a deeper meaning), or perhaps Clarke doesn't know how to pull together the various threads of her story.The ending is particularly unsatisfying. The images become so bizarre that the seamless garment of magic and history is torn. The ending is neither comedy nor tragedy, but an unresolved dilemma begging for a sequel. But who wants to read a sequel to a book that was too long to begin with?"},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"Very well written book... but awfully long. The 200 pages in the middle could be lost - without any damage to the quality of the book.It took me a while, but I enjoyed my reading. I just had to realize that this entire publishing buzz about \\"Harry Potter for adults\\" is a buzz - and no more than that. This is not a page turner, and never supposed to be. For me, this is something that Dickens would have written, if he had been inclined to write a fantasy book.(Not that I ever had patience for Dickens :-)So, enjoy the book - if you have enough patience, sense of humor and love for both historical fiction and fantasy. Well, it will also help if you have something action-packed on your bookshelf, for the times, when you actually have to put the book down and get some break from its density and complexity."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"Not my typical read - I ventured forth with an open mind because I like to vary my reading. I admit, it was a struggle at first to get into the writing style - very different from the usual \\"novels\\" America reads. However, I kept plodding along. Turns out it is an enjoyable read if you're willing to just enjoy it. The \\"footnotes\\" are a big surprise. As you're reading the first few chapters, you're saying to yourself - why the footnotes? But, they end up filling in gaps that aren't explained in the story itself (interesting). All in all, once I was into it, I kept going back - just had to see how it ended. It was like eating a box of chocolates - some you really like, some you just eat because they're in your mouth and so you might as well chew!If you want to a read that is really \\"out of the ordinary,\\" this is it."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"A wonderful read, part historical novel, part gothic fantasy, part society novel, Strange and Norrel proved an enaging read. Clarke has a delicious style with a voice that is both engaging and haunting. She creates a compelling and convincing world of faerie and magic, conveyed through a wealth of notes that gives the book a grounded and rich depth. While reading I recalled Eco's Foucault's Pendulum, but Clarke's style is lighter, more playful, yet just as eerily dark at times. I was also reminded of the now lost collection of stories, The Kingdoms of Elfin, by Sylvia Townsend Warner. I have not seen the world of Faerie so hauntingly evoked since I dipped into Warner's little gem of a book.I measure a book's impact by the emptiness left when I turn the last page...a page I keep revisiting and rereading...and I find myself glancing sidelong into mirrors, searching for distorted reflections of a world lost and so thoroughly inhabited over the past two weeks.I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"This wonderfully written story is a throwback to the times when people wanted a book to take forever to read. Before there was TV or radio, people read for entertainment-- to learn about the world, to become engrossed in a story, for distraction, etc. Susanna Clarke has absorbed that mindset and written a meandering, detailed, intriguing, well researched, and at times quite amusing story that is full of interesting characters who seem at home in their time and place. Although magic is real in this story, it is much closer to Dickens than to Tolkien. The omniscient narrator addresses the reader directly but never abruptly. For example, the narrator begins the introduction to Jonathan Strange with the account of his parents' marriage; it takes an entire chapter before we even see Jonathan Strange. If you have a problem with slow starts, I recommend the CD version, as the actor who reads the story does a great job of giving each character a distinct voice and the funny bits sound funnier with a British accent."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"GOD! Just because it has magicians in it don't expect it to be Harry Potter. It wasn't written under the intent to compete with Harry Potter and to put it in the same genre is ridiculous. Dicken's Oliver Twist and the comic strip Little Orphan Annie are both about orphans. Should we lump them in the same literary category?If you enjoy a well written, engaging novel that HAPPENS to be about English magician, then try this book. If you are looking for the next Harry Potter, try Eragon or some other mass-appeal novel."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"Susannah Clarke's sly, swirling, over-the-top romantic fantasy begins in Austen country and ends up somewhere east of Mordor.\\"Strange and Norrell\\" is the author's first novel, and it's remarkably self-assured. It gets progressively darker as the two duelling magic-makers of the title make statues talk, cultivate politicians and the Duke of Wellington himself, aid Britain in the war against Napoleon, attempt to save distressed damsels, encounter some problems with ravens, and match wits with a malicious fairy king.Ms. Clarke, apparently had a plan from which she seems not to have deviated from at all, and unlike so many authors on their maiden voyage, she keeps your attention focused on the plot, character, and action--not on authorial self-advertisements.The book is slyly witty, often scary, and never less than exuberant. Ms. Clarke might be the last romantic left in the room, but if she is, it doesn't appear she wants to turn out the lights anytime soon."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"This is a fun read with a whimsical plot. It reads like a 19th century novel with a magical twist. The characters are well drawn and compelling, and an air of mystery keeps the novel suspenseful. Unfortunately, the plot meanders a bit, but Clarke's brilliant writing keeps you intrigued. However, near the end the pace quickens and as in many novels as the mystery is solved the thrill of the search unravels leaving me not as engaged as I was through the rest of the novel. It seemed things were wrapped up too quickly and the solutions were unsatisfying after the build up. So read this novel. But read it for the world that Clarke weaves with flesh and blood characters in a dark 19th Century England, not for the fully realized plot line."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"This is the finest piece of fantasy that I have read excluding only the works of the great J.R.R. Tolkien. Susanna Clarke has done something extraordinary here that is bound to classify this text forever in the pantheon of fantasy literature. I actually found myself combing my volumes on British mythology and folklore in the attempt to discover what the origins of the \\"faerie\\" were, considering their role in this book. What I found was that Clarke had done her home work. In the modern day, we tend to think of faeries as little jovial creatures dressed in flower petals - their origins are far more sinister. This book was such a pleasure to read, and now we are guaranteed a sequel and a movie! Life is good. The book is dense - it even has foot notes, which must be read if it is to be understood.This is a book that leaves the reader longing for more Norrell, more Strange, and certainly more Raven King. They do not get much better than this!!!"},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"Whoever suggested skimming the footnotes is a bowdlerizer. Most of the footnotes are marvelous stories that stand on their own. This is not Tolkien or Rowling. This sometimes very funny and sometimes very sad book, the world Susanna Clarke creates, is utterly original, a gorgeous and thrilling mix of magic and history. Very highly recommended."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"I wish there were different categories for the overall rankings of books here, because I would give this book several fives. The author has created a world of magic that seems real and almost scholarly. It is set early in the 1800's in England and the characters are so believable and interwoven with real historical figures, that you almost believe you are reading actual history. I would give Susanna Clarke a five for creating this amazingly intricate and believable story we enjoy with dozens of little footnotes and sub-stories that make the overall story very believable and real. In fact the magic is so real you almost have to adjust your thinking after living in this world for a while, to realize it is just fiction.The magic and the story isn't like anything else I've read. I'd never compare it to \\"Lord of the Rings\\" or \\"Harry Potter.\\" This world is more like our regular world but with subtle magic thrown in here and there. And as the story progresses, we are exposed to a greater hidden world of magic and the history of magic in England starts to take shape and we realize that there are amazing powers and worlds that can be tapped by our main characters. Now that these worlds have been opened, they need to be explored and we need to more and more information. Our taste buds are prepared now for the spicy, exciting stuff.It took me a couple of weeks to read the book and I'm a pretty fast and intense reader. There were times when I got tears in my eyes, times when the story dragged a little bit, but all and all, I think it is well worth the effort. That said, I understand that some people who are very plot driven and looking for a thrill every chapter, won't do well reading this book. There are many insightful and fun quips here and there that kept me amused and sometimes amazed. And don't think you can skip the footnotes. There are little themes and information in the notes that reveal important future events and possibilities.I do have to admit that I'm a little bothered when I read a book of this length, when the book doesn't quite get finished by the end. Anne Rice was particularly guilty of this. There are solutions to the most important questions, but there is a lot left hanging. I hope the next book doesn't take ten more years to write. I am looking forward to it and I'll certainly buy it.So, if you're looking for a good, long read (there are pictures here and there, so that helps) with amazing characters, a fun view of personality traits and the British sense of humor and wit, tackle this book. If you're more of a \\"Da Vinci Code\\" kind of reader, I'd say it may not be for you.Good job, Susanna. I'll be watching for the next installment and I hope it is titled, \\"The Raven King.\\" I'm like Jonathan. I need to know a lot more about him."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"Others have likened the author's style to Dickens, which was the comparison that sprang to mind for me as well. Closing the back cover on certain Dickens novels is like saying goodbye to loved friends. Finding a cotemporary author who displays such love and respect for language and character, with such wit and charm was delightful. This is anglophile paradise. I tore through the book on a binge of pleasure.Odd, improbably named characters swirl through each others lives, their numbers swell, their threads lost,then, sudddenly reappear to turn the plot just so.It is not a perfect work, and portions found me anxious for a return to pacing of chapters past. By the end of the book, I felt perhaps the author was exhausted by the effort of her own brilliance. It is a negligable rest, probably only detectable by it's juxtiposition to the lightening bolts of language it follows. This unique subject and story, which is wholly unlike anything I have read, is written in so convincing a style, you'll question your reckoning of history.Furthermore, no format should allow footnote refrence to a back section ever again, after this book. The footnotes are copious and while one could read on past them (sometimes having to turn multiple pages to do so), they are a delight.I plan to read it anew, just to find if phrases like 'malevolent pedagogy' still force me to laugh aloud, and still reverberate in the mind as when first struck."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"This book is beautiful to read. Many others authors have forgotten how to write something that is wonderful to read on each and every page. You still want to read further and find out what happens, but each single page is enjoyable and great to read. The plot is subtle and consuming. I found this a nice change to books that are so driven to a climax, that creating ambience and good, strong characters is often overlooked. I would suggest this book to anyone who loves to read, for the sake of reading itself. You will find this book enjoyable and surprising. I loved the book and I felt a twinge of sadness when I finished, because I had to say goodbye to the world the book the author had created."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"I'm about 350 pages into the book and I must say the story line is very interesting. I don't know much about 18th century England, or magic in England, but I like the way the author tells this story and how each character has a role to play. I'ts like a spider web and everything is connected to each other. I think the best way to describe it is clever writing in the Queen's English. For some reason I have a lot of difficulty reading books in the Queen's English, but this book seems like an easy read so far. When I saw it in the store I was curious as to why this book was 1000+ pages, but as some other people wrote, the story takes its time, but the good thing is that the chapters are short and this is a book you can put down and come back to i.e. digest a little at a time of you are not a power reader like me. It's a good commuter book and if you read carefully you will become engrossed with the characters and the charcoal sketches are very effective in putting a face with the characters on the pages. I would compare Ms. Clarke to Elizabeth George in story development and writing style. So if you have some time to kill and you like to concentrate on one good book at a time like me, you might want to get this one. If you like to take your time, this book is worth the purchase."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"I loved this book. It's a little long and a bit too dry in places, but it is an overall very entertaining and fun read. If you enjoy dry humor and historic novels you will enjoy this novel. Don't let the size intimidate you."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"First, what some might consider bad: this novel has a languid pace, is surprisingly quaint, and only kicks into high-gear toward the end.The good news is that the story is enthralling, and although it might not reach a lofty height, it's very much worth your time.The font size in the mass paperback is wholly inadequate, so I suggest that you avoid it all costs; obtain one of the other versions."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"This book is wonderful! I didn't find it boring, even though it was extremely long. The characters and descriptions were excellent, definitely worth the read. I loved it! If you love long, descriptive books, then you should read this one. If you don't enjoy reading long books, then I wouldn't bother. But this book was intelligent, funny, and magical. I reccomend this book to anyone who enjoys spending time reading."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"The first 150 pages of Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell irritated me immensely. First of all, it was the second book within the last month that I have read which used faux academic footnotes for digressions and parentheticals. Second of all, the concept was so determinedly and adorably British that I felt like it was kind of British Disney theme-park. Finally, it was wordy as heck. The initial reading experience was like watching paint dry-- albeit bright and showy paint.Oh gosh, I thought. I am never going to make it through this book.But somehow, the book snuck up on me. Before I knew it, I was one third of the way through. I ignored my usual podcasts on the train and kept reading after I arrived at home. One day I found myself purposely not going into the office so I could just read for three more minutes.Why so catchy? I have no clue. In the end, it is simply immensely likable.Clarke delivers a heady and smooth mix of historical and speculative fiction. A book well worth reading. Use patience, and give it a little bit of time to work its magic. Suitable for both teenagers and adults, and recommended for anyone with a sweet tooth for smart speculative fiction."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"This is an excellent book. Its sense of humor is dry, its language is incredible, its world feels complete, and its characters are both fascinating and believable. In short, it's all the best of recent fantasy, and it now has a place of honor among my most-loved and most-reread books.Unfortunately, it's also all the worst of old fantasy. Think only a few steps removed from the level of the Silmarillion, but with jokes. Especially towards the beginning, the novel is slow, and focuses on a character who is harder to sympathize with than most. The fact that it kept my attention in spite of this is nothing short of amazing. That said, it may not keep yours, so if you have any doubts, check the book out from the library first.Basically: I loved it. You might, too, but find out before you buy it."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"I have to say, I didn't really get into this book until after pg. 100. In fact, I had read 30 pgs., put it down for a month, and only picked it up when I left for a week on a business. Goodness, I am happy I picked it up again.Like many have said, it's not the requisite page-turner like so many books seem to be these days. With that being said, I always come back to it - the next day, before bed, while commuting - with the same interest I left it. The story, the events have become so realized in my mind, that they seem to be entirely believeable works of non-fiction. So convincing is Clark in her masterful art of storytelling, that I truly love each page I read.I highly recemmend it to even the most impatient, distracted person. Just give it some time - you'll surely fall in love as I did."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"JS & Mr.N is an excellent book, you can tell immediately that the author took 10 years to finish it. The footnotes are an amazing plus. With that said, it is not a book for everyone. I know several people who have tried to get through it without success. Not that I'm saying they're not dedicated, but it does slow down a bit in the middle but the wait is well worth it.I hope there's a sequel!"},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"as evidenced by some of the reviews, but yay for the lucky group that do. I think if you don't get it, it's because you haven't given due time for the themes to unfold--and I know that is not an easy thing for a lot of people (including me sometimes).I will say that the first time I read this novel, it was a challenge in the beginning, because the first half of the novel is much more of a social satire that uses magic as its catalyst, with very little actual magic going on, not mention the rather hard-to-wrap-your-arms-around first magician, Mr. Norrell.But by the time I finished, every piece that was laid out over the course of the story fit, even the plot ends that were deliberately left hanging. It was absolutely tremendous, and listening to the audio book was just as rewarding, even more so in some ways. I really can't recommend it highly enough."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"I would recommend the audio version of this book. The narrator is one of the best I've heard and he makes the book fly by. There are many lengthy footnotes in the book, which could be confusing while listening to - but the narrator handles them in a way so you don't lose track of the action. I later bought the book to see the illustrations and re-read my favorite parts."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"Grisham freely admits in the preface to \\"A Time to Kill\\" that it is his first book and is a little long winded and slow at times. This one needs a similar disclaimer.I get the sense that Clarke could tell a good story. This book in fact actually contains a good story, it just gets lost in and amongst the 782 pages.Some general comments:Someone complained this book had no magic. I think they meant no \\"lightning bolt, wizards battling\\" type magic. Actually, it has lots of magic, and that is it's biggest problem - it is \\"god-like mountain moving\\" type magic. For magic having been gone from England, it sure came back in a big way.The charcoal illustrations in the book are quite pleasing and fitting in style to the book/story.The idea that a fue words written in quasi-old english style brings a feeling of periud writing to the book is lostt on me. I could shew (actual word used throughout the book) you examples, but you'd probably quit reading my revuew. As you can tell fromme this paragraph it can be pretty annoiying.I'm torn on the footnotes. There are a lot of lengthy footnotes throughout. Though they really don't advance the story, they do add to the historical novel feel of the book.Funniest review here in Amazon: the person who claimed they sell it in shrinkwrap because no one would buy it if they scanned a few pages in the store - based on the writing style and footnotes it is hard to argue with that logic.In reading reviews on this book here on Amazon, I am struck with the idea that Mr. Norrell has placed a spell on the review section also. Amazingly, the percentage of people who find the 1 and 2 star reviews useful is very low, yet even the most information-less 4 or 5 star review is found to be very useful.Well, if you've read my rambling diatribe to this point, perhaps this book if for you. As for me, I only finished it because I was mildly interested in how it ended (thus 2 stars instead of 1) and the fact I took it out of shrink wrap and started it before my wife - for all the grief that caused I sure as heck wasn't going to not read the whole thing."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"I'm not sure what the detractors of this book were expecting, but Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell has everything a good book should have: likeable but flawed characters, deftly written dialogue, romance, adventure and humor. The writing style may be difficult for people expecting another DaVinci Code or Lovely Bones, but for readers of fantasy or literary fiction, Clarke's debut is wonderfully taut, playfully serious, and, above all, engrossingly plotted. It will most likely appeal to fans of Alan Moore's work (Susanna Clarke cites him as an influence) and fans of Neil Gaiman. It will also appeal to those with an interest in English literature in general, Charles Dickens and Jane Austen in particular. Those who prefer mainstream American fiction like Nora Roberts, James Patterson, Janet Evanovich, etc. will have a harder time reading Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell, as Clarke's book lacks the lean, film-derived plotting and cardboard characterization of the latter works. Above all, this is a literary work, a story to be chewed slowly and digested rather than binged upon."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"As a book, I loved it. I didn't think it needed too much patience to get in to and I enjoyed it from start to finish. However, I was disappointed that the kindle edition was riddled with errors: lots of missing spaces between words, words that were inappropriately hyphenated (and inconsistently), missing letters at the beginning or end of words and some formatting errors. These are things that would never be tolerated in a print edition and I don't see why they are tolerated in an electronic version, especially considering that the kindle version doesn't cost much less than a paperback.I recommend the book as a read, but do think that the publisher needs to made a better e-book; the amount of errors in this one was pretty disgraceful."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"Hyped as the adult version of Harry Potter (probably down to the fact that both are published by Bloomsbury), I was curious to read this book to see if the hype was deserved. I'm happy to report that I found it to be one of the most enjoyable books I've read for years.An adult J K Rowling novel is, to my mind, a description that does the book few favours; I would describe it as a Jane Austen with magic. The style of such writers as Austen and Thackeray is captured so perfectly that it is hard to believe that this is not a 19th century book, but one from the 21st century. Using this device makes the reader feel that this story has been part of our British literary heritage and, as such, seems to turn it into an instant classic. Clarke creates a world that is entirely believable. Weaving the plot around historical figures (Wellington, Byron, Mad King George) added a sense of reality to the magic.The story revolves primarily around Gilbert Norrell and his gifted pupil, Jonathan Strange. They are both multi-faceted complex characters, and, in many respects, I was constantly wondering which of them was the so-called bad magician, and which the good - as with real characters, they are neither entirely black nor white! Apart from the two main protagonists, the story is packed with wonderful characters, my favourtie being Stephen Black (Lord and Lady Pole's Butler), who is befriended by a strange faerie gentleman anxious to grant his every wish.The scale is immense and the pacing somewhat measured - but I enjoyed it all the more for this, as it felt like a book I wanted to savour rather gobble. I didn't want it to end. My only criticism is that it's just too big and heavy to read in bed!"},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"For the first several chapters, I just loved this book.... Interesting characters, charmingly old-fashioned style of writing, so fitting with the historical atmosphere of the novel. Then, about a third of the way through (right about at the first LONG footnote, yes, you heard me right, there are footnotes, and then there are the LONG footnotes), it started to drag a bit, maybe annoy me just slightly. Then, several chapters later, it was gratingly unpleasant to read. But, I'll admit, I wanted to know how things would turn out, so I finished it. It was painful; I wish I could have those days of my life back."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"Boy, the publisher did neither the author nor the readers any favors with the way they marketed this book. Just save yourself some time and money and...DON'T buy this book if:- you get irritated when a book doesn't give you an unflawed hero to root for, or when it doesn't have an unconditionally happy ending- you hate it when an author frequently switches between story arcs- you don't want to spend much time getting to know characters...you'd rather have the plot move quickly- the main type of fiction you read contains lots of action and is written in the usual American English found in most of today's thrillers and mysteries- you're under eighteen, or your biggest fantasy involves suddenly finding out that you have magical powers (Harry Potter).- the only type of fantasy novel you like is the kind where good/beautiful/perfectly honorable people overcome impossible odds to defeat bad/ugly/insane people (Lord of the Rings)DO buy this book if:- in-depth character development is as important to you as the story itself- you understand and revel in well-done, old-style English prose- you enjoy subtle humor- you prefer thought-provoking, multi-layered stories to \\"quick hit\\" escapism- you like a little history mixed in with your fictionLook, I like Lord of the Rings and Harry Potter, too, when I'm in the mood for sheer escapism. But to me, it's kind of like eating fast food vs. dining on a gourmet meal. I may be forced to settle for fast food most of the time, but I'll take the gourmet meal whenever I can get it."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"At 782 pages, there's a definite level of commitment here. Once you start a book this size, you should understand that you'll be reading it for a WHILE. Nobody should expect this will be a \\"quick read.\\" The chapters average about 12 pages each, which is a nice bite-size chunk; handy for reading in stages. I finished it in 10 days, one of which was my day off from work so I spent the entire afternoon devouring the last 200 pages in one long rush. Yeah, the action picks up around page 500 or so, and suddenly this lazy, plodding brick of a book you've been strolling through, admiring the sites and stopping occasionally for lunch, becomes an intense page-turner which absolutley DEMANDS that you find out what happens next. The action escalates to a crazy, hectic climax. But it takes a really long time to do so.Other reviewers have lamented how boring this book is, and yes, I'll have to admit there's not a lot going on in the first 1 or 2 HUNDRED pages. Ms Clarke takes her time establishing setting and characters. I was prepared for this. I have been reading the dullest nonfiction for the past 2 months, so it was a treat for me to read something that has characters and a plot. This story COULD have been told in 400 pages, but the author has stretched it out with her languid, meandering storytelling style. If you're not patient - if you're addicted to adrenaline and demand constant action, stay away from this book; go watch TV instead. I don't understand why these people bought an 800 page book in the first place... Expecting to be captivated in the first 10 pages? Come on.Anyway, Ms Clarke's narrative style could best be described as \\"whimsical.\\" It borders on \\"cutesy\\" at times, and occasionally I felt like I was reading a children's book. At one point early on, the narrative voice breaks character and addresses the reader directly, stepping out of the story and referring to itself as \\"I.\\" This is all the more disconcerting because it only happens once - which makes it seem like a mistake. But the whimsy gradually melts away, and by page 400 the narrator has become invisible. You've forgotten that she is there and you're just following the story. It looks like Ms Clarke may have written this book in chronological order, so the first chapters, where the writing is weakest, are the first ones she wrote, and as the novel progresses she actually becomes a better writer (as I understand it, this book was more than 10 years in the making.) She is in much fuller posession of her powers by the time she reaches the end. It's just that the reader has to slog along with her while she learns to master her craft.The archaic spelling of some words seemed unnecessarily cute. (\\"Scissars\\" and \\"chuze\\" spring to mind. There were others.) These words annoyed me every time I saw one.So much time has been taken developing the characters that you begin to feel that you know them. You will identify with them. (I realize, somewhat shamefully, that I am more like Norrell than Strange.) By the end, you will care a great deal what happens to them. But unfortunately the end, the _very end_ of the book, was a disappointing fizzle. It was sappy. The final impression I was left with upon closing the book was not a good one. Probably could've done without the last chapter; the story was already over by then anyway.Everybody has mentioned the footnotes scattered throughout the story. They were quaint, usually funny, entertaining, and utterly pointless. I liked them, but they weren't necessary and they made the book longer.So, to sum up: you need to have some reading stamina to get you through the first half because the story doesn't get really interesting (by Hollywood standards) til then. The story itself feels like it should be only about half the size of the book, which tells me there was a lot of fat in it, bulking it up to 800-page proportions (but fat makes things taste good, right?) Though I was entertained and occasionally amazed by this novel, I still can't say that it was GREAT. 3 stars. Recommended if you have a lot of time to kill."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"Before deciding whether to purchase and read this book, I scanned several reviews on Amazon. I didn't find any that accurately predicted my ultimate response to the book, and after talking to a few others who shared my experience, I thought I'd add my voice to the multitude here.I'm only giving this book four stars, even though I ended up absolutely loving it. Why? Because it has a serious flaw: the first 200+ pages are excruciatingly dull. However, about a third of the way into the book, I began to get intrigued by the characters and unfolding events, and stopped questioning whether I really wanted to keep reading. By two thirds into the book, I was absolutely hooked, as in can't put it down, excuse myself from social obligations to devour another chapter hooked.A few things to know about the novel if you are struggling through the tedious beginning:If you find yourself wondering why anybody would write a book about a protagonist who is so pedantic, dull, and mean-spirited as Mr. Norrell, you have a point -- and he's not the protagonist. Unfortunately, the first third of the book is mostly devoted to him.If you find yourself wondering why you should care about the seemingly random and unrelated events and persons parading through the opening chapters, know that every situation and character ultimately plays an important and gripping part in the story. In fact, some of the most important of these are presented without any clues from the author that they play any role of significance whatsoever.If you find yourself annoyed and distracted by the endless footnotes that break up the narrative flow, well, yes, they are annoying and distracting and break up the narrative flow. For the most part they are not critical to the story, and can be skipped or at least quickly skimmed.If you are half way through the book or, heaven forbid, two thirds of the way through, and you are still wondering when it is going to get interesting, save your precious time. This book is probably not for you!"},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"This is a fictional tale about magic and the magicians who practice it. Most stories of this nature tend to culminate in battles of good versus evil, but not this: what we encounter here is a conflict of style.Mr. Norrell is an old school magician in every way- tradition and moderation are the hallmarks of his life. (This is not a man who embraces change.)Jonathan Strange is a young upstart who challenges Norrell's approach to magical theory. Books are fine (if Norrell would ever let him get his hands on some), but practice and pushing the envelope are much more to Strange's taste.The crux of the story begins with good intentions: Mr. Norrell wants to restore the magic that has been lost in nineteenth-century England, but only on his terms. As long as he is in control of every thing magical, all will be well. However, one desperate night in an attempt to prove himself, Norrell makes a very poor choice with far-reaching consequences. From then on the course of English magic is forever changed.Basically, the reader plays audience to a struggle of egos: Who is right? If you're not with me, you're against me...that sort of thing. While there is no problem with this intrinsically, it goes on and on for seven hundred (700) plus pages. If a story actually requires that much space to tell, fine, but this one didn't. Part of the problem came from the overuse of footnotes. It's fiction! Several chapters worth of footnotes shouldn't be required in fiction- what, will there be a quiz?Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell spanned about ten years. The problem was that I felt like I was there with the characters, every step of the way, for ten years. For me, that's not a plus. A reader should want to actively pursue a story to its conclusion, not be dragged on by the hair hoping to eventually see daylight.All in all, the idea was good and the ending worked, but the lack of editing took away its appeal. If the author felt that all of those details were truly necessary I wish she would have broken up the story into two books, leaving me to want more rather than yearn for less."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"Incredible book. I'm still laughing at the fussy, cautious, and paranoid Mr. Norrell. I'm still horrified, yet somehow darkly amused, by the Fairy King's careless, clueless destruction of human life. I'm still cheering for Jonathan Strange, who pursues magic at great risk to himself, because nothing important can be achieved without risk. Here's a magician who thinks the world doesn't need a nanny...how's that for a refreshing view in today's over-regulated world? And I'm still chuckling over the idea of Napoleon frantically trying to find a few wizards of his own...by force, if need be. Great, great book. If the rumors are true that Clarke is working on a sequel, then yay, sign me up now."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"Britisher Clarke's first novel is 782 pages and will not be everyone's \\"cup of tea,\\" but my husband and I read it aloud together and were disappointed when it ended.

Feels timeless and fresh, even though it takes place in Victorian england"},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"I am still glowing from reading this AWESOME book!!! Yes, I know that not everyone will find it awesome and I respect that, but for me AWESOME hardly describes how I feel, I found it that good. Let me attempt to explain. By nature, I am not someone who appreciates magic or the fantasy genre with a few exceptions that I read as a child such as The Chronicles of Narnia. I haven't read Harry Potter or seen the movies because I just don't get into the sorcerer thing. I rarely feel motivated to pick up a 1,000 page book. Although I like books set in merry, olde England they don't impress me anymore than say, a book set in Laos or Bermuda. So, what amazed me about this book?First, of all, I loved Clarke's writing style. The use of a select few olde English words and spellings such as chuse, surprize, faerie were just enough to sprinkle a magical olde feeling over the book but not used to frequently to become a chore to read. Her style was easy, but yet charming. I don't think I hardly read the entire first page before I was interested, and only a couple pages in before I knew I would finish the book.Secondly, the plot was not formulaic or contrived like so much modern fiction. I never guessed right once about what would happen next. This was a book that was a pleasure to read. Yes, there were a few murders and ghastly deeds but they weren't dwelt on nor were they the focal point of the story. It was nice to read a book that wasn't full of horrors, that was an escape like fantasy should be. I always looked forward to reading my chapter-a-day.Thirdly, along similar lines, I appreciated Strange's code of honor that he could use magic to kill someone, but that a gentlemen wouldn't, so he wouldn't. Magic wasn't used in a petty way by Strange.I'm sure I could go on and on about what I loved, but this review is already much longer than I intended. Last thought: If this book would have been 2,000 pages it wouldn't have been too long. It is the first 1,000 page book I read that I didn't want to end. .7.5 Stars out of 5."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"If you want a totally engrossing lengthy novel, you will really enjoy this book.

Its history of poets and wordsmiths tangles back to time out of mind, conjuring images that exceed its small area and population. But if you read recent Brit Lit, it has a distinct atmosphere of discouragement about it. So when English author Susanna Clarke recaptures pre-Victorian times in a heroic fantasy, we know exactly what she means when a character asks: \\"Why is there no more magic done in England?\\"Clarke tells a story that delves into two worlds at once. Her plot, stripped of the language in which she clothes it, tells of two men, wanderers outside their time. Gilbert Norrell is a collector, an introvert, a man with his head in the clouds. Jonathan Strange, who first apprentices to Norell before they descend into rivalry, is eminently practical, a man of the people. And both of them happen to be wizards, with power unmatched in Britain since time of myth.But Clarke doesn't strip the story of its language. The events of her story don't just happen; they happen in a very specific context. Hers is the world of Jane Austen and Laurence Sterne, of Mary Shelley and Sir Walter Scott. And the language she uses painstakingly reconstructs the time in which its set. Clarke infuses her words with the intricacy, lyricism, and humor of Britain's pre-Victorian heyday, a time when, for literature lovers, England still had magic.Because the time in which she sets her story is so well known, Clarke feels free to insert characters who will be instantly recognizable to readers. In addition to the title heroes, Clarke trots out stock characters like Sir Walter and Lady Emma Pole, and the slave Stephen who possesses practical wisdom his masters don't share. She also uses historical figures: George III, Lord Nelson, and Lord Byron make cameo appearances.Any college-level Brit Lit survey course will spend the longest amount of time on the years surrounding the Napoleonic Wars. Ironically, the years when England produced its greatest linguistic magic corresponded with the years when the land was nearly at greatest risk of disappearing from the globe, second only to the Blitz. Perhaps the fear that their culture might not last long gave the Limeys reason to remember they had a culture.And the works produced in that time have been a mixed blessing. On the one hand, the linguistic flowering that began with Marlowe and Shakespeare bore fruit in the days of Wordsworth and Johnson. On the other, because the pre-Victorians accomplished so much, they have linked British letters to a veritable industry of nostalgia. Now wonder English Literature progressed through Victorian weariness to the sooty, emasculated world of Amis and le Carr&eacute;.Clarke at once channels that nostalgia industry, by recapturing the pre-Victorian tone, and challenges it, by forcing a conflict between the past and the present. Just as Austen's excessively prim patriarchs subtly mocked the mores of her time, Clarke's wizardry mandarins, frozen in their worship of the past, point the finger at today's professors and librarians. Our best work is not behind us, Clarke says. But we have to actually do that work.But it's not just about who creates the work. By mocking the nostalgia industry, Clarke also indicts us readers for keeping our eyes turned backward. We, like the authors, are not living up to our potential. We are creating a system of rewards in which all of us feel free to rest on the accomplishments of the past. And we have convinced ourselves, by lionizing how good things used to be, that we can never be that good again. Shame on us.As the forces our title heroes unleash turn on them, forcing them to overcome their rivalry for the greater good, Norrell and Strange go on a journey in which they come to grips with the future. Neither Norrell's dusty historical scholarship nor Strange's practiced applications mean anything when apocalyptic forces threaten. England is changing around them, and they must find the strength to change with it. They have so much to accomplish, if they (and we) will survive.And the same applies to us. The broad, fantastic world Clarke reveals indicts us for accepting smallness and diminished hopes. She challenges us to honor the past by making a present, and planning for the future. In short, she tells us that, if we fear there is no magic being done in English, we have no one to blame for that but ourselves."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"I saved 50.00 getting the product used-it was like new, an excellent story read extremely well. I'm very happy I bought it."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"A different view on the magic theme. Placed in England and around but nicely integrated in to real events. Not much real action but a nice and calm story telling with just enough of action to keep the reader interested. Easy reading."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"*Spoilers Within*I need to start off by saying, as others have, that this book is certainly not for everyone. This isn't a bad thing, though. Clarke has crafted a beautiful novel that reads smoothly for the audience it's geared towards, while it may stump others who are used to the fast-paced, action-packed, romance-ridden novels that have become so popular. It reads like Austen-- so if you're not into Austen, you most likely won't dig this book. That said, if you LOVE Austen (as I do) and also have a great affinity for the fantastic and sometimes ridiculous, this will be right up your alley.I like to make lists, so that's how I'll review this novel. The things I like best about this novel are:1) The tone. I have never read an author who sets a tone so beautifully before. Throughout most of the book, the feel of the world she's created is dark and dreary, but the book never feels heavy or weighed down by it. Her dark skies, rainy afternoons, and Perpetual Darkness are balanced artfully with a near constant outflow of humor. Even the darkest moments in the book never feel especially bleak-- at some points in the book she made dreariness seem almost inviting. She could have chosen to make the entire novel be heavy and somber, but she did the exact opposite with it, which I thought was very clever and creative.2) The humor. As most people have noted in their reviews, Clarke is a master with subtle humor. Her jokes don't beat you over the head and are never inappropriately placed. Most of the laughs come from the very obvious jabs at English propriety. Like Austen, she points out ridiculous human behavior without ever directly saying \\"humans can be ridiculous.\\"3) The characters. Clarke doesn't bother to introduce characters who don't serve some kind of purpose. Unlike some other writers (*cough* George R. R. Martin *cough*) Clarke won't mention a name more than a few times if that person doesn't ultimately affect the course of action within the plot. Case in point: Vinculus. At first I thought it was strange that Clarke kept bringing up this particular character's name after it seemed that he would be insignificant, but after reading on I began to realize that every mention of Vinculus' name, and eventually every one of his appearances, was another spoke in the wheel always turning in the direction of the action. All of her characters are illustrated not through descriptions, but through their actions and words. She never outrightly says that Lascelles is a despicable person, but we KNOW he is based on what he says and how he behaves.4) The villain/the conflict. The gentleman with the thistle down hair! His character reminds me of Christoph Waltz's character in Inglorious Bastards. His attitude throughout the whole novel is just delightful, and yet his appearance in any scene is enough to make your skin crawl. He doesn't exude the typical villain's persona, which is absolutely brilliant, because it makes him even more frightening. And I think it's wonderful that Clarke could have written an entire novel in which good-battles-evil without the opposing forces every really meeting (except for once-- and that was towards the beginning, before the two knew they were enemies,) and even without the opposing forces every really understanding what they were up against. The triumph occurs almost by complete accident, but is all the sweeter because it comes at the hands of Stephen Black--who, I might add, I was rooting more for than any other character in the novel. It was a completely unconventional way of seeing the conflict through to the end.So there it is. I loved this book- if I didn't know better, I'd have thought that Clarke knew exactly what my tastes were and wrote this book just for me. I loved every word of it, but I wouldn't ask her to to write more of it because it was so perfect just the way it was. If you're a fan of Austen, The Lord of the Rings, and Dickens, then I'd venture to say that this book will be one of your favorites!That said, throughout the novel I began to cast this in my mind in case a movie or series was ever made based on it. I just like to cast books in my head, so here's what I came up with:Mr Norrel- Ian HolmJonathon Strange - Paul BettanyArabella- Anne HathawayLady Pole- Mia WasikowskaGentleman With Thistle Down Hair- Jude LawStephen Black- Djimon HounsouChildermass- Michael SheenVinculus- Tom HollanderLascelles- Rupert EverettDrawlight- John LeguizamoMiss Greysteel- Justine WaddellLord Wellington- Kenneth BranaghI could cast the whole book but I'll stop there. I'd love it if they made this into a miniseries or something-- but I'd only trust the British to do it justice.

I just found myself losing interest every so often so that I'd have to take breaks. The characters are very interesting, the plot is, too. The real magic of it all is in the last third of the book, though, when it seems to come into its own. That's where the real action is, the real development, and the real interest. Granted, the beginning portion helps to lead up to it, but the first 2/3 of this book are at some times extremely difficult to get through. Overall, I would recommend it. However, don't go into it expecting it to be a quick read (not even for its size). The impression the book leaves is lasting, and it is very unique. However, it is not everybody's cup of tea."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"There are some interesting stories in this episodic mess. Raven King, who mostly lives in footnotes, is a fascinating character. The problem is that the novel has grandiose ambitions which it is unable to fulfill. Characters fail to build. Action fails to build. After 800 pages of episodic adventures which lead nowhere, magic supposedly returns to England, and the Faerie are conveniently tamed...we know this, because Clarke takes a chapter or two at the end to tell us so. The plot and the characters, however, do not go there naturally.Very disappointing."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"A pleasant and endearing work. Transports you back to a slower-paced, proper and polite bygone era. IF you're willing to spend MANY evenings patiently communing with these mild and temperate men, slowly unfolding their noble (yet flawed) character and depth, you will savor this story. The slow pace pulls you in, as though these are your friends of many years and you are settling in for a quiet and reflective evening with them in the drawing room.If, on the other hand, you prefer your fantasy fast-paced and action-packed, then this ISN'T the novel for you.I particularly appreciated the willingness of these characters to gently overlook faults in others, to readily forgive, to respect each other even in the face of disagreement--we could all learn a thing or two here."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"Set in early 19th century, pre-Victorian England, this unusual novel posits the existence of actual practicing magicians in the midst of English society during the Napoleonic Wars. Having gradually deteriorated through the preceding generations, an individual appears (Mr. Norrell) with the goal of reestablishing magic as a noble and useful profession. As luck would have it, a second, competing magician appears on the scene (Jonathan Strange).Parts of this novel are intriguing, as actual historic events (Waterloo) are merged with fanciful, magical twists that sometimes work (as a literary device) and other times do not. Some reviewers seem to be put off by the archaic language and spelling used by the author (surprize, chuse, etc.). Others are perturbed by the extensive use of footnoting. Neither of these devices bothered me overly much (though a three page footnote IS a little extreme), as the underlying theme and execution of the work itself simply didn't work for me. Arguing about footnotes and spelling seems to be nitpicking when the actual work itself is found wanting (kind of like complaining about the food served aboard the Titanic).It is too long. It is, at times, quite boring and at others ridiculously silly. There are moments of amusement and entertainment, but they are few and far between."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"And the fairies are very well dressed, with satin coats the color of deep despair. Also: magic demands madness. (Arguably, the same is true of being highly proficient in any field.)"},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"This is my first Amazon review, which should explain how much I loved this book. It is definitely a matter of taste, and not for everyone - the prose is dense and Victorian in style, the plot is slow and meandering, and many of the characters are maddening in their flaws. You must understand: this is not a fantasy novel in the traditional sense of the word. Rather, it is a novel about fascination with magic, represented here as any other discipline, i.e. history might be. It is also a very in-depth character study. Whether you sympathize with characters or abhor them, you will not be left unmoved. Don't mistake the slow pace of the plot development for an absence of one. The author takers her time to deliver each valuable piece, as if stringing precious pearls onto a necklace, but at the end I was floored by how beautifully and naturally all the pieces came together to offer a conclusion. If these events had in fact taken place, there would have been no other resolution possible. Not a single false note. Not a single concession to readers' sensibilities. It's bittersweet and breathtakingly elegant. The prose is beautiful, wry, funny and touching at times. For a debut model, a true masterpiece."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"I bought this for my Girlfriend. This is the second copy I have bought after we lost the first one. The story is great, magical but oddly believably and easy to read but never compromising on the richness of the story. The book arrived quickly and in excellent condition. All in all, I am pleased with this purchase and would buy from here again."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"To me, an audio book is made or broken by the narrator. While a terrible reader can ruin a great book, a brilliant performance can elevate a mediocre text and make it compelling. All of which makes the audio CD of Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell a double whammy-- you have Susannah Clarke's tour de force debut, made perfect by Simon Prebble's riveting performance. Once I started listening, I simply could NOT stop.I'd compare Prebble's brilliance to that of the late Patrick Tull. I thought his O'Brien series performances couldn't be surpassed. As a body of work, this may be true, but JS&MN; is easily the best single work I've ever heard, and one that I listen to over and over with delight."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"This is one of the few books I've read that when I got to the end I wished that I could keep reading. Its long - no its loooooong, and there are a few times where I found myself losing interest, but once the momentum of the story really kicks in its brilliant. Almost the moment I finished this book I went to buy \\"The Ladies of Grace Adieu\\". I love the perfect way she built the concept of a world where magic once truly existed and makes it seem so real, that a small part of you wants the book to be part of a hidden and forgotten history. I hope the author is writing more sometime soon.(The reviewer was compensated for posting this review. However, the opinion stated in the review is that of the reviewer and the reviewer alone.

However, if you long to immerse yourself in a great tale, that will take you to magical worlds--jump in! It's hard to believe that this is the Author's first book. The amount of detail in the story is incredible, and the characters are well developed. This is a story of magic, kings, fairies, and all sorts of mischief. I really enjoyed this book and recommend to all devoted bookworms:) If you liked The Magicians, and Harry Potter, and the Neil Gaiman stories, you will love this book!"},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"To seriously explore Susanna Clarke's JONATHAN STRANGE & MR. NORRELL, I recommend you have some quantity time on your hands. This voluminous (over 800 pages) novel set in a very different 19th Century England is crammed with subtext and footnotes; and although reading this book proves daunting Clarke's prose is engaging, humorous, and majestic. This is very much a tribute (and a throwback) to the complex, intricate English novels of the early 19th Century; if Austen and Dickens appeal to you, then by all means give STRANGE & NORRELL a go.So Clarke is a gifted writer, and the world she creates--an England with a rich heritage and history formed by magic and magicians, only the craft has been in disuse for years and years--is compelling and infinitely interesting. So what's the problem here? I can only describe the fundamental problem as a distinct lack of fluidity; this is a novel comprised of a series of rambling, often disjointed, sub-stories, ultimately with not very much happening at all. We are introduced to countless characters, many whom we meet only once and never see again; several minor characters are as unpredictable as they are unbelievable. And (to me) the focal point of the entire novel, the return of one John Uskglass (the Raven King), was so anticlimactic I can't begin to mask my disappointment. As I turned page after page (after page) I kept asking myself, \\"When is this story going to actually take off?\\" I was still asking myself that when I turned the final page.To be sure, the actions and adventures of Mr. Norrell (an ultra-conservative practitioner of magic who wishes to monopolize the craft all to himself) and his pupil Jonathan Strange (who wishes to revive a Golden Age of English magic) are wondrous and interesting, yet the lack of a seamless plot throughout has this novel ringing hollow. Am I glad I took the time to plunge into JONATHAN STRANGE & MR. NORRELL? Absolutely. Ultimately, was I a bit disappointed for all my time and effort? Again, absolutely.--D. Mikels, Esq."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"I rarely buy a book unless it receives great reviews. This book got great reviews but I struggled to finish it. Why? Primarily because of the lack of a viable plot. I thought a fiction book had to have a plot to be published. I was wrong.Plot SpoilersThere is the potential for this book to have been interesting and original - the faeries' world, the refiguring of history, the magic duel between the main protagonists, the disturbing outcomes of faerie encounters. Evidently, most of those who gave this book 3-5 stars thought the potential was realised. I am afraid to say I did not. The main reason for this is the lack of a plot thread, a purpose to the main conflict, the lack of an interesting cast of characters, the lack of a true antagonist; I could go on. I did finish the book but it took me several months to do so, with other books fed in between."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"I gave up after 250 pages.

Maybe this is who gave 5 stars.Everything other reviewers have said is true. Boring expressionless characters. Painfully simple plot that never builds up to any climax.This is like the scenes in Harry Potter when they go to the the strange train station and then see the school with its oddities for the first time It is wonderous for the first 100 pages but instead of the story continuing this scene just keeps looping endlessly with different descriptions and dialouge for 900 more pages.Mabye this is enough for some people.If I had spent the countless hours watching clouds pass, it would have been more exciting.Only the most acute and active animals are capable of boredom.-Nietzsche"},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"I rarely write these reviews because I'm too busy. But I had to write about this one. OK, it is a decent book. But I bought it because it was touted as an adult (grown-up) version of Harry Potter. This was one of the hardest books to get through. The whole story jumped all over the place and in the end you still did not know what the plot was.Buying this in paperback might be worth it.

I was enchanted by the near-Dickensian prose and enjoyed every chance I had to sit down and read until......about 100 pages into the work, a black butler is introduced, Stephan Black who is then revealed to be the most intelligent and witty character in the story. The whites around him (revealing how ignorant they really are) assume him to be some African king in exile. Everyone around him dotes on his wondrousness. I hoped that he would be some minor character and soon disappear but as I scanned the next few hundred pages I saw his name popping up again and again and again to the point where I knew that no matter how much I liked the writing and the flow of the story so far I just could not continue such an anachronistic uber-PC work."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"After plodding through 400 pages of this immense, plodding tomb, including the annoying and unentertaining footnotes, I am at the crossroads of deciding whether I should waste any more of my life by continuing onward to the end.

Even more, I don't understand what convinced some editor to ever publish it. Okay, I convinced myself, I'm putting it down, taking it to the used paperback store and trading it in.

I was immediately hooked! I left my copy in a B&B so I went out and bought another. This book is a charmer. It's funny, it's engaging, it's smart and it completely captures the feeling of the period. Frankly I don't know enough about the subject of English majic to know if Susanna Clark made up all the footnotes or if they have any basis in fact. DON'T SKIP THE FOOTNOTES! They are half the fun. I'd just finished Pride & Prejudice for the first time and this was a great follow up to that. This book isn't for everyone, but I'm glad I found it."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"I didn't think I would like this book becuz it seemed for women, but I was wrong. It is very long book but so good a read. It is about a magician, but not at all like Harry Potter, so don't think it is. It is so much better than Harry Potter. I found myself thinking more of Jim Butcher's excellent DRESDEN FILES series, that I also think is great. There is no romance stuff in it, so don't worry about that.It takes place in the 1850s or so and follows the exploits of Jonathan Strange on his quest to explore the world that cannot be seen. He makes \\"jumps\\" into a vast unknown area to go to other places and follow a mysterious figure that eventually begins to wreck havoc on the world of humans.These characters come to life and is hard to put the book down, even though it is very very long. But you will be glad it was long when it is done and you will still want more. I am waiting for a sequel"},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"JK Rowling meets Jane Austen. A lovely fantasy set in an alternate Regency period, this book is not a fast read by anybody's count (and I am usually a very fast reader), but it's well worth the effort as the author spins a charming tale which affords a tantalizing glimpse into the whimsical, frightening world of Faerie amongst the drawing-room humor. As the story moves deeper into the magic, the tone becomes darker, drawing the hero into an otherworldly quest of sorts. The scholarship is thorough but unobtrusive. A challenging but ultimately satisfying read!"},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"The book is definitely worth the read. At 800+ pages, it may look a little daunting, but - trust me - there isn't a wasted word in the entire novel.It's good to see a female writer doing something so different in the field of fantasy. The only complaint I might possibly have is that the book is told by a very distant, very omniscient narrator, which makes it intellectually stimulating and humorous, but lacks a strong emotional connection to any of the characters. All of the characters are likeable, even the unlikeable ones who simply make us a laugh at their absurdities.One thing that I can say is a big plus: I truly didn't see the ending coming until right before it hit. I knew that the plot was going somewhere, and it made steady progress through the hundreds of pages, but it actually has a pretty satisfying ending, which is rare in a lot of books I've read lately."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"This is a very strange and wonderful book. Its genius lies in Susanna Clarke's ability to paint such a clear picture of magic in her readers' minds that magic somehow acquires a texture, a color, a sound, and a taste. (Sometimes I could even swear that the colour and the taste are, impossibly, the same thing...) Magic is never reduced to wandwaving or incantations, but is allowed to be an elusive, dark current running throughout England and English history. It's malicious, it's dangerous, and it's always mysterious.I have read this book at least three times, and each time I find new details to admire and enjoy. Its plot may meander, but its wit is incisive.If you like to inhabit books rather than simply read them, then this is a book for you."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell is just about the best book I have ever read.

It's well worth your time."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"I'm not a fan of the \\"fantasy\\" genre; in general, I think it's a waste of time. However, I got this book on CD from the local library without really knowing what it was about, and after perhaps half an hour I was hooked on it. The \\"fantasy\\" elements don't seem strained or ridiculous, somehow, and the writing is a joy. I later bought two copies of this book, one for my little cousins and one for myself, and I'm strongly considering getting my father a copy as well. I suppose if you don't enjoy Victorian literature, you'd not like this, since it obviously is strongly influenced by the writing of that period."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"I hate to write a review that's not really a review, but I'm desperately trying to find an edition of this book that comes in a green dust jacket. I've looked high and low, sleuthing around the internet for this elusive edition but to no avail. I see someone above has posted a picture of this 'green' edition. Does anyone know where to find it or if it is a limited printing?To do justice to this book, instead of just using this as advertising space, I strongly recommend that everyone go out and pick up a copy of Ms. Clarke's wonderful novel!

Maybe it was the wrong choice succeed The Forsyte Saga."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"I've always described Jonathan Strange as a fusion of Jane Austen and Harry Potter, but rereading the book makes me wonder how accurate that is. Yes, the book plays with the same world and social circles that Austen wrote about, and creates as vibrant and indelible a portrait of the times as Austen ever did. And, like Rowling, Clarke creates a world where magic is just another fact of life. But limiting a comparison to those two authors ends up missing out on so much of what makes this novel wonderful. Sure, the Potter books are filled with magic, but while Rowling treats magic as just another task, Clarke creates magic that fills the reader with a true sense of wonder and awe, treating the subject as something monumental, not mundane. And while Clarke still writes of the upper-class, she also writes greatly about lower classes, creating a London that feels as much of Dickens as Austen. But there's so much more to write about - her plotting, which allows the characters to breathe and yet spins a far tighter web than you'll realize at first; her characters, who feel like true, living, breathing people; her depiction of magical worlds; her rich and complex mythology; her sense of history...the list goes on and on. When you start reading Strange and Norrell, you feel as though you're entering into a rich world you could explore forever; when the final page turns, you're saddened for having to leave it behind. Clarke has created a modern masterpiece, telling her tale about two men, their friendship and rivalry, and how they reshaped England. It's the story of fairies, magic, seduction, glamour, power, war, love, and more, and it's one of the richest and most satisfying books I've ever read."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"Yes, I said it: there are enough needless words and pointless side stories/footnotes in this book to create 4 more novels. Now, some books are detailed, and account for the details later, but in the book, the author goes rambling on about the most needless things that do not come back around in the story. You could easy cut this book down to 1/4 it's original length and still have a great story, maybe even better.Seriously, much longer than it needed to be. If the story were amazing (which it is not), then we could overlook this word-packing.Now, as for the CDs, another personal pet peeve: the CDs do not alert you that you have come to the end of the disc. My CD player just returns to the beginning, so I have to drive another 5 minutes before I realize it is replaying itself. Some of the better CD sets tell you the disc has ended and to \\"continue on disc __\\", which helps a great deal while dodging traffic on the freeway.If you must: get this from the library, but DO NOT pay money for it."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"This is a fascinating novel. It unlike nearly everything I've ever read.It's about two men, the first real magicians in a couple centuries, as they rediscover the old magic lost to modern academics, and use that magic against Napoleon's armies. It's about their relationships-- between the two men, with their families, with their friends, with their servants, with their academic/political peers, with their patriotism, and even with their magical forefathers. Both men have dramatically different views about what makes good or bad magic, about how it should be used, when, and by whom. This comes out gradually over the course of the novel-- nothing is rushed here. Which isn't to say it's slow, it merely takes its time in tracking the course of these two magician's careers, fully developing events and relationships so that when things build up and Stuff Happens, you have a deep, grand understanding of all the players involved.If you like historical fiction, if you like traditional ideas of British fantasy along the lines of Faerie realms, magical items, spells that turn out more trouble than they're worth, magic in warfare, and a great love of knowledge in the form of books, you'll like this story. A huge theme of the novel is the conflict between learning by reading and learning by doing: being a theoretical magician is safe but ultimately limited...being a practical magician means no end to the knowledge and power you can acquire, but the danger in learning is infinitely higher. Is it better to study or invent? Is it even possible to separate the two acts? That's the source of philosophical conflict in the book, and as a premise if fascinates me. Will magic see them through the day or will it ultimately destroy them? Honestly, it could go either way."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"I might not have started this book if I'd known what it was about, but I read every footnote of this atmospheric literary pastiche -- George Eliot meets Harry Potter.

I absolutely loved it. It is one of the most original works I have ever read. Yes, it is long and No, it is not Harry Potter- but so what? I am not going to get into the plot here- you can read that on its info page. But I highly recommend this to people looking for an original read that blends sophisticated fantasy with enjoyable historical fiction. With the extensive footnotes and detail you find yourself actually wondering of any of these magical persons/books/events actually took place!"},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"I approached this book with some trepidation. I'm not a big fan of the fantasy genre in general (I find most of it to be fairly derivative). I'm not a big Harry Potter fan, either, and when I saw this book appear -- a great big fat book about magicians -- I couldn't help but assume somebody was trying to cash in.I gave it a chance anyway, and I wasn't disappointed. This book is a lot of fun.Some people describe the writing style as being pretentious or stilted, and maybe it is a little. What it also is, however, is witty in that extremely dry way that just screams \\"England.\\" Imagine John Cleese teaching a college course on the history of the Zulu wars and you have the general idea.It's big -- maybe over-big -- but it never wore out its welcome and I closed it fully expecting to pick up Ms. Clarke's next one when it appears.If I have any criticisms, one is that the plot does tend to meander a bit and doesn't really pick up steam until late in the manuscript. The other is that by the end of the book there are so many references to Clarke's alternate-England world, with its fairy roads, magician kings and haunted castles that move from one part of the landscape to another, that it sort of loses its mooring and you no longer have any landmarks to keep it grounded in the real world. It no longer feels like real England plus magic, in other words, and instead starts to feel like a completely alien fantasy environment. But this is a minor quibble.\\"Harry Potter for adults\\" is an apt enough description, but this book is more than that also. I say give it a try."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"In it's way this is a brilliant book and it certainly is entertaining in a very odd way. I couldn't really stop reading it though there were times when it's sheer weight made my arms tired. The character protraits and historical perspective are remarkable. The book is about two practical magicians who want to bring true magic back to England, where only theoretical Magicians prevail. It seems the best way to do that is to cleverly help the government wage war against the French...and so much more. One gets comfortable in this strange world where many unexpected things occur. One gets comfortable escaping into this well structured alternate reality and with it's characters. But unlike Harry Potter, the plots unfold slowly (if interestingly) and if you're looking for a gut grabber this one isn't it. All that said, I had to give it 5 stars because for what it is, it is extremely well done...and I hated to see it go."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"...this is what she would have written. It is not the perfect book, but it comes close, and what other book can appeal so well to the sensibilities of both Jane Austen and Harry Potter lovers?

I had a hard time making it through the first 100 pages and had to force myself to keep going. I wish I would have gotten it from the library so that I could return it instead of wasting my money at the book store."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"I give it one star to give the author credit for being able to spew such a very large amount of prose.I love big books. War and Peace. Anything by Dickens. Big 18th century novels. Even big 20th century novels, like Gravity's Rainbow. I'm not a snob that way. I know that when a big book is good, it is very very good.This one is awful. The author cannot muster up a voice one can listen to and abide with for this length of text. Her attempts at imitation early 19th century prose verge on the insulting, especially since she lacks the wit and imagination to do so convincingly. Her struggle to do so results in a text that is stifled, constrained and uncomfortable.The writing is anipathetic to a good reading experience. The author neglects to offer the reaer an interesting or compassionate route through which to enter the story. The characters are remarkably uninteresting for a tale of a fantasy parallell reality. The plot moves along so slowly that the book's finest feature, for this reader, was its ability to induce sleep.I suspect it was the publisher's intent to market an adult Harry Potter-type fantasy franchise. It won't work with this author, these characters or this storyline. It's an insulting marketing ploy.Don't bother."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"I had high expectations for this book. Although I would give the author high marks for atmospherics, I think the whole thing was ruined because of contradictory premises at the heart of the novel. At first it was just a vague, sneaking suspicion, but after a couple hundred pages, I couldn't get it out of my mind.See, this book has two core premises. One is that \\"magic\\" is real: that by contorting one's fingers into odd shapes and uttering some arcane Latin, one can indeed summon demons, cast spells, blight crops, whatever.The other premise is that this art has been \\"forgotten.\\" There's a society of magicians, of a sort, who set themselves to addressing the question, \\"Why are we merely historians of magic? Why do we no longer practice it ourselves?\\" This is not an idle aside: it's the central thrust of the first half of the novel.Unfortunately for Clarke (or anybody else) these premises can't go together . . . even in a work of fantasy.If magic were real, there is no way it would have been forgotten! It wouldn't have happened! Are you kidding? Work all day with my smelly ox under the hot sun breaking this earth when I can just utter a few syllables and have magical servants do it for me? What? Build an expensive and dangerous scaffold when we can just utter a few syllables and levitate this heavy block of granite right up to the top of this cathedral? How's that? Risk our priceless argosies to the whimsies of sea weather when we can just utter a few syllables and have calm, safe seas? Are you nuts? Where do we sign up?This is the kind of knowledge that humanity simply wouldn't have lost in the first place -- yea, even during the darkest of the dark ages. The only reason I can swallow the premise of its being \\"forgotten\\" is that it was unreliable bunkum. If it worked, it'd be something that would have spread all over the earth to the point where even the most unlettered serf in Siberia would have known basic spells for making his life easier. They'd have been posted on every refrigerator, written on every palm!I couldn't get this out my mind while reading this book. I've seen fantasy novels that asked you to believe something that was impossible and you were glad to oblige -- mainly because they suspended, say, only ONE law of nature and then got on with it. But THIS novel asks you to suspend disbelief not merely in all the laws of nature, but every insight ever gleaned about human psychology, economics, and anthropology. Good luck with that."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"I am an avid reader and felt compelled to agree with the majority of negative reviews with regard to this book. Unfortunately the book is very boring and hard to get through. After reaching the midway point I am trying to decide to keep on going or throw in the towel."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"It escapes me why this book was the darling of a number of critics. The only gripping episodes were those involving the gentleman with thistledown hair, Stephen, and Lady Pole. The lengthy footnotes could be entertaining but grew tiresome as the book progressed (and it is a long book, to put it mildly); Norrell is more a spoiled whiner than a threat to Strange; and the use of magic in the Napoleonic Wars never attains the suspense and drama of a real battle. In short, steer clear."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"You know I have been plowing through this book, and I just realized the reason why I can't seem to finish. There's not a character in the book I want to identify with! I certainly wouldn't compare it with Harry Potter.

Although I typically try and push myself to finsish books I start, I was unable to sustain my motivation after the first 150 or so pages, and just gave up.1. The author's writing style I found generally pretentious and often uninteresting. The narrative voice is an attempt to mimic early 19th century British English. I will assume the author has achieved some level of authenticity, but it does not always make for readable prose. Although speech patterns may have been goverened by a stiff upper lip in those times, it doesn't mean the narrators inner voice has to adopt the same pattern.2. The author seems to enjoy self-indulgent asides and multi-page footnotes that don't serve an obvious rhetorical purpose. There are many examples of footnotes used to explain the obscure background or history behind a quip or phrase. To my knowledge, however, these don't seem to advance plot or add depth to the character development. I found them mostly irritating and pointless.3. At times, the book feels more like an analysis of political strategy and behavior of 19th century British bureaucrats. This might be an interesting topic, but to me was completely out of place.Or am I the only one who feels this way?"},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"Boring, wooden and lackluster. The characters are unengaging, and I can't make myself care what happens to them. Yes, there is a lot of period detail, but good research does not a good story make. A triumph of marketing.

I buy books and read them as soon as I get them, then go looking for more. I've read and loved Hawthorne, Dickens, Twain, Alcott, Bronte, Austin, and even some Melville (I mention these because they have been compared to this book's \\"denseness\\")...But this book has been sitting on my shelf for over a month. I keep pulling it out hoping that maybe time has let it ferment or meld itself into a readable book, but no such luck. I have yet to get past the first chapter. Reading it feels like slogging through quicksand with cinder blocks attached to your feet. I tried flipping ahead in the book in hopes it would be better and every so often I find a passage where there is something interesting, like conversation instead of the history of a non-existant magical comunity... but for the most part this book is serving as a dust collector. The only thing that keeps me coming back to it, besides the fact that I have never let anybook go unread once I got my hands on it, is the fact the last page in the book is very captivating...so I keep thinking for a book to end so well it must be good somewhere in the middle.If you like dry, long, boring books based on 'fantasy' this is for you... But if you don't, for heavens sake don't waste your money... go buy Jane Eyre, or Wuthering Heights or something...or if \\"thicker\\" books aren't up your alley go get some Artemis Fowl or Terry Pratchet books."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"Johnathan Strange & Mr. Norrell was a 700+ (for the hardback) page novel about..... yeah, that's just the thing. I read this entire stupid book, and I still couldn't give you a clear answer what it was about.After searching around online for an answer to why I just wasted more time than I should have reading this bland Dickens knock-off, I discovered that the question of \\"what is this book about?\\" is even in debate among people who actually liked it. It's either about the relationship between Strange and Norrell, the relationship between reason and madness, a little of both, some other drivel, or... whatever because by page 500 I really stopped caring and started skimming my way through the rest of this thing just to get to some kind of god forsaken conclusion to this jumbled mess by an obvious amature author.I can see the reason why so many people like it. It's long, there are a lot of characters, and a lot is going on creating the illusion of a book that should be considered \\"important\\". I flat out hated it, and here's why:-It is unnecessarily long. This isn't really a point of it's own as it ties in with the ones I'm about to make, but I just wanted to start by saying this should have been at least half as long. I absolutely hate the trend of believing \\"longer is better\\". NO! It is not. If you're just adding filler to your book in order to make it longer, you are diluting the quality.-There are entire plot lines which are introduced and just go nowhere.-There are characters who are introduced, and given a good deal of page space, who add nothing to the plot. Mainly because, once again, their plot lines are introduced and go nowhere, or because it is ended so abruptly you wonder what was the point of introducing it to begin with.-The point of this book is so hard to pick out because it seems to keep shifting focus throughout the novel. I swear it's like I read five different books. The flow of the book is clunky and lacks cohesiveness.-The book is so overburdened with \\"side characters\\" that once you get around to the ones that actual do matter (and their story lines) end up getting choked by all the rubbish that fills the book.-The footnotes are distracting and add nothing to the story line. Yeah, I get it, they add background information in a cutesy kitschy way. It's not needed. It's just another distraction.-With the exception of Strange, there is NO character development. And it's even a stretch to say there's any with Strange's character. If you are going to write a book that focuses more on character relationships than \\"story\\", at least have some kind of character arc or something. For a book that spans more than a decade it's pretty unbelievable that almost every single one of the characters have exactly the same voice/opinions/story/goal/etc near the end as they do in the beginning.It's not the fact there this is a character driven book with many interlocking plots going on throughout it, which makes me hate this book. I love character driven novels! It's just that this is written so badly that I'm not really sure where Clarke was going with this.So, as a brief summary, this book is unfocused, cluttered, and has no immediate point. I think it suffers from the classic rookie author mistake of Clarke trying too hard and taking on more of a book than she could successfully handle (a la \\"The Historian\\" by Elizabeth Kostova, but at least that had an actual plot, albeit ridiculous, unlike this novel). I don't know how else to express exactly how much this book sucks. It just does. It's really awful and an incredible waste of time. I cannot believe the crap got published, and it makes me even more astounded that it got such good reviews (then again, The Da Vinci Code and Twilight are also critically praised... so there you go...).Oh, and did I mention (no, I did not), that there is no conclusion after all. It basically leaves you by opening another plot line (big friggin' surprise), and a \\"Too be continued\\" type cliff hanger. Not an open ended \\"form your own conclusion\\" type ending, but an obvious set up for a sequel. God, do I hate authors who pull this stunt. If you can't wrap up your story line in your original novel (especially one this long), then it's probably because it's not good enough to continue into another one anyway. By the end of the book I'm left wishing I owned a fireplace for which I can chuck this trash into."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"I slogged thru the first third of the book but I found it quite boring. I think it had to do with the author's style of writing as though she were a novelist in the late 18th early 19th century. I can't read unabridged Austen nor Dickens either."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"I am an avid reader of all Genres and I was given an advanced copy of this book by a book store owner. I usually give a book 100 pages before I give up on it. I went to 300 pages with this book ONLY because the book store owner wanted a review. Not one of the characters was interesting or likeable. The pace is slow and the plot is tedious and boring. The writing is self-conscious. The only reason it is on the bestseller list is the marketing ploy which hypes this work as \\"Harry Potter for the adult\\"."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"I got this book hoping to enjoy it based on many rave reviews. I DON'T GET IT! I have not been so bored with a book in I don't know how long! I bought this at Amazon.com from an Awesome Deal I found on DailyTool.com."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"I was excited to get this book. I had it on hold at the library for months. When I finally began perusing it, I discovered to my chagrin that it was actually just a mildly more adult version of Harry Potter. Not just because its subject matter is magic--that is the least of it. I was excited to read a dark adult book about magic. No, the story, the characters, the consequences of the magic that is done, all combine to make you soon realize that this is a book for children. Everything is so droll and quaint, no one's reactions to the plot points are anywhere close to realistic, the writing is simplistic, like a child's christmas story. It's also one of those historical fictions where the author continually makes painfully obvious little anachronistic statements. Like suddenly people are saying all this feminist stuff, or all this ridiculously modern stuff about racism. It does not feel like a historical novel, but rather like someone poorly aping the vibe of this moment in history. I don't understand why it is marketed to adults. It falls in the Harry Potter demographic. It is saccharine, dumbed-down, and, again, clearly written for babies. I don't understand everyone raving about how it is written in the style of Jane Austen. Just because you liberally sprinkle your writing with words like \\"madame\\" and \\"alas\\" and just because everybody rides horses does not mean you are writing like Jane Austen. This book feels like it was written by someone who loves Jane Austen a lot, but just doesn't really have the chops to pull off anything truly clever or interesting.If I sound bitter it is only because I anticipated this book so energetically and waited for it for so long. If you are one of those grownups who loves Harry Potter, you will surely love this book, and more power to you. If, like me, you are looking for a deep, dark, intriguing adult historical fiction/fantasy novel, you would do better to look elsewhere."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"At first I thought this book would be right up my alley -- a long, period, British novel about magic. How can you go wrong? The first thing that began to bug me were the elaborate footnotes. They really did not add to the plot or understanding of the characters and only served to frustrate me as I debated whether or not to read them.The book starts out well but my major problem was that none of the characters are really gripping. Mr. Secundus, who does come back much later (though not in the 3rd of the novel I read) is moderately interesting. But the main character for most of the first bit of the novel -- Mr. Norrell -- is not very likeable or compelling. We never learn much about him. When Strange finally makes his appearance I was happy, thinking this might perk things up, but again, the author has one thing after another happen but nothing really seems to further one's understanding of, or concern for, the characters. The main \\"character\\" in this book is the author's creation of the history of English magic. Unfortunately, this was not riveting enough to keep me going.I saw one review who said that if you like Dickens, Elliot, etc., you will like this. I could not disagree more. They are great English novelists. This is not a great English novel."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"There is no reason to bother with this book, as far as I can tell. (I tossed it aside after 250 pages.) The prose is a poor imitation of that of the age the book depicts, and, though there is (contrary to some reports) a plot, the plot is entirely uninteresting. Again in opposition to some reports, the footnotes here are actually the most interesting thing in the book.In any case, any novel that telegraphs plot twists exactly 102 pages in advance (this figure derived from the mass-market paperback edition) cannot be counted as anything but uninteresting. There are, of course, worse books, but none I can recall now that has been so widely praised.Apparently, fans of the Harry Potter series might like this; let me recommend instead just rereading the Potter stuff or, better still, turning to the originals of which this is the tv movie version: Wilkie Collins' \\"The Woman in White\\" would be a fine place to start, and you can probably borrow that from the local library instead of wasting the money on this."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"I am an avid reader, and enjoy the fantasy genre. However I found this book impossibly slow and boring. I gave up after two hundred pages, and I almost always finish books that I begin. It seems that most of the reviewers enjoyed the book. Perhaps I have poor taste in books, or Susanna Clarke has lots of relatives."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"My husband purchased this book for me after he read a review that raved about it. He went to a great deal of trouble to track the book down and get it for me for Christmas. If he hadn't gone to all the trouble, I would have chunked this in the trash after 2 or 3 pages. More than 800 pages later, I felt like I'd been trapped in a Seinfeld episode (not much happening, but spending a lot of time talking about it) without the laughs. Unfortunately, he bought 2 of her books for me so I also read the book of short stories - The Ladies of Grace Adieu and Other Stories - it was marginally better as the stories were short."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"What a great waste of time, and 782 pagers of paper stock. I give the book only 1 star out of respect for an author that can string together that many words. The book would have been a halfway ok at half the number of pages. It's a frustrating read filled with half-baked characters and a story line that does not hold together. But, more importantly, it's such and uninteresting book to read. Unless you have a fetish for 19th century English culture. Otherwise, as a fantasy, it's a dud. [...]"},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"I was utterly devastated to see all the rave reviews of this book turn out to be completely untrue. The story is written in a VERY dry, rambling style with ubiquitous footnotes - many of which are almost an entire page long and totally off subject! I waited patiently for the pace to pick up, but it never did. It was only in the last 100 pages of the book that my imagination was finally prodded out of coma-mode. This book is defnitely NOT worth the $30!"},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"I hate to contradict myself in one sentence like that, but honestly is the best policy. A friend recommeded this book, and I picked it up at the library. The first 100 pages was fairly smooth, but as I went farther into this long book, I rapidly lost steam. It is not the easiest read in the world, there is something antiquated and almost romantic in the way it's written, which is great at first. But when you're reading page after page it was difficult to get lost in the story when I'm stumbling over the prose. I'm going to eventually try the audio book. It is a very interesting story, and if you like a slower read, this is your book."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"So many reviews already detail this novel so I'll just say that i really liked this journey. I'm just amazed at the imagination of the author. One of the things which pleased me was how the author kept the characters on track and true to themselves."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"This is an excellent book. My kids got me into Harry Potter, but this is a much better read for adults. Nothing graphic, just a more complex story. Intrigue and a believable story line make for a better read. It is somewhat difficult to get into the story initially, I found myself reading late into the night about 1/3 of the way through."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"When we LOVE a book, we want to recommend it to other readers, but how does one describe the marvelous tale of Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell and who would enjoy it?The setting is early 19th century England. The wit, subtle humor, and bittersweet romance bring Jane Austen to mind. On the other hand, the large cast of lively, vivid characters dealing with life's most basic themes of good and evil; greed and retribution, most definitely give this novel the feel of Dickens. Then, there is all the incredible detail about the history and legend of magic in England and the elegant magic itself performed by Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell. This is a long book (782 pages, illustrated with delightful, eerie black and white drawings) that left me hoping I could soon return to the world of the two English magicians.As a person who works in a public library with many teens as patrons, I am always looking for book recommendations for our young adults. As a reader who was enthralled by Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell, I am eager to pass this title on to potential Strange and Norrell enthusiasts and I think teens would make excellent candidates for this recommendation.Young adults are a group of readers looking for something that has the same lure as the books they enjoyed when younger (Rowling, Tolkien, etc.), but more sophisticated and complex. Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell is such a book. In the world created by Susanna Clarke, a key moment is Mr. Norrell bringing a beautiful young woman back from the dead in order to become the most famous magician in England. He does so by enlisting the powers of \\"the gentleman with the Thistle down hair\\" and the Kingdom of Faerie. With this act, he does nothing short of bargain with the devil and it is the catalyst for all the many twists and turns of this well-crafted plot. I was enthralled by the world created by Ms. Clarke and I think many teens would love to be transported into this book's realm."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"This book has a certain charm. The style is similar to Jane Austen. That said, you could cut 300 pages out of the middle and not miss very much.The story revolves about the workings of two rather incompetent magicians named Strange and Norrell. They intend to restore magic to England.Norrell wishes to exclude everyone else from practicing magic, and Strange seeks out knowledge of the Raven King. The Raven King ruled 3 kingdoms: northern England, Fairie and Hell.The plot drags on over a decade, and a great deal of the back story is contained in footnotes (I hope you like agate type). One plot aspect is that Norrell summons a fairie to perform a task. This fairie is essentially at war with Norrell and Strange through out the book, but neither of the magicians understand this until maybe page 600.I guess I expected something more rousing when you consider the hype this book received.I think the writing is quite good, but the novel suffers from a touch edit and too many pages."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"This book is a true pleasure, beginning to end. Yes, long, yes, wordy, but absolutely worth it. A book to be savored."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"I found this book to be very good bedside reading. Normally when I read a book I MUST read it cover to cover. I lose sense of time and space and immerse myself into the world I am reading. I was unable to do that with this book. I found it very easy to pick up and (more importantly) to put down.I thought it was written in a very dry style that reminds me of books written in a bygone England. As that is the main setting of the book, might have been the idea. I, however, found it tedious. However, I did enjoy reading the 'footnotes' scattered throughout the book. Many of them were mini-stories in themselves.I would recommend first checking it out from the library before buying it to ensure that the writing style is one that you enjoy."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell brings magic back to England in the early 1800s. Mr. Norrell is an eccentric gentleman appearing out of what seems like nowhere to show the self-proclaimed magicians of York that he is the one true practical magician in England. From York, he travels to London to introduce as many as people as possible to his abilities and the revived practice of magic. Enter Jonathan Strange who has also proved himself adept at practicing magic. Norrell fears Strange to be an enemy and competetor, but soon keeps his enemy close by taking him on as a pupil. What ensues is a facinating work of losely based historical fiction that explores the allegorical history of magic and a wonderful story of how the magic was applied.Despite being almost 800 pages long, this book is a page turner from start to finish. Toward the end I read even slower in order to savor every word. Additionally, it is a smart read that entertains as well as seems to educate along the way. On top of the magical entertainment, this debut novel addresses love, master/servant relationships, social hierarchy, war, friendship, and loyalty. Susanna Clarke has done an amazing job with this first work and I cannot wait to see what she turns out next."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"I'm a fast reader; except where history books are concerned.Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell really is a history book -or an alternative history - of England. Here is where magic and magicians have a place amongst some of Britians historical figures, like the Duke of Wellington.It is also a social comedy along the lines of Jane Austen's novels and the classic British series Upstairs, Downstairs.Ms. Clarke infuses the novel with extraordinary detail with tons of footnotes -most of them very humorous - and characters that jump off the page.It took me a long time to read this book, and I waited until the paperback came out to take it up. I knew - at 845 pages - it was going to take an effort to fully understand her intentions, and I so hate dragging a thick hardcover around.I was also aware of the mixed bag of reviews this book got when it came out over a year ago, so I'm sure this was also part of the reason it took so long. As much as I try to be partial after hearing a review of a book I want to read, sometimes as I read a book, those thoughts crowd into my brain.Anyway, it is worth the read as far as I'm concerned. It packs a lot of information in its 845 pages, including poking fun at Harry Potter and reminding me why I love British humor.And its not a many \\"fantasy\\" novel that could easily crossover into the history section of your bookshelf."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell tells the story of two magicians who come to power just as the forces of magic return to England (Between 1807 and 1817). Mr. Norrell is a aging, dull, stingy scholar of magic and practical magician; he has been holed up at his estate, Hurtfew Abbey, for nearly all of his adult life, until an argument with a magical society in York entices himself to make himself useful to the English government.Jonathan Strange never intended to be anything but independently wealthy, or a \\"gentleman\\" as they would say. But boredom and a prophecy from a London street-tramp turn his interest towards the magical arts. Mr. Norrell hears about this young upstart magician, and takes him on as a pupil.All goes well for a time - but Mr. Norrell is an extremely secretive man, and cannot trust any one enough to share all that he knows about magic, and so Jonathan Strange must strike out on his own.This is threatening to Mr. Norrell for many reasons - his incredible ego cannot take it - how could Strange ever leave him? But what is more troublesome is that Norrell is hiding a dark secret - one that could damage English Magic for good.If you enjoy reading any of the following: Fantasy novels, historical fiction, a good love story, a novel with: characters that walk a fine line between good and evil, that resembles Jane Austen, Anthony Trollope, or any other Victorian author of social comedies, a good war story, or evil men who meet fates worse than death, this book is for you."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"I cannot rave enough about this book; certainly I have not been moved like this by a literary work in some time. Gorgeous from start to finish- sometimes whimsical, sometimes heartbreaking, always intelligent, fresh, and full of magic. Clarke's writing is impeccable and a pure joy to read. One always has the sense that she's subtly mocking her characters even as she allows us to love (or hate!) them. The story is breathtaking and moves along with exquisite pacing. Allow yourself to be lost in her world!"},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"It's rare to find an 800+ page book that you are truly sad to see end. but this was that book for me. beautifully written and brought to life by Clarke, it has just about everything you could ask for in a book...drama, thrills, tension, humor, & that rare gift in a book these days...it makes you truly, deeply care about the characters. In fact, by the end of this novel, these people in Clarke's world were real to me, in a way i've never experienced before in a novel. I actually wished i could have stayed in their world longer, and am hopeful of the upcoming 'not-quite a sequel' Clarke has planned.I will refrain from tackling the plot, because it has been gone over so many times so far by other reviewers. But, i will say if you like completely losing yourself in a book, take the plunge and dive into the wonderful world of Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"This book is gonna take you a while. It's all about the revival of English magic while England is at war with Napoleon. Part fantasy, part 19th century Bronte-style romance, it's reminiscent of \\"The Lord Of The Rings\\" in that all living things in nature have a spirit and more to them than meets the eye, though you may not grow as attached to the main characters in this novel as in Tolkein's classic. The appeal of LOTR is the humble down-to-earth heroes from different backgrounds all fighting one giant evil force, while in \\"Strange & Norrell\\" it's two rich English gents fighting a small Frenchman. The book has also been described as \\"Harry Potter for adults\\" but you get the impression from \\"Strange & Norrell\\" that you have to be well-to-do to even begin learning magic, unlike \\"Harry Potter\\" where anyone who has a gift is welcome to study. The two magicians do struggle with a greater evil later on, but it takes a while - and I mean a while - to get to that. You'll appreciate the secondary characters a lot more including Anabelle Strange, Mr. Childermass, and the wandering magician Vinculus. \\"The Man With The Thistle-Down Hair\\" might remind one a lot of David Bowie's character in Jim Henson's \\"Labyrinth\\"; Bowie would be a great choice for the film adaptation.\\"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell\\" is definitely not a beach or airplane read as it's like toting around a phone book; it's around 800 pages. It's drawn out in areas, and there's even footnotes (yes, footnotes) that explain a lot of back-story, but stick it out and you'll be rewarded in the end. I found myself wanting to see how the story finishes, and yes, it's open for a sequel."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"While the last 150 pages or so of this nearly 1000 page book are thrilling and rewarding, most of the rest of the book makes you feel like you are listening to your grandmother tell you a very long and boring story. By this I mean you will be plagued by a feeling of \\"hurry up already!!\\" and \\"I can't wait to finish this book,\\" neither one of which is a feeling that a good novel should inspire. But, if your pride will not let you put down a book that you find only slightly entertaining, you will be rewarded with a wonderfully thought-out and executed climax. The last 100 pages of this book will undoubtably be read in a single sitting, and as you close the book you will be satisfied.As for the characters and settings, I thought Susanna Clarke did a wonderful job of painting a vivid and lifelike (although somewhat gloomy) world that will transport you to the days of Old England, where gentlemen hold great but undeserved admiration themselves, and pure disdain for the common man. Clarke makes almost no attempt to explain the origins of English Magic, and her characters accept its presence with only mild surprise. The atmosphere of the book is somewhat disconnected, with very little in the way of deep emotion coming from any of the characters, even when you know they should be overpowered with feelings. This is part of the way Clarke is able to convey such a sense of surealty and, in my opinion, takes away from the books overall impact.It's a Strange world that Susanna Clarke presents, you'll enjoy it if you realize what you're getting in to."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"Clark mixes fantasy, historical fiction and term paper together to create this simultaneously entertaining and annoying tome. While I don't regret having purchased the book, I found myself becoming distracted by Clark's gimmicks--writing in the style of the period the novel is set in (with archaic spelling) and the use of footnotes to provide background and tangential narrative. There are almost as many words in footnotes as there are in the body of the novel.Also, I think the book needed a tighter edit. There were sizeable stretches of the book dedicated to secondary plotlines and character develelopment that could have been presented in Clark's chosen style in much more compact form. In the end, I felt that Ms. Clark's publishers were far too indulgent of her wanderings."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"Well, if you're expecting a Harry Potter knockoff, forget it. But if you want a page-turning, literate fantasy with beautifully worked out characters, a wonderfully convincing alternate England and a crackerjack plot, all written in the dry, ironic, witty \\"voice\\" of a latter-day Jane Austen, then be sure to buy this book. I absolutely loved it. I am really sorry it finally had to end."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"The joy of this book is not in its length, for it is too long, but for the fully-formed world and the arch manner of the writing. Too many people have tried to compare this to Harry Potter for some very superficial similarities: it's set in an England where magic works, the author is female and the book is a brick. But this is not a children's book, albeit those weaned on Potter might find this interesting if quite slow in comparison, for Clarke's method is much more subtle. This is a comedy of manners in the traditional sense. In Rowling's world, we're never going to see Draco Malfoy as a sympathetic figure, yet the complex character who is Mr Norrell comes across as equally malicious as Malfoy at times and yet also quite sympathetic at others. He, and Strange, and most of the rest of the characters in this book are entirely too human, who do stupid things and smart things and they are never quite sure which is which during the action thereof.Mr Norrell is the last practical magician in England, who is determined to be the only magician as well, because all of the others are charlatans and theoretical. He's a vain man, who wants to restore England to glory through magical means, but only if the means and ways are those that he approves of. Norrell is also quite naive, and quickly is surrounded by a pair of handlers in the high society of London who use him much more than he uses them in their employment. A combination of Norrell's misuse of his own magic (in a severe lapse of judgment) and the arrival of Jonathan Strange, a ne'er-do-well turned magician through natural aptitude, who joins Norrell as a pupil, that proceeds to give the book its slight plot. While nicely resolved at the end, it is the examination of the characters and the world that is of more interest, as Clarke does a wonderful job of creating a magic realist alternate history, where the magic, while unnatural, isn't viewed with alarm by people, but taken as it comes.This is Clarke's first published novel, and I'm somewhat surprised it didn't have an editor trim it down, but this may very well be due to Rowling's proof that the marketplace can embrace 800 page novels. I look forward to her next, as this novel holds promise for a bright future for her."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"I could tell by other reviews that this is one of those books one either loves or hates. I am on the love side. The one thing I did not see mentioned in any of the reviews are the lovely illustrations by Portia Rosenberg which added so much to my reading pleasure. In fact, the copy of the book I bought (from Amazon) turned out to be a First Edition printing, and the entire book is amazingly beautiful, which also added to my pleasure."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"I just closed the back cover of this book, which I started well over three months ago. I agree with much of what everyone else is saying here; it is enjoyable entirely all the way through, but not until book three does it ever become a \\"page turner,\\" it is absolutely not in the same realm of \\"Harry Potter,\\" and it is oddly more dark and yet more funny than those books. The reason I am bothering to add to almost 300 other reviews is to discuss one aspect of this book. Which is, if you follow along, and read all the footnotes in this book, you come away with the odd sense that you have actually, honestly learned a lot of factual information about 18th century English magic. This is of course, ridiculous, but Suzanna Clarke writes with such authority and confidence (and detail) on the subject that, unlike the Potter books where you come away wishing the world were so, but quite aware it is fantasy, you leave the world of Strange and Norrell, quite convinced that it was indeed so. In this way this book is astoundingly unique. Her writing style, almost a Austen type comedy of manners, works well to make you believe she is just relating a story of everyday life, with all the petty jealousies etc, that people go through. Magic is simply part of the world they live in. You will either love or hate this book, but you should at least try it, and give it a chance to unwind itself for you and leave preconceptions behind."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"I started this book with enthusiasm, and had to force myself to finish it. The prose is very good, the characters fully developed, and the situations range from entertaining to outright funny, but...First, it's too specific in genre. You really have to have read a lot of fairy tales to understand many of the references, but if you do understand them, the direction of the plot eventually gets obvious. I was hoping from a departure from the norm, but this isn't it.Second, it's just too long. All the tension is in the first two thirds of the book and the last third is a long winding down.Still, a great first effort. Buy it used, there are sure to be 100s of copies around soon."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"I enjoy fantasy a great deal but so much of it is Tolkien redux, in fact I'd almost forgotten that it was possible to make a fantasy any other way... until I read two books that reminded me how narrow and uninspired fantasy has become. The first was \\"American Gods\\" by Neil Gaiman and the second was \\"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell\\". It's hard to think of two more different books yet both are \\"fantasy\\" (anything with magic is fantasy in my book but these labels are always loose). There isn't much I can add that hasn't been said, I just wanted to throw in a very enthusiastic thumbs up. I highly recommend this, it's amazing to think this is her first novel.So, don't despair! there is unique and inspired fantasy novels to be found and this book is one of them."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"That's just how I would describe this book. It is not a book that you can pick up and read cover to cover in the space of a few hours. The most tangible obstacle is the sheer length of the novel, at over 800 pages. However, as anyone who's read the Song of Ice and Fire series can tell you, those seem much shorter than their 1000 pages let on. Not the case with this book, primarily because of the style it is written in. Clarke, in attempting to envelop the reader in the atmosphere of early nineteenth century England, uses the same style of prose that was popular at the time, but without the benefit of communicating in it on a daily basis. As a result, the novel reads like those of Vladimir Nabokov, who wrote beautifully in English but in the awkward sort of way that comes with it being a second language. This by no means detracts from the story, but it does mean that in order to comprehend what is being said one must be in a more wakeful state than is common at two in the morning.With that said, however, this is a marvelous piece of work. It is certainly the best combination of historical fiction and fantasy that I've ever read, to the point where it really fits in neither of those genres, nor any other genre for that matter. I would say it is Historical Fantasy, the only Historical Fantasy out there, and a Large Print version could probably take up a shelf of its own in the bookstore. It deserves no less. Clarke has managed to take the Napoleonic Wars and turn them into a mere backdrop for the all-important return of magic to England, which was under the control of a magical king for hundreds of years during the Middle Ages. But while she did do a good deal of shifting around of English history, she made the changes obvious and yet subtle enough so that any historian who read the book and did not enjoy it because of the historical inaccuracies would be forced to keep his/her mouth shut. Clarke also draws on magic, or illusions, that actually were performed during wartime, such as the movement of the Port of Alexandria, and the rubber armies of Eisenhower, to make the magic, the earlier magic at least, that much more plausible. And she tactfully refrains from going beyond those simple tricks until the reader is thoroughly engrossed in the story and doesn't really care what kind of magic the magicians do anymore, so long as it keeps the story going.The only complaint I have is that the female characters could probably have been a bit more fleshed out. Arabella, Lady Pole and Miss Greysteel, all fascinating characters, never really came into their own as I had expected them to. But perhaps Clarke is simply reserving them for the sequel (I think someone mentioned that) where they will likely play a larger role."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"This was a terrific book. Don't be daunted by the size and the pace of the narrative. Clarke immerses you in the world of these two great magicians. It is a great novel and much fun to read. A little lengthy at times, but when one gets to the end, it becomes apparent why Clarke took so much time crafting the story. All loose threads come together at the end. A great read if you like historical fiction or fantasy."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"This novel absorbed me into a world I did not want to leave at all. It takes a team effort by every element of a novel to do this, story, characters, style, etc. Clarke's first novel hits on all accounts. Many of my friends, who are into fantasy literature as I am, were put off by the writing style. Truth be told, I had the same worries about the style as I have not truly delved into any classical English Literature, but \\"Strange\\" was not difficult for me at all. Clarke writes some very funny scenes and dialogue, and the characters all have their little quirks to keep things moving.The history of Clarke's magical England is very well developed to impress most \\"world building\\" aficionados. The footnotes are always interesting or funny or often times both. I don't really get the charge that none of the characters are likable. They are all deeply flawed, but I liked them all, even the despicable Lascelles, Drawlight, and the gentleman with the thistle down hair. Strange is probably the most sympathetic of them all (which I often think people confuse with \\"likeable\\" but oh well) Oh there are plenty of characters, as befits a novel of this size, but there aren't too many. I never came upon characters later on that I forgot about. The ending is quite good and worth the well over 700 page drive. I just hope we don't have to wait another decade for Clarke's next novel!"},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell (JS&MN;)isn't you're typical fantasy novel. It definitely isn't and 'adult' Harry Potter story. JS&MN; is a fantasy and yet not the typical fantasy tale. The story is set in the early 1800's in a time when there isn't any magic in England. The book provdies a lot of background into the rich magical past of this England and how two new magicians enter the scene and try to revive English magic. The magicians initially work and learn together, but eventually part ways. Unknown to the two magicians, there are forces working for and against them.The novel is divided into three 'books'. At times, the story diverges into other story lines that tend to slow the story. In the end most of the divergent story lines add depth to the novel, I think that some of it could have been edited to keep the pace of the story.Having said that, I found the book to be good. I was very pleased to have stuck with the story and would suggest other readers not to give up too soon. While I thought the first 'book' and a half were a bit tiresome, the later half of the book was very good with a great ending."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"Most of the reviews you will read either copy the same theme -- \\"it is like Austen! Enjoyable, if digressive\\" -- or attempt to launch themselves into the sort of bombastic critical arc that could sit comfortably within the pages of an eighth grade English fiction mag. On the larger web, I've even encountered a comment that expressed disappointment over the dearth of \\"feminists\\" in the novel. I am not here to dismantle such notions myself. I think it is enough to point out that this novel is itself an hilarious satire of modern day critical culture, and as such, is critic proof. The magicians that Clarke describes have become so preoccupied with matters of form and style that they are unable to recognize (or perform) actual magic. They are thus easy prey for someone (Mr. Norrell) who not only co-opts their pretensions (he is much better read), but who is also a skillful practicing magician (read -- writer). The irony lies in the fact that Mr. Norrell is only an improved version of his critics; he does not believe in magic as such. The story's real and allegorical conflict is represented in the person of Jonathan Strange. Mr. Strange is more than a practicing magician; he is an artist. Yet he is an artist who has matured under the tutelage of Mr. Norrell . How, the book seems to ask, can art escape hidebound institutions and persons? The narrative's answer is mirrored in the structure of the book itself, which craftily appropriates academic conventions (lengthy footnotes, pseudo-historical theories, etc.) and then transcends them through sheer creativity and willfulness. This book is far more Twain than Austen. If you are at all interested in reading good satire or disappointed with the modern \\"art\\" novel, I would encourage you to purchase it forthwith. -Travis"},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"The reviews for this book vary widely and for good reason. This is a book set in 1810-1820 England where magic is being rediscovered. It is also written in a voice and meandering style approriate to the period. The emphasis of the story is on the English manner, personality, ethos, and world-view rather than magic, sorcery, and quests. Magic is in many ways secondary to the rest of the story. This difference in perspective will delight readers of English period stories and frustrate readers of fantasy.While I really enjoyed the book. It is not without fault. It is overly long, and many of the side excursions lend little to the overall story. There are many named characters (at least 40) that pop-up throughout the story. While the language is appropriate to the period, it often seems stilted and somewhat artifical to the modern ear.I suggest you read the first 100 pages. If you are not entranced, put the book down and read something else."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"I think this book has been unfairly advertised in order to hopefully grab people who enjoyed the Harry Potter books. when I was given this behemoth of a novel to read, I was told I'd like it because \\"its a mix of Harry Potter and Jane Austen.\\" Its an entirely different kind of novel than Harry Potter; and the only connection to a Jane Austen novel would be that its set in old England and uses old English (\\"chuses\\" for example). That said, the writing style is more in line with Jane Austen than some of the modern authors. But, I wouldn't call this book Harry Potter done by Jane Austen. Its also a fairly hard book to get into which is highly different from the pickup and readability of Harry Potter.I don't even want to talk about what the book is about and my recommendation is to not read the book jacket because it basically tells you the entire story. Strange and Norrell tells the story of a magician, Norrell, who wants to bring magic back to England under his own terms. But it doesn't start out like that. It starts out with totally different characters who consider themselves magicians but don't practice. Then it becomes a different novel about Norrell and his personal idealogies...then it involves Strange and tells his whole life history up to this moment before showing his ideologies.Part of the problem with the novel in its early pages is that it has a ton of beginnings. It feels like the story will be about one thing but then introducing someone else gives another beginning to the story. Its filled with too many false starts. It also spends a large portion of the book setting up what will unfold in the last two hundred pages; in fact the majority of the story dictated in the book flap happens in the last half of the novel. Fans of very pickup and read novels will probably be turned off early on. Its a shame because this novel is very rich.It has a lot of subtext involving the time period (1800s) that fans/history buffs of the time period will enjoy. I hate to call it a historical fiction, but it closely resembles this but with a fantastical twist (namely magic). Susanna Clarke spends a good deal of time describing the time period, the setting, the characters, their motivations, etc that you really do get a good feeling for the characters. She does a good job developing characters that will definitely have an idealogical and moral confrontation. Clarke does tend to lean on cliches every now and then, what with the yes-men surrounding Norell and their tireless bickering on who's better. Its handled deftly, but its still cliched at parts.My recommendation is that if you enjoy a quick read (and I don't mean page length) then I would just check this novel out. If you are interested in devoting a good portion of your time to a novel that is thick with description, characterization and a plot that involves a ton of setup and involves a ton of characters that need to be introduced, then this is a good novel for you."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"Susanna Clarke has put a different spin on the fantasy novel with JOHNATHAN STRANGE & MR. NORRELL. By using the conceit of treating the novel like a history, with footnotes included, Clarke does a nice job of creating a \\"realistic\\" England that never was; a land where magic had a strong influence on the development of the nation.Mr. Norrell is an unpleasent individual, who having brought practical magic back to a land that treated magic as something to be studied rather than performed, chooses to keep magic to himself and continue as its sole practitioner. Along comes Johnathan Strange, who is everything Norrell is not, even tempered, congenial and in possesion of a sense of humor. At first Strange becomes Norrell's pupil and after a difference of opinion over the future of magic his foe.Behind the scenes a member of Fairie is creating problems that will lead to climactic scenes of magic and a satisfying tying together of the various subplots in this novel. At almost 800 pages the novel does occasionally get bogged down in all the details that Clarke puts in and occasionally the footnotes are of little value, (Ex: Hexenmeister is German for magician. The context easily answered this without a footnote.)but overall this is a fine addition to the world of fantasy fiction."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"It took me several tries to get started with this book (much like the first time I read Dorothy Dunnett's \\"The Game of Kings\\"), but once I got to the first bit of magic, I couldn't put it down. Early on I continued with the audio version on CDs and found myself listening far into the night and dragging myself to work the next days. This book was great fun, and the CDs were excellent - a book that can be listened to over and over. What an imagination!"},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"I couldn't help but give up on this book. After so much fanfare, I bought this monstrosity and invested several hours of reading, but simply did not have the stamina to endure it. The bits of promise helped sustain my interest for a while, but the mundanities of the content soon surfaced, forcing me to ultimately give up about 250 pages in. There are only so many tangents one can go off on. Footnotes can be very interesting, as witnessed in \\"House Of Leaves\\", but they prove, in the end, to be tiresome and meandering, and rarely contribute to the overall story. There HAD to be another way to give the illusion of a completely imagined world. I couldn't even finish it.One would be better off reading Dickens. At least it delivers what is expected.In the end, it is well written but ill-conceived."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"I bought this book from the high reviews it has recieved and the plot sounded very creative and intriguing. But, as I soon learned, no matter how creative a story is, the story needs to be paced well and shouldn't make the reader be thinking about the other unread books waiting for them on their shelf. I read about seventy pages through and the book failed to contain my interest. Although, I will give Clarke credit, for her writing style is very enjoyable and her characters are very believable, but still, the book needed a an editor very heavily. The story was slow to get started and the beginning was just a long drawl. Hopefully, the freind that is going to recieve this book will enjoy it better than I did."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"I've read the early reviews many months back touting it as \\"Harry Potter for adults\\" and was just thrilled when the book arrived last week from Amazon.I hated Emma. Absolutely hated it. I thought it was just far too slow. This book felt like Emma in the beginning. My eyes were starting to glaze and I was quite ready to put it down and put off continuing reading it for a year. I gave it another 200 pages and was surprised. The writing \\"grew on me.\\" I started noticing the humor behind the story and started enjoying the witty little subplots the writer introduced.I don't want to spoil anything but this is not a sharply contrasted environment that many fellow theoretical \\"magicians\\" have been expecting and you really have to \\"R-E-A-D\\" to appreciate all the work that has been invested by the writer. This not a modern novel in style.This is an exquisitely crafted world and the writing mimics the classics quite well; and Susanna Clarke, I await your next novel eagerly."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"The cover of the book quotes a review calling it \\"the finest English novel of the fantastic in seventy years.\\" At nearly 800 pages, it is a hard, dry slog, recommended only for diehard fantasy readers. This is the author's first novel, and she spent ten years on it. It seems that when she got bogged down in the plot or ran out of inspiration, she would write \\"footnotes\\" of other or older story ideas that have little or no relevance to her story, but which take up about forty percent of the novel. As other reviewers have noted, we join the Duke of Wellington at the Battle of Waterloo, do Venice with Lord Byron, and keep returning to an ongoing underground fairy ball that has been in progress for thousands of years.The characters are vaguely similar, but none of them aspire to a higher good, or to a goal more noble than personal gain and knocking out the competition. There is a lot of petty bickering of the \\"my spell's better than your spell\\" variety, and more arguing over the history of magic than actual use of magic for a real purpose.I fell for the hype, and wanted nothing more than for that blurb to be true, but I would really like the time back that I spent reading this book."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"The title is enough to give me a fair share of 'review unhelpful' votes. But this is something that I've realized in alot of US reviews, even in the New York Post. They don't seem to get the point. They'll ramble on about how the prose is trite and too dry, all the while failing to realize that this isn't American literature. This is British.You could perhaps put some of the fault of misunderstanding on Bloomsbury, with the emphasis they've been placing on the US mass marketing, it gives the impression that this book is meant primarily for Americans. Which, of course, it isn't. (Ifm pretty sure I haven't read a more British book in the last decade.)We say 'lost in translation' and think it only refers to exotic languages and translations, but what we fail to realize is that it applies also to the gap between British English and American English."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"I am a voracious reader and this is my gendre...I find it a struggle to finish. There is no care to build characters so I could care less what happens to them....Footnotes get VERY obnoxious...I don't think it's that clever or funny...SO not in the caliber of Austen or Tolkien as rated...don't waste your time."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"The book really grabbed me at the beginning. I was intrigued and quite excited about where it was headed. And then after the magic of the stones that spoke, I got entangled in the mire that is this book. I kept reading hoping that it would pick up or get exciting. After slugging through most of it, the ending got a bit exciting but not by much. I think it could've been a fantastic story if Clarke would have hired an editor with any common sense that cut it down to 200-300 pages."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"I loved this book. It takes its time in the beginning - it was something like 200 pages before the second title character is honestly introduced, and about that long before I began truly to care about any of the characters or the story. No one I recommended this book to got through the beginning. Yes, it's slow. Yes, the language is (I assume deliberately) old-fashioned, perhaps somewhat difficult. Yes, there are voluminous footnotes that don't relate directly to the story. I happened to enjoy the footnotes -- although they don't add much to the story, they add enormous depth to the world. Think of the first section of the book as establishing the world -- it takes a little while longer for Clarke to establish the characters and plot. But establish them she does, and if you ask me, awfully damned well. I read a lot of fantasy, I love the magic and alternate worlds, but for me, at least, I don't see a whole lot of fantasy that has truly well-done, deep characters. This one does. The plot is similarly deep and compelling, once it gets going. The book is long and, at times, slow, but stick with it and for me, at least, it was more than worth it. Truly one of my all-time favorites."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"Picture an England during the Napoleonic Wars of the early 19th century, very much like the historical England, recognizable in many ways to readers familiar with the period, except that this England has a magical past, a distant connection to medieval English magic which has dissipated and diminished for hundreds of years but is now starting to come alive again. This is the setting of Susanna Clarke's wonderful book, which conjures up a familiar alternate England which becomes progressively more strange and fascinating as the story unfolds.The seminal figure of English magic was The Raven King, a mysterious figure who emerged fully formed in the 12th century, a human child raised in Faerie, to become the ruler of the entire north of England for the next three centuries with his capital in Newcastle, and additional demesnes in Faerie and on the far side of Hell. The last of the golden age magicians, Dr. Martin Pale, was nearly contemporaneous, and upon his death the decline of English magic became manifest until our story opens in the early 1800s, when the self-taught bookworm Gilbert Norrell emerges in Yorkshire as England's first practical magician in nearly 300 years.Like J.K. Rowling, to whom her work has been compared, Clarke is adept at plotting and characterization. Clarke has said that her favorite character is Childermass, Norrell's loyal and highly competent servant; my favorite characters are the Gentleman with the Thistledown Hair (a powerful, volatile and amoral Otherlander) and Stephen Black, an admirable person who reminds me of a personal friend with a similar name. My favorite plot device is the hidden and indescribable double life of Lady Pole, which is as frightening as anything in Robert W. Chambers. Please believe that I have said nothing that will ruin the experience: you will enjoy this book. ***"},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"This is one of the most unusual books I've ever read! Difficult to categorize, I've seen it referred to as 'fantasy', 'alternative history', and a 'grown-up Harry Potter'. It's all of these, but none of those descriptives quite capture it. Set in 18th-century England during the Napoleonic wars, this long, meandering tale gives a lot of exquisite detail without ever really going anywhere specific, opening with with a gathering of dusty, stodgy theoretical magicians who are prodded into wondering what ever happened to good old English magick and those who actually practiced it. On that note they find Gilbert Norrell, a practicing magician who has no desire - at first - to share his knowledge with others. He's soon convinced that it would be in England's best interests to bring magick back, and where better to start than with influencing the war with Napoleon? Many reviews I've read tend to give the impression that the whole book is about this, but that's very misleading. It's not, at all.Soon after Norrell begins to meet with England's government about the different (and amusing) strategies to thwart Napoleon's army, he's approached by the young and eager Jonathan Strange, whom he agrees to take in as his student, although he tends to frustrate Strange beyond endurance by concealing as much as he reveals, even going so far as to ship half of his rare books of magick to a secret location so Strange can't read them! Even so the two enjoy a prosperous and famous partnership, until their one primary point of disagreement - the relevance and history of England's \\"father\\" of magick, John Uskglass (a.k.a. The Raven King) - finally comes between them in an irreconcilable way and they become bitter enemies.The couple of people I've discussed this book with say it held their interest at first, but then petered out. It was the opposite for me. I found it a little tedious at first, but stayed with it because I absolutely love the very wry, faux-proper writing style that only English writers can pull off really well, and the more I read, the more entertained I was. My one complaint is probably the same as others have had - nothing ever really happens. There's no big climax, per se. At the same time, this obvious drift from formula is compelling in its own way, and once I stopped waiting for the big build-up and the clincher and just settled back to enjoy it for what it was, I really got into it. At 800+ pages it's a long tale, probably unnecessarily so, but I enjoyed it."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"As a work of fantasy, Susanna Clarke's novel has a lot to recommend it. Clarke has invented an entirely new (and reasonably self-consistent) magical framework and embedded it in a (highly believable) faux history of Britain. The plot is pleasant, and the story skips along without a hint of self-consciousness.But for all its originality, Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norell does not belong in the first rank of Fantasy (i.e. alongside TolkienJ.R.R. Tolkien Boxed Set (The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings)or McDonaldAt the Back of the North Wind (Barbour Christian Classics)). The story is strong on setting and has a solid plot, but it lacks characterization. The transparency of the two magician protagonists is hardly justified by the conceit that they embody an ancient spell of the Raven King. I was disappointed that the women are treated as passive plot devices - by rights they should have dominated the plot. The two bad guys seem merely ridiculous until just before they are killed. The most lively characters (Childermass, the butler, and the Man with the Thistle-down Hair) receive far too little air-time.I'd like to read another novel by Ms. Clarke - one where she transfers a bit of her inventiveness to the characters."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"\\"Jonathon Strange & Mr Norrell\\" is set during the early 1800s in England, as the Napoleonic Wars are raging and England appears to be losing its battle. Mr Norrell, a serious-minded and stubbornly uncharismatic character, appears on the scene claiming to be a magician who will restore the glory of English magic. Through several key acts Norrell proves that he is no joke and becomes the toast of London society, complete with two hangers-on named Drawlight and Lascelles -- who are more than worthy of an episode of \\"Entourage\\". The arrogant young Jonathon Strange steals some of Norrell's thunder by coming out as another magician, albeit one in need of guidance and teaching. He becomes Norrell's pupil and soon begins to live up to his enormous potential. But after Strange returns from serving as Lord Wellington's personal magician in Spain to help fight off Napoleon the two magicians begin to clash over their ideals for English magic and the course it should take. Norrell wants to censor its history and to prevent people from practicing the art because he does not believe their \\"inferior\\" intellects are up to the task. Strange wants to learn about the history that Norrell has hidden from him and to see magic proliferate and thrive as it once did. The two magicians clash and part ways to bitterly pursue their ideas and to trash the other in the public eye. Ironically, this parting of ways is not the big conflict in Clarke's novel, as the dustjacket would have you believe. There's a subplot involving a mean-spirited fairy with thistle-down hair that takes some nasty twists and turns until it overtakes the plot completely.Clarke's writing is exceptionally good, taking on a fantastic subject with cleverness and a sharp, biting wit. Her debut novel is extraordinarily ambitious and Clarke is, for the most part, up to the task. She's just a little TOO ambitious in the end. The story she has set up requires a great degree of forethought and planning (Clarke even invents a clever history for English magic that appears in footnotes scattered throughout the book), but in the end she stirs in a few too many ingredients. For example: having set the novel during the Napoleonic Wars it makes sense for Clarke to have her magicians rub elbows with Lord Wellington, and Strange's adventures with Wellington's army in Spain are fascinatingly creative. But when she contrives to have Lord Byron show up and butt heads with Jonathon Strange in Italy one cannot help but feel that he has only appeared to suit Clarke's interest in including a famous writer of the time in her story. About fifty pages could have been shaved off right there had Lord Byron's role been reduced to a cameo instead of the deviation that it becomes. With all of the time that Clarke devotes to every little detail of her story it is surprising that she glosses over the subject of religion vs. magic almost completely. She makes mention of it passingly three or four times in almost 800 pages, but never explains how the two effect each other exactly. There is mention that a letter stuffed into a bible is protected from magic, and that when England converted away from Catholicism it changed the way spells are cast -- but there is no explanation of what the relevance of this is! Perhaps I'm being picky (it wouldn't be the first time), but I thought it would have been very interesting to explore that dimension further, especially when one considers that Clarke gave so much thought to every other detail. It is also unfortunate that Clarke's characters are so uniformly unappealing in the end. She never pretends to make Norrell likable -- indeed, it is a major plot point that he can be a crashing bore at times and is a self-righteous prig at others -- but it is disappointing that his counterpart, Jonathon Strange, becomes so self-involved and irritating by the novel's halfway point. Add the surly gentleman with the thistle-down hair to the mix and it becomes impossible to tell who you should be rooting for in the end. The ending of Clarke's saga as a whole was a little disappointing to me after such a long set-up (possible spoilers ahead). Two of the characters are done away with in a random fashion that doesn't fit Clarke's otherwise meticulous planning -- as if she had to get them out of the way before she could get to the big finale and didn't quite care if their exits made sense or not. Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell are surprisingly -- and disappointingly -- inconsequential in the final showdown, and the resolution feels like we are being cheesily set up for a sequel. I suppose a sequel wouldn't be such a bad thing, but let's hope that Ms. Clarke's editors are a little more stern next time."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"This book is about magic and magicians, but Harry Potter it ain't! It is much more dark and Victorian. Those who enjoy reading writers such as Dickens with the long, tedious, wordy manner of description will find this book fascinating. Those who prefer to get down to the action will not.I won't say that the book is without merit. I didn't hate it but I have a hard time saying I enjoyed it. I kept following the convoluted path expecting it to get better, more interesting, it never did. But once you've been a ways down the path you feel bound to finish it.Light summer reading it definitely is not but if you have a lot of patience and persistence and you have a thing about dark magical intricacies you might enjoy it."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"I bought this book because of my love of fantasy, especially of the Mieville and Gaimen vein, but enjoyed it not so much for its fantasy and magic, but as a well written comedy of manners, done in a distinctive and consistent style that might suggest descriptors such as Victorian or Jane Ayre.Indeed the magic is not done well. It is unruly and lacks a the consistency of a Scott Card or George Martin novel, and hence perhaps the comparisons to the Harry Potter books where magic also varies from vast and easy to small and tricky with little internal logic, but there I think the comparison should end. The magicians, on the other hand, are well formed and enjoyable despite, and becuase of, all their conceits and faults. The opposing malevolence is also well crafted, subtle yet wild and dangerously amoral.The \\"comedy\\" is of the driest type, matching the period of the writing style. So droll that I'd imagine many readers would say \\"what comedy\\", and find this a tedious journey towards resolving a thin and un-original plot. The pace does pick up in the latter half of the book, and yet moreso towards the end, but this is a novel to be savoured and those wanting a stirring story will probably be left wanting."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"I have tried, twice, to get through this book.

Subjectiveness be damned, I cannot for the life of me understand how anyone got through this overwritten, overwrought, meandering mess of a...something...I hate to say \\"novel\\".

Many people obviously loved this book, and there are some very witty lines and clever descriptions, but there are too many great books out there for me to invest time slogging through page after arid page in search of a literary oasis.

And after just a few footnotes, it became clear that Clarke had done an insane amount of work on the background. She probably has in her notes a complete history of English magic from 1100 to the present. This is comparable to Tolkien, who created an entire world just to tell the story of the Lord of the Rings.But for some reason, none of this magic seems to have made much of a difference: there are folk tales told about fairies and the Raven King, and an obscure section of law dealing with magic, but that's it. Norrell and Strange, the eponymous wizards, are said to be mere shadows of the great wizards of old. Even so, Strange can move mountains and rivers, and even transports the city of Brussels from Belgium to America.So why is the history in this novel nearly identical to the one in our world? Why didn't some wizard of old transport Paris or Brest to the middle of the Atlantic during one of the innumerable wars between England and France? For that matter, why are there no French (or Spanish, or German, etc.) magicians?This could easily be overlooked if the characters or story were interesting, but that's not the case. Most of the characters are either unsympathetic or worse, boring. There might be an interesting story in here, but it's lost in lots and lots of padding. There is usually a stage at the beginning of a novel where the action doesn't advance very quickly because the author is setting the stage, presenting the characters, and introducing plot elements that will become important later on. We don't mind that it's slow, because it promises that if the setup is done properly, the main story will be the better for it. Unfortunately, JS & Mr. N never delivers on that promise.After 500 pages, I gave up from lack of interest. And oddly enough, I haven't flipped to the back to see how it ends, because there are no lingering questions. No \\"does he kill the villain?\\", no \\"who does the heroine go off with?\\", no \\"how do they manage to save the world?\\" After 500 pages of introduction, Clarke still hasn't managed to introduce the central element of conflict that can drive the plot.If some kindly editor takes a red pencil to this novel and cuts it to half its length, it might be worth reading. But if you think a novel should include a story, don't bother."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"I know I've read a good book, when I turn the last page and say \\"wow, that was good!\\". That didn't happen for me with this book. It wasn't a page-turner for me. For me, it was a lack of excitement and adventure in the book. If you find war exciting, then maybe you'll like this book, because that's where most of the book \\"moves.\\" Otherwise, I found it very slow-paced. There are some moments in the book where there's some mystery and excitement, but they don't last for long.I wouldn't recommend buying the book, but if you've nothing great to read this would be okay if you needed something to read and you could borrow it from someone or the library."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"I normally shy away from the bestseller list as most of what's on it is rather plebian. Not so for JONATHAN STRANGE and a few others. Things are looking up.STRANGE is, well, strange. But it's also wonderful. It's the tale of two magicians who are in the process of restoring magic's good name. All of this during the ninteenth century admist English history, Napoleon, books, and politics. Talk about your formulas for success.As if premise isn't enough, the author has taken writing to an entire new level. His portraits of the characters are three, four, and five deminisional. Truly magical, and I mean that in more than the obvious sense of the word.Would also recommend several other books, though they're completely different from this one (why would you want to read the same thing twice?) &quot;The Five People You Meet in Heaven,&quot; &quot;Secret Life of Bees&quot; and &quot;Bark of the Dogwood.&quot; All are good and worth a shot."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"A great, imaginative story that could have been more effectively told in half the length.I ended up skipping whole pages b/c the extraneous descriptions and actions went on and on and on.I liked the story, but the book was torture to get through in some spots."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"I listened to a review of this book on radio 5 live (UK radio). All the reviewers were very exited and enthusiastic about this. One even went so far as to compare it to Tolkein.

I'd never heard of it before, even though I live in York and have had a few drinks in The Olde Starre Inn over the years. Then (today) I dropped in on a friend and he had a copy, and I learnt that it is an International Bestseller, soon to be made into a film by the 'Lord of the Rings' people. And then I find that the web is full of it. Funnily enough there really is a York Society of Magicians (of the Magic Circle kind). And Uri Geller keeps visiting. And this evening I have read about 20 of the reviews here (and intend to read them all eventually) most of which seem to be criticising the book for what it's not. My current thoughts about it: definitely good for the York Tourist Industry (eventually); A Great Bit of Myth-Making; Not So Much a Novel, More a Powerful Spell; where's the sequel?Well worth borrowing from the library."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this book. I was wondering at its almost 800 pages, but the author kept things moving with new and, dare I say it, magical, characters and happenings. It is like reading a Dickens novel and that is part of its graciousness. The two magicians, Mr. Norrell & Jonathan Strange, are as disparate as they can be in their thoughts about how magic should be handled, but their lives are intertwined and they must face their future together.How they each use their magical abilities and how it affects the many people that find themselves in their sphere makes for fascinating reading.The author has a great imagination, with well drawn characters, especially the deliciously evil fairy. I anxiously await Ms. Clarke's next novel, but, please, Ms. Clarke, skip the footnotes - they were the only thing that detracted from the story & weren't really necessary."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"I got through 200 pages before giving this book away to someone who actually cares about magic, which apparently I do not. I would probably enjoy a book written by this author on some other subject, as I cannot fault the writing at all."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"I was really looking forward to reading this \\"Harry Potter for adults\\" but 200 pages in I realized I was still looking for a plot. The most magical thing that happened were potential story lines that would disappear or which took the reader on rides to nowhere special at all. I wanted to give this \\"story\\" more of a chance because of all the good reviews it has gotten, but I didn't care about a single one of the characters. This story reminded me of what it might be like to visit a retirement home to visit with seniors - except instead of hearing interesting stories of times past which revealed universal truths about the human experience, they just droned on and on about disjointed half-memories. Obviously this book was a labor of love, but it's also a labor to read. Honestly, this was such a painful experience that I could feel myself get a little older with every flip of the page."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"It took me forever to get thru this book. 781 pages of sheer tedium. But stubborn as I am I just kept plugging away hoping it would get better. I found it to be just as dull at the end as it was in the beginning. I must have missed something as I do not understand why and how it is on the best seller lists and for so long too. This book was so arduous to read and I was happy when I finally got to the last page."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"Must say that how ever enjoyable the book and the Miss Manners writing style was (yes, it's Miss Manners' voice narrating the novel), it should have run no longer than 300 pages and not the 800 that it does.The ending is barely satisfying as it turns out the two magicians, Norrell and Strange, do not do battle. Throughout, the writer \\"surprises\\" by avoiding conflict, but the avoidance also deflates the story. The two magicians also do not remain the main characters of the book, despite the book's title. The supporting cast takes over at the end, does all the work, and does it by accident. This diffuses the little momentum the book has.The characters seem never to know what's really happening around them, which is realistic, but they never figure it out either so there's not one ah-ha! moment. The author adheres to a consistent \\"logic\\" when handling magic except for the glaring inconsistency at the end when a major spell persists beyond its conjurer although all other spells from this same person die out.On the plus side, there is a touching love story brought to a fitting conclusion.The length and diffused plot are, I think, meant to be entertaining in a gossipy parlor-room conversation style. And it is if you don't want anything more out of a book, or several days' reading labor. You can get as much from Miss Manners' columns.I would recommend devoting time to some poetic writing and Welsh magic from, say, Alan Garner, instead. If you want something longer, look up and get the delicious American \\"Folk of the Air\\" by Peter S. Beagle."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"I found it both really hard to get into this book and really hard to stay with it as well. Although it is well written, language and construction wise, and the ideas it contains are interesting, the delivery failed to grip me as a reader. The author has adopted an early 19th century writing style, which although clever, is possibly one of the things that helps keep the early 21st century reader from easy immersion in the story. I also found the footnotes irritating - there were just too many of them and I found they distracted from the 'flow' of the story rather than enhancing it. The main negatives however, were the lack of almost any attractive / sympathetic characters and the very slow pace of the narrative. The combination of these two factors led me to 'plod' through the book out of a sense of duty (given the hype) rather than reading with a sense of keen enjoyment. There was no reading through to the wee small hours with this book and nor did I ever tell myself that I could just 'squeeze in a few extra chapters' before the main business of the day - and end up reading practically all day!"},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"Susanna Clarke's \`Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell' is undoubtedly unique, but despite the rave reviews by hallowed publications such as the NYT etc, it doesn't live up to the hype. Not by a long shot. The craze for the Potter series may well have helped create a marketplace for this kind of novel, but fantasy buffs will be disappointed. There's very little in the way of interesting magic - let alone comic hi-jinx - taking place and the theoretical and philosophical arguments pertaining to magic and its use are dreary in the extreme. The two main characters, Strange and Norrell, are equally unlikeable, the tone of the book is oddly nationalistic, and the plot - two dull magicians battling for supremacy in the context of Britain's battle against Napoleon, is hardly a page-turner. Which is a pity as if there's a dire shortage of humour and excitement, there's an oversupply of pages, and only the culling of around 600 of them could save this turgid tome from a non-stop snore fest. With contemporary British literature like this you start to wish the French had won."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"I bought this book because it had such good reviews, but found myself wanting to put it down often. Well, it is completely overrated and much too long. Although fairly well-written, it is slow and not exciting at all. I can at least say that about the Harry Potter series. Thing LONG and hard about bothering with this slow moving sleeper."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"I got this book for Christmas and, although it was hard for me to get going, I am very glad I stuck it out. It is, by far, one of the better books I've read in a while. The language suits the book perfectly (I felt as if I really were in the era of Strange and Norrell). As with all good books I was sad to finish it because I wanted it to go on and on."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"It is the very early 1800s, and the esteemed golden age of magic has declined to the point where it has become a theoretical and scholarly discipline among gentlemen rather than a practical one. King George III has become a raving lunatic. England is at war with France and could use some magic to defeat it. Along comes the colorless recluse Gilbert Norrell, who seems to be the only practicing magician left in England. Perhaps this is because he hoards all the books of magic that are known to exist. He is called upon by the York Society of magicians to demonstrate his abilities, which he only agrees to do on the condition that they all stop studying magic. As the only remaining magician free to practice the craft, he is now in great demand by the government, who uses his talents to help win the war against Napoleon.However, it is lonely being the sole magician in England, so Mr. Norrell takes on the young apprentice Jonathan Strange. Norrell is conservative where Strange is progressive. Norrell reviles the legendary Raven King, a powerful magician raised by faeries during the glory days of magic, but Strange believes the Raven King's magic should be studied and appreciated. With such conflicting opinions on the practice of magic, it is inevitable that a confrontation will ensue between the two magicians.This book is brilliant in its treatment of magic as a rule-based gentlemanly art, studied by scholars and accepted in the highest social circles. As the story progresses, there is a gradual shift from this civilized magic of parlor tricks and war tactics to the far more ancient and untamed magic practiced by faeries. Before long, a pervasive dark magic overlays reality and is reflected in every mirror and rain puddle. Clarke is able to portray both flavors of magic with masterful skill, and she blends them into a mood-setting whole that is unusual and innovative.There is such a seamless blend of history and magical fantasy that it is hard to tell where real English history leaves off and an imaginary history of magic takes over. Strange and Norrell carry on their business alongside the Duke of Wellington and poet Lord Byron. Clarke tells the story with wit and polish. She sets a realistic tone with meticulous detail on societal structure and mannerisms of Jane Austen's time. Her use of quaint phrasing and such spelling as \\"chuse\\" for \\"choose\\" and \\"shew\\" for \\"show\\", as well as use of fictitious footnotes on folklore and the history of magic, add to the realism. Yes, this is a long novel. But that effectively pulls the reader into a world where Parliament and magic, history and enchantment, and gentlemen and faeries work side-by-side. The book is so full of well-articulated imagery and magical surprises that the story line speeds along. Forget comparisons of this novel to Harry Potter. I recommend it as a refreshingly unique read.Eileen Rieback"},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"Oh how I wanted to dislike this tome. Oh, how I wanted the hype to be excessive, the unfair advantages avenged, the assistances from well-knowns to be misplaced. Alas, it was good - very good - extremely good. So much so, that by the end I wanted more."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"If you heard what I heard before reading this book, you would think this was going to be a \\"grown up\\" Harry Potter book. However, it was a big disappointment. I have also read the first 5 Harry Potter books and would certainly recommend them over this one.The best part of this book is in the beginning where Mr. Norrell raises a lady from the dead and makes a deal with the \\"Thistle Down Hair\\" character. There are three characters in the book that are taken away by the Thistle Down Hair character - They are enchanted. One of these three just happens to be the wife of Jonathan Strange, who has supposedly died.Jonathan Strange becomes the pupil of Mr. Norrell but Mr. Norrell does not tell Jonathan about the Thislte Down Hair character. Jonathan and Mr. Norrell have a falling out and Jonathan goes off on his own. He then figures a way to summon and see the Thislte Down Hair character - to enter into his world. While he does this, he see his wife, the butler, and the lady Mr. Norrell raised from the dead in the beginning of the book. As a result of being able to get into the enchanted world, Jonathan in basically surrounded by a black funnel that follows him anyplace he goes. This was placed upon him by the Thistle Down Hair character.The end of the book is disappointing because Jonathan is still stuck in the black funnel and is not able to be with his wife, who he does manage to rescue.This book is too long for the lack of action. It was somewhat of a chore to get through. If you are not into the book by page 400 or so, don't bother going on to the end.I was expecting something better and was disappointed in the end."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"Great, highly original alternate history/fantasy novel that ranks at or above Mervyn Peake's Gormenghast, Christopher Priest's The Prestige, and Philip Pullman's Golden Compass series (all of which I also highly recommend). The older style of writing may put some off (though it is much more readable than Peake), but I thought it lent the book a tremendous sense of atmosphere and even mystery (who is the speaker/author?).My only complaint is that the book is so heavy that it gave me a neck spasm from holding it so long, but even that is an endorsement: I enjoyed the writing so much that I didn't skim and read slowly, despite the pain!"},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"As a three-books-a-week reader, I looked forward to Clarke's opus. Great disappointment! The novel seems to have been written for major book reviewers of the world instead of readers.The characters are one-dimensional -- even Jonathan doesn't come to life -- the insider jokes are tiring, and the plot's twists and turns are too obviously manipulated.All in all -- thumbs down."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"I was excited to read this book but could not get past the first hundred pages. It was just dull, and I found myself forcing myself to read it.It's well written, but there is too much information to take in, the end notes were annoying, and I didn't enjoy the form of the novel. It was just off-putting altogether."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"I never \\"got\\" the Harry Potter thing. As a lifelong reader of Tolkein the appeal of a children's book about magic, however thick, eludes me. When I read the original reviews for this book in other media I was intrigued not by the comparisons to Harry Potter but by the substance of the book itself. I think that if the Harry Potter comparisons are marketing driven, they do a disservice to the author. This novel is much more mature, and more of an indulgence in language and character than any children's novel could hope to be. Perhaps some of the other 'adults' that are such fans of the children's fantasy genre ought to work their way up to grown up literature. Harry Potter is a good start, but the writen word is meant to inspire and entertain on its own. You dont need a thrill a minute. An English moor delivered by the pen of a competent author, and appreciated by a sophisticated reader are what literature is all about."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"This bookis infused with the spirit of Charles Dickens. The words take you back to Victorian England, and there is where you want to stay. This book beat The Crystal Cave, which I had thouroughly enjoyed. It cannot be compared to Harry Potter; it is too sophisticated! I only hope Ms. Clarke has a sequel in her; or even another different book. She needs to keep writing. Charles would be proud!"},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"After over 700 people have weighed in on this book, what is there to add? I found the way the author invented an entire alternative magical history of England to be very creative (although the footnotes became tiresome). Mr Norrell, a crabby, insecure type, sets himself the task of restoring magic to England in the early 19th century. Magic apparently flourished in the early Middle Ages but then inexplicably died out. But Mr. Norrell wants only a genteel, controlled, domesticated form of magic -- not the wild, unpredictable powerful type that lies buried just under the surface.Mr Norrell finds no acceptance in the England of his day, embroiled in the Napeolonic wars, until he brings the newly-wedded bride of a cabinet minister back to life. But in doing so, he makes a pact with the devil that continues to haunt the pages of this overlong book.Another magician arises -- Jonathan Strange. He is more normal in his appetites and more daring in his ambitions than his mentor. At first the two get along but increasingly a rift develops between them. Strange sets out to help the armies of the Duke of Wellington in the Iberian Peninsula and plays a crucial role in the British victory.Much more happens in this massive tome -- which ultimately lost my attention. Despite the author's skill and erudition and imaginative feat in conjuring up a new reality (she is the true magician of the book), the novel lacked heart. The characters were not sufficiently vibrant and compelling to justify such Dickensian or Tolstoyan length. It's an act of hubris to create a book such as this. I applaud the author's ambition and imagination -- but it could have done with some trimming."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"Despite the positive reviews here, I found this book drudgerous. After reading patiently through more than 2/3 of the book and waiting for a plot complication, point, or reasonable struggle to emerge, I made the decision to stop reading the book.There are too many chapters in this book filled with contrived, and poor, period dialogue and nothing else, no plot struggle, no complication, only scene, characters, and dialogue - no contribution or struggle. I felt like the chapters had as much substance as an episode in a 20 year long running soap opera. There was as much substance here as ash after a forest fire. I would not necessarily discount the author though since modern fiction is nearly as much in the editing as in the writing.I am a patient reader when the work demands it. This work didn't. It was frustrating, boring, sophomoric, and poorly edited."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"I had read somewhere that Strange and Norrell was an adult 'Harry Potter' and was given high marks. An adult Harry Potter? Wow! Even better! I was fooled. I found S&N slow and plodding with but a couple of imaginative scenes that tended to pull - no, drag - me along. This is in comparison to the Harry Potter of which I read the first three in the series. Harry Potter I found totally absorbing and fun. (I read fantasy and SF for fun and don't like the genre to beat around the bush. It either grabs me or I chuck it aside.) I decided after 200 pages to chuck Strange and Norrell aside giving my copy to my library."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"Not surprisingly people are making comparisons between this novel and Tolkien or J. K. Rowling, yet it's a wonderfully original story about these two guys re-discovering the forgotten art of magic.

I rarely read fantasy books, but I couldn't help but be enchanted by this quick-paced, intriguing tale of epical and classical (and magical) proportions."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"With such an intriguing topic and an obvious readers' market for this type of work, it's an embarrassment this book came out to be so weak. The writing is immature [\\"And so they rose from their seats in the icy drawing-room (where this conversation had taken place) and went up to...\\"]. Obviously.... the discussion just took place so it's safe to assume the \\"icy drawing-room\\" is where is all happened... it's border line insulting... The style feels unnatural, often tedious, struggling with redundant, endless paragraphs, and the tiresome use of old English makes the experience a painful deciphering job. The flow is constantly being interrupted by lengthy and irrelevant footnotes (in some pages 80% of content are footnotes). The \\"footnote\\" concept is in itself interesting but seems to be misused in many instances sounding like the author just had an after thought or is unable to fold the information into the current story line. This is neither a fantasy novel, nor an historic one. Patience I'm afraid is not enough to enjoy this book. A thorough editing job would be needed to make this a digestible book. A missed opportunity."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"&#65279;Let's start with what this book is not:1. It's not Jane Austen: Jane may have used archaic language, but she is neither boring nor long-winded. If this was a genuine imitation of Austen, it would be one quarter of the length. Austen studied economy. Clarke does not. And Clarke, though she tries, also can't manage Austen's wit; she imitates it without having it.2. It's not \`Harry Potter for Adults': shrewd marketing ploy, but there is no resemblance other than the inclusion of magic. Rowling isn't much of a technician, but she is an excellent storyteller, with a casual, throw-away wit, which makes her work the exact opposite of this book. \\"JS & MN\\" is so calculated it's practically a literary computer.3. It's not Charles Dickens: Charley is long-winded, but at least his characters have life. And he was a lot later.4. It's not a Victorian novel. Victoria's reign started in 1837, and this book is set about thirty years or so earlier. So it's supposed to be Georgian pastiche, but it never comes alive, as some historical novels do. I have never understood the point of trying to use an archaic writing style if the culture and ethos that produced it is long gone. I hated Charles Palliser's \\"The Quincunx\\" to which this book bears an unfortunate resemblance; it was a similar exercise in stylistic futility. But if you're going to do it, get your idiom right. I'm sure Clarke thought using what she deemed to be the style of the book's setting was clever, but that's all it is. It's a cake-walk: a needlessly elaborate dance, the point of which is to show off, rather than make an aestetic point. The style always feels forced and fights the content the whole way, eventually winning a Pyrrhic victory.5. It's not interesting: When you read your first dull resurrection, you know you're in trouble. I had to flog myself to read farther: life's way, way too short. And I've read and enjoyed some very dry books in my time. The only remaining mystery is all those glowing reviews. This isn't Austen, or Rowling, or Dickens, or even Thackeray: it's Mrs. Humphrey Ward. (A once very popular, and now completely forgotten 18th century novelist.)

I appreciated the depth of story, but I admit I got tired of reading footnotes, especially just to get referred to other footnotes. It broke my concentration. To suggest the world created by Clarke can step to Tolkein in term of depth and breadth is ludicrous.

The characters are very shallow in design, with quite a clinical approach to their descriptions. They are equally stand-offish which makes it hard to relate to the characters or feel for them.The book is written in giant paragraphs. It makes it hard to follow dialog when they are all smashed into the same paragraph. With the old British way of speaking, and the unusual names, it is hard to follow the conversations.I know people who have loved the book, and one of them actually recommended it to me since we have similar taste in books. This was not one of them.

I wanted to read an interesting story, and I just could not remain INTERESTED. Maybe it wasn't meant to be read as a story. Maybe it was meant to be viewed as a work of art with it's Dickens-like prose. Maybe.Whatever interest I had upon picking up the book had disappeared after 100 pages or so.

Let me first say that anyone who compares this book to the Harry Potter series or The Lord of the Rings should not be allowed to read ever again. This book is so, so bad I need to dust off my thesaurus to properly describe it.The author hasn't the faintest clue about plotting. Reading this is like slogging through waist-deep mud for three days straight. It just goes on and on and never gets anywhere. It doesn't really end, it just sort of tires out, with nary a climax in sight.But the author apparently finds herself frightfully clever. The one character is never named but rather only identified as \\"the gentleman with the thistledown hair.\\" This affectation is annoyting from the start but after about, oh, 1000 repetitions of this phrase I wanted to start blacking it out.As for the magic, suspension of disbelief doesn't help here. There's no internal logic as to what can be done, by whom, or under what conditions.And the characters ... Mr. Norrell is insufferably pompous and Strange, who should hold some interest, being a magician and all, is as fascinating as oatmeal.

These suggestions affect which books I purchase from Amazon. I think it is pretty silly of them to try to force you to write a review. I guess I will start using the bookyap website more often since I don't feel like writing this same tale over again for every book I enjoy."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"While I found Clarke's writing to be imaginative and charming in places, I found the book to be slow, very slow. New characters and plot devices are introduced with every chapter, creating confusion and muddle. I fell asleep reading it for nearly three straight months. Perhaps that's why I felt it to be slow and confusing, but for the very reasons that others enjoyed it, I found it a battle to read. I hoped for a brilliant ending, but it felt like Clarke got tired of it and just wrapped it up. Somehow."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"I liked Jonathan Strange: I appreciated Susanna Clarke's twist on the standard magician story and found the book's central characters very compelling. But readers beware: the book is frequently boring. For quicker-paced sci-fi summer reading, I would recommend John Twelve Hawks' brand new The Traveler. Unlike Jonathan Strange, The Traveler never plods: it moves like a speeding bullet from start to finish. Plus, it's every drop as erudite as Jonathan Strange: it delivers a blistering critique of the post-9/11 surveillance state. For a summer read with smarts and action, The Traveler is your best option."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"I should have known something was up when my daughter-in-law said, \\"here, read this book!\\". Her tone was uncharacteristically challenging. I struggled to finish this tedious tome. It simply wasn't fun, and I didn't like the characters. When I read about magic I expect wizards and the like . This book isn't about that and to be fair it was handed to me I didn't buy it."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"I am glad I borrowed this book from a friend, who kept telling me it was marvellous.I tried, I really tried to read it. I stopped after more than 200 pages where almost nothing happened. Oh, well, to tell the truth, \\"some things\\" happened, but they were so uninteresting that I could not believe. The plot? Nonsense. The style? A bad joke. No humor at all, terrible characters - I wished all of them died horribly, so at least something would happen.I have read many, many books, all my life. Dante, Milton, Tolstoi, Dostoievsky, Sinclair Lewis, Joyce, Dickens, Tolkien, J.K. Rowling. I like big books, I like historical books, I like fantasy and fiction. The problem here is that \\"Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell\\" is tedious, overrated, a total waste of paper. It is the first book I was glad I didn't finish. I regret every single moment I spent trying to find some sense in it. I kept reading, thinking something would finally happen. It didn't. It is simply stupid, bland, annoying.Save yourself some precious time and money, avoid this mess."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"Never having been one to be interested in magic, I was not at first intrigued by the premise of this novel. But the story, while dealing heavily with the subject, can be read on an entirely different level. Four and a half stars."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"I totally agree with many of the earlier reviews that this book is so slow that it demands you to be in the top .00001% in patience to finish it. Overall, a truly boring book."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"Most books, I think, suffer when wrapped in hyperbole from the press. Very, very few of them can live up. Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell, however, not only lives up, it surpasses anything wonderful written about it. There are simply no words to describe how glorious this book is. And, make no mistake, this is definitely not, \\"Harry Potter for grownups.\\" The magic is different, it's darker, and it's far more wintry, despite Clarke's occasional, and charming, flights of fancy.The tone of Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell reminded me far more of Jane Austen and Charles Dickens (two of Clarke's favorite authors) than it did of J.K.Rowling. For one thing, there's nothing modern about this book. The tone and atmosphere are definitely nineteenth century. Even the spelling of many words is nineteenth century, e.g., \\"chuse\\" for \\"choose\\" and \\"shewed\\" for \\"showed.\\" Although many readers may find this annoying, I loved it and thought it added greatly to the charm and authenticity of the book.Clarke seamlessly weaves her own magical world into actual history. So seamlessly that there were times when I caught myself actually believing in Clarke's make believe world. The book is replete with footnotes, something I usually detest. However, Clarke's footnotes are delightful and only add to the verisimilitude of her story.Despite the fact that this book numbers nearly eight hundred pages of small type, it's not at all \\"wordy\\" and there is absolutely no \\"filler.\\" Don't, by any means, be intimidated by this book's length. It's so well constructed and so well paced, it's actually a faster read than many books only half its size.The ending, which can't be predicted, is bittersweet, heartbreaking, unforgettable and, best of all, inevitable. It also sets up a sequel, something I read Clarke is working on now. And, although much of the book enjoys a rather leisurely pace, Clarke picks up this pacing near the end, so that the reader, once he or she reaches the last two hundred pages or so, feels almost compelled to finish the book, no matter what he or she has to do or how late at night it is.Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell is, quite simply, a \\"ripping good yarn,\\" masterfully crafted and flawlessly written by a woman who promises to be one of today's most imaginative storytellers. Don't miss it; to do so would only be denying yourself one of the greatest pleasures in the world of literature. Yes, it really is that good."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"Okay, you have to have a marathon-attitude when you pick up this book--it's an 800 page whopper. However every single word, every single page is worth the time it takes to read it. It is the first book in a long time that had me fully engaged, was so good I felt no need to skim paragraphs, or skip pages.The writer is a genius with words. She brings you back to the era of Jane Austen, with all the civility and politeness of the time, and weaves in a story about magic and magicians as if it is as natural as the countryside. It is utterly wonderful, singsong prose, with a dance between two imperfect characters whom you cannot help liking regardless.If you are a big reader, you cannot miss this book; it doesn't matter if you care for straight fiction or fiction of the more fantastic kind--you'll enjoy it. What a breath of fresh air.Thank you Susanna Clarke."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"I think it is very misleading to dub this book \\"The Harry Potter for adults.\\" In both books, great magic is done and the setting is England. I suppose that being written by a female author also adds some Harry-Potterishness to it but there the similarity stops. Far from being a page turner, this book is most appropriate for those who relish words; those who love rhythmic sounds and smooth, meandering sentence structures. You can't be in a hurry to finish it because skimming and skipping paragraphs will cause you to miss some great stuff. Off the top of my head, I can't think of a single other book that it is similar to so hats off too Susanna Clarke for writing such an original work.The characters were so well drawn, they felt like they would pop off the pages and step into your living room. (Indeed, maybe Strange would drop in via my mirror?) Norrell, the old-school and stuffy teacher, is contrasted so well with Strange that the dynamics of their relationships offers much insight into the teacher/pupil relationship. Perhaps my favorite thing of all is how completely and utterly realized this world of Susanna's is. She's built a whole alternate history for England complete with faeries and an inscrutable nameless king.A summary of the plot has already been done so I will not reiterate it here. Actually, I think that you get more out of the book if you know nothing of the plot beforehand. I do have one complaint. I felt like I knew these people so well that sometimes, I felt their actions didn't correspond to their characters. The mere fact that Norrell took Strange as a pupil still baffles me a bit, but it served the plot well. Overall, I think to be precise, I would actually give this book 4.51 stars."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"The problem with so many reviews and advertising on this book is that they bring to mind Harry Potter and other fantasy-genre novels. But that will set a reader up for disappointment - this is not your usual fantasy book. It's a work of literature, and an enchanting one at that.Like many of the great classical novels, it can be a bit difficult to get into, but it's worthwhile to continue until you have become absorbed by Clarke's style of writing and the world in which she places you. She's really quite clever, and her sense of humor is witty and subtle. The characters (especially after the first 1/3 of the book, when the action picks up and many things are really starting to happen all over) are very interesting and each has their own individual personality. And they aren't static, which I find most realistic. All the many characters that appear throughout the book either grow or fail as human beings in a world both longing for and fearing the return of English magic and the aid of fairies.Clarke has so perfectly developed this England, both in complicated past and intricate present, with a number of minor storylines and character plots building up to who-knows-what-end... The resolutions are not cheap, nor easy. None of the characters are perfectly good or bad - they are themselves, with their own system of logic and reasoning that lends to their choices.The magic herein is not as flamboyant as in many novels in the fantasy genre. Magic is, after all, a skill that has been nearly forgotten and is only now being re-learned, with only two practicing magicians able to figure it out, using the old books of ages long gone, and occasionally some rash guesswork. But as they both develop their skills, the magic grows increasingly more complicated and impressive. This is a story not merely of magic... but of gentlemen, of resolution for England's mysterious magical past, of moral conflicts, of supernatural dangers and delights, and most especially, a new way of approaching a subject that in many similar genre books has become tired imitation."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"I find it very odd that many of the previous reviewers said that they were unable to care about the characters in this book. I can't recall a book in which I cared about the characters _more_. They seemed like real people, and the footnotes (which I thought brilliant) simply made them seem more so. Not only did the characters seem real, but so did the world that Ms. Clarke created for them (or did she create the characters for the world, one wonders?). I am a voracious reader and have seldom, if ever, seen an imaginary world as fully realized as this--not even books with a modern, realistic setting are as convincing when it comes to perfectly rendered, but invisibly deployed details. This is the first book that I've read since I was a teenager that felt \\"right,\\" the first that I've wanted to hug when I finished it and the first that I ever had the (unfullfilled) urge to copy out onto my walls in tiny gold writing. I cannot deny that this book is not for everyone--a reader must like omniscient narrators, be sufficiently interested in details to explore (and enjoy!) the footnotes, and not be afraid of the rhythms of slightly formal speech and poetic description--but the rewards for those who _do_ read it are manifold. This book--with it's intricate setting, believable characters and gripping story--may become the standard by which I judge all following books that I read.An aside (or footnote, if you will): I believe that retail books are sold shrink-wrapped for one of two reasons. Either the book contains photographs or other pages that would be tempting to tear out, or (as in this case) the shrink-wrap serves to prevent the book from warping under its own weight if placed at the end of a row. I doubt that any bookseller, much as they might like to, would shrink-wrap something to obscure its lack of worth. :)"},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"Advice to the aspiring writer - if you must write an 800-page novel, take care with the structure of your narrative. I made it 360 pages into Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell. Napoleon had been defeated, but there were still 400+ pages to go, and I had no inkling what the point of the rest of the book would be. They were looking into a magical cure for the Madness of King George, but I didn't know whether that would become a major theme, or just a digression. There was a seemingly malevolent fairy lurking in the background, who might have become a major threat to British society; but again, I couldn't tell for sure, and didn't care enough to keep reading.Further, I found the magic incredible -- that is, I didn't believe it. If Muhammad himself can't move a mountain, there's no way in Hades some English twit will be relocating Spanish mountain ranges without breaking a sweat.The point when I gave up was when I fell asleep toward the end of a chapter, and the tome hit the floor with a resounding thud and scared the cat. It was due back at the library, and I didn't choose to renew it."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"I'm not sure I can do this book justice. It is utterly unique, combining aspects of fantasy and period novels without truly belonging to either genre. The pacing and language are from another era--a slower, more eloquent one. I was completely captivated by Susanna Clarke's world from the first page to the last, and can't wait for her next book."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"I just stopped reading this book on page 721. That's right I stopped with only about 60 pages to go, after having read every footnote and every word up to that point. Why? I just couldn't spend another hour of my life on this book. I skipped to the end and read the last few pages and found that it didn't matter that I stopped reading because nothing is really resolved at the end anyway. I would seem to be the perfect audience for this book. I love 19th century British novels and their elevated language and leisurely pace and I love the fantasy works of Mervyn Peake and John Crowley that some readers find difficult. The primary problem for me with this novel is that the characters are not human beings, but children's cartoon characters. They have no adult passions or emotional complexities. This novel is too philosophically and emtionally simplistic for adults and too slow and convoluted for children. I don't understand what these people are who are giving it five star reviews are seeing in it. If you want to spend days and days of your life reading a really long adult fantasy novel, there are several I'd suggest instead: The Gormenghast Trilogy by Peake, Little, Big by Crowley, The Little Country by Charles DeLint, Wreaththu by Storm Constantine, Imajica by Clive Barker or Bellefleur by Joyce Carol Oates. All of these novels should appeal to anyone who would pick up Clarke's book and these are MUCH better. Go check out other people's reviews of these novels and then do yourself a big favor and buy one of them instead of this nicely packaged, but pointless and forgettable, tome."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"This review is simply concerned with the kindle version, not the content. Some of the fun aspects of the book in print are the arcane and amusing faux footnotes. In the Kindle, the numbers should be a link to the footnote text, but they are not. One has to go to the table of contents, find the footnotes section, then search for that number. Come on, guys, this isn't rocket science."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"That should say a lot about how much I liked it. I'm a quick reader, and I usually devour books in one sitting, but I savored this one for a month. I would put it down, read a couple more books, watch some TV, start reading again... you get the point. The book is very interesting and entertaining, the characters are extremely complex and the plot, though slowly developed, is absolutely great. One of the things I loved most about this book is how it treated the existence of magic as a matter of fact. It mentioned old magicians and their books and spells, and it had these great footnotes that sometimes described entire stories within. By the end of the book, I was thoroughly convinced that magic had once been abundant in England. Another incredible aspect of this book is that it defies classification: it's fantastical without being Harry Potter, it's historical fiction without being Philippa Gregory, and it's a love story without being Twilight-y (thank God!). So, should you read it? Yes. Will you like it? I honestly do not know. The only thing I can tell you is that I did."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"I do not know how long it has been since i enjoyed a book like this one.

Miss. Clarke does such a wonderfull job weaving a story colored with actual Historic figures and dates that at times you are in awe of what she has accomplished. Suffice to say I loved this book up until the last fifty or so pages. I will not expound further only this is a read worth taking a journey worth going on but if we are going to travel through england and europe in the early 1800s for 780 pages then why not finish the job and go the extra 220 pages and complete a novel worth completing.What would the Raven King have to say?"},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"This book is not worth the 800 page investment of time.

The last 150 pages are superbly done, and almost able to stand on their own. Only if you have great patience, should you attempt to read the entire book...."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"Most fantasy strikes for the bad ripoffs of Tolkien, or other well-known (though not always great) authors.But Susanna Clarke dazzles in a subtle way in her debut novel, \\"Jonathan Clarke & Mr. Norrell,\\" a sprawling opus that took a decade to write. Think if Jane Austen had written fantasy about feuding magicians, and you'll have a pretty good idea of how this reads.It's the early 19th century, in England. The Napoleonic wars threaten England, but that's not the only struggle going on. Magic is all but dead in England; the so-called magicians don't actually want to handle it, but want to leave it to old books and stories. Once the English magicians were powerful and respected, but now they just write boring essays about magic. Except for Mr. Norrell, a cautious little Yorkshire man who taught himself how to do magic.However, things take a twist when he gives his help in the battle against Napolean -- a new magician enters the scene, the enthusiastic and charming Jonathan Strange. The two magicians begin to work together, but things begin to go awry when Mr. Norrell realizes that Jonathan is attracted to all magic -- including the more dangerous varieties. He's increasingly fascinated by the legend of the Raven King, a changeling child who ruled Faerie and Earth...Historical fantasies have rarely been as detailed and rich as this one -- usually either the \\"historic\\" or the \\"fantasy\\" is abused. Often the best authors can do is write alternate universe stories where America lost the Revolution, the Roman Empire never fell, and so on.But Susanna Clarke shatters that with her richly-realized look at 19th-century Britain, with unique magic and a slight mythologic twist. This is an England where, even though magic is stagnant, it's still something of rich power, awesome presence, and the creatures involved in it are completely otherworldly.Clarke keeps her writing solid, detailed and dignified, also footnoting extensively, with little wry winks and nudges to keep the book from being too serious. It does get tedious at times, and the finale gets a bit stretched out, but the positive far outweighs the negative. She has a flair for the historical parts of the book, keeping dates, battles, and political movement entwined in the plot.But she doesn't neglect the fantasy either; there's a mythic flavor in the story of the Raven King and the old magicians, reminiscent of old legends from ancient times. Her handling of magic is especially good -- less is more, and hints of past greatness make the magic all the more stunning.The title characters are the best of the book -- both are products of their times. Mr. Norrell is cautious, studious, ingenious and quiet, the sort of person you could imagine chatting with some classic author. Strange has more of the wild, society-be-damned wit that characterized some great artists of that time. And Norrell's faithful servant is just one of many solid supporting characters.If Jane Austen had written like Diana Wynne-Jones, the result would have been something like \\"Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell.\\" Well-written, enticing and thoroughly original, this is a keeper."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"The story pulled me in like a tractor beam and it was almost impossible for me to stop reading this wonderfully written magical fantasy. Susanna Clarke makes the impossible seem plausible and even believable with her matter-of-fact style and impeccable attention to detail. For the magickally and metaphysically minded reader, Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell should prove to be an exceptionally satisfying and delightful diversion into other mysterious worlds and fantasy. Some have called this Harry Potter for adults and I cannot entirely disagree, but this style of writing far exceeds the Potter series which was, after all, written with children in mind. For readers who enjoy faeries, good literature, magic and English historical literature I believe this will be a valued addition to their collections."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"As a lover of 18th and 19th century literature, I was very happy with this book. I read it as a prose experiment on the order of Possession, or some other such title. It is fantasy fiction in that it employs elements of the magical and surreal (it is about the relationship between two magicians and an enemy from the fairy kingdom). It is in part historical fiction utilizing fictitious characters along with historical characters in the manner of Sophia Lee. I read this book immediately on the heels of reading Camilla, by Frances Burney, and so I was struck at how well she captured the prose style of that same time period. Frances Burney would have been alive at the time in which the novel's events take place. She was even part of Napoleon's court for a time, and Napoleon is very involved in this story.I was impressed at how Clarke's prose in this book resembles Burney's, and I believe it was because they are both writers of comedies. With one exception, all of Burney's works were comedies, and Clarke's book is in fact a comedy written in period prose. However, Clarke's book is funnier because it caters to more modern sensibilities. It employs a more modern humor, though still written and packaged in the style of another age. As good as it is, Johnathan Strange & Mr. Norrell would never have been published during the times that it describes. I remember one passage in which the author comments on the poverty of the royal princes, who were obliged to support households full of illegitimate children. Such a sartorial comment would never have made it into print in early 19th century England.This book has been described as a sort of Harry Potter for adults, but I don't know about that. Certainly it shares some elements with the Harry Potter story. I think it is a very different story and the comparison with the Harry Potter books is a bit of a stretch. The novel just has a different quality and is really trying to achieve something else in terms of the prose and its play with mythic themes. While reading it I wondered what A.S. Byatt might say about it. You might remember the fuss that she made over the Potter books. Would she perceive this novel as being more \\"tasteful\\", or \\"highbrow\\"? I don't know.It is very much a historical novel, and among other things, it's good comedy. I didn't find the prose boring at all, nor even slow-paced. I found this book so engrossing that I finished it in 3 days, and this is an 800 page novel! Even if you don't like Harry Potter, you may still enjoy this book very much especially if you are a reader of classics and the so-called \\"serious\\" fiction."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell is Clarke's first novel, and what a doozy it is. The novel is focused on the two title characters and their interactions in early 19th century England, and Clarke makes them wonderfully fleshed out and flawed characters, who we cheer for, want to yell at, and laugh with. The story is complex, and the fact that this is a fantasy novel should not deter anyone. It contains some great writing, reminiscent of Jane Austen, with a dark and pervasive sense of fear that the magic evokes. This isn't Harry Potter's magic, this is some dark and dangerous stuff, and this sets the book apart from most fantasy (for the record, I refuse to read most fantasy, and that which I have read is rather shoddily written and cliched).The only major flaw with the book is that it ends. While the end works, I would have preferred to spend more time with the characters and the world, which captures the early 19th century English attitude towards science and knowledge and portrays accurately how it would react to magic instead.The book isn't for everyone. Her style hearkens back to the 19th century, and again Jane Austen is a suitable comparison. Her comedic sense is also here, but above all her style dominates. While some will find this to be tedious and boring, many will enjoy it and the rather comic descriptions of English high society, and for those, this book is written. All we can hope for is that Clarke writes another book as good as Jonathan Strange."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell isn't a self-contained story. That's not to say that the ending is anything less than satisfying, for virtually all plot threads are neatly addressed, if not tied up. It's just that the level of education and exposure to literature necessary to understand and enjoy this book is much higher than the usual fantasy fare, or indeed, higher than for most literature written in the last fifty years.Have you ever finished a Dickens novel and wished the story could have gone on? Did you think that Victor Hugo had the right kind of pacing? Does Dumas seem a little terse? If you answered \\"no\\" to any of these questions, then you may not appreciate Strange and Norrell. The \\"faux academic\\" style that another reviewer cited is actually a very passable imitation of the writing style of the Victorian era. The pacing and vocabulary are likewise Victorian.And why not? The frame of the story, very subtly presented, is that the author of the novel is writing at some point in the future of the events described. In other words, it is an historical novel from another universe, one in which magic is a commonplace idea, if not a commonplace occurrence. The tone of the author is that the reader is expected to know much about the lives and history of famous magical figures, or at least to have learned their stories in grammar school. And at the same time, we are not expected to know anything of certain concepts more familiar to us, such as Native Americans or haggis. Susannah Clarke does this with a wink, while her persona of author in her own story writes blithely on.Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell is truly Dickensian in scope, with characters introduced whose payoff occurs hundreds of pages later. This is a novel that rewards the attentive reader, and equally rewards a second reading. If you have the 35 hours to devote to it, I suggest the audiobook version, in which the characters are brought to life by Simon Prebble.If you have any doubts, check it out from the library first.

I can't believe the amount of information found in this book, and I really found the footnotes very helpful, and conveniently located at the bottom of the same page you're readingHere in this book, we see the struggle of practice vs. theory. One magician is innovative, willing to experiment and to spread his magical knowledge, while the other only wants to keep all knowledge to himself. One knows the dangers of conjuring Faeries and other worldly creatures, while the other seeks the help of the dangerous Faeries. (I won't say which one is which).I love when a writer includes famous colorful characters in his or her stories. Clarke includes Duke Wellington, Napoleon, and Lord Byron, the irresolute poet who befriends Strange in Venice. Cross reference to various magicians from the past, gives this book an unprecedented authenticity, considering is a fantasy story. The magic is described so subtlety, that it might appear that such things really happened, and will happen again, unlike Harry Potter, for example.Love Clarke's inventive, from the hilarious flying pineapples , the candles inside people's heads, to the magical fleet, the disappearing roads, all speak of a vivid imagination, and impressive talent as a story teller.Her view of a magical realm is so different from what one expects. No glittering halls, no magic wands, no wizards no rainbows not a single sunny day, or starry nights. All is gloom, sadness and melancholy. Long halls, abandoned gardens, mysterious mirrors, and empty parlors, and in the middle of it all, an enchanted servant and two enchanted ladies longing for their release.After reading this book, you won't look at a cloudy day the same way, and every time you hear the sound of a lonely bell, you will expect to see the gentleman with the thistle down hair wearing a bright green coat coming your way.5 stars"},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"WARNING: If you haven't read many 19th-century authors, or if you have trouble with the writing style of a lot of classic literature, then this probably isn't the book for you.

Everything, from the characters to the action to the landscapes, was described with such perfectly dry wit that I was in a constant state of delight, even through the darkest parts. I can understand how those who mostly read mainstream, contemporary literature might find this book boring. But, if you're someone who enjoys regency-style writing, all I can say is be prepared to be impressed, astonished, and entranced by this book."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"I loved this. I tend to be a reader of modern-setting fantasy, and this worked for me in the same way that does by way of the various historical personages and detail that went into it--the research here is obvious. There's a detached, dry ironic humor running through it in the vein of Jane Austen (and the footnotes with the same put me in mind of Terry Pratchett), and the writing style also is well in line with novels of the time period it's placed in (early 1800's). It's spooky and believable in all the right places--the premise seems out there to begin with, but the attention to detail makes it quite believable. I'm rarely completely satisfied with the ending of a novel, especially a fat monster of a book like this one, but the end was perfect. And don't give up after the first couple hundred pages--the story kicks into a much higher gear after Strange appears on the scene, while the earlier parts are more introduction for characters who become much more important later in the story. While definitely a fantasy, it also holds lots of era-appropriate social parrying and lavish detail to what seems to us trivial things, which may be a turnoff to some. For me, it only enhanced the period feel. While a little slow in the beginning, the pacing is generally very even throughout, only speeding up a bit at the end; for me, it made the various characters and storylines much easier to keep track of.I can't say that I heard the \\"Harry Potter for adults\\" comparison before I read this; however, if that's what you're looking for, this is not it. personally, I fail to see the comparison, though I enjoy Harry Potter very much--this is just in a totally different ballpark. This is not necessarily an easy read, though it's one where you get out of it what you put into it. If you have horrible memories of being forced to read Victorian novels for school or by a parent, this is not for you. If books like The Moonstone, Pride & Prejudice, and A Study In Scarlet hold prized places on your shelves, by all means quit reading this review and go get this book."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"It seems to me that the numerous reviews I've seen and heard comparing this book to the Potter series must have done so simply because the reviewers didn't know where else to pigeonhole the book. I've read and enjoyed all the Potter books, don't get me wrong. But I would sooner compare THIS book to a Jane Austen novel than a Potter-esque story. Yes, it's about magic... but the style, which some have found tedious, is far more formal. It is a quasi-\\"scholarly\\" book, which may obscure the story for some, but I really enjoyed the footnotes and the archaicisms -- though some have found them tedious too. It is more work than the average bestseller, in short -- but to my mind, well worth the effort."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"This novel is absolutely, utterly transporting, and written by someone who clearly understands the power of tone. I really can't recommend it highly enough.It's important to understand that this is not a novel that attempts to be a \\"fantasy\\" story in the sense that modern readers have come to expect. It's definitely fantastic, and its wry, pseudo-scholarly tone has echoes of some of the best British fantasy of the early century (and, in the way that scions of the same man resemble each other, evokes shades of the Harry Potter novels without being anything like them.)The book is at once a parody and a celebration of a certain sort of literature, and is meant to be read by people for whom the act of reading almost awakens their sense of taste. If you are such a person, and if you have an affection for folklore and the contradictions of power, you might expect to find in this book a rich supply of paragraphs worth reading aloud to an empty room."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"I wanted to mention, though I'm not sure how many people will get through 540 reviews to find mine, that if possible it is better to read the hardcover edition of this book. It is yes, a long book, and in my opinion wonderfully long, but having the smooth raven on the cover, as well as the rough edged pages to enjoy, made the book nice company.Odd comment? Maybe, but this is a fantastically odd book. I'm an Austen and Dickens fan like many of the other readers, and I feel that Susanna Clarke stands well with those authors. I'm only a bit sad that this is her first book. It will be a long summer waiting for the next to come out in October.-Stephanie"},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"If I were unfortunate enough to be in a housefire tomorrow, I would grab precious family heirlooms and my copy of Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell. That's how much I love this book.As it has been stated many times before, this it a truly unique piece of work. Some weird mixture of Jane Austin's social comedy, alternate history, and Tolkien's natural magic and mythical grandeur produces something close to this novel. It has so many levels and themes it's impossible to summarize them all in one space; just take a look at the other reviews!A note of warning: This is not a book for very impatient readers who don't like anything but contemporary style. Ms. Clarke makes use of the language and even the archaic spelling of the Napoleonic Era, giving the impression that the book was written during that time. I find it delightful, certain readers will find it unbearable. If you do like it, the language is a rich treat in itself, so to me this is a \\"winter book\\", best savored in front of a fire on cold grey days. (though it's great anytime)I especially like how Ms. Clarke makes her characters so complex. The cast is huge and covers every personality and social standing, but we learn the background and motivation for each individual. Notice that even the 'good' and 'bad' characters are truly human: every one of them has personality flaws as well as good traits. Overall, very satisfying. Definately a book I plan to pass on like an heirloom."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"I think this book is wonderfully written, with all of its clever asides, and that the author created quite a fascinating world. It is very long, however, and takes a great deal of patience to read, especially the first third of the book. Be warned that this is not a fast-moving book, though the action improves a bit once the two magicians meet each other.An interesting read if you have several days to devote to it."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrel is not the DaVinci Code. And that is a good thing. In my opinion, The DaVinci Code represents everything that's wrong with modern literature: The honored author simply has no idea how to write a good book and is using cheap tricks to keep readers interested and, well, reading. In the davinci code every single chapter ends in a cliffhanger, a technique of which I grew tired after chapter three, and despised after finishing the book. But this is not supposed to be a bashing of respective work, it is supposed to praise Jonathan Strange, a work that managed to captivate me without the slightest hint of foul play.I admit, the novel has a slow start if you are used to the likes of the davinci code. The plot takes its time to unfold, but for crying out loud, it has all right to do so. There is no need to rush. Everybody who takes down a book from a shelf has the time to read and finish it - putting it down for a while doesn't mean that the plot will run away from you, it will still be there the next day. Once the plot does, however, unfold, it is captivating. I experienced everything with the characters while the story went on, I suffered with them, was shaken by some events and laughed out loud at other times.The author knows brilliantly how to make her readers feel smart - her use of footnotes (and later references to those) made me feel as if I actually learned something at one time and then later, when it was being referred to, employed that knowledge.There are few books that I have read that are so captivating that I watch in horror how the number of the pages left to read diminishes, to be honest, this is only the second book of that kind. I am 200 pages away from the end, and wish I was still in the beginning.I already find that the covertext gets the narrative wrong and am angered at that.This sort of intense experience of a novel is quite rare nowadays, and I highly recommend this piece of ingenuity to anyone who has a week or two to spare, and is willing to completely immerse into a world familiar to us, yet full of magic.by the way, the language employed by ms clarke is quite honestly one of the most beautiful that I have ever encountered. I am able to smell the smells, feel the cold, see the battlefields and experience the loneliness she is describing, as well as everything else. I applaud this beautiful work."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"This vast first novel by former Cookbook editor Susanna Clarke starts a little slow but quickly picks up steam and by the third part has you strapped in and holding on for the wild ride. Yes, it does take a little patience and faith to stay with to the end, but in my opinion its worth the effort.Much of the novel is invented Magic history told mostly through the use of footnotes, citing a whole library of imagined texts. But the main focus is on the title characters and of course the subject of part 3, John Uskglass aka The Raven King. These characters are drawn deftly, but my favorites are among the minor players. Such figures as John Childermass, Norrell's dark and faithful servant; the bluish tinged Vinculus, a street magician; and the scheming, dubious gentleman Lascelles amass to create an almost Shakespearean cast in its breadth and support to the main story.I believe the author leaves the ending wide open for at least a Book 2 of this epic tale. One can only hope."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"After shifting through many reviews I came to this conclusion, you either love or hate this book. I am definitely in the former group. In fact, personally I wonder how any could not love this wonderful piece of fiction?My guess is that a large group of people misunderstand the intent of the author (and that don't find humor in the genre of satire). Ms.Clarke does not intend to deliver a fast-paced good vs. evil epic. Nothing could be further from the truth... instead she has given us a high comedy/satire on English life. Comedy with some magic is how the reader should approach the 1st page.And make no mistake, I found this to be the funniest book I have read in years - I actually laughed out loud! It reminds me of Mark Twain's, \\"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's court\\" both are psuedo-serious on the subject of British life (Different periods of course) but both are full of satire. I find these two books have much more in common than \\"Strange & Norrell\\" would have with \\"Harry Potter\\".Ultimately, I feel that this is the reason for the negative reviews. Satire is a close cousin to sarcasm and in both cases you either get it or you don't. Many people simply don't find this type of humor funny, therefore, they hate this book and find it unbearably boring.Personally, I can't remember a book written in the last 10 years that I have enjoyed more. Like some of the other reviewers I am reading it much slower than my typical pace... not because I find it \\"Hard\\" to read, but simply, I really didn't want it to end!My final opinion- If you liked Dickens, Austen, or even Mark Twain... you will LOVE, \\"Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell\\". If you find reading these authors a form of personal torture...stay far, far away."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"I have one thing to say........get the audio version. I would never have gotten through the print. But, narrated by Simon Prebble, this was entertaining. I thought the characters were animated, well defined and there were more than a few times where I thought the situations were just plain funny (see Drawlite meeting Norrell, pushing himself into his house, telling everyone he already knew him, etc). The humour is perhaps, English for lack of a better word (I'm somehow reminded of that old sitcom, 'Are you being served?'The plot did not lack complexity and was well done, characters were rounded, believable and the story was not lacking in suspense and wait. There were a few times where it dragged a bit (geez this is a long story), but I never kept listening and always found it interesting. Got kind of dark near the end. I'd definitely go see the movie (which is being filmed now) and will probably buy a copy of the CD."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"The promo copy describes 'Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell' as \\"Jane Austen meets J.R.R. Tolkein.\\" If you like either (or both) of them, it's likely you'll enjoy this epic fantasy set in 19th century England and Europe. I've read some people took a long time to finish or quit reading after a while, but I couldn't put down this 800+ page book, and it never stalled for me. Some say it's like Harry Potter for grown-ups, and Ms. Clarke has created quite the History of English Magic for her readers to explore. And the many interesting characters: Mr. Segundus, Mr. Norrell, Childermass, Drawlight, Lascelles, Sir Walter and Lady Pole, Stephen Black, Vinculus, Jonathan and Arabella Strange, the Gentleman with the Thistle-down Hair&hellip;! Don't miss the footnotes for some foreshadowing and the numerous back and side stories. I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"edge of seat thrill ridenot this onepatience will reward"},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"The first thing any first-time novelist needs to know about writing an 800-page novel is that it has to be written in such a way that the reader, when he's on page 750, still remembers - and cares about - what happened on page 50. Susanna Clarke hasn't quite achieved that. This is an interesting book, in some ways, but it's far too ambitious and falls flat in many places. This story could have been told more effectively in half the space.I'll admit that adult fantasy fiction is not my usual cup of tea, so the fact that I didn't find much to cheer about in this book shouldn't turn off diehard fans of the genre. Still, any book that wins the Book Sense award should have a mass appeal that transcends any one specific audience. The Book Sense award should go to a book that an independent bookseller would recommend, without reservation, to any customer looking for a good read. This isn't such a book.And what's the deal with all the footnotes? Sure, it was a cute gimmick the first couple of times. It provided an original way of providing insightful background on the story, and gave the novel a certain authoritative feel to it. But after, say, the first twenty pages it just grew tiresome. Few of the footnotes were actually integral to the story, so they became more of a distraction than anything. I'm not even sure why I read all of them - it's not like I read footnotes in non-fiction."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"This book is clearly not for someone looking for a quick mindless read. Coming in at over 700 pages, it is a complex tale of english magic written in a way that doesn't insult the reader.The author doesn't embellish the spells the magicians use, but does allows the reader to fully grasp their effect. Although long, the book is not so full of characters and strange names (no pun indended) that you get lost. You get a good understanding of the nature of all of the characters without getting bogged down in the minutia.This was a good read and held my attention for the entire month it took me to read it. I look forward to more work from this author."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"Few books make it onto my \\"read every couple of years/give to my children\\" list. This one didn't take long to jump onto that list.Other reviewers can tell you about the plot... though it is slow to develop, it is there, consistently throughout the book. The characters are a delight, and the story is rich with detail both historical and magical (sometimes melding the two).What I loved about this novel was the resemblence it bore to some of Tolkien's lesser known stories like Smith of Wootton Major & Farmer Giles of Ham... short, fairy-laden tales of otherworldy magic.Buy this book, start reading and give it a chance. Totally worth every minute spent reading."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"I finished this huge story in just a few days. The characters were so unique, I wanted to spend time with them. I didn't know who to side with in the end, but I loved the swift slide from like to dislike, real to surreal, and life to death to life again. I loved the use of nature as a conduit to the magical realm of things, and I was consistently caught up in the smooth storytelling. The conclusion was open-ended, which sets it up for a hefty sequel. Clarke has an imagination that stays far afield of the usual and yet lends itself to believeable events that make the reader wonder, \\"How real is real?\\""},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"What more can I say? It is the most amazing reading experience I have had in YEARS. A masterful blend of all kinds of the most skilled voices: Austen, Dickens, Hawthorn -- and yet, completely unique and inventive. I was completely enchanted. Those who are bewildered or under-whelmed (or over-whelmed) need to find another time when they can leisurely read this book (which it deserves) and savor each individual word and episode to fully appreciate its magic!"},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"When I finished this novel, I was faced with the same challenge that many others faced upon completion. Did I like this book? Yes! 4 out of 5 stars! No! 1 out of 5! Either of these ratings I could identify and completely understand. I'll split the middle and call it 3 out of 5 stars, because even now, I'm not sure how to rate it.The Plot (with very minor spoilers):It is the early 1800's in England. The country is currently at war with Napoleon and France. There is an elite, invitation only society of non-practicing magicians in England. This society is made up of the male aristocrats of England who get a lot of pleasure out of calling themselves magicians. These magicians do not practice magic like the ariates did in the early 1000's, they study it from books.The ariates were the elite of England's magicians, and they came after the greatest English magician ever known, The Raven King. The Raven King was a child kidnapped by the fairie and raised in their land. The King was able to conquer and hold 3 different lands, which were Northern England, Fairie, and a kingdom on the far side of Hell. Don't be fooled when I mention Fairie and the land's inhabitants. Fairies were often summoned to serve the Raven King and many of the historical magicians used them as well. They are creatures that appear much like like humans, with the exception of their crazy eyebrows. Fairies are strong in magic and very low in morals (at least they are different than ours). Many revel in violence for sport and they can ruin a life with perfectly good intensions. The land itself is a strange creepy place. The Fairie roads can lead to Heaven or Hell or Earth, and they are filled with bleak rivers, gray skies, and dead forests. There are burrows where the Fairies live, old ruined castles under the ground where endless dances are held with only the music of sad pipes and violins. The courtyards are full of murdered soldiers in armor, impaled on spears, or hung from trees, and some of Fairie's most violent massacres of women and children are celebrated and reenacted on a nightly basis.Things change for England's society of magicians when an actual practicing English magician, Mr. Norrell, is discovered. Mr. Norrell receives an invitation to report to the society to prove himself. Mr. Norrell makes a deal with the society, and by performing an actual act of magic the society agrees to disband itself. Mr. Norrell has spent his life's work to become the only practicing magician in England and he would mostly like to keep it that way. He buys up every book in the country containing any spells or secrets. One of his greatest wishes is to be useful to England so he offers his assistance to the English government. Norrell is a boring, unpersonable sort, known for going on long lectures about English magic, and he does not have any connections in English society. There are a couple of questionable men who do, who are quick to associate themselves with him and take him to all the social affairs. This still doesn't get him anywhere so he is forced to perform a very noticeable magical act to get the government's attention. This goes against Norrells style and feelings of what English magic should be about, but he has become desperate. A member of England's government has just lost his beloved wife, and Norrell is able to bring her back from death, but at a terrible cost. Norrell used the assistance of a fairie to perform the magic, something which he publicly abhors. Finally he has the government's attention, and he is put to work helping to confuse Napoleon's fleet and armies.Not long after, another practicing magician is discovered, Jonathan Strange. Strange is a somewhat care-free sociable sort who discovers he can do some magic. Undecided and unsuccessful in a career, Strange decides to give magic a whirl. Strange seeks out Norrell and after much interaction Norrell agrees to take Strange on as a pupil. Norrell is very guarded with his knowledge and only shares what he wants with Strange. Norrell believes that magic should be strongly controlled. The ariates were reckless, and The Raven King was abominable. Strange, eager to learn as much as he can, is patient with Norrell, despite wanting more. England's need for help with the war grows and Strange is sent to Spain to serve under The Duke of Wellington. Several years pass and Strange earns great honor in the war against Napoleon, for his impromptu magical acts. Eventually he returns home to find that he has outgrown Norrell, that he can no longer serve as his pupil if he isn't still willing to share more knowledge. Strange believes that the teachings of the old magicians and The Raven King should be sought out and shared. The Fairie paths should be explored to learn more. All magical knowledge should be shared with England. Norrell believes in the complete opposite. The rift between them grows strong and meanwhile, the Fairie which was secretly summoned by Norrell to do his greatest act, is causing more and more deadly havoc in both their lives and the lives of many English men and women. Prophecies of the Raven King and the Unnamed Slave are appearing, and the boundaries between England and Fairie seem to be blurring....The characterization in this book is well done for the most part. The characters are convincingly flawed, but show some acts of courage and honor as well. Whether you identify with any of the 2 main characters is to your taste. The dialog is well done and seems very appropriate for the era. Most of the secondary English characters come off as arrogant and pompous, but have enough unique characteristics to distinguish themselves. There are a few very honorable characters as well that most will enjoy; I was particularly fond of Stephen's character.The writing style itself is unique, but well done. For me, it was very sluggish to get through. Imagine reading a long novel written by C.S. Lewis & Leo Tolstoy and you get what I mean. The magical portions were very descriptive like Lewis, except much darker. The main villain's dialog sounds like a character right out of Narnia, such as the White Witch, but again, much more violent. The magical darker portions were a nice contrast to the lighter writing of the interactions of English society. The parts focusing on society reminded me much of Tolstoy in terms of the length of the book, as well as the span of years the story took place.A unique, charming characteristic of the book was all its footnotes. The footnotes contained information on English history and the false history of the English magicians. This was also one of the most tedious aspects of the books. Often, I would stop in mid sentence and read a 2 page footnote. These often disrupted the story.To sum up a very long post, I liked this book, and I disliked this book. I enjoyed the magic in big doses. It was very descriptive and seemed to fit the time and mood well. I particularly enjoyed the curse that was put on Strange later in the novel, I thought it was brilliant. I enjoyed the dialog but in smaller doses. My biggest complaint for the book was that it was just too long. It seems like it could have been much shorter, containing the same events, without losing the story's appeal. It is a book over 700 pages and I swear, I still didn't know where the book was trying to go by page 600. It is a hard book to read if you don't have several uninterrupted hours. It was just tough to keep my interest, but good enough that I kept coming back. The book did come to a satisfying conclusion, and you have an understanding of what the struggle was about. There was some good tension near the end, and the last 150 pages or so I was able to breeze through. I'm hesitant to recommend it due to my difficulties with it, but I did think it was an excellent story, and a very unique read. Just be patient if you are going to try it."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"I would be pressed to add something new to what previous reviewers have put down, so I will summarize what has been mentioned: this is a wonderfully slow book without a single bad character (though the narrative was a little irritating with its profusion of \\"rathers\\"). The characters are the key to enjoyment. Their portraits become clearer and clearer until they are all lined up and presented in a dramatic and satisfying ending. You can't do without this one - It is truly a restoration of English Magic."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell is in many ways more a piece of historical fiction than it is a 'Harry Potter' or 'Lord of the Rings' style fantasy. There is no wand waving. There are no lightning and fireball battles between wizards. There is no epic 'good versus evil' battle at the end. Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell is a character driven story about 'jealousy, ambition, and loss. The magic is almost incidental.Ms. Clarke crafts an alternative version of England at the 'beginning of the 19th century - the twist being that magic has returned to England - that is so wonderfully immersive that you can nearly smell the damp earth and musty libraries.Ms. Clarke has structured the book as a sort of post-action record compiled for posterity. This structure gives Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell it's most remarkable feature - its footnotes. These glorious footnotes explain bits and pieces of magical history to help us, the reader, understand references made by Strange, Norrel, and others. Each one is a jewel of compressed storytelling, a tiny window into the wider magical world beyond the confines of this book.You get the feeling Ms. Clarke could write he own version of The Silmarillion, filling out a complete history of the world she's created.Though the book starts off slowly, the writing is rich enough and the characters intriguing enough to get the reader into the meat of this book. Once there, read slowly to savor the world Ms. Clarke created. The end of the book comes much quicker than one would expect from an 800-odd page novel.Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell masterfully mixes action, drama and comedy into a attention-consuming whole that left me with a wonderfully satisfied feeling."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"If you are a fantasy fan who also enjoys historical or period fiction, this may just be the perfect novel for you. It's an odd novel that blends the realities of English society at the time with fantastic elements in a masterful manner. It made me laugh like Austen while also providing the kind of ponderous yet tongue-in-cheek depictions of Dickens. It didn't keep me up at night--although I've heard that it has for others--and yet I actively looked forward to picking it up again the following evening.I think this novel, well written as it is, is largely a matter of personal taste--but well worth the \\"risk\\" compared to most others."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell is precisely the book that might have come out of a response to Bronte's faulting of Austen (all shut up in drawing rooms and privet hedges, with no wild moor or tumbling becks in sight, to paraphrase only slightly).Wild, wild England bookending very British (quintessential age of Britain Britishness) characters and laughing at the magic men have held onto in it's pale weakness no man would accept in his tea.I never read this book before because all the descriptions started in the wrong place. They start with the MacGuffin or Maguffin--Napoleon--if only in reference to the period. Much more to the point is that this is almost to the Regency era, which frames a sense of magic that feels like that of DeLint's Little Country more than that of Harry Potter.And Strange is the \\"bright, rebellious pupil\\". No, that is the wrong start, too. Strange is already a man when he comes into this book (not the child \\"pupil\\" made me assume). While I was thinking he was of the make of Nathaniel in the Bartimaeus Trilogy, instead, he's merely a genius under a scholarly Casaubon type (yet not Casaubon, to my utter relief also, and yet the similarity to a character in one of my other favorite classics drew me to trust this book's voice). He is married by his second appearance, and he has a patience and kindness that I was not expecting. Certainly he's a bit careless, but his contrariness comes of being too bright among the dull. It's not a main feature.The length of this book is essential. It's not drawn out in any sense of the word. It's paced exactly its style and subject demand. I've enjoyed it every page and actually bewildered how fast the end comes.For someone as fond of Austen and Tolkien as I am, this book is like a return to a golden age. I'm so encouraged to think books like this can still be published for classics lovers wishing for new things in that familiar style of wit and subtlety. However, it's not a retrogression by any means."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"It's long, but so whimsical and imaginative, it's worth every page. Some have criticized the footnotes but they are a story unto themselves. Clarke creates a complete and consistent alternate universe, and it's a complete delight."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"I found this book a bit difficult to get into, but once it grabbed me I could not let it go. It mixes a delightful tale of English magic and faeries with human virtues and failings."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"This book was a find for me. I stumbled on it out of the blue, having never heard of it before. I only noticed it because it was on a table at the bookstore labeled \\"Humorous, Helpful, and Odd\\". Who could resist??!!It is indeed everything everyone else says about it - beautifully written, civilized, and long - but it is also VERY funny! Clarks takes her time with her setups, and delivers deliciously ironic bits of commentary. I don't believe I managed to get through any 3 consecutive pages without a good laugh.Her portrayal of the fussy, dry, timid, yet driven Mr. Norrel is absolutely hilarious. This old stick of a scholar is propelled by his conviction that he is responsible for the restoral of English Magic. And this drives him to perform acts of magic that seem totally dissonant with his character.And his two sycophants - Drawlight and Lascelles - are hilariously fruity and delicious! His interactions with these 2 tulips of fashion (Norrell is totally social inept, and is effortlessly manipulated by these shameless coattail riders) are endlessly amusing.Next to Mr. Norrell, Jonathan Strange is nearly a straight man. But his capability for single-mindedness (or absent-mindedness), and interaction with his constantly gentle and ironically affectionate wife brings lightness to him as well.Clarke's book is filled with well-realized and memorable characters, from the practical and impatient Lord Wellington and the gently mad King, to Sir Pole and his capable butler Stephen Black - all so well introduced into the story that the reader never feels that there are too many characters or sub-plots running, though there certainly are plenty!Despite its length, and the many footnotes, every scrap of it is readable and enjoyable. It is impossible to declare this book belongs to any particular genre. It has elements of the historical novel - and, to my mind, some of the best elements; the day-to-day concerns, furnishings of the houses, clothing and parties and conversations and surroundings of the times and places - elements of mystery, fantasy (of course), and comedy. Indeed, it \\"belongs\\" to no genre at all, which is in this case the highest of compliments."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"I want to write SO MUCH about this book. It has history, magic, deep characters, style, involving plots, feuds - everything to keep most readers of any age extremely interested.

By page 800-something, I was wishing the book would go on for 800 more pages."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"I long to write a long and rapturous review about this magnificent & wonderful book. But I won't.However, I will tell you that I was completely enamored with 'Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell\\". I fell under its spell, absorbed in a world of alternate history, comedy of manners and dark, shadowy magic. Comparisons to Harry Potter is misleading.I'm amazed that some readers here found it tedious and boring. To be sure, it's a very lengthy tome. But it's like a long awaited vacation to an exotic, faraway land, it goes by amazingly fast. Indeed, I felt a keen loss when I was done.I love JRR Tolkien, JK Rowling, and Jane Austen. However, I feel Susanna Clarke has topped them all."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"I'm amazed by some of the negative reviews I've read so far. How anyone can say that this book has no plot is staggering. It's definitely not a formula kind of thing (Thank God). It's full of small details that some people may have found daunting but I think that's the book's great strength.Anyway, it's a wonderful book, one of the best I've ever read. Yes, it's long but I found myself wishing it had been much longer. Honestly, Susanna Clarke's imagination is one of the best ever. The book is incredibly rich, very complex, a bit baroque, very funny, very sad, kinda scary and so on. Think of all the things that make a story great and I'm sure the Susanna Clark put them into Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell. It's a long book, after all.She deserves a place in the pantheon of great British Fantasists, if there is such a thing somewhere."},{"Title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell","review":"I've read several Harry Potter stories and found them morally simplistic. Good and evil are clearly separated, and there is none of the ambiguity in those books that permeates real life. In this book, Ms. Clarke pens a far more sophisticated story of magic and moral ambiguity. A more difficult, but more satisfying story than Potter by far. I would also commend her on the fantastic ending --- I did not think the plot lines would come together so neatly."},{"Title":"The Foremost Guide to Uncle Sam Collectibles","review":"With a better than average knowledge of Uncle Sam collectibles, I searched for specific information in this book and was able to easily locate what I needed.

This book is a must for any westerner living in Japan, or planning to do so."},{"Title":"Max Danger the Adv of Expat in Tokyo (Tut Books)","review":"I thought it was hilarious and I haven't ever been to Japan! I had lived in Europe for a few months, but that's the closest I'd been. So don't think you need to live in Japan before you can appreciate it!I will say, however, that you might want to read the sequel first. The sequel is funny, but not *as* funny as this one. Thus if you read this one first, the sequel is a bit of a letdown."},{"Title":"Max Danger the Adv of Expat in Tokyo (Tut Books)","review":"I moved to Japan for a few years back in 1991. Within the first few weeks of my trip, no less than five people told me I needed to read this book (but not until I'd lived there a few months). I did, and I loved every chapter. It's funny to the average reader, but it really resonates with anyone who's been there. To them, it's HYSTERICAL. The only other books I remember laughing out loud to were The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy and Catch 22. In a sense, this book is like Scott Turow's book One L -- in that it's a must-read for those embarking on the adventure. I hope you enjoy it as much as I did."},{"Title":"Max Danger the Adv of Expat in Tokyo (Tut Books)","review":"Many expat executives in Japan say to themselves, \\"I should write a book about all the strange stuff that I see.\\" Then they read Max Danger by Robert Collins, and realize that book has already been written.

I was a gaijin for 10 years (hey, who am I kidding? I'll *always* be a gaijin!), and, for me, Max Danger, expat extrordinaire, captures all the quirks and nuances of being a foreigner in Japan in a wonderfully funny, true-to-life fashion.

I've been to Japan many times in recent years. The book was written a long time ago, but Japan hasn't changed much except for the value of the yen, Tokyo is larger, and the Shinkansen goes to more places.Don Maloney's books; IT'S NOT ALL RAW FISH, AND SON OF A RAW FISH; are similar in their humour and vintage. I bought them both on Amazon.I think the second Max Danger book is just as funny and recommend that one too."},{"Title":"Max Danger the Adv of Expat in Tokyo (Tut Books)","review":"Collins, in his persona of Max Danger, relates the trials, adventures, misunderstandings, and challenges of working and living in Japan. His Western business attitudes and expectations humorously clash with Japanese ways of business. The best parts of the book are when both sides of the table are parodied. Parts are, upon occasion, poignant and thoughtful. It's clear that Danger shares a compassion and love of his home away from home."},{"Title":"Max Danger the Adv of Expat in Tokyo (Tut Books)","review":"There are very few books which I am able to read and enjoy more than once.

He has the American Club to socialize with other foreigners.He has a family, car, maid, american grocery stores etc.I had none of that. I'm not saying that I'm jealous. Just that Max Danger's experience has very little in common with my own.On top of that, the author's sense of humor is limited to giving people dull nicknames (Expat Max, Beautiful Gloria, Serious Hirose, etc.). There are a few gems that make good stories but those have strong hints of fiction to them.Those looking for a humorous take on an American's stumbles through Japan would do better with Dave Barry Does Japan."},{"Title":"Max Danger the Adv of Expat in Tokyo (Tut Books)","review":"This book is boring.

There are so many more wonderful &amp; entertaining books about Japan. Just say no to Max Danger."},{"Title":"The Charioteer","review":"Reading this book as a heterosexual female, I can't say that I identified with any of the characters; but Mary Renault has written a remarkable book that explores the issue of love from various sides and gives us an in-depth view of a people coming to terms with their own sexuality and what it will mean for them in the world at large.The time is 1940 and the place is England just after the retreat from Dunkirk; in the memorable words of Winston Churchill, it was their finest hour. At the center of the book is Laurie Odell, wounded in action, waking up in a military hospital to the fact that he will be crippled for life. The problem for Laurie is that he fears being emotionally crippled as well. Laurie is a graduate of a rigid British prep school where the head boy, Ralph Lanyon, was the object of his hero worship; Ralph is kicked out in a sensational scandal involving a hysterical accusation of homosexual activity with another boy in the school. Laurie is sexually attracted to Ralph and when Ralph is expelled, he realizes that the attraction was mutual, but that Ralph never approached him because he knew better than Laurie himself did that Laurie hadn't awakened to his own sexual orientation yet, and Ralph was not about to take that responsibility for him. While recuperating in the hospital, Laurie meets Andrew, a young conscientious objector who looks up to him as Laurie had looked up to Ralph. Andrew, however, is a total innocent, and his uncompromising religious views would make him look upon homosexual love as an abomination, even while he is attracted to Laurie. While on leave from the hospital, Laurie runs into Ralph, whom he hadn't seen since he was expelled from prep school seven years earlier, and learns that it was Ralph who piloted the navy boat that rescued him from Dunkirk. Ralph has been wounded as well, however, having had half his hand shot off, so the two of them are basically free and unfettered to start a relationship.Ralph has grown hard and cynical after seven years of searching for love with increasingly superficial partners, and he has hit rock bottom with his current partner, whose sole attraction is his dazzling good looks. The attraction between Ralph and Laurie is immediate and compelling, and throws Laurie into a dilemma: he can hook up with Ralph and face up to the fact of his homosexuality which he has been hiding from everyone, including himself; or he can remain on a platonic basis with Andrew and remain sexually frustrated. At the core of his problem is trying to resolve how one can be gay and maintain his integrity at the same time. After meeting some of Ralph's associates, he isn't so sure. Laurie doesn't want to be dragged into the gay milieu, and Ralph sees Laurie as his means of escape from that milieu, and the bottom line for them both is, are they homosexual men, or are they men who happen to be homosexual.Things get complicated when Laurie tells Ralph about Andrew (one of the things that attracts Ralph to Laurie is his fundamental honesty) and although he understands Laurie's dilemma, Ralph isn't about to let him off the hook; he tells Laurie that he has a choice: he can continue to help Andrew tell lies to himself about himself, or he can help Andrew face up to what he is. Laurie doesn't want that responsibility with Andrew any more than Ralph wanted it with him seven years earlier, and he temporizes until someone intervenes and Andrew has to face his own nature up close and personal. The resulting explosion shakes everyone up; Laurie finally realizes that being human ultimately means being true to oneself. What that means for Laurie is resolved at the end of the book.There are several interesting secondary characters in the story, including Alec, one of Ralph's previous partners, decent, honest, but unable to commit more than superfically, and Sandy, Alec's current partner, insecure, demanding, jealous, but also capable of love, and Bunny, Ralph's latest, despicable, devious, and totally amoral. But the three main characters are the most compelling: Andrew, whose rigid, unbending morality finally makes him snap; Ralph, hard, jaded, yet with a core of innocence and trust that still makes him believe that love is not a myth; and Laurie himself, trying to resolve who he is and what he stands for as a man and as a human being. For all its being a World War II story, the problems and issues are timeless and make the book as fresh today as it was 60 years ago when it was first issued. Mary Renault has shown with \\"The Charioteer\\" that she is not only a great historical novelist, she is one of the best writers of the 20th century."},{"Title":"The Charioteer","review":"The complicated romances of closeted gay men in England at the height of World War II seems an unlikely subject, but Renault endows The Charioteer with such depth of perception that virtually any reader will be fascinated by her story of three young men who strive to reconcile the frequently opposing forces of sex, love, and personal integrity in their lives and relationships. Considerably more than just a &quot;gay love story,&quot; Renault's novel examines what it means to be completely honest and completely fair in even the most difficult of relationships at even the most difficult moments of life.Written with both on-the-surface (as in the myth of the Charioteer) and covert (it is no accident that many of the characters are in some way physically damaged, or that the story is set during England's darkest hours of the war) symbolism, Renault's novel encourages the reader to take time over it. Although sometimes demanding, the book casts a spell; I can honestly say that I did not want it to end, but I wanted to know more about what the future held for the characters. It is a book to which readers will return again and again."},{"Title":"The Charioteer","review":"I have been a firm Mary Renault fan ever since I read her first historical romance -- The Persian BoyUntil Icame across the Charioteer, I had always thought that shespecialised in writing hsitorical works, I had no idea thatshe started out writing novels set in contemporary timesI live in a Muslim country where homosexuality is nottoleratedAlthough I'm not a Muslim and am a hextrosexual, I too was very biased against homosexualityI never saw gays as being normal -- they were an abominationI thoughtTwo books were instrumental in me changing theway I looked at homosexuality. One was the Persian Boyalso by Ms Renault and the other, The CharioteerThis book made me realise that in the end, all people are the sameregardless of their sexual orientation. Ms Renault portrayedthe characters beautifully and showed very positive imagesof gay men and the conflict that they go through.Although in most western countries the climate is very freefor gay men to come out, here in the east, especially aconservative country like mine, the situation is still likewhat it is described in the bookFor me personally, I have never been able to get the twomain characters, Ralph and Laurie out of my head. My onlyregret is that Ms Renault never furnished a sequel forthe novel because it ends rather abruptly. Although it is implied inthe novel that Laurie will forgive Ralph, I am dying to knowwhat happens to them say, five years down the road.For all those homophobics out there, this is one book whichyou must read. Ms Renault is proof that the msot intenseemotions and love can still be explained without havingto resort to graphic sex scenes which are so prevalentin today's books."},{"Title":"The Charioteer","review":"\\"The Charioteer\\" is one of the most beautiful love stories I have ever read, I hadn't felt such intense emotions reading a book since my adolescence. Before and much more than being a gay story, this is first of all a novel about love, showing in a most powerful way how all life is a struggle to love and to be loved, because only by giving and receving love one can feel alive and life is meaningful and worth being lived.The three main characters, each of them absolutely fascinating and superbly portrayed, discover and are confronted with their own true nature when falling in love, but they also have to make choices and take on responsibilities which often seem unbearable. Love is shown through all its sweetness and romance but also in all its terribly dramatic implications: love always means suffering and none of the characters is spared his share of pain and defeat. But the force of life triumphs despite everyone's conflicts, limitations and mistakes, which must be coped with and accepted in mutual respect and forgiveness.The young protagonists are brought to life in an amazingly effective way and they are so vivid and forceful that they outlive the end of the book itself. The reader can share their most intimate thoughts and the decisive turns of their lives and is therefore bound to feel strong compassion. I am not surprised that a lot of readers wish there had a been a sequel of the novel, but I believe the author did the right thing not writing one. The end of the story leaves very open prospects and, especially considering the circular structure the novel acquires at its conclusion, all the characters are liable to being again together in their maturity and it is better to let the reader imagine possible evolutions.The narrative scheme is very solid and well balanced, all parts of the book contribute to light up the whole plot; the text flows slowly but continuously and once you adapt yourself to the inner rhythm of the story you are fully involved and almost become a part of it, each line adding a relevant detail or setting the suitable atmosphere to lead you deeper into the characters' inner thoughts and feelings; the language is rich though never mannered and the style is often very poetic but never in a cheap way.\\"The Charioteer\\" certainly stands also as a great gay story and is very effective in demonstrating the universality of love, which transcends lovers' genders and social barriers. Its explict homosexual theme is all the more surprising if one thinks the book was written almost fifty years ago, when to state that love between two men has the same dignity as heterosexual love was certainly a hard challenge, and that it was written by a woman, as the protagonists are absolutely and coherently credible and masculine in their appearance and psychology.Needless to say a wonderful film would come out of this book. I do wish a talented director could see to this undertaking. I find Matt Damon (especially after being Mr Ripley) would make a perfect Laurie Odell and he might also be the film director and producer himself.Reading \\"The Charioteer\\" can be a heart-wrenching experience and cause to shed more than one tear, especially if one is in love, but it also makes one feel more attached to the beauty of life and long for youth and pure, noble, authentic love, the most important of all things. This novel and its appealing characters, Laurie, Andrew and Ralph, will always remain in my mind and heart as wonderful companions of my youth, revealers of the complexity and fragility of the human soul and of myself, an important landmark in the search for my identity of adult gay man.P.S.It is a shame that \\"The Charioteer\\" is not translated into Italian. It is certainly the kind of book it can be difficult to read in a second language and I sometimes experienced this difficulty myself. Now it has become my dream to translate it into my first language one day because I want such a beautiful novel to be accessible to all Italian readers."},{"Title":"The Charioteer","review":"I read this book before ever indulging in Mary Renault's ancient Greek fiction, although this story is every bit as entertaining, even set in World War II.The two main characters, Laurie and Ralph, struggle with their love for one another as well as their devotion and dedication to their relationship, and their friendship as well.This book is every bit as timeless as the ancient Greece novels, yet a bit dated of a read amidst modern day views and sensibilities about homosexual relationships. It does, however, send readers back to a time where more value was placed upon the root of a relationship and of love. It transcends the need for graphic sexual display, yet does not hide the nature of the involvement between the two men.Of all the homosexual themed novels I have read, this is far and away my favorite. Even though it was written over forty years ago, it stands the test of time in its message of understanding the value of love, regardless of gender."},{"Title":"The Charioteer","review":"I first read this book because it was mentioned in Bruce Bawer's &quot;A Place at the Table&quot;. I never expected that it would impact me so startlingly! I identified very closely with Laurie Odell, the main character, and his struggles with experiencing love as a gay man. All of the characters in the book are well-developed, even ones we don't meet very often. Renault manages to put together a wonderful, sometimes heart-wrenching story that doesn't restrict itself to people with gay experiences. ANYONE could read this book and feel total empathy with Laurie. I heartily recommend this book to anyone who has the least interest in reading a love story--it won't disappoint. I only wish that the story could have continued, perhaps in a sequel. Still, a very touching and satisfying tale."},{"Title":"The Charioteer","review":"The book reviewers have eloquently described the characters and plot of the book. I would add though, while repeating some reviewers, that we follow a young man's journey through self-recognition and with all his dignity intact, chooses the path he deems for himself.It is a model of how to think and act while maintaining pride,in one's eyes and in others. It is painful, as he chooses a life considered perverted by a society in a time that considers homosexuality an illness and all who are homosexuals to be shunned and ridiculed. Laurie chooses his path with his past experiences in life, situations, philosophical and poetical knowledge as guide posts. The ending is bittersweet but triumphant. A bible on how to act, on your own to find the life that will give you happinessMary Renault's writing is magical. With her use of metaphors, similes and quotations from classical literature, the author creates a person realistic, sensitive and sympathetic. The reader is uplifted."},{"Title":"The Charioteer","review":"If it is possible for a novel to enhance a persons life, then 'The Charioteer' did that for me. I first read the book over 20 years ago and its effect was profound. Each time I have re-read it, further insights into the characters and the era have unfolded. I have spoken to gay men of that time who have read the book and they confirm the complexities of homsexual relationships as written by Ms Renault. How different the'scene' is half a century later - and then, how similar. Very different from her historical novels, 'The Charioteer' is a study of humanity that places her firmly in company of the greats!"},{"Title":"The Charioteer","review":"I agree that I have always pictured this as a movie. It seemed like a natural subject for Merchant and Ivory, though it is too late for that, now. Someone said it isn't a historical title, but since I didn't live through WWII on the British home front, it was for me. The immediacy of war---the black out, people dying in their own homes, all young men being military---this is what seemed most striking about the book. Juxtaposed against the backdrop of a world where none of the old promises hold true and where tomorrow may not come, friendship and romance become the proof of humanity. Since there is always a tendency to cling to the tattered shreds of the past in times of crisis, a romance that defies taboo is especially humane.But please, use British actors. Make them the right age, too. These are kids. If only Laurence Olivier was alive and young. I get the feeling that Ralph was modeled on him."},{"Title":"The Charioteer","review":"As a young man still exploring my sexuality, The Charioteer fell into my hands. I might call it providence, for Mary Renault's novel, more than any other I have read, has affirmed me in my own journey...and challanged me. Her novel is not exclusively about homosexuality though, it is a novel about all people filled with compassion and insight. This book contains wisdom, for this reason it belongs on all &quot;must read&quot; lists."},{"Title":"The Charioteer","review":"I am a gay man. Based on the very positive comments I read about this book I was much looking forward to reading it. Well, I am quite disappointed. It's elaborately written to the point of boring me stiff. Every notion, every thought, every movement of an eyebrow or the batting of an eyelid is described, acknowledged, explained, reasoned in extensive detail, thus often bringing the \\"action\\" to a screeching halt. I had a tough time reading it. The language is beautiful and rich. No denying. The dialogues vary from a realistic down to earth to highly stilted. Did gay men at WWII time really converse like \\"this\\"? For good orders' sake: I read the Pantheon paperback version of '83. \\"The Charioteer\\" was first published in '59. I dare say that by today's conceptions and expectations it is dated; of a certain historical value, maybe. Much is said between the lines. Patricia Nell Warren's \\"Front runner\\" and \\"Harlan's race\\" are, in comparison, almost pornographic. Our befuddled hero, Laurie (!!), eventually on page 267 has the sudden audacity to \\"lean over and kiss him\\" (= Andrew, the young man he admires). Kiss him where? On the forehead, the cheek, or (Heaven forbid) on the mouth? We are left guessing. Should we still care at that point. At around page 317 we learn in a most discrete manner that Laurie and his other love interest, Ralph, finally wound up between the sheets. A love story? I really don't know. It takes the protagonists the longest to even speak of love. My patience with the characters pretty soon came to an end. Despite my good intentions I could hardly muster an interest in them in the long run. And finishing reading \\"The Charioteer\\" ultimately became a duty, an obligation, not a pleasure."},{"Title":"The Charioteer","review":"After \\"the Persian Boy\\" this was recommmended to me, a love tiangle story played during the beginning of WWII in France among British boys. It was OK, rather wordy and not very dramatic."},{"Title":"The Charioteer","review":"I read the Charioteer ages ago. And I have reread it perodically. Mary Renault writes beautifully about the heartbreaking difficulty of finding and living with mature homosexual love. She goes beyond the superficial mannerisms and right to the issues of personality, commitment, caring, love and loneliness. Her book, more than any &quot;diversity&quot; training I have undertaken has taught me about the complexity of living outside of the mainstream and finding fulfillment in companionship. This goes beyond &quot;equality&quot; or &quot;gay rights&quot;, straight to the fundamental issues. And she does so with compassion, and brilliance."},{"Title":"The Charioteer","review":"THE CHARIOTEER is the kind of storytelling that doesn't exist any more in the modern literary world. There's barely any plot, but instead an exploration of emotions, self-discovery, and desires. It's written in the style of utmost literary propriety, rather than that of modern colloquialism, which makes for lovely prose but a much more difficult read. I often found myself re-reading sentences two or three times to fully grasp the meaning.For those of you unfamiliar with the story, it is set in England in 1940. Laurie is a 23-year-old soldier convalescing from a serious leg wound in a veteran's hospital. He befriends a young conscientious objector/pacifist/Quaker, Andrew, working there as an orderly. Laurie understands the sexual undercurrent of their friendship, but Andrew does not. Then through a circumstance of fate, an old school chum, Ralph, enters the picture. He's a naval captain who has just lost his command and is now part of a small clique of gay men, most for whom he feels contempt though he relies on their communal support. Ralph, who has developed a dependence on alcohol to counter the effects of the war, finds in Laurie a salvation, while Laurie finds his love divided between two men. One with whom that love can be fully realized, and the other which must be protected and kept chaste, lest it be destroyed.What makes THE CHARIOTEER such a masterwork, is that Mary Renault found an ingenious way to infer a hidden meaning to so much of her text. As this was first published in 1953 when the literary world was not ready for full-on descriptions of homosexuality, I don't know whether she actually wrote more, and was censored by her superiors, or if she instinctively knew just how much she could get away with without crossing the line. A discerning reader can pick up all the little cues and know exactly what is missing.The wonderful depth is all due to the character development. Laurie and Ralph are real-life human beings. Andrew less so, but that is because he is relegated to the supporting cast. Every bit of dialog, every physical movement, every thought (and there are some lovely flourishes of humor in Laurie's stray thoughts) plays to perfection without a single false note. The yearnings, fears, confusion and joys are absolutely genuine and I wouldn't trade a second of it for a slam-bang action-oriented plot.For anyone professing to be a student of seminal gay fiction, or historical gay fiction, THE CHARIOTEER is imperative reading."},{"Title":"The Charioteer","review":"I realize I've already written a review of The Charioteer but while perusing other customer reviews I came across a review which made me realize why I love this book so much. It is because ever since I finished the book for the first time back in 1986, I can't get Laurie and Ralph out of my head. They became so real to me upon that first reading that I have been compelled to return to the book again and again if only to spend a few more moments with some old friends. There are only a few other fictional characters I feel so close to, and none as much as these two."},{"Title":"The Charioteer","review":"This is, bar none, my favorite book. It must be; I've read it at least a dozen times over the years, and I walk away from it with something new each and every time.Renault is a mistress of sublime subtlety, and she says as much through artistic uses of pauses and silence and the absence of words as she does with every finely-honed phrase. Each of her characters is beautifully human: Laurie, the frustrated invalid coming to terms with his identity and his emotions; Ralph, a man living a painfully British life \\"of quiet desperation;\\" Andrew, the innocent; the cagey yet well-meaning Alec; the immature and demanding Sandy; cruel and calculating Bunny... all of these characters and more are thrown together by fate and circumstance after the evacuation of Dunkirk in 1940-- Britain's finest hour-- as they attempt to make sense of love and war.The Charioteer is successful on every level-- as a brilliant piece of historical fiction, as poetic literature, as an etude on the themes of the Iliad, and, perhaps most importantly as a timeless story of love among the ruins and the power of hope ... It is truly an underrated masterpiece of 20th century fiction."},{"Title":"The Charioteer","review":"I read The Charioteer first in mid 1960s when it was first gay book I had ever seen. It changed my views of gay lifestyles in a very positive way. For years I was afraid to reread it in case it disappointed me but when I finally did so I finished it in 24 hours and then read it again. Well written, supportive, affirming and hopeful. A remarkable book for one written in early 1950s"},{"Title":"The Charioteer","review":"The Charioteer reminded me very much of Sense and Sensibility by Jane Austen, in theme rather than style. Renault's aversion to the sexual tribalists is very much apparent by the end of the book; it parallels Austen's disdain for romanticism. The book is eminently readable, if a bit slow (I give it 4 stars instead of 5 for its tendency to be a tedious read at times). The potential reader will get more out of this novel if he/she has a good grasp of Plato (especially the Phaedrus). In any case, Renault's departure from her powerful historical fiction set in Ancient Greece is a positive thing; The Charioteer is among Mary Renault's finest."},{"Title":"The Charioteer","review":"I also read this book several years ago and just returned to it. It was even better than I remembered!It is a subtle and tightly written book which needs to be read carefully but is WELL worth the effort. If I were ever restricted to one novel, this would be it!"},{"Title":"The Charioteer","review":"One of the most powerful novels I've ever read; it had a major impact on my life. A long-time fantasy of mine is that Merchant/Ivory would make it into a British TV mini-series. If you like this book, you will probably also enjoy &quot;Maurice&quot; by E. M. Forster."},{"Title":"The Charioteer","review":"I found this book by doing a little research into what is considered \\"quality Gay Fiction.\\" When I first started reading I was a little surprised at first at how antiquated the writing style was and I suspected that I might not have the patience to read a book that requires the effort of rereading some sentences to get the point. However, I was immediately drawn into the characters and kept at it. By the last half of the book I was in love with all 3 of the main characters, appreciative of the authors beautifully nuanced writing and caught in the exquisite agony of tearing though every page to find out what happens while dreading the end of my time with these characters. I cannot recommend this book highly enough."},{"Title":"The Charioteer","review":"This was the best novel I have ever read! This story is about what love between two people really is. This book shows the difference between infatuation and love. The story is very intimate and gets into the emotions of human beings"},{"Title":"The Charioteer","review":"**spoiler alert** A review is not possible, not for me anyway, because the book is so rich and complex I don't think I have the means to write about it. Just a few thoughts.I can't explain how pervasive Laurie became page after page. I thought I was keeping an equal distance from him and the other characters, but when I got to the end, I realized I wasn't able to detach my point-of-view from his and he totally, totally convinced me of his perceptions, so much so that I thought Ralph had really spoken to Andrew. I read the last chapter with dread, shock, worry and being sorry and mortified.Laurie is divided between the love for Andrew, which Laurie seems to want to keep innocent and spiritual, and the love for Ralph, which is physical and brings with it the participation to a circle of gay men, that Laurie seems not to be able to accept, because it seems to exclude them from the rest of society.The writing is subtle and beautiful, it's not only to be read, but also to be contemplated. We are so used to being open, but the constant tension of what is said or left unsaid, because the concern for social propriety was so ingrained in the characters, makes you always hyper-aware of each word. There are moments of obscurity, but also moments of revelation. You are expecting something, and it happens under your eyes without you realizing it. You are in the dark, then the author sheds a light, until it becomes blinding.Beautiful. Beautiful. Beautiful."},{"Title":"The Charioteer","review":"This is the only work of Renault's I have ever read - it was assigned in an undergraduate gay & lesbian literature class. I found the characters superb, exquisitely developed, highly believable. Renault's prose is a mixture of romantic lyricism and modern experimentation. A wonderful, moving love story. Dense, but very highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Charioteer","review":"The Audio verison of this book is Excellent. The reader is a woman, whose name I can't recall. She does a great job. It seems strange at first, but then it flows very nicely. On Audio the Characters are even more real and Vivid. It's almost as if you were listening in on their dialoge. Since the book can be a hard read at times, this can be a great alternative."},{"Title":"The Charioteer","review":"There's really not much to add to the other reviews, but I feel the need to put my two cents into the mix. This novel does several things extremely well: A)It illuminates the inner life of a thoughtful young gay man in England during the Second World War, B) It vividly portrays gay culture in London in the mid-20th century, C) It examines the conflict between heartfelt religious belief and genuine love in the life of a young conscientious objector, D) the author inserts a steady stream of insights regarding living a life of integrity as a gay person, and E) the writing style is typical of Renault: subtle, thoughtful, and elegant. I have returned to this novel on several occasions, and each time I have been thoroughly engrossed in the world Mary Renault creates for the reader."},{"Title":"The Charioteer","review":"Mary Renault's The Charioteer is a partly-frosted window on a bygone time when homosexuality was \\"the love that dare not speak its name\\" in literature and real life. In lyrical prose she shares an engrossing story of three homosexual men interconnected by love yet experiencing extraordinary difficulty in their personal relationships. The raging Battle of Britain is only one of the sources of their troubles and not the most serious. Because the gay characters had not died by the end, the story was considered to be gay-positive for its time. A happy ending can be worked out by the alert reader, perhaps after a couple of re-reads.Renault employs creative literary devices to espouse a truth that related in less evasive fiction might have been suppressed in the 1950's, when the novel was written. (It was published in the US in 1959.) She has a flair for the artful metaphor and prose pregnant with hidden meanings. The careful reader will discover the ellipses in her tale, and particularly her character portrayals. The narrative is littered with lacunae which must be puzzled out (among them what sexual interactions transpired.) One of the most apt and telling phrases that turns up is the \\"hairpin drop,\\" now an obsolete concept. It means dropping a hint of one's homosexuality in a way that a straight person wouldn't pick up on, as of a time when being exposed as gay would ruin one's life. The hairpin drop is an equally serviceable metaphor for Renault's prose style. Even so, it is all done very tastefully and with great literary skill. British men of that age weren't expected to express their feelings except by indirection.The vividness with which Renault portrays the burdens placed on her gay characters by the repressive society in which they were trapped cannot but distress the sensitive, 21st century reader. The characters are beaten down by homophobia, a force so pervasive that it seldom needs to be pointed out. In my view, the book fails as romance because it is much too realist, and reality for gays in the mid-twentieth century was insufferable.The book received glowing reviews when it arrived in America in 1959, a little more than a decade after Gore Vidal had been shouted down for his unapologetic treatment of homosexuality in The City and the Pillar. It seems plausible that Renault's understated, elliptical storytelling style compromised in a way that made favorable reviews attainable. Unfortunately being well-attuned to the regressive intellectual sensibilities of the 50's puts the book at a disconnect with the 21st century. The Charioteer casts homosexuals as atomized, wounded individuals who find satisfying human relations only with the greatest difficulty, and at significant risk of bad things happening. The moral sometimes seems to be that gay men are their own worst enemies, albeit as a response to the hostile environment of that time.The Charioteer discreetly succeeded in putting the case for gay liberation way ahead of its time. Consider Mary Renault's evocation of the idea of gay \\"pride,\\" using that word, when her most insightful character makes a point by alluding to the prohibition of alcohol:You can't make good wine in a bathtub in the cellar, you need sun and rain and fresh air, you need a pride in the job you can tell the world about. Only you can live without drink if you have to, but you can't live without love.The pride this novel inspires comes in the realization that our movement has transformed the living conditions of LGBT people beyond all recognition since Stonewall. The Charioteer calls us to a history that makes the present all the more remarkable for how different it is."},{"Title":"The Charioteer","review":"If it is possible for a novel to enhance a persons life, then 'The Charioteer' did that for me. I first read the book over 20 years ago and its effect was profound. Each time I have re-read it, further insights into the characters and the era have unfolded. I have spoken to gay men of that time who have read the book and they confirm the complexities of homsexual relationships as written by Ms Renault. How different the'scene' is half a century later - and then, how similar. Very different from her historical novels, 'The Charioteer' is a study of humanity that places her firmly in company of the greats! A classic!"},{"Title":"The Charioteer","review":"A small grey mouse slips from beneath the door sill, pauses a moment to fan silvery whiskers and smooth down velvet grey fur, then whispers:First one must thank the good folk at Amazon Shipping for their efforts. They said the book would get here on January 26th and it arrived on the 22nd. One is unable to express how much delight this actuated. So far, this one has re-read it three times since its arrival and plans to spend the weekend on a fourth and fifth visit into Ms. Renault's world.Now, who does not love to come home to old friends, knowing they will be more then welcome, and anticipating only the most wonderful reunion?One first read this book over thirty years ago, and is utterly enthralled to find thirty-odd reviews online concerning it. The horrible house ate one's copy about twelve years past and one has been hunting for a copy ever since, because one re-read it once a year up until the time the house held it hostage.At fifteen, this book was an epiphany, not merely for writing style to an aspiring author, but also for it's subtle and well crafted characterizations.Please meet Laurence Odell, child of divorce raised solely by his mother. After the age of five he never sees his father again. One follows Laurence - Laurie -through the most formative years of his life until the story settles. One sees his mother push out his father for allegedly cheating on her. One sees him in what we would call High School. He has developed a strong attachment to an older authority figure, R.R. Lanyon. More than a crush, less than a declared intent, Laurie is appalled and enraged when a friend announces that Lanyon is to be \\"sent up\\" (expelled) for immoral activities. Only Lanyon's admission that he is not innocent of the accusations pressed against him stops Laurie from Outing himself - completely unaware and unrealistic of the actual repercussions.Now it is 1940. One finds oneself observing am E.M.S. hospital in the countryside of nearby Bridstow. Laurence has had his kneecap shot off at Dunkirk and must be ignominiously rescued, as all the army was ignominiously rescued, by the navy. He has endured two surgeries to correct the big-gun wound and cannot walk without a crutch or cane. Laurie is a corporal, and comfortable with the other wounded vets who surround him. 'They are a touchy society' to quote the book, ' but they know it'. Enter into this makeshift hospital a batch of c.o.'s, Conscientious Objectors, to replace the orderly and maid staff who left after finding their placement too isolated. Now Laurie meets Andrew Raynes, a seventeen year old Quaker who has opted not to fight. A chaste romance blossoms on Laurie's side, and something seems to be blossoming in Andrew, but Laurie, remembering the lessons taught to him by Lanyon during their last interview seven years ago, cannot tell Andrew what he is and what he feels, because he does not wish to interfere with, or ruin Andrew's self perception.As this gentle romance meanders along, Laurie runs across a gay intern he played with long-distance, on an impulse. Sandy Reid invites Laurie back to a birthday party for his partner, one later meets Alec Deacon who is also an intern at the hospital. Laurie refuses twice, he has had a bad time at Oxford with a gay man he met, started to get to know, and rejected, but then Sandy Reid mentions Ralph Lanyon and Laurie is hooked. He ventures into the closed society of the homosexual men of the time...a time when blackmail is almost legal against gay men, a time when the laws are not on their side to say the least, a time when a gay bashing might be overlooked as the thing to do.At the party, Laurie is appalled to hear, and see, the flouncing, frisking gossips and nattering, jewelry sporting men who seem to have no sense of themselves beyond their sexuality and its confinements. He rejected this society at Oxford. He rejects it now. He almost leaves before Lanyon arrives. Lanyon does arrive but not before Alec informs Laurie that it was Lanyon's ship that picked him off the beach at Dunkirk, ostensibly saving his life, and Lanyon wrote to him after being wounded in the sinking of that ship a little later. Lanyon wrote, but the letter came back that Laurie had died of his wounds. Laurie is astounded, and somewhat flattered, to realize that he had Lanyon's attention even when he stank of decomposition and looked like all Hell.When Lanyon enters, an unquiet scene plays out that results in a particularly unpleasant event. Laurie and Ralph Lanyon are thrown together for the best part of the night, and they exchange any number of confidences as they begin to get to know one another as adults. It's too good to throw out spoilers, read it. The Romance has been thriving, unfed, in both of them for almost a decade. The pleasure of this book is watching them feel their way towards one another, with caution at first, then with determination unabridged on Ralph's part. The ending stops one's breath in one's throat. One likes these young men, and wishes them well, and is very much afraid how their conflicts with devolve: With or without resolution.Put aside certain details. This is a Romance in the old fashioned meaning of the word. A sweeping emotional Odyssey that covers the first half of two people's lives. Never mind they are gay men. Never mind the back drop of Bridstow, or the E.M.S. Hospital. Here we see humans striving to be worthy to both give and receive love despite all obstacles and social conventions. We want them to be worthy, and we strive right along beside them. I have left out a great many details because there are thirty-odd reviews before this one, and because one has only so much time. And because you should indulge yourself in this book, if you're reading this review then obviously you are interested. It will satisfy, as all Ms. Renault's works do. It is understated, skillfully woven, and always topical.Left, right, or center, it is always important that one make out as a human being.Someone in the reviews wants this to be a movie - I say mini-series on HBO or Showtime, but since so much of the book is internal and emotional, I worry it won't really make a good video presentation. I'd by a ticket, or rent it on line. How about a C.G. Peter O'Toole, back when he was young and spare and sharp as a knife?(Madly anthropomorphizing:) Smoothing back silver whiskers, the grey velvet mouse surveys the scene. Nodding once, it slips quickly back through the door sill and is gone."},{"Title":"The Charioteer","review":"The Charioteer is a sympathetic portrait of the love triangle between three men who meet and fall in love in post-war London. The protagonist, Laurie Odell, was severely wounded during the battle of Dunkirk, and the novel explores his journey towards recovery. While in hospital north of London, Laurie meets Andrew, a Quaker indentured to the hospital due to his status as a conscientious objector. (Tell me you've read this, secretlybronte). The two men strike up a sweetly innocent and sexless romance based on their mutual isolation and barely-acknowledged queerness.Meanwhile, Ralph Lanyon (an older, more experienced man whom Laurie knew years ago at school) reenters Laurie's life, and Laurie is forced to chose between his innocent love for Andrew or his more overtly sexual yearning for Ralph. The novel features some interesting exploration of what love can mean when it's approached as a moral choice, but it also looks at issues of peace, cowardice and existential yearning. The Charioteer is a bit dated (the novel was published in 1959) and has some offensive characterization of men who are overtly effeminate, but it's beautifully written and incredibly forward-thinking in its treatment of gay themes."},{"Title":"The Charioteer","review":"It's true that this marvelously written story (though often a slow read) is ONE BIG TEASE! Even in 1941 the \\"hidden\\" gay subculture in England was more available and well-known and far less \\"swishy\\" than Renault needs you to believe in order to hook you. And hook you she does! But poor Laurie, though hungrily Yearning to do so for years and years, does not even kiss (fully platonically) another male until, what, page 200-something?If you're prone to judge any/all books you read by today's \\"standards\\" of explicitness, directness and overt sexual detail please don't read this book and by all means do not criticize it by such guidelines. If you're \\"offended\\" by the normalization of gay male love, don't read this book, and by all means do not criticize it through that perspective. However, be sure to criticize it and react to it as a work of high literary value. But, please, all you homophobes out there simply zip your lips and keep your offended \\"sensibilities\\" to yourself. Let the rest of the world enjoy a moment of literary (if not cultural) sanity.Laurie, the hero, is hardly a son I would ordinarily have been proud of. He's not very manly, really, though he's quite intellectual. He often seems to lack backbone. He takes eons to decide ANYTHING of importance. And when push comes to shove, he more often than not denies his nature and wimps out. Pity. When unleashed, his mean side is shocking, his words hurtful, and of course his conscience causes him regret and anguish. He doesn't like his nasty side, and it obviously is a self-loathing projected onto others. But, though slow on the \\"uptake of self-awareness\\" and even slower to act upon self-revelations when they knock him about in the head, he nonetheless becomes a rather lovable creature and a son to embrace.Laurie also, for most of the book, has an unresolved and terrifyingly obvious and debilitating Oedipus complex. His thoroughly unlikable mother finally abandons him to a new husband late in the book, whereupon mere hours later, that very night, Laurie magically becomes an honest gay man, aged 23. His long-dominant complex vanishes (just like that!), thanks to one sensational night sleeping with Ralph, the anti-hero and main secondary character, the only guy who really and truly loves him.What Renault, an Oxford-educated woman cannot do in this fine book published first in 1959 is --- get truly inside the head of a sexually conflicted young man (either Laurie, or Andrew, his secret love interest). Getting inside Ralph, who is a much less subtle personality, she succeeds. But Mary Renault is not a gay man, and like someone who has never been imprisoned for years and years, she simply is mentally unable to correctly depict with any thoroughness what actually goes on inside the imprisoned body and brain of a gay male who cannot, is not, and will not be open, whether 1941, 300 BC, or 2008. Only someone \\"who has been there\\" has this capacity.But, the book is very good indeed! It's a wonderful, beautifully written tantalizing love story, giving readers a glimpse into Renault's view of an important subtext of 1940's British society. The war is merely a backdrop. The characters act out for her the awful truths about repression and suppression of self and the price all gay men everywhere in all eras pay for being people without full civil rights and true societal integration.Some nice sentences include these: Page 100. \\"You looked too absorbed to be true.\\" (That's Andrew speaking to Laurie.) Page 190. \\"For the first time he had a feeling of its being no longer in the background of his self-portrait.\\" (That's Laurie thinking about his injured knee.) Page 191. \\"This grave moment gave to the smile that followed an irresistible sincerity.\\"I have one big complaint. I honestly did not understand the last 3 pages, when Laurie \\"returns\\" to Ralph. It seemed to me that she must have written the ending 10 times, and finally chose one version at random. Renault's metaphor of the pair of white and black horses, when she makes a final connection to the concept of \\"Charioteer,\\" was too cute and too elusive to cause (in me anyway) a feeling of satisfaction on the last page of this otherwise fine novel. The finale was a huge let-down. So, not only for her consistent, unnecessary obtuseness throughout the novel, I rate this story a 3, because a) She failed to raise the gay characters sufficiently above stereotypes, and b) she simply could not write a satisfying ending."},{"Title":"The Charioteer","review":"I read this a few months ago; these are lasting impressions of the book.I have read some of Renault's historical fiction, and this moden novel differs. The Charioteer is not infused with the history of a period, no descriptions of politics or great battles or historical details. Writing in this modern wartime setting is, I think, so close to Renault's own world that it evaporates from her prose. The characters and events, what events there are, occur almost in a dreamy vacuum. Renault writes inside her characters' minds, not looking out from their eyes into the world, but inward-turning. It's also a sort of cryptic, poetic style of writing, which I personally did not enjoy so much. If you are a fan of poetry and philosophical meandering, you may enjoy this, but readers looking for a visceral book in terms of place and time setting, characters, action, etc should look elsewhere. The book is filled with emotion, but it's emotion tempered by self-contemplation and self-doubt. The main characters are pressed down tight, a stranglehold on their actions and feelings.It's brilliantly written, but I didn't enjoy it."},{"Title":"365 Kittens-a-Year Calendar 2003","review":"Most calendars give you a monthly picture this one has kittens everyday.

The actual quote from the book is as follows: \\"I can't guarantee that good preschool work will make your dog a top dog, but I can guarantee the puppy will be untrainable if you bring it home, put it in the kennel, give it no name, pay no attention to it, and a year or so later try to train it\\".This is a great book for anyone that has decided to train their own gun dog!"},{"Title":"Top Dog : Training the Retriever for Waterfowl and Upland Hunting","review":"this book focuses too much on field trials and not enough on the hunting dog..better books out there for the hunter"},{"Title":"Top Dog : Training the Retriever for Waterfowl and Upland Hunting","review":"What a dissapointment of a book.

A year ago, while searching for a copy of the Disney film Our Friend the Atom, I bought a 1961 printing of this book. I had honestly forgotten just how well written it really is. For all of its naivet&eacute; - arguably just reflecting the naivet&eacute; of the times - Our Friend The Atom nevertheless proved that solid technical content can be presented in an attractive and, most importantly, understandable package. Forty years after its release, the mix of form and substance still holds up well.I have since bought three additional copies (all different printings) for my collection of early atomic energy memorabilia, including a first printing. In these days when nuclear power seems a dying technology, Our Friend The Atom reminds me of the promise it once held."},{"Title":"The Walt Disney story of our friend the atom","review":"I got this book for a Christmas present when I was about 8 or 9. I was interested in science at an early age and eagerly sought out popular accounts. This book was well illustrated in the Disney style and clearly written. I remember reading it from cover to cover in one sitting -- an re-reading it over and over again -- and being fascinated by the portraits of various scientists, the depiction of things and technologies related to the atomic world. One part stood out above all: the story of Avogadro's hypothesis that equal volumes of different gases contained indentical numbers of particles. For some reason, this absolutely fascinated me. Why should this hypothesis be true, and how could one possibly know it? I even tried to make up what I now recognize as kinetic theories to account for this -- of course, I didn't know any real physics so I was way beyond my depth.I can really say that this book helped inspire me to go on to a scientific career.

It also taught me that mercury, beryllium, arsenic, and nickel cause health effects. Four years later, one of the major toothbrush manufacturers began selling a toothbrush impregnated with a mercury compound to suppress \\"unhealthy bacterial growth\\" on the bristles between brushings.

After much more time and education on the subject of American Sterling flatware, I realized that Ms. Dolan's approach is actually rather pragmatic and useful (organized alphabetically, by manufacturer, with hallmarks being displayed before each section). I would have appreciated an entire section devoted solely to identifying hallmarks, a wider range of American manufacturers, and an index, but this book has indeed proven useful for me, regardless (even though I am only able to reference between 50 to 60% of the patterns in any given pile of mixed antique American Sterling flatware, using solely this book - but still). Though by no means a complete reference in itself, Ms. Dolan's book should indeed be included in any collection of American Sterling flatware reference material, and seems to fill some of the gaps in other existing reference guides."},{"Title":"American Sterling Silver Flatware 1830s-1990s: An Identification and Value Guide","review":"The 1880&#8217;s to 1990&#8217;s American Sterling Silver Flatware is a reference guide to 23 of the major American Sterling Silver Flatware makers and their production. It provides an overview of the patterns and the individual pieces produced in this 100 or so year&#8217;s time frame. For someone who loves silver it is lovely to look at. Some of the images are, just as they are on the front cover; beautifully photographed images. Others seem to be poor quality computer scanned images that produce, in many cases, barely acceptable illustrations or examples of the pattern.If you know the name of the company you will be able to find the name of the pattern, the date of issue and an approximate price for four components. Not necessarily the basic four components of a place setting, as I understand it to be, i.e. a Dinner Knife, Dinner Fork, Dessert/Salad Fork and Tea Spoon. One also has access to a list of pieces that were originally produced. Here again, the guide could offer so much more. It does not provide insight into the difference between a Master Butter Knife and a Butter Knife nor does it include the measurements of different pieces, which I would have found invaluable. It is very useful to know that a Place fork or Luncheon Fork might be slightly less than 7 inches in length and that a Dinner Fork may be 7 inches. And just what does an Orange Knife look like, or Strawberry Spoon an as compared to an Almond Spoon. More importantly, how does a Five O&#8217;clock Spoon differ from the more Basic Tea Spoon and those, which are mentioned as Full Size Trade Tea Spoon, Full Size Regular Tea Spoon, Full Size Heavy Tea Spoon, or Full Size Massive Tea Spoon. Again, the weight of different items would have been useful.

Their gradual coming to terms with one another, amid the backdrop of the family business - a pay-by-the-hour roadside motel that depends upon airmen, prostitutes, and visitors to the state penitentiary for its clientele - evolves through the turbulence of an extended voyage of discovery and more, in this sometimes sardonic, sometimes heartwarming look at the effort it takes to forge true family ties. The Blue Yonder Inn is a deftly written and highly recommended for personal reading lists and community library contemporary fiction collections."},{"Title":"The Blue Yonder Inn","review":"This book is highly entertaining and a very quick read.

Well, drive yourself over to the Blue Yonder Inn where you'll meet a memorable assortment of oddballs whose resumes aren't exactly worth a second call. Bonnie Blue, the down-and-out protagonist, leaves Blackie, her baby, in a wheelbarrow outside the Blue Yonder Inn and heads out on her own hero's journey. On the run from her good-for-nothing husband Gil, Bonnie meets up with more curious folk - some unsavory, some endearing. This story is sharp, fast paced, and has well drawn characters.

Just as Turnip Blues was too hilarious to put down, so the character development in The Blue Yonder Inn makes you not want to quit reading until the end. Though the central story of Bonnie Blue, Blackie, and Darnelle covers but a brief span of time, you are transported back and forth through the generations of their family and friendships resulting in a panoramic encounter that seems all so familiar. Campbell writes with such detail and clarity that the reader's emotions are continuously engaged.

Authentic, funny, poignant, insightful -- Campbell's novel doesn't shy away from the ugly truth about the underside of American society -- as it was in the 60s in Texas -- but you'll end the book feeling joyous rather than depressed, trust me."},{"Title":"The Blue Yonder Inn","review":"Reading The Blue Yonder Inn is like stepping into another world, filled with high-spirited quirky women who you've never met, but you soon feel you can't live without.

I really like this series so far. The first two that I've read, Waltz of Shadows and Blood Dance, have been very entertaining and satisfying. They are not perfect books, but that is not the intention. In the case of Waltz of Shadows, Lansdale simply decided not to publish it when he finished it years ago. Blood Dance, though, was an early Western novel that just had a lot of bad luck through multiple planned publications.Blood Dance is pretty much a traditional Western. Lansdale stays within the structure of an off-the-drugstore-rack pulp-style Western yarn, which is what I think he set out to do. Lansdale readers, though, will recognize plenty of Lansdale's stylistic trademarks. The book has some very minor flaws, and I won't get into them for fear of spoiling anything, but they were for me very easy to forgive. Generally, this is a very polished piece of writing. The story pulls you right along, and Lansdale knows that it's all about the characters anyway, and there are plenty of interesting and well-drawn characters here.I like that Lansdale resisted the urge to revise these &quot;lost&quot; novels (although I think he cleaned up Waltz of Shadows a little for publication). As a long-time fan, it's enjoyable for me to read an early novel, warts and all. Waltz of Shadows is not likely to be published again any time soon, but this book, Blood Dance, might be in paperback someday for those that miss this limited edition."},{"Title":"Blood Dance (The Lost Lansdale Series Vol. 3)","review":"As I said in my review of THE MAGIC WAGON by Joe R. Lansdale, I'm not really a big fan of Western novels, though I have read a few over the years. Because I'm now such a huge fan of Mr. Lansdale's writing, I'll read anything by him, no matter what the genre. BLOOD DANCE is no exception. It's one of his earlier Westerns that was written back around 83 or 84 and finally saw publication two years ago with Subterranean Press. Since I loved THE MAGIC WAGON so much, I decided to pick up a copy of this short novel, and I have to say that I definitely got my money's worth out of it. BLOOD DANCE takes place in the Dakota Territory, ten years after the Civil War, and is the story of Jim Melgrhue, an ex-Confederate soldier and Louisiana boy. When he and his best friend, Bob Bucklaw, decide to join a gang a train robbers, led by Beau Carson, Jim's instincts tell him that there's nothing but trouble around the corner, which proves to be the case. The train robbery turns out to be a fiasco, and when Carson orders the execution of all the passengers, Jim and Bob quickly decide to take a stand against the gang and its leader. Though they valiantly try to save the passengers, the gun battle that ensues leaves Bob Bucklaw dead and Jim seriously wounded. When Jim eventually comes to, he has to once again fight in order to save himself from a Sioux war party that's investigating the train and its dead passengers. Only through luck and the unexpected appearance of John Johnston the Crow Killer (think of the Robert Redford movie, \\"Jeremiah Johnson\\") does our protagonist survive. Thus begins the journey of Jim Melgrhue's quest for vengeance against Beau Carson and his gang of killers. As Jim heals from his wounds, he tags along with Johnston for a while, and then with a Crow warrior by the name of Dead Thing, who has his own score to settle against Carson. This leads to a Sundance in which Jim experiences a vision of his future. Before the path of revenge has been completed, Jim will try his hand at gold mining, save the life of Wild Bill Hickok, and find himself at Little Big Horn with General George Custer and three thousand Indians that are looking for a little payback. Like the late Louis L'Amour, Joe R. Lansdale does his research and incorporates historical fact with fiction, carefully weaving his adventurous yarn so that the reader doesn't always know what's true and what's created from the author's imagination. BLOOD DANCE is a quick read that can be done in a couple of hours. What makes the novel so entertaining is Lansdale's ability as a storyteller. He has a unique skill at being able to create characters that come alive with just a few short sentences, a dark sense of humor that can make even the most jaded reader laugh out loud, and an uncanny instinct for making any story sound interesting With Lansdale, the reader knows that he's going to have fun from the first page to the last. I find it hard to understand why more people don't know about this exceptional East Texas author. This man can write horror, action, westerns, serious drama, children's fiction, and even zany over-the-top adventure stories. Illustrated by Mark A. Nelson, BLOOD DANCE is a sure winner for those who enjoy a good Western novel and want to have a few hours of pure fun."},{"Title":"Blood Dance (The Lost Lansdale Series Vol. 3)","review":"A rip-roaring Western is not the genre I associate with Lansdale. But I will read anything the man writes - he is that fine of a raconteur. I've often wished I could be sitting around a campfire, having Joe Lansdale telling some of his tales. Two of my Top Ten books of all time -The BottomsandA Fine Dark Line- were written by him.In this short novel, the protagonist is Jim Melgrhue, ex-Confederate soldier and a man you would want to call friend. This novel is about revenge. Jim's best friend Bob Bucklaw and he decide, albeit begrudgingly, to help ex-Confederate officer Beau Carson rob a train carrying gold. When things don't turn out the way Carson thought they would, he decides to kill all the witnesses, which Melgrhue and Bucklaw can't abide. Bad turns to worse and soon Melgrhue is hunting down Carson and his followers for revenge of his best friend's and others' deaths.Melgrhue meets up with all kinds of colorful characters (some historical and some not) along his path to find Carson. In-depth character development is something Lansdale does in all his books and has quite a talent at making look easy.You don't have to enjoy Westerns to enjoy \\"Blood Dance.\\" You just need to enjoy excellent storytelling."},{"Title":"Blood Dance (The Lost Lansdale Series Vol. 3)","review":"As this story opens, Joe Melghrue is hesitant to proceed with a planned train robbery. Along with his partner, he has fallen in with an unsavory lot but they need the money, both being Confederate veterans with no stable work. Melghrue's worst fears come true when the outlaws decide to murder everyone on the train and when Melghrue refuses, they kill his partner and leave him for dead. The rest of the novel deals with the time-honored quest for revenge as our hero faces many obstacles in his journey for blood.Lansdale's work, whether writing horror or mystery, always moves at a break-neck pace. With the author taking the reins of the traditional fast-paced Western genre, he delivers an extremely quick read loaded with action and memorable characters. As part of the Lost Lansdale series, Blood Dance is presented by the author as is. While I admire his warts-and-all approach, the roughness of the novel shows through in what I noticed were two very distinct sections of the book.The first part of the book is very traditional and reads much like a Louis L'amour story. The action is fast and plentiful. While we are introduced to the character of Liver Eatin' Johnson, who was a real life frontiersman, his appearance does not take on the same pretentiousness as the later historical figures.The latter half of the book has Melghrue interacting with Wild Bill Hickok and Custer at the Little Big Horn during part of his quest for revenge. Too often, when Westerns include true-life figure, they begin to read like a Forrest Gump movie. Lansdale falls into this trap here. Not only must our character meet these people but they must interact with them or save their lives, altering or predicting history. We are bombarded with historical facts about them and the result is characters that are not fleshed out as real people but more like caricatures.We also have the Sundance here which is an Indian ritual portrayed in the move \\"A Man Called Horse\\" (remember that scene where he's hanging by tethers that have pierced his chest? Ouch!) Here the novel takes a little more supernatural turn. Not unusual territory for Lansdale but seemingly out of place after the more traditional Western feel of the first half.Overall, I thought this was a good read that provided a strong entertainment value. But I would not recommend it for fans of the Western genre who have not been exposed to Lansdale. Lansdale fans, even those who don't like Westerns, will find the book interesting as a precursor to his later run of odd Western stories and the author doesn't let anyone down in the action department either."},{"Title":"Z Goes Home","review":"The letter Z escapes from her sign at the zoo, and tours through town noticing the other alphabet letters. Z gets into quite a bit of trouble - eating cake and falling into an earthquake zone, receiving a karate kick and even getting lost in a labyrinth - and finally makes it home. Zowie! Whattabook!Last page is a glossary. Don't miss it!"},{"Title":"Z Goes Home","review":"That's it. I'm just going to have to write a book all about the abundance and diversity found in alphabet books out there. There's nothing else for it. Every time I convince myself that I've reviewed my last alphabetical picture extravaganza, I discover another one and it's down that slippery slope I slide once more. I've eventually come to the conclusion that alphabet books fall into two distinct categories. In the first are the ones that try to appeal to children in some way. They may utilize racecars, dinosaurs, or puppy dogs. It doesn't matter. At their heart is an overwhelming need to be loved by people under the age of 12. Then there are the alphabet picture books that couldn't care less what kids think of them. These are designer alphabets. They're tricky and clever and exist in their own little world. Which brings us to Jon Agee's 2003 foray into the alphabetic picture book world. Like any good illustrator (I've always admired his, \\"The Incredible Painting of Felix Clousseau\\") he's given his own little touch to the genre. The result is a book that somehow manages to walk a fine line between kids and adults while at the same time zooming into wide-eyed devil-may-care zaniness. If nothing else, \\"Z Goes Home\\" is an exercise in alphabetic clean-lined surrealism.It's the end of a long day. On one page we see a ladder leaning against a sleeping bear's cage and the words \\"CITY ZOO\\" standing proudly up top. In the next instance, the \\"Z\\" in \\"ZOO\\" has climbed down the ladder and is returning home. To do so, he wanders through a series of paranormal scenes, all hiding a letter of the alphabet somewhere in their midst. A walk over a \\"B\\" shaped bridge looks down on an \\"A\\" shaped alien in a valley. A \\"J\\" shaped jetty sports a karate master who has fashioned in body into a perfect \\"K\\" and who has also (though this is unclear) just kicked \\"Z\\" into the awaiting water below. I wouldn't say that the longer you read the goofier it gets since these scenes are pretty goofy to begin with. Still, it's hard not to stare in confusion at the \\"N\\" shaped newspapers or the inexplicably hollow oak that could just as easily have displayed an \\"O\\" had it not been so mysteriously emptied of its inner wood. By the time you get to the lady in the black and white checkered skirt creating copy after copy after copy of the letter \\"X\\", you're as relieved as \\"Z\\" is to finally open the door and announce, \\"HEY, EVERYBODY, I'M HOME!\\". Other letters lounge about the place, including a mysterious exclamation mark who somehow earned himself letter status in the household. With a final page simply titled, \\"ZOWIE!\\", Agee provides a one to eight word sentence that defines each term used in the book. From this you can learn that ink is, \\"a liquid that stains your clothes\\", and that rocks are, \\"large masses of stone\\".Yeah, I was a little weirded out by the whole exercise. Agee can't quite decide whether to make this the actual journey of our hero \\"Z\\" or just a wild conglomeration of a wild assortment of people, critters, and things. The journey isn't understandable. You don't know from one page to the next where \\"Z\\" is going or where he's about to go. It doesn't feel like the letter is covering any distance here. Instead, it feels as if \\"Z\\" has been zapped into each scene without any rhyme or reason for it. This isn't an objection, by the way. It just means that if you've a literal child who needs to see a series of steps taken to achieve a goal (i.e. getting home) get them \\"nno's Journey\\" by Anno and skip \\"Z Goes Home\\". This is a book for the child who finds the image of \\"Z\\" sunbathing beneath a palm tree, while a legless man pulls himself from a vortex-like circle of quicksand, intriguing.Agee's drawing style has changed over the years. In the aforementioned \\"Felix Clousseau\\" he was all about shadows and dark corners. \\"Z Goes Home\\" typifies his later work and has a look that's far more similar to his later \\"Terrific\\". If there is a sky or a plain background to these scenes, it's gonna be white or the very lightest of grays. There's a cleanliness to each picture in this book. Tiny details and messiness are absent from the whole kerschmozzle. I also found it mildly interesting that Agee chose to put a teensy bit of product placement as one of his words. \\"Xerox\\" isn't really a term, though it's used like one, and I'm sure the Xerox Company would have loved this bit of a mention, no matter how small or unintentional it was.I wasn't thrilled with \\"Z Goes Home\\". I'll admit it. I can't vouch for whether or not kids will take to it either. None of the reviews for this book (as of 12/8/05) have mentioned whether or not children enjoy reading it. Adults do, sure, but many adult who read this will already know their letters. Do kids like its gentle insanity or are they put off by it? My vote goes towards the put off camp, but since I've no evidence for this (and since I've never had a child ever recommend an alphabet book to me) I can't say for certain. What I can say is that this is an enjoyable book with interesting pictures that works well as a picture book and oddly as an alphabetic one. If you're looking for a sure-fire hit with the kiddies, \\"Z Goes Home\\" would not be my first recommendation. Try \\"Alphabet City\\" by Stephen Johnson or \\"The Turn-Around Upside Down Alphabet\\" by Lisa Campbell Ernst instead. If YOU would like a cool alphabet book to look at, however, knock yourself out."},{"Title":"Z Goes Home","review":"Z goes home is a very creative book.

Labour MP Graham Allen, however, argues that Blair's greatest constitutional significance comes from developing, to the fullest extent yet seen, a *de facto* UK Presidency. This short book gives us Allen's historical pr&eacute;cis of how this happened. More importantly, it also presents why he thinks this is a good thing, and how it should be codified and made part of a larger, and much-overdue, reform of the British Constitution.For an American reader, Allen's use of the title \\"president\\" risks some misunderstanding of the nature of the British office. The author makes it clear that he's not talking about a presidency in precisely the American sense. For one thing, he is explicit that The Queen should remain Head of State. Nevertheless, Allen is convinced that the highly-centralized UK is already \\"a political monopoly\\" (p. 21), and the Prime Minister an office-holder with \\"power that would make Stalin blush\\" (p. 25). It struck me as linguistically more precise to have described the UK Presidency as a monarchy (\\"sole\\" + \\"ruler\\") or even a tyranny (my dictionary defines *tyrant*, without initial reference to cruelty, as \\"an absolute ruler without constitutional restrictions,\\" which sounds a lot like the way Allen paints the PM's office).But linguistic concerns are secondary, at best. What Graham Allen has given us is a spirited argument about the essential irrelevance of Parliament and its Members in the governance of Britain. Some MPs and small-c conservatives are apparently still cherishing the zombie of parliamentary supremacy and of the House of Commons as the Churchillian stage on which the nation's great issues are debated. Allen has no time for this myth. Today, he says, Parliament exists solely to provide democratic cover for the UK presidency. In Bagehot's terms, it is now part of the \\"dignified,\\" rather than the \\"efficient,\\" part of government (p. 74-5).The essential thing to remember is that Graham Allen considers the expanded UK presidency a good thing. His book is not a critique but rather, as the subtitle suggests, a plea to the \\"apathetic, disaffected\\" British democracy to recognize the historical development of a UK presidency and to make the most of this. That would be done, as I said, by codifying the presidency in a larger package of constitutional and government reform, to include renewed relevance for the House, stronger and more independent local government, and development of true separation of powers.Far as I am from Whitehall, I can only guess as to whether this tract has had any impact on British politics or society at all. I'm inclined to doubt it, precisely because of that \\"apathetic, disaffected\\" democracy and the fact that -- as the author himself notes -- it is to the advantage of the Prime Minister (any PM, not just the incumbent) to keep things undefined. Still, as a reader with an interest in British history and politics, I learned much from the author's analysis and found a good deal of merit in his arguments. I hope in raising these questions to a wider audience, he enjoys greater success than he did when he raised them in Prime Minister's Question Time."},{"Title":"National system of political economy","review":"This book is very hard to find now. If you come by it in a large academic library you might note that it hasn't been checked out in a couple of decades or more. It is in fact the first, and probably still the most powerful, challenge to Adam Smith, David Ricardo and colleagues who developed the tenets and assumptions of the Free Trade, Laissez-Faire movement, starting in 1776 with Smith's 'The Wealth of Nations'. Published in the 1840's, it comprehensively compares national systems which promote industrial and agricultural development through tariffs and government support, notably the German and American systems, with the British colonial system of unrestricted Free Trade. It is a powerful indictment of the underlying motives and effects of the colonial system. The book has gone into extreme disfavour and total exclusion from college curriculums as these have gravitated to roles of corporate apologists or to reactions of Marxist and post structural ideology. It cogently presents, however, the argument against the world wide movement to limit economic sovereignty of nation states, and paints a grim picture of the inevitable result of unrestrained Free Markets, notably in the experience of British workers during the Industrial Revolution. The experience of the early to mid 19th Century, where these competing systems could be seen in very pure form by comparing the American and the British models, presents a compelling case for the National System List describes. Our current economic leaders do not want you to read this book, even as the leaks in Globalism start to bust down its dikes and even with a growing body of contrary modern opinion as to the benefit of Free Markets. If you read the 'Wealth of Nations' (or even better Ricardo's theories of Comparative Advantage.. free of Smith's distracting meditations on Moral Sentiments) do your self a favour and read the National System of Political Economy as well and see whose arguments, proven by human experience, win the day. It explains much of what is going on in the world today and presents alternatives to our current path at this critical point in history."},{"Title":"National system of political economy","review":"In _The National System of Political Economy_, Friedrich List advocates an economic policy of nationalism based on the philosophy of protectionism. List argues that protectionism can lead to greater national economic benefit and argues against the system of laissez-faire free trade. The book is divided into four parts: The History, The Theory, The Systems, and The Politics, each focussing on a particular aspect of the theory of protectionism. List rails against the \\"cosmopolitical\\" theory of free trade economists such as Adam Smith as espoused in his _Wealth of Nations_. In particular, List contrasts the systems of protectionism in America and Germany against the system of free trade advocated by the British. He gives the history of the rise of the Hanseatic League in Germany against the British. He advocates abolishing the tariffs between the individual German states but erecting a tariff wall around the German nation, thus creating a strong federated Germany. List refers to this as the \\"insular supremacy of the Continental powers\\". Against Britain, List advocates a protectionist policy for North America as well. Of particular interest is List's discussion of the difference between agriculture and manufacturing powers. For instance, List contends that an agriculture nation without manufacturing will remain subsidiary to a nation which has manufacturing. Thus, the need for creating a nation which can sustain both manufacturing and agriculture. Rather than the individualistic standpoint of economists such as Adam Smith, List argues for political economy to be seen from the standpoint of the nation. The book contains many further insights into the value of protectionism as a trade policy to create a strong national economy. In a world being continually driven in the direction of mass globalization and technocracy, this book by List offers an alternative policy to maintain national sovereignity. While the classic works of free trade economics are highly important, especially the ideas of their originator Adam Smith, List offers cogent critique based on his nationalistic point of view. In sum, this book provides a much needed remedy to the dangers of globalization and the New World Order. Unfortunately, the advice of nationalist thinkers is not being heeded in today's political climate."},{"Title":"National system of political economy","review":"Why is protection good for the economy and particularly good for the economy of today's poor countries?Today's poor economies in Africa etc. are where the Continental economies were in the first half of the 19'th century.

Sure wish I'd had this book for my daughter three years ago...."},{"Title":"Red Flags: How to Know When You're Dating a Loser","review":"This book is somewhat amusing both in that it points out certain truths about the world yet is crudely simplistic and over-exaggerated in its cartoon-like categorizations of men into personality types. It is more observational comedy than it is serious psychological advice. There are some strange leaps of logic or arguments that the authors don't seem to have quite thought completely through.For example, they warn about \\"Loners\\" as a type of \\"loser\\", even though loners are essentially harmless to society, their worst sin being that they seem awkward in social gatherings. It never seems to occur to the authors that a woman who tends to be a loner herself (of which there are plenty in this world) might find her ideal mate in such a man. The authors may be more \\"prescriptive\\" than \\"descriptive\\" in their advice, assuming the role not of impartial observers, but rather as condescending, self-appointed intellectual patriarchs who view women as little girls - delicate, vulnerable, helpless victims that need their protection from all those other nasty men out there, lest they \\"fall down and get hurt\\". They more or less list the types of men that bug them for various reasons and tell women to steer clear of them at the first hint of trouble.The authors' own promotional blurbs on the back cover essentially sum up their own somewhat confused and shallow grasp of what they're trying to say: I quote \\"You'll learn how to quickly spot a guy who's bad news before you run screaming for a gallon of vanilla fudge swirl...\\" Essentially, every negative trait a man could possess is magnified into a portrait of a dangerous psychopath, while the negative traits of women (in this case, the demeaning, sexist stereotype that all women impulsively overeat as a way to deal with emotions) is laughed off as just another one of those \\"girl things\\" (despite the real and serious danger to a woman with such a habit). A loser, as bad as he is, is probably no worse in his ability to honestly face the world than is a woman who feels justified in drowning her sorrows in sweets.All in all, the book is an easy read. It's the kind of book that two guys with Ph.D's can churn out cheaply and easily (a \\"quickie\\" as they are called in publishing trade circles). Read it with one suspicious eye cast upon the guy you're going to date next, BUT another equally suspicious eye cast upon the psychologist with slick, anecdotal rhetorical skills trying to sell you advice on how to live your life.More than anything, the book is a testament to the sad, narcissistic state of our society where \\"personality\\" has replaced \\"character\\" in establishing the integrity of other people.About the only thing this book will do for most women is make them even more paranoid than they already are about men in general. If a woman is frustrated with all of the losers out there, following the authors' advice and reasoning is probably only going to make everything worse for her. Of course, the authors are quick to make the predictable, perfunctory statements to the effect that there are a lot of decent men out there (though, who or where these guys are is anyone's guess.) But a woman isn't any more likely to find one once she buys the basic premise the authors are throwing at her. It certainly won't give a woman any strategic or competitive advantage in finding a compatible mate if she is constantly preoccupied with the negativism of secretly running every one she meets through the arbitrary loser-test-ringer that she got from a cheap psychobabble book."},{"Title":"Red Flags: How to Know When You're Dating a Loser","review":"Just another contribution to the destructive, man bashing, \\"lets feminize men into blubbering losers from Mars\\" bandwagon.I'd like to meet a single man or woman in the world, who doesn't have at least one characteristic described in this book as being a complete loser quality.

HINT: You can only truly love someone else, if you love yourself first. You can't give to someone else what you don't have for yourself. And loving yourself requires that you know yourself well, including your own faults and weaknesses. Only then can you begin to love others, and tolerate their own shortcomings.But I'd bet most people who indulge in a book like this are too cowardly to take a good look at themselves, because they wouldn't like what they'd see. So they just judge other people so they can feel good about themselves. Now that's a loser.One last thought, if you date losers, have you considered that you might be a loser yourself?"},{"Title":"Red Flags: How to Know When You're Dating a Loser","review":"Apparently, any sort of fellow will fit into one of a variety of categories that the authors flag as losers. According to the book, I'm contradictory categories for being assertive and confident in some cases, but I'm a co-dependent leech for being attentive and caring. It also makes assumptions about different men's pasts which will automagically make them a &quot;loser&quot; without hope for recourse or repair. I put this book in the same category as DeAngelis books which match certain personality types and state that a relationship will or will not work according to some hard formula...which is rarely, if ever, the case. The saving grace is that yes, certain types of men/relationships ought to be avoided or removed from your life, such as with abuse. But I'll save my next reading for when I want to feel bad for remembering that my girlfriend likes coffee ice cream."},{"Title":"Red Flags: How to Know When You're Dating a Loser","review":"This book is just too simplistic in its recipes for detecting the wrong man. Basically, it assumes that all women want to marry the same type of \\"ideal\\" man. Is this really the case? not very likely. Its pretty sad if you need a book like this to tell you who to date. Plenty of people who live with their heads in the clouds are going to go through life single, giving them plenty of time to read this."},{"Title":"Red Flags: How to Know When You're Dating a Loser","review":"If you want to live in denial about your fear of intimacy, this is the book for you! This book eliminates 99% of all men as being even the least bit worthy of taking a chance on. Another good alternate title might be &quot;So You'rr Codependent: How To Make Sure You Never Recover&quot;.

Yes, some of whats in this book is true...but to be so generalized?If you are not completely PC, and want a MAN that you can be truly happy with, you may have to accept many &quot;RED FLAGS&quot;, as anything w/ testosterone in it will have these &quot;RED FLAGS&quot;."},{"Title":"Red Flags: How to Know When You're Dating a Loser","review":"A great book for loser women to make fun of their own misery. It is simply ridiculous and its stereotypes of all kind of possible men, always negative, just show the little vision of reality that these writers and some readers have."},{"Title":"Red Flags: How to Know When You're Dating a Loser","review":"As a single woman, I devour books like these. This one disappointed me. At its heart is the notion that there are easily-codified, distinct 'types' of bad-news men, and that with the proper preparation, a woman can recognize them in order to steer clear! It all makes sense, but it's awfully simplistic, and therefore not terribly enlightening in the long run.If a companion volume were written for men about &quot;loser&quot; women, I believe that we women (who, let's face it, are the primary readers of most of these books, whether they are directed at males or females) would be enraged - and rightfully so. The authors take discrete negative traits and enlarge and universalize them so that they become the defining aspects of personality. Much is ignored in this process.I do not think that this book is more than a fun read. I think that often, people we love may have a number of annoying traits, but many others which can balance the negatives quite well. And it's in that balancing that couples often find their good relationship.I gave this book only 3 atars, because it's just too simplistic."},{"Title":"Red Flags: How to Know When You're Dating a Loser","review":"I enjoyed this book immensely - in fact, I bought a 2nd copy for my (college freshman) sister! I told her there are some generalities, but if taken within the context of a pattern this book is a unique way of informing ourselves about the men we date. Additionally, it prompts us to look at our new guy intellectually, as well as emotionally, and make a decision with our heads, not solely our hearts.I do agree there are too many &quot;man-bashing&quot; books out there - I'd LOVE to see this book written for men and the women they should look out for.I found, looking back at a 10-year relationship I left with much difficulty,that there WERE signs of future conflicts. I'd ignored those things because I didn't have much dating experience (so he lives with his parents, they're a close family . . ), and no one to guide me through the dating jungle!Read with a dash of common sense - every man's circumstances are different and that has to be taken into consideration - this book is very helpful. Thanks for a great book."},{"Title":"Red Flags: How to Know When You're Dating a Loser","review":"Sure, you need to take some of this advice with a grain of salt, but the reason that men have gotten away with a lot of the stuff they've pulled is because women put up with it. It's eye-opening to read this book and see so many people you've known described down to the smallest detail. Women deserve to be treated well. This book helps identify the men who aren't going to do that."},{"Title":"Red Flags: How to Know When You're Dating a Loser","review":"This book catagorizes people into types that are losers. Yellow flag losers may be worth the effort, while RED flag losers need to be weeded out. The book even tells you how to get rid of a loser.The book is FUNNY, but also informative. Although you know the guy is a loser, sometimes it is difficult to put your finger on what is wrong. This book helps. The book helped me see some similarities in the losers I have met. It also helps to educate you on how to get out of the relationship. Some losers are easy to leave, but there are others that you just can't run from either because they keep returning, or because they become violent.There is one loser that the book does not mention. That is the one of the selfish or stingy person.I really enjoyed this book."},{"Title":"Red Flags: How to Know When You're Dating a Loser","review":"After reading Dr. Aumiller's first book, &quot;Keeping It Simple,&quot; I couldn't help purchasing his newest book &quot;Red Flags!: How to Know When You're Dating A Loser.&quot; At first I was hesitant in picking up this book, because I heard how it catergorizes men into different loser categories. (I am happily married and was afraid that my husband may be in one of those categories). So I decided to purchase this text and read for myself how my husband would be catergorized. Interestingly enough I found that he was none of the above. But I was, however, intrigued by the different types of men that were listed. When I think back on days that I was dating, I think God these guys were really Losers and pretty much wasting my time with B.S. Fortunately for me the RIGHT man did come around, before this book was written. I was so inspirationally overwhelmed by this book, not only did I buy one, but I bought four more books as Christmas presents for my single girlfriends who are having trouble finding mr. right in this world. Now this book doesn't actually tell you what you need, because everyone needs something different. But it does help you sort out losers and children from real men. Maybe your the type of woman who likes to play games, but if your like me you're only getting older and it is going to be harder and harder to find mr. right. If you are truly serious about relationships and getting a control of your love life, I highly recommend this book. I would also recommend this book to fathers who have daughters interested in dating. I know after i read it my husband wanted to see not only what category he was in but what to look out for when our little princess gets older. Kudos to Dr. Aumiller again and please keep 'em coming."},{"Title":"Red Flags: How to Know When You're Dating a Loser","review":"Hats off to the author for writing this fantastic guide in which he profiles 25 different types of dud boyfriend. They're all here - Mr Ego, The Deadbeat, The Closet Case etc etc to help you guard against dating Mr Wrong. I gave it to my daughter Stephanie for her 14th birthday, having got busy with the highlighter pen and added a handwritten appendix of my own with a few pearls of paternal wisdom."},{"Title":"Red Flags: How to Know When You're Dating a Loser","review":"Some reviewers of this book think that it is a man-bashing extravaganza. I don't think that's true. The authors are clear that there are lots of great guys out there (most women realize that as well). But, there are lots of not-so-nice guys (and women too!)out there that can cause alot of emotional damage.Any women who dates should be aware of these loser types."},{"Title":"Red Flags: How to Know When You're Dating a Loser","review":"After reading several books on relationships and dating, this is the first book to actually broach the subject of &quot;Losers&quot; in such a candid and witty manner. Every intelligent woman who is single or divorced should seriously consider this reading this fabulous book and pass it on to loved ones or good friends who are also dating. Keep in mind that this book is a tool to be supplemented by other qualified books for relationships and self-improvement, and it should not to be regarded as a dating &quot;bible.&quot; The book covers simple techniques (or Red Flags) for detecting possible &quot;Losers&quot; before a woman considers a serious or even casual relationship with any man. Additionally, should a &quot;Loser&quot; somehow infiltrate a woman's life, there are very helpful tips on gracefully ejecting him from her life without creating a social or emotional disaster. It is admirable that the book has been authored by male (Ph.D.'s) who specialize in the methods used by police to profile criminals, and the authors have no qualms about pointing out the serious personality flaws of dysfunctional men lurking in the dating market. Although I had the abysmal experience of living with and subsequently ejecting a complete \\"Loser\\" from my life this year (prior to discovering this book), I am grateful that the authors published it during my prime dating years and I can finally avoid any further relationship traps thanks to Red Flags!"},{"Title":"Red Flags: How to Know When You're Dating a Loser","review":"Oh my! I got to the chapter on &quot;The Show Off&quot; and almost fell over. This is the man I have been dating down to a hundred little details such as being into scuba diving and driving a jaguar. I wonder if he has a little jaguar pin since he has all the other jewelry items mentions in the chapter. How weird. He'd be horrified that he is in a book as one of 25 loser types since he is a man lives who lives to be impressive. I recognize a lot of themen in this book and have wasted my time with many of them. The one I mentioned was pretty eerie though. I still can't believe it wasn't him personally that they were talking about. I saw all the red flags but I ignored them. I'll never do it again. Listen and observe your dates ladies. A man will tell you exactly who he is and how he will treat you in the first few dates if you just pay attention. It will save you a lot of pain and frustration. This book is a good primer for warning signs to watch for. It also helped me understand the relationship I just ended and eased the guilt and pain. I can understand why some of the men are offended by this book but the truth hurts sometimes. These types do exist and they also do damage."},{"Title":"Red Flags: How to Know When You're Dating a Loser","review":"Red Flags assesses various loser dude types quickly and concisely, and that works for me. My loser dude scored 60 on the Mr. Neglecter test, and close to that on Mr. Ego. This guy is so \\"red\\" he's a stop light. For me, it's a tremendous help to know that his behavior isn't about me, so I won't blame myself. When I read the story that precedes the test, I substituted my name and his for the main characters and the similarities were eerie. I love it when that happens!Another thing I like about this book is that the final chapter gives examples of events and phases of our lives that can make us vulnerable to red flag types. This information is helpful for all women, even those who can spot a loser a mile away.I'm giving this book 4 stars instead of 5 because I didn't find any information that addresses the root causes of choosing red flag types. Most of us who've been through any model of personal growth know that we're attracted to certain \\"types\\" and the reasons often trace back to our family of origin. Red Flags doesn't address this and doesn't offer any reference material on the topic. Also, the book does not have an index or a bibliography.That said, I think this is a solid purchase for any woman who's out there dating, especially as our options dwindle for various reasons. Once again, the authors make it clear that finding Mr. Right is a numbers game, so it's good to know what types we shouldn't waste precious time on.I found this book at the public library, but it's definitely worth the purchase price."},{"Title":"Red Flags: How to Know When You're Dating a Loser","review":"This is a great book.

They both agreed they had made mistakes dating such men but nowbelieve they know better.This is a good read for women entering the dating pool who haven't been therefor some time or even for those knew to the arena.

The book plainly states that all men are losers at some point in their lives. Whether you're a jerk, a nice guy, or someone in between, the authors have you pigeonholed in a loser category of their choice. It is filled with tales of woe in which worthy, longsuffering women date the unskilled, the insecure, the insensitive, and most of all, the undeserving. Aumiller and Goldfarb have done their market research well. They know that relationship books from a male-friendly perspective are not well received in the publishing industry, so they sell out their brothers and write the latest piece de resistance in male-bashing. After all, what &quot;respectable&quot; publisher would accept &quot;Red Alert: Is Your Girlfriend A Feminazi?&quot;? There's a real double standard out there. I suppose this book was meant to make men feel ashamed of themselves. It worked. I'm ashamed to be of the same gender as Gary Aumiller and Daniel Goldfarb. Hate speech directed at your own kind is still disgusting. I recommend this book for any woman who needs to feel a sense of entitlement and moral superiority at any cost. For women who genuinely want to pursue healthy relationships with men in good faith, run, run far away from this book."},{"Title":"Red Flags: How to Know When You're Dating a Loser","review":"There are so many books available on Amazon & the public Library that are guides for Women avoiding \\"bad\\" Men, but how many are out there that do the opposite??? I'd like to know...This is one of the better ones, especially with its point-checklists at the end of each description, but it is easy to get the feeling that this unilateral masterpiece is just following the river rapids of similar \\"Ladies avoid Mr. Wrong\\" books out there. I'd like to see a companion volume set up as this one was (Description, sample conversation, whys & wherefores, point-count checklist, and score interpretation). Maybe the title \\"Pink Flags\\"? (Is she a gold-digger? Is she a Nomad? Is she a Daddy's Girl? etc.)One other criticism--many of the traits listed are superficial, not globally oriented (example--Does he look downward while conversing, or do his eyes dart around? Well, is this in reference to GENERAL behavior, or does it only apply to your (current) date, or behavior toward you specifically?) This especially would apply to behavior signifying any of the more violent or extreme categories. Then it tends to generalize."},{"Title":"Red Flags: How to Know When You're Dating a Loser","review":"This book was excellent. I value intuition a lot and this book helps me back it up with concrete information. Gavin De Becker says, \\"Intuition is ... knowing without knowing why.\\" This works great for fight or flight situations because I don't have time to think. Unfortunately, I find I try to rationalize this feeling away in dating situations. Red Flags helps me identify \`loser' characteristics expressed through my dates dialogue, body language, past history, etc. It ties together my past \\"loser\\" experiences. And through a consistent formula of displaying their \\"25 Loser Types\\" I was able to learn from their examples about the types I haven't (now never will) get involved with. I found it well written with a \\"tell it like it is\\" style and brutal wit. These authors grab your attention and keep it. This book is my new best friend. It won't tell me what I want to hear, or egg me on to go out with a guy so it can live vicariously through me. It will deliver the facts."},{"Title":"Red Flags: How to Know When You're Dating a Loser","review":"To the other reviewers here: I can't believe you actually needed the book to outline specifically that you're not SUPPOSED to follow all the guidelines... did you seriously not understand that all on your own? You're supposed to take what you can and cannot deal with and go with that. For example, I can deal with people being late all the time, because I am too.Regardless, I found it rather useful.

I've been single again for a few weeks, having just broken up with &quot;The Burdened Beast&quot;. It was difficult to make a clean break, but now I'm glad I did it, as it was exhausting and ultimately harmful to my own emotional health.

I figured I should get it for my daughter, just in case he can analize her dates as well as he did the sick guy in Ft. Worth. Well, what a shock!! I haven't given it to my daughter yet, because my wife and I are enjoying it so much. It is brilliant and hillarious just like the guy we heard on the radio and saw on tv. The content is straight forward, great explanations, stories, break-up advice, etc., but the humor is extraordinary and the writing in general has such rhythm and flow. It could be bought just for the joy of reading. This is great writing. Never thought I'd write a review, much less give a dating book five stars. HEAR ME FATHERS, buy this book for your daughters. It's worth 1000 times the cover price!"},{"Title":"Red Flags: How to Know When You're Dating a Loser","review":"My best friend had recently ended a long-term relationship and had picked up this book for a laugh, more than anything else. After I ended a relationship with a man I thought I would marry, she loaned it to me with the words, \\"this book is a fun read, but you may find it a little creepy in its accuracy - I know I did.\\" Boy, was she right!I had agonized for months over the relationship and had even been to therapy trying to understand why I felt the way I did. My therapist was very forthright and informative, but I chose to ignore his advice (my mistake). I read self-help books (some good, some just OK) in an attempt to understand both myself and the relationship better. I finally realized that, for whatever reason, the relationship was not a healthy one for me and I ended it. A few weeks later, I read this book.I initially found the descriptions in the book somewhat amusing. None of them really seemed to apply to my most recent relationship, so I was entertained by the brief overviews and the real-life scenarios. When I reached the middle of the book (the chapter titled \\"The Leech\\") I was suddenly stunned. The scenario and the description of how these people can make you feel were 100% right-on. The quiz showed that my ex scored well into the 'red flag' zone for this particular trait, and I was amazed to see that the brief description of the most effective way to end a relationship with someone of this trait was exactly what I had used only weeks before. After all of my introspection, I had decided that the only way he could accept a breakup was if I accepted all of the blame and reinforced to him that I was the one unable to hold up my end of the relationship (whether or not it was actually true). It worked better than I expected, which surprised me at the time, and here I was a few weeks later reading a book that told me, in half a page, to do that very thing.Because the other traits did not pertain to my exact situation, I do not know whether the others are as accurate. I would say it is probably safe to think they are more accurate than not. I plan to buy this book so i have it as a handy reference for those times when I can't identify the source, but something just isn't quite what it should be.Yes, the book simplifies things - it carves it out into easy-to-understand pieces, which is part of its appeal. It is entertaining - at least when the traits don't pertain to you and your significant other. It is also dead-on accurate. Some reviewers have claimed that the book tries to get women to seek out the same type of \\"ideal\\" man. This is not accurate - it encourages women to avoid truly unhealthy men...those who are not good relationship material, at least not at this particular time in their lives.As for some reviewers' concerns about the book not addressing the underlying pathology of why the men behave this way, or why the women are attracted to these men, that would really be best for a psychologist to assist with in real-life instead of via a self-help book (the reasons can be many and vary from person to person).Overall, it is a handy reference for the early stages in a relationship when there seems to be something you just can't quite put your finger on that keeps the relationship from feeling \\"right\\". I will recommend it to all of my single girlfriends (and I may even consider suggesting it to some of the married ones)."},{"Title":"Red Flags: How to Know When You're Dating a Loser","review":"Tells you everything that if you listen to your gut you already know.

Also in each chapter is a typical conversation between some questing woman and the man she meets who goes on to display all the characteristics found in the checklist. What annoys me is the cloying, cutesey tone of these conversations with most lame, trite stabs at &quot;wit&quot; I have ever painfully read. A rising sense of panic began to overcome me as realization dawned that the world is so jam-packed with Loser Men that there is virtually no hope for a normal woman to hook a normal man. Luckily, I believe there is a lid for every pot and women will continue to choose men in their lives that they need for psychological reasons of their own, and they will put up with their choices. For those women who are undecided about the men they date, this book will at least clearly point out the bad habits of various guys so they will at least be warned before getting in too deep. Say what you like about Dr. Laura Schlessinger, but I truly feel her two books, The Ten Stupid Things Women Do to Mess Up Their Lives and The Ten Stupid Things Men Do to Mess Up Their Lives, are more useful to both sexes."},{"Title":"Red Flags: How to Know When You're Dating a Loser","review":"A dating book I gave my daughter as sort of a joke and started reading myself.

But some really good manga series are__________ Ultra Maniac by Wataru Yoshizumi (5) and _________Beauty Pop by Kiyoko Arai (7+) :)"},{"Title":"Nana, Volume 1 (v. 1)","review":"Now, if you've ever read the masterpiece Paradise Kiss, also by Ai Yazawa, this manga doesn't even hold a candle to it. From beginning to end, Paradise Kiss was beautiful, artistic, and tightly knitted plotwise and characterwise all the way from beginning to end.Nana is long. The premise is odd and hardly interesting. Two girls with the same first name end up living together. That's it. It's all right. A lot of stuff happens, sort of, like the one girl gets a job and the other one doesn't. But that's it. They really don't have any real problems right now. Nothing bad really happens for about three volumes.I thought, if nothing else, maybe I'll be able to relate to the fact that they're two kids just moved out on their own to tokyo. Having recently moved out from home and being the same age myself, I was eager for them to experience some of the real-life sufferings I had to. Not being able to pay bills. not making enough at crappy minimum wage jobs. Not always being able to eat. But none of this happens. Things just, always go right, and it appears for the sake of leaving time to focus on drama rather than worries with rent.There is one second, one brief second when the perky Nana realizes she won't have enough money and loses her only job. However, this is solved within a single page when mommy sends her A LOT of money. Just sends it right when she needed it. The end of all her problems. She immediately gets a better job afterward without a single problem, like the same day. not sure how everything's so perfect in this world but it is.Anyway, I give it four-stars because it's Ai Yazawa and it has potential. Once in awhile, something does happen, and my heart does ache for the cool Nana and her long lost love. They're just, a bunch of all right people doing a bunch of mediocre things. I get the feeling it might get better though, so I'm looking forward to it. Perhaps she might even introduce a bit of plot? Maybe? When she gets a chance. No rush."},{"Title":"Nana, Volume 1 (v. 1)","review":"I didn't actually read this in English, so I'm not sure how it is in that language. The collected Japanese edition is interesting, but for me (a middle-aged male) the most interesting aspects were language use (moot in a translated version) and asking various younger people I know why they liked the manga. This is very light reading, and Yuzawa does a nice job with characterization. Note that one need be familiar with visual shorthand depections of emotions to fully comprehend some of the action."},{"Title":"Nana, Volume 1 (v. 1)","review":"I simply adore this manga.Huge in Japan, NANA recently made the swim across the Pacific to US markets, and horray for that! 20-something Nana Komatsu is your average charming 'hopeless good girl,' an aimless graduate trying to find direction, survive self-doubt, and a string of never-ending boyfriends. Nana Osaki is nearly the opposite: a cool, confident, focused lead singer of her own punk band and dealing with internal longing for success and the only man she loves. This first volume fills in the details of their lives and how it is that they later came to be on the same train to Tokyo, where despite their obvious differences, they soon become roommates and the best of friends in one of the most charming and endearing storylines ever.This is not necessarily what American audiences think of when they think of manga (Japanese comics). It's not rockets or robots shooting up the old west, or cowboys in deep space. Instead NANA is a more down-to-earth read about growing up, aspirations, relationships and a more intimate side of two contemporary heroines. The title falls under the term 'shojo' and it's like 'chick-lit' manga - except for a slightly mature audience. This particular series is not for young kids as it has an amount of sex and adult socializing, but NANA is a really good read!!Forget feeling silly, or feeling like you're 'too grown up' to read comic books! Artist Ai Yazawa has created a story and artwork that is both delicate and nicely stylized. It's a pleasure to read, doesn't force unrealistic circumstances down your throat, but rather engages and endears. Most of all, it's just as enjoyable the second time around... and there aren't many 'chick-lit' or even manga books that can claim that. I understand that in Japan, NANA is such a sensation that fans have named cafes and clubs after it, demanded and purchased a NANA video game, and there has been a live-action movie (I'd definitely see that). I've read the first novel and kept up on the serialized version in various magazines. I'm already convinced I'm going to be a fan for all volumes... Read with confidence, NANA is an enjoyable guilty pleasure - like getting the uber-large super mocha latte..."},{"Title":"Nana, Volume 1 (v. 1)","review":"Nana Komatsu has had a string of bad luck when it comes to men. One right after another she falls into desperate love with them and ends up heartbroken and alone. So when her most recent relationship with Takashi Asano (age 29) ends in his moving to Tokyo she doesn't know what to do. Having applied at an art college with her friend Jun she bobs her hair and sets out for a new life and a new attitude. Of course the first thing that happens when she enters class is she falls in love with Shoji Endo, an amenable fellow who knows Jun from Junior High. He introduces the two too Kyosuke Takakura, his friend, and everything seems to be going ok. Jun points out Nana's attraction and accounts it to be the reason why Nana has no male friends, which Nana resolves to change. From then on she refuses to see men as object and vows to befriend them. This puts a cramp in Shoji's plans, who actually is attracted to Nana. Things become even more complicated when Jun surrenders to her mutual attraction to Kyosuke. Nana thinks this is betrayal, but actually does feel as if she is growing from her male friendships.When the group decides to apply to art colleges in Tokyo Nana is the only one who is rejected. She goes on a scouting trip anyways where she has a fight with Shoji and then ends up running into Takashi and making amends all around. Things with Shoji end up so intense that they manage to maintain a long distance relationship while she works and is determined to reapply to the Tokyo schools the following year.Enter an entirely different Nana. Nana Osaki lives with her boyfriend and band mate Ren Honjo. Fronting a punk band has her feeling good about her past, a childhood where she grew up apart from her parents, alone and unwanted. Suddenly Ren is afforded this great opportunity to make it in the music industry by joining another band as their bassist, and he decides to take it. Nana decides to wait until she is better prepared to follow, but in the end she packs her bags and heads off to Tokyo.The series is interesting, especially with the two points of view on life. I imagine the two Nanas will meet up together, but from there I don't know quite what to expect. Will they be friends? Enemies? Lovers? Who knows. It is obvious that these two will meet up in Tokyo, but how it will go from there is unknown. I admire some of the art.... I do stress some though. There are parts that are beautifully drawn, and then there are some parts that are just not well done...and the super tall and skinny frames of the main characters are a touch exaggerated at times for my taste. Overall though, a decent read. I will probably check more of this series out in the future. For now though we must all be content with the two that are available, thus far."},{"Title":"Nana, Volume 1 (v. 1)","review":"Nana is a story of two girls who meet on a train to Tokyo and become fast friends. The first volume in this 21+ volume series (currently on hiatus) introduces us to the girls (both are named Nana, which means seven in Japanese) to their friends, and the loves of their lives.Nana is by the same manga-ka who did Paradise Kiss, and it is a manga more concerned with day to day lives of the characters and their interactions. The art style is very unique and very beautiful. Yazawa carefully constructs three dimensional characters that one comes to care about.Nana Komatsu is a boy-crazy artist wannabe who follows her boyfriend to Tokyo. She is a bit airheaded, but not stupid. She is aware that her sometimes foolish ways can get her into trouble and she's quite superstitious, citing that the Demon King is out to punish her for her deeds.Nana Osaki is a singer in a rock group. She goes to Tokyo to pursue a singing career. She is more levelheaded and serious.When these two girls meet, they hit it off immediately and by coincidence become roommates. The story chronicles their friendships, hardships and so forth.This type of manga is usually classified as Shojo, because it generally appeals to females. The rating will probably be older teen because this series deals frankly with issues like sex, though it is never gratuitous.Nana will probably appeal to those who like Paradise Kiss or any of Ai Yazawa's other work.Here's hoping that Nana being translated means that Yazawa's other work like Gokinjo make it over here as well."},{"Title":"Nana, Volume 1 (v. 1)","review":"Nana has been one of my favorite manga series for years, and I was thrilled when it got licensed for English readers. While the story and art still stands up on its own, I found their choice of slang phrases in the translation really distracting. In many cases, it sounded like an old person trying to sound \\"hip\\" and in others, it made the characters sound younger then they actually were... They're supposed to be college age, how many 20 year olds actually talk like that?Other than the very sad way the translaters tried to make it sound cool, this still is a great read. With fascinatingly flawed characters, a complex storyline, and beautiful art, this series is still in my top ten favorites."},{"Title":"Nana, Volume 1 (v. 1)","review":"This is my all-time favorite manga. I've been reading it since 2006. It starts off with the background of both Nana's (one who is later nicknamed Hachi). After that they by chance meet on a train to Tokyo where they both are hoping to achieve their dreams.This story deals with so much, it has drama, music, romance. The characters are likable but they also have flaws that will make you go, \\"WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS?!\\"The art is great. Ai Yazawa studied to be a fashion designer so even the clothes are always unique and well drawn.I love this manga but the only sad, sad news is that it's currently been on hiatus for almost 3 years. And so far no sign that it's continuing. So for that reason read with caution because I know how hard it is to start something and then not be able to finish."},{"Title":"Nana, Volume 1 (v. 1)","review":"I saw the anime for this before I started to read the manga and I have to say that it is an amazing story so far. So in the fact that I wanted to know what happens next (or in between the story and \\"ending\\" they used in the anime) and started reading the manga.The story so far is exactly as the anime shows but the only thing I did not like about the english translated Manga is the fact that they use the most annoying slang when the characters are talking or thinking. The subtitled version of the anime that I watched (on-line) was wonderful, and the slang used in the manga was not in that. I think that the manga would be a lot better if they would just translate it without the annoying slang. Like having the characters constantly saying \\"man\\" or \\"dude\\" or such things at the end of every sentence, it's just annoying and clearly these characters do not talk that way.But the above is the ONLY negative thing I have to say about it. It is a great story and I highly recommend both the manga (despite the annoying slang) and the anime series. I have yet to see the live action films."},{"Title":"Nana, Volume 1 (v. 1)","review":"If you like a love story with a Comic twist this is the book series for you."},{"Title":"Nana, Volume 1 (v. 1)","review":"NANA like new Sid And Nancy is cool highest.

They stopped having it in the magazine on the 7th or 8th edition, so I had to go and buy it. Now I have all of them.Nana is about 2 girls who's name is Nana. It's how they meet and become friends. One Nana is a punk girl who sings in a band, The Black Sones. And the other Nana is just a girl with bad luck in love.I highly recommend this series!"},{"Title":"Tales of the jazz age","review":"I love F.Scott Fitzgerald. After reading through some of his later works I thought there was no shame in reading some of his earlier writing. Sadly, his attempts do show it's novice. Almost all of the stories follow the same plot line, the main exception being the curious case of Benjamin Button. Mainly the stories all consist of a man, who barely walks the extra mile for a girl and he either gets her or he doesn't it. That is, in essence, the whole book. This wouldn't be so bad if the characters were more three dimensional or if there was some effort put in for the reader to care about them. The women in every story plays a seemingly stupid but pretty woman who is to be wed and There's the main character who is a hopeless man who hatches an idea to win her.They are nice and fun stories, but really not worth the time if you want to experience Fitzgerald's finest. Even the best artists had to start out somewhere, this was Fitzgeralds."},{"Title":"Tales of the jazz age","review":"To be honest I don't think I would have paid to read Fitzgerald. It's no slam against the author, but it's something I would have read sometime in the future after I've exhausted other authors.The Kindle version itself is pretty good, although it lacks a table of contents. Since there's only 11 short stories in the collection, I didn't miss it too much. The book itself is divided into three major sections: My Last Flappers, Fantasies and Unclassified Masterpieces. The real surprise was the short story of The Curious Case of Benjamin Button, which as a story worked infinitely better than the movie did.I feel unqualified to judge the collections of the stories, but I'm glad I bit and took a chance at reading Tales of the Jazz Age. I like Fitzgerald's style of writing and will read more of his work soon."},{"Title":"Tales of the jazz age","review":"Although the stories are complete, they are filled with errors.

The Camel's Hump - After being told \`no' to his marriage proposal... ultimatum, Perry gets pretty liquored up. Using a cab driver as an assistant the two go to a circus party as, in tandem, a camel. The literary depiction of these two trying to walk is excellent: \`The camel had a halting gait - and as he walked he alternatively elongated and contracted like a gigantic concertina.' (468).Seeing his love interest at the party Perry soon finds himself in a mock wedding. Accidently handing over his earlier intended marriage license, followed by a ruse from the camel's hump - he's married and the rest is history.3. May Day - Gordon's in a pinch, needs some m money to pay off an old flame that's hounding him and is capable of causing him trouble. Dean, well-to-do, the person from whom Gordon seeks financial assistance. Drinking having taken its toll on Gordon he soon meets Edith, a long since past love interest / opportunity, but also encounters Jewel (the aforementioned woman to whom money is owed)... here's where it really goes poorly for Gordon. The end result: Him not being able to deal with the circumstances.The story is interesting in its anti-socialism feud depictions and partly existential bent toward the absurdist nature of all things.4. Porcelain and Pink - A play which sees a young woman, nude, in a bathtub. Julie Mavis occupies the tub; her sister Lois wants the tub. What happens when Lois' beau came calling at the bathroom window and identities are suddenly confused?5. The Diamond As Big As The Ritz - John T. Unger meets Percy Washington who's father has a diamond of the title. Of course it's a huge secret. Imagine the plummet of the diamond trade, maybe even market crashes. Naturally \`guests' are infrequent and even those, John is informed by Kismine, Percy's sister, are generally not allowed to leave.The Washington father is deemed \` the richest man that ever lived. Yet was he worth anything at all?' (1722). Not a cruel man, Mr. Washington offers (and wishes for the actual potentials) his prisoners ways out, but fear of the secret escaping prevents their release. The morality displayed in John's love for Kismine when he discovers he \`isn't much better than a human corpse' and their subsequent eloping epitomizes FS Fitzgerald's \`love as savior' philosophy. The concluding prayer by the Washington's and offer of a diamond to God indicates the absurdities of this world (\`even God has a price'), as does the stealing of rhinestones instead of diamonds by Kismine. Forcing herself and John to live a life of poverty after escaping the desert.6. The Curious Case of Benjamin Button - Reviewed elsewhere.7. Tarquin of Cheapside - A man is seeking to be hidden from two seekers of justice, the crime regarding the act he'd committed upon one of the men's sisters. Hidden by a \`friend', now accomplice the fellow writes an expose concerning the reason the men were hunting him. His host is given a copy of the work; we learn only the tales appalling title.8. O Russett Witch! - Merlin Grainger works at the \`Moonlight Quill', a bookshop named for its proprietor. Here he meets \`Caroline' for the first time. She destroys the store and leaves Merlin in lust. Merlin encounters her many more times over the telling of the story that is his life in its near entirety. These encounters however, in the end, are never what Merlin had perceived them to be... if only he'd read the newspapers. My favorite story if for nothing other than the closing line: 'There was nothing left but heaven, where he would meet those who, like him, had wasted earth.'9. The Lees of Happiness - Jeffery Curtain develops an embolism which puts him in coma-state. Despite all of life's hardships and temptations his wife remains by his side for eleven years.10. Mr. Icky - Another play. Mr. Icky's children represent the kids of the jazz age. Likely representing the old era and the state of \`being out of touch with the times' his children look down upon him and his practices, ways, habits and thoughts. Upon his death one of his sons is kind enough to proffer a mothball.11. Jemina - Tantrums versus Doldrums. Two hillbilly families who one day encounter a \`civilized folk' looking to buy land. Jemina Tantrum and the prospector fall in love but perish in the battle between the families. Jemina is \`a human alcohol lamp' (from distilling whiskey) and the stranger... \`was wonderful.

There are 11 stories here, of varying quality and I enjoyed reading them all and letting myself visit the time and a place and the culture that is now just a small blip in the annals of history. Some stories are set in the world of the moneyed, others are set in the world of fantasy and there are other that are just figments of the author's imagination. I didn't like all of these stories. As the saying goes, \\"when they were good they were very very good, and when they were bad they were horrid\\", but I felt I got to know F. Scott Fitzgerald through these stories, see how his mind worked, and understand how he became so well known and was able to come to his full power in his novels.His strongest stores were set in the real world, the young southern man who was smitten by a rich young woman, two recently released soldiers from the War in Europe who stumble upon some party-going socialites, a very funny story about a costume party where two men dress in a camel costume, and a sad story about a happy marriage which is spoiled by the husband's illness.I don't like fantasy and found myself annoyed by these stories, even the one about the Curious Case of Benjamin Button which was recently made into a movie, or The Diamond as Big as the Ritz which was a fantasy of enormous wealth and cruelty. There were stories of unfulfilled dreams and real emotion which I liked. And others that were just stupid and silly and hard to follow.Yes, I enjoyed this book, even the stories I didn't like.

This story is not contained in the other two Fitzgerald short story anthologies which I own. The story is a fascinating little foray into straight-forward fantasy, as a man is \\"born\\" fully cognizant (and speaking the King's English), fully-grown (Fitzgerald never explains how Ben's poor mother survived, let alone managed, the birthing ordeal), and obviously very old. Benjamin then proceeds, Merlin-like, to live his life backwards, growing younger and younger. The story is only 32 pages long, and ends rather sadly and abruptly. However, it is so un-Fitzgerald-like that I found it intriguing, and am now anxiously awaiting the movie to see what Hollywood does with it.Fitzgerald, although an artist and genius of the highest calibar, also had to eat. These stories were written for money, and they are not as well-wrought as the best of his prose stylings in his novels. (Fitzgerald states candidly in his intros to the stories that several of them are re-worked stories which he had first done at Princeton while an undergraduate.)

The other eight stories were either just okay, or a struggle to get through because they just felt so \\"blah\\" to me.I really like Fitzgerald, but in my opinion, he is more of a novelist than a short story writer. I haven't disliked any of his novels that I've read (so far), but for some reason, his short stories don't have the same oomph. I was also expecting more of a Jazz theme, rather than a collection of stories that just happen to be set in the 20's when Jazz was the thing.I'm sure there are many people who love his short stories, but were someone to ask me what they should read to start on Fitzgerald's cannon, I would definitely suggest his novels."},{"Title":"Painted by the Sun","review":"For historical accuracy Elizabeth Grayson leads the pack.

However, the guilt he feels colors any every attempt at changing his future.Shea Waterston is also tormented with a painful secret.Having learned the art of photography from her late husband, she is moving ever West, hoping to change the outcome of a decision she was forced to make years earlier.She is a couragous, determined woman, who knows that her skill with a camera is an important gift.The first chapter of the book brings these two characters together in a dramatic way. It is one of the best openings of any book I've read in a long time.The secondary characters, who can often make or break a story, add immeasurably to this one. Clay's sister Lily, painfully self conscious of her scarred face,is unaware that her beautiful spirit and caring nature enrichs all those around her.Damaged by the war, Owen Brandt does his best to be a helpful assistant and a faithful friend to Shea.Dr.Emmet Farley, a Southerner,is trying to overcome the horrors of being a battlefield surgeon. He will be put to the test of whether he can forgive someone he trusted and move on with his life.Rand and Tyler, two boys who share more than they know, and whose lives will be forever changed when Cameron and Shea meet.Having always excelled at making her childrens' characters realistic and appealing,Grayson has outdone herself with these two.They are as real and as irresistable as any little boys you will ever meet. The &quot;story behind the story&quot; will keep you guessing here.This book has one interesting little extra going for it. The models on the attractive cover actually look the way the characters are described, down to the dress Shea is wearing.While it may not be important to most readers, I really appreciated and enjoyed this attention to detail. It doesn't happen very often and shows the reader that care was taken with this book. Thank you to all who were responsible for this lovely cover.Katherine Grayson's beautiful writing,wonderful characters, and attention to historical accuracy have never been put to better use. Don't miss PAINTED BY THE SUN."},{"Title":"Painted by the Sun","review":"This is the story of a female photographer, in the early years of photography, traveling the west on the trail of the orphan trains. In the beginning of the story Shea locked horns with Judge Cameron Gallimore when she had set up her equipment to photograph a hanging. She wound up in jail at the behest of the judge. The author lets you &quot;see&quot; the hanging through the ears of Shea. This picture painted with words is stronger that a visual would have been. This book grabbed me from the beginning, and I could not put it down until I had finished the book. It has love, heartache, mystery, danger, compassion and laughter, what more could you ask for in a book. The secondary characters were as life like as the primary ones. This is western americana romance at the very best. If you don't buy this book as soon as you can, you will miss out on a truly rewarding reading experience. Why was she following the trail of the orphan trains? Uh uh, that is an answer that will tug at your heartstrings."},{"Title":"Painted by the Sun","review":"Elizabeth Grayson has been writing since the age of fifteen with her first published book released in 1985. With nine books (including those written under her other name, Elizabeth Kary) under her belt, I would have expected I had heard of her before now. She creates a strong heroine for whom you find yourself cheering.Painted is the story of Shea Waterston, a traveling photographer who was forced to place her toddler son on an orphan train ten years ago. She follows the path that the orphan trains took, moving from town to town in the hopes that someday she will find the child she loved. When she stumbles upon the change to photograph a hanging, she knows it could make her career, only the town judge does not think a woman should watch such brutality. Not one to take no for an answer, the judge places her in a jail cell to ensure she misses the brutal event.Judge Cameron Gaillmore is a stubborn man with no time or love for women. When Shea saves his life, he has no choice but to start trusting her. And pretty soon, he can't fight his growing attraction. But they both have secrets; will those secrets pull them together or rip them apart?A beautifully written story with excellent historical details, you feel as if you are on location watching the story unfold before your eyes. Rich details abound from the minute details of the scents surrounding the characters while out in the wilderness to the textures and colors of the clothes they wear. Cameron and Shea come across as people you know. You feel Shea's heartache from having to give her son away in order to better care for him. I found myself crying right alongside Shea desperately wanting to hold her hand and let her know she was only doing the best for her child. Cameron's stubborn attitude had me wishing I could jump into the book time and time again and help him see around his pride. While it was not an original plot line, there were plenty of refreshing twists and turns to keep the reader excited. After reading this story, I can't wait to find her older books and lose myself in them.Vtavidreader......"},{"Title":"Painted by the Sun","review":"Normally, I'm not a fan of Westerns, but something told me to give this book a try when I saw it at the bookstore. I'm glad I obeyed the instinct.Painted by the Sun is about Shea Waterston, a traveling photographer who is following the orphan trains west to look for the son she gave up a decade before. While setting up her camera to photograph a hanging, she meets Judge Cameron Gallimore, who promptly throws her--and her camera--in jail. The Judge, however, has demons of his own, and he and Shea recognize each other as kindred spirits.Elizabeth Grayson writes beautifully about 1870s Colorado and a relationship between two tortured individuals who are inherently decent people. Cam's sister, Lily, his son, Rand, and Rand's friend, Tyler, are well-portrayed. Shea, especially, is a wonderful character. Unlike most romance heroines, she is no prissy, helpless virgin. Shea is pragmatic, self-sufficient, and experienced. And don't cross her, or someone she cares about, if she has her Winchester rifle nearby!This is a wonderful book. Read it!"},{"Title":"Painted by the Sun","review":"In the 1875 Colorado Territory, Judge Cameron Gallimore hates the idea of hanging someone, but knows the importance of completing his job as he has done eleven times in the last four years. However, he draws the line with a photographer wanting to take a picture of the upcoming hanging of crazy Joe Calvert. Instead, he locks up photographer Shea Waterson until the deed is done.Unable to accept that the handsome judge incarcerated her and took away her camera, Shea wonders how she will earn money to continue her quest for the child she was forced to give up almost a decade ago. Shea follows the path of the orphan train, but has had little success. As Shea and Cameron become acquainted they begin to fall in love. However, she starts to believe that the son he adopted in 1866 is her biological child and he still carries guilt from a Civil War raid that hurt innocents, including his own sister.PAINTED BY THE SUN is an Americana drama centering on various types of relationship. The relationships seem genuine because the characters involved feel real and their motives make sense. The story line is filled with action, love, and a touch of history as Elizabeth Grayson paints a picturesque tale of the Reconstruction Era in the Rockies.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Painted by the Sun","review":"Wow -- this book works on so many levels. I couldn't put it down except to reach for more Kleenex!It's beautifully written with sharply-defined characters -- one of whom is a &quot;photographer lady&quot; and another a judge who has seen too much death. While many might not consider it a &quot;proper&quot; romance because the romance doesn't start to heat up until halfway through the book, it still is all about the love relationships between people: friends, family, potential lovers.I don't usually read westerns, but I'm sure glad I sat down with this one! Highly recommended -- a definite Keeper for your bookshelf. (Just have at least a quarter box of Kleenex on hand.)"},{"Title":"Painted by the Sun","review":"I just finished reading &quot;painted by the sun&quot; and &quot;color of the wind&quot;. They are both fabulous. The many reviews on each of them give you the storyline so the only thing I will add is that the writing talents of E. Grayson aka E. Kary are truly awesome. Her characters are so real and their experiences become yours. The children in these 2 books and their relationships and needs will grab your heart. Having already put E Kary's books on my keeper list I was thrilled to find that grayson and kary are one and the same. There is one commentator who dissedthe &quot;coincidences&quot; in &quot;Painted&quot;. Without giving the story away I must tell you that those comments are bogus. Life is filled with coincidences and the one in this story fits perfectly with grayson's planned plot.You won't be sorry you've bought these two books. enjoy. ab"},{"Title":"Painted by the Sun","review":"Elizabeth Grayson is a fabulous storyteller, and from a purely writing standpoint she has done it again with &quot;Painted by the Sun,&quot; the story of a woman photographer on a trek through 1870's Colorado in search of her lost child. The photographer, Shea Waterston, connects with a Denver judge, Cameron Galliimard, and the novel follows the rocky course of their relationship as they continually peel back the veneer of the present and wrestle with the phantoms from their pasts.The characters are well-rounded, multi-dimensional, and believable. The descriptions are fascinating, informative, and painlessly reveal what must be weeks of painstaking historical research. Some scenes--the hanging, the midnight intruder, the love scenes--are just pearls of fabulous writing.So why wasn't this a &quot;keeper&quot;? The characters were so believable, and the settings so sharp and meticulous, that a series of incredible coincidences jolted me right out of the story. I could certainly accept one coincidence, but three? four? A few of the plot threads needed less fantastic endings for the story to hold up. By the end, I was almost expecting the photographer's assistant to turn out to be Shea's long-lost brother. If you find such coincidences endearing, then you will adore this book."},{"Title":"Painted by the Sun","review":"Many romance novels set in the old West (1875 Colorado for this book) are really thin on historical accuracy. Elizabeth Grayson is a nice exception to this rule. Almost everyone in this novel is now located in the West because of something bad which happened to them during the Civil War, regardless of their side in that war. Shea is trying to recover her son who she put on an orphan train heading West rather than let him starve to death in the East. Her photography profession pays her way. Grayson is extremely realistic on how difficult and cumbersome photography was before our own &quot;point and shoot&quot; camera times. Since all of the novel's characters live in the shadows of the past, photography was a very apt medium to use in this book. (Photography, done well, manipulates light and shadow to produce haunting images.) Cam is a judge in Denver who adopted an orphan train boy. He lives in continual fear of a shameful secret from his Civil War past coming to light. The romance is, of course, between Shea and Cam but this book also has very well developed secondary characters. I felt this book was a very good read but it is not so gripping or emotion-evoking that you will think it one of the best books you've ever read. I would describe it as being a very solid &quot;B&quot;."},{"Title":"Painted by the Sun","review":"I read a lot of books in a month but I hardly ever read a book so engrossing that I just can't put it down. The book takes place in post-Civil War Colorado and the descriptions are so realistic that you'll feel like you're there. Cam and Shea both have a lot of secrets in their pasts and a lot of hurts to heal. Shea is a photographer traveling, searching for her lost son. Cam is a judge, settled in to a new life with his sister and son and trying to forget the past."},{"Title":"Divine Creatures: Animal Mummies in Ancient Egypt","review":"An excellent book by a professor of Egyptology at the American University of Cairo. It deals with all the reasons why animals were mummified in ancient Egypt, why these mummies acccmpanied their masters into their tombs, and also the hoaxes that were sometimes perpetrated on unsuspecting pilgrims who thought that they were actually purchasing mummies of animals to offer to the gods. Salima Ikram is the leading authority on the subject of animal mummies. She has written widely on the subject, lectured on it at the Smithsonian Institute in Washington DC, the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, the British Museum in London, and several other well-known institutes, and appears frequently on TV (I have seen her on the Discovery Channel, the History Channel, the National Geographic Channel, etc, etc.) She has established a room for animal mummies in the Egyptian museum in Cairo, the first of its kind in the world."},{"Title":"Divine Creatures: Animal Mummies in Ancient Egypt","review":"A fantastic book on the subject of animal mummies in ancient Egypt.

It has many illustrations of bodices, sleeves, skirts and trains throughout the process of creating the designs, and gives the basics of slicing your ordinary sloper to create bridal stylelines. In that, it is great for the patternmaker. You can see how bustles, portrait necklines, leg o'mutton sleeves and stays are updated to be used in today's bridal fashions. The section covering the boned bodice has many diagrams to help you visualize where the seams and darts are placed. There is minimal information on the construction of the bodice as well. The book also tries to touch on the construction of a head-dress (veils, tiaras, headbands) and offered rather skimpy information on the subject.As it says on the cover, &quot;Pattern Layout and Design.&quot; That is all you will find worthwhile in this book. If you are not an experienced seamstress with pattern drafting expertise, this book is not for you. &quot;Patternmaking for Fashion Design&quot; by Helen Joseph-Armstrong is an excellent book to start with, and will teach you all the basics you need to create your own styles. &quot;Couture Bridalwear&quot; is a supplement to my library.

I have never heard a complaint about this book and that is REALLY unusual with a statistics book.Walker writes short chapters centered around common statistical methods. He gives a clean paragraph or two saying why you would use a statistic. Then he writes-up a little math, with the algebra usually worked out. After that the vast majority of the chapters are completed examples with datasets, code and output.

I was expecting information about the bad deeds of many of the desperados but I was pleasantly surprised to find additionally a comprehensive treatment of the legal aspects of Parker's tenure. As Glenn Shirley effectively documents, the Judge Parker known and respected by the citizens of Arkansas and the Indian Nations is a far cry from the one created by the Eastern press and the monied interests (including Congressmen) of the East. This book will provide the reader with a very balanced approach to what Parker saw as the rights of the victim and community with the rights of the accused. And as Shirley clearly points out Parker may have gone too far sometimes but early on extreme measures were needed.The body of the book covers many of the best known cases to be covered in Parker's court but also provides appendices on each and every person that Parker sentenced to hang (including those that were commuted, pardoned, reversed and acquitted). Byron Dobbs, a second generation lawyer that practiced law in Ft Smith for 40 years, provided a lawyer's appraisal of the Parker Court a number of years ago for the \\"Ft Smith Historical Journal\\". He wrote:Parker was given the near impossible task of providing justice between the white men and the Indian. The disgrace arose out of the failure of the U.S. and Congress to appropriately prevent intrusion upon the Indian land and in permitting such carnage as to result in the great number of murder trails and then Parker was condemned in the halls of Congress for imposing the only penalty authorized by Congress. Parker's accomplishments stand as a monument to law and order achieved under the most trying circumstances.Shirley's book simply and effectively documents these accomplishments."},{"Title":"Law West of Fort Smith: A History of Frontier Justice in Indian Territory 1834-1896","review":"Written by noted Western author Glenn Shirley in 1957, this book is not up to the standards of his more recent works. Shirley depends extensively on other books, and unfortunately, his book contains a large number of errors.

Leave this one to hollywood...."},{"Title":"Law West of Fort Smith: A History of Frontier Justice in Indian Territory 1834-1896","review":"This book cobbles together accounts from policy makers and the popular press seeking to show that Indian country was a lawless place, with Judge Parker and the federal marshalls as the slim line between law and anarchy. The account utterly ignores the reality in Indian country and works mightily to justify the actions of a man for whom, apparently, the accusation was enough to make you guilty. The book does, however, compile some interesting sources not found elsewhere, including a description of each of the 79 men Judge Parker hanged, the battle between Parker and the Supreme Court which continually reversed Parker, and the statements of some of the Indian defendants on their views of federal justice. The evident desire of the author to celebrate Parker and the court rather than objectively examine his record, however, fatally taints the entire work."},{"Title":"Law West of Fort Smith: A History of Frontier Justice in Indian Territory 1834-1896","review":"This is a very easy book to read. Not at all like a history book...but it is! It thoroughly tells the tales of the infamous characters that came through Judge Parker's (the hanging judge) court. It tells of the founding of Ft.

(Actually, I had gotten started a few years earlier, in high school.) I'm old enough to remember the end of the era that Gergel writes about. We would perform 100-gram reactions even in undergraduate courses; benzene was a common solvent, sitting in the lab in gallon+ quantities; part of the training of every chemist was to learn respect for dangerous compounds -- explosive, carcinogenic, air-sensitive -- by handling them personally, often in large quantities.In contrast to today, pharmaceuticals, computation and the latest in academic research were way, way back in the mind of the typical working chemist, compared to industrial chemicals -- as a visit to an old copy of C&E; News would reveal. A typical back-cover ad might feature a babe in hot pants poised provocatively upon a 55-gallon drum of the solvent or industrial-grade starting material being advertised. At ACS meetings, similarly attired babes handed out literature and lured customers into the booths of the chemical companies at the Expo.It was the wild West, or the wild South, in Gergel's case. Production and working conditions were for the most part unregulated, and the Gergels of the world were able to start companies and succeed or starve without much interference by anyone. Gergel did both, and had an exuberant time along the way -- though his book reminds us that the lows were as low as the highs were high. We're indebted to him for this book, which for some of us is a reminder and, for those younger than we, perhaps a revelation of a time when everything was freer, wilder and less encumbered, if not better in all regards."},{"Title":"Excuse Me Sir, Would You Like to Buy a Kilo of Isopropyl Bromide?","review":"Max Gergel was a talented chemist who founded and ran the Columbia Organic Chemicals company for decades, despite never receiving a higher degree in chemistry. He was an effective and funny salesperson, and many in the industry from the 1940s through the 1970s dealt with him in one capacity or another. In the 1960s and 1970s, the ACS flew him around the country to speak to college students, recognizing that his funny, sometimes profane stories would humanize the profession and might help young chemists decide to stay in the field. Thus he touched several generations of chemists, even though he was never a professor.This book covers Gergel's childhood, education, and the first half of his career. Sex (or his inability to get any) is a recurring theme, as are the awkwardness of being a civilian in an army town in 1944, anti-semitism in the south, and the various ways chemists rip each other other. Every chapter is laced with chemical synthesis, so for example he might describe a failed date, and then his method of synthesizing n-Dodecyl bromide with no residual alcohol.Gergel's sharp memory is touching; he lists the names of students who passed through the almost countless courses he taught in the Navy flight school during WWII, then lists which of his students had died in the war (and in which battles), and which had gone on to be doctors, or vice presidents at industrial companies, or professors.His personal motto seems to be sic fret crustulum - That's How the Cookie CrumblesThese memoirs provide windows into aspects of the home front not often talked about. Mothers would call the draft board to ask why their sons had to go to war but not Gergel. It was so awkward being out of the military that he and his fellow naval flight school academic instructors devised fake uniforms for themselves, even buying WWI medals from thrift stores declaring they had fought in the Battle of Jutland (there may be some exaggeration here). He learned to fly and described wounds from lab accidents as coming from flight accidents to impress his students.Later, he talks about hiring a local bootlegger as a lab assistant, whose vast experience with novel techniques of distillation allowed Columbia Organic to hit deadlines that would otherwise have been impossible.The stories are funny and interesting, but I am not sure there is any deeper value here for young chemists or business people. Gergel's success seems most due to having launched a chemical company in 1944, able to meet the military's demands during the war, and the demands of a booming economy in the 1950s and thereafter. The lack of environmental regulations helped; he cheerfully describes the convenience of his first office's location next to a stream in which he could dump his waste chemicals. How much of this would be relevant in today's economy?"},{"Title":"Excuse Me Sir, Would You Like to Buy a Kilo of Isopropyl Bromide?","review":"This book is in many ways reminiscent of the memoirs of Richard Feynman, in that they are often humorous memoirs of a Jewish American scientist who comes of age during the second world war and becomes involved in the Manhattan project, and much of the humor revolves around science, sex and romance. Max Gergel was a couple of years younger than Feynman, from a poorer southern family and his trajectory followed a very different path.Max attended one State University earning his bachelors. Almost from the beginning Max was focused on starting his own chemical company. He started one for the university while still a student, then started a new one with his step-father and uncle while filling in for drafted professors and also teaching future pilots. This company eventually became a supplier to the scientists of the Manhattan project. While he was sometimes mistaken for a professor, the war and the need to pay his way prevented him from earning an advanced degree.The book is divided in two parts: the first covers the \\"academic\\" period of his life from early high school in the mid 1930s through to the end of the war when his association with the university came to an end. The second deals with his experience with his business. I get the impression that the stories were written down as one significant event prompted memories of other events however distantly related, and the author or his editor then started to put them in largely chronological order, but ran out of patience or time about half way through the discussion of his business years.Among other things one will discover: that it is not a good idea to wrap potassium in a handkerchief and put it in a pocket, that antisemetism was a problem during much of the war, that mercaptans will evacuate large academic buildings, that there are a number of compounds whose production should have poisoned Max but didn't, however one almost killed him and largely ended his work as a practicing chemist, that not being in uniform during a war makes courting difficult, having a pacifist for a partner makes business difficult during a war, that a company under financial pressure will take chances with its employees even its chief scientist and manager, that is is very easy to create a hazardous waste site, and that even under financial duress there were chemicals Max would not make."},{"Title":"The Maras Affair","review":"This is not one of Eric Ambler's better novels, which may be the reason he published it under a pseudonym. Still, second-rate Ambler is better than most of the genre. As always, Ambler shows a formidable grasp of the geopolitics of his time. One would be tempted to think \\"The Maras Affair\\" was a quick exploitation of the Hungarian Uprising of 1956--except that Ambler published it in 1953! Like all of Ambler's novels, this one has no heroes, but I find the non-heroes of those published under his own name are more sympathetic."},{"Title":"The Fox in the Attic","review":"I read 'The Fox in the Attic' many years ago when I was seventeen. It was a revelation to me of how literature can deal with history and politics on a deeper and more profound level than simple narration of events can do. As a journalist Hughes had travelled widely in pre-war Europe and the novel reeks with his knowledge of real people and places. In one sense perhaps this is a roman-a-clef but Hughes was interested intensely in the psychology of human beings, in the irrational, half-understood motives we have for our behaviour, and his writing focuses on that as much as on giving a picture of an era. This was the first of a projected trilogy; 'The Wooden Shepherdess' being the second installment. Hughes was not a prolific writer and he died before he finished the third - whether he had begun it or not I do not know. One of the minor greats of twentieth century English literature."},{"Title":"The Fox in the Attic","review":"I'm only writing this \\"review\\" to express my amazement that this book has not received a uniform 5 stars. Richard Hughes is one of the most sublime discoveries of my literary life. The Fox in the Attic was supposed to be the first of a trilogy. The second book also got written by this very slow and idiosyncratic author (who loves parentheses), and it is equally wondrous although rather different from the first. The third was only begun, and what got written is disappointing. Then to discover A High Wind in Jamaica ... well, I thought I'd died and gone to heaven. So if, as I had, you think you're not likely to discover an entirely new (to your experience) author of truly great and enjoyable novels, banish your malaise and give this fellow a try."},{"Title":"The Fox in the Attic","review":"I have loved many of the books in this series of reprints by the New York Review of Books. Contrary to the criticisms of the previous review, left by someone who hadn't even read the book(!), the novel explores the cultural environment in Munich just following the first world war, so in and around 1919. It's also filled with enigmatic characters and great atmosphere- mouldering castles and mysterious guests with homicidal tendencies. Definitely worth checking out."},{"Title":"The Fox in the Attic","review":"Yes, I've read the bleeding book, down to the last syllable of our protagonist, recorded Augustine. (Sigh.) Out, out brief candle! Life in this book is but a collection of assorted oddities and heavy-handed psychological theorising about I'm not at all sure what. The London critic Michael Holroyd calls the book \\"unusual and impressive.\\" I heartily agree with \\"unusual,\\" but it's impressive only in the aforesaid unusualness. Everyone in it would seem to be trapped in their own harum-scarum, incoherent - I would say Weltanschauung, but none of the events recorded here makes for anything but a schizophrenic take on life. \\"But wait, that's the point don't you see!\\" I hear admirers of this book exclaiming. No, I don't see. Like Mitzi, literally, and, Augustine, figuratively, I'm lead to no deep insight into the etiology of my blindness. And the writing is such a chore. I find it very difficult indeed to lend credence to the belief that readers found this stilted, archaic idiom employed throughout the novel in very unmelodious passage upon passage worth their while. I came across many a word that I'd only encountered in crosswords heretofore.Anyway, not my spot of tea at all, save for the obscure and interesting word usage that pops up now and again. I'm quite sure that this review won't dissuade anyone from reading the book. Just be sure, old boy, not to \\"bark your nose\\" upon brushing up against the verbiage upon opening the covers."},{"Title":"The Fox in the Attic","review":"This is the story of Augustine, a clueless English boy of 23 who wanders through various scenes in 1923 England and Germany. He happens to be a Baron, endlessly wealthy with an Oxford education and his whole pampered life in front of him. The author gives this typical back-story endless unusual facets both intriguing and odd. But the core of the book and its only intensity is a detailed multidimensional discussion of the Munich putsch and events leading up to it.Post WWI hyperinflation in Germany is described using two of the most forceful images I have read: by the time you can drink a bottle of beer the empty bottle is worth more than the full one a moment ago, and workers paid for a week of work find that the next day the train fare to work is more than that weekly pay. This world of hyperinflation and the topsy-turvey world of winners and losers it creates is but one facet of post-war upheaval and discontent that created a fertile breading ground for Naziism. We are given intimate portraits of several ex-soldiers, both young and old, who were brainwashed into the concept of ever victorious Germany. The surrender left them stricken and prey to ideologies that would replace the tattered world of the soldier. The scenes build logically and at a quickening pace until fairly late we see Hitler during the events of the failed putsch. While I have read the scene of Hitler hiding at Putzi Hanfstaengl's cottage several times, the surrounding events are equally well described, and leave a strong impression on the reader.My enthusiasm for the book is tempered by the listless personality of Augustine who lives through momentous personal and historic events over a period of a few months, but these experiences appear to have impacted him little if at all. He is a sheltered, opinionated Englishman uninterested in other people (yes, he falls in love, but with someone he has essentially never talked to), politics, the arts, and foreign anything. He is rather dim, deeply blind to anything outside of himself, and utterly unappealing as a personality. A deeply odd choice for our protagonist. His one skill is visual acuity, but it is displayed in a manner typical of our odd Augustine. He admires the plumage of the birds he kills as much as his loved one's hair. Yicks!There are lots of minor characters and moderate to large dramas, but these are dropped quickly, and we never learn what happens. Nellie? Polly? Fritz? The author can write an arresting scene in a couple of pages, but to continually leave us with those scenes unresolved is disappointing."},{"Title":"The Fox in the Attic","review":"Richard Hughes wrote High Wind in Jamaica, one of the strangest and most compelling books that I've ever read. His next novel, The Fox in the Attic, is a well written and intelligent fictional account of life in Europe between the two world wars. A sophisticated, educated, and upper class Englishman visits his relatives in Germany and becomes aware of tensions between Bavaria and Munich and tensions between republicanism and monarchy. There is very little understanding between him and his relatives. The English feel revulsion towards the idea of war; the Germans, on the other hand, are determined to fight again, but to win this time. Hughes describes this very well. There are some notes that will remind the reader of High Wind in Jamaica: some charming descriptions of children and some concerns about what it means to be &quot;I&quot;. The novel is odd, and the characters are difficult to understand, but High Wind in Jamaica was magical with characters that one will always remember. I'm not sure how I would have felt about this wook had I not read HW in Jamaica first. Recommended for people wanting a different viewpoint on Hitlers rise to power in Germany."},{"Title":"The Fox in the Attic","review":"I read this at the prompting of a friend. However, I'm not that impressed -- it didn't hold up to the literary expectations I had. It isn't horrible -- just a historical novel about the 1920's in Germany and Britain. Hughes did a good job of providing sympathetic portrayals of characters some of whom are so flawed I would call them evil. Honestly, that contributes to why I don't care for the book."},{"Title":"The Fox in the Attic","review":"To quote the previous review...&quot;A sophisticated, educated, and upper class Englishman visits his relatives in Germany and becomes aware of tensions between Bavaria and Munich and tensions between republicanism and monarchy. There is very little understanding between him and his relatives.&quot;It is not surprising that the Englishman is little understood by his German relatives if he is talking about &quot;tensions between republicanism and monarchy&quot;, since the German monarchy was overthrown in November 1918 in a popular revolution, many years before the date of this book.I hope this oversight doesn't reflect further historical errors with the novel."},{"Title":"Walt Disney's Bambi gets lost","review":"Was so happy when I received this in the mail THE NEXT DAY!!

Both stated that the books were new. After getting the first and finding a very used copy I ordered another. Neither was new. One had the price $1.00 in permanent ink on the cover and throughout the book it was obvious it well worn. The other's cover edges were smashed and page edges obviously used. Ended up in the hospital and didn't have the time or energy to return the items.

The authorand friends travel to various Australian locales inorder to spearfish for sharks. They hunt mostlynurse sharks with catches of up to 10 feet made byapproaching the shark with an explosive tipped spearand plunging it into the shark. Lots of excitementand an interesting viewpoint which contrasts to todayseco-sensitive attitudes. Worth reading"},{"Title":"The House of Kuragin","review":"Set against the backdrop of 19th century Russia, the House of Kuragin is the first novel of British author Constance Heaven. It also won her an RNA (Romantic Novelists Association) award in the early 1970s. It tells the story of Amarylis who journeys to Russia to become a companion cum governess to a small boy - the child of fairly old Dimitri Kuragin and his beautiful young wife. Adultery and its tragic consequences is a key theme in this excellent romantic suspense novel. Being a fan of the genre, I would recommend this and other books by Miss Heaven. It is followed by a sequel, the Astrov Inheritance where the main protagonist is Amarylis' younger sister Sophie. The characters in the House of Kuragin feature prominently in this book too."},{"Title":"Gurps Steampunk","review":"I've been dying for this book for months, and let me tell you... it lives up to the expectations. It doesn't matter if you want to play a Jules Verne-esque Romantic Fiction romp or a James Blaylock Steam meets Spells dark comedy, this book will help it come true.Essentially, this book makes the assumption that Victorian-era culture, morality, and society would not change much had the technological marvels been possible, and I tend to agree. The setting gives players and GMs a terrific overview of a mis-understood culture that is chock-a-block with gaming possibilities.As an example, my playing group is using this book to re-create the Battle of Rourke's Drift... but the Prussian government has secretly armed the Zulus with advanced weaponry, in order to win an ally in the region. Is it plausible? Probably not. But is it fun? HECK, YEAH!Never mind those &quot;more-anarchist-than-thou&quot; cyberpunks or &quot;more-gothic-than-thou&quot; Vampire gamers. Pick up GURPS Steampunk. Pick it up NOW. Trust me."},{"Title":"Gurps Steampunk","review":"Ever since the demise of the Game Design Work Shop. I have been looking for a conversion for my Victorian roleplaying. This book fills the gap. I, being an old fart roleplayer, have little time to do conversions. The original rules for 1889 where very simplistic. I wanted more meat. GURPS gives me that extra detail that I crave. The history and color supplied is very good, but of little use to me. The characters and tables were what I needed. Very well written, and to the point. many of these suppliments tend to lean to generalities, but this one focuses on the salient points."},{"Title":"Gurps Steampunk","review":"I highly recommend this book, even if you don't find the genre compelling. I may never run a victorian game, but I read the book from cover to cover. The writing is excellent and really captured my imagination. Stoddard evokes a marvelous setting, chock full of gaming potential."},{"Title":"Gurps Steampunk","review":"The best one sentence characterization of Steampunk I've ever seen is \\"an excess of odd enthusiasms combined with the almost was.\\"It is a marriage of the almost possible with mad science and an over-the-top enthusiasm outlook that is odd, and even annoying, by modern standard. Imagine a steam-powered dirigible with a heavy load of coal on board. Impossible! Ridiculous! Now \\"all\\" you have to do is invent a partial anti-gravity device and suddenly it becomes quite reasonable. Sounds impossible? Perhaps, but it didn't seem so to inventors in the Victorian era who were constantly challenging and changing every aspect of society.History does things that writers wouldn't dare put in their books because they are so implausible. Steampunk takes advantage of that and then pushes it to the nth degree while still seeming half reasonable. It's like a pleasant daydream during a fairly good history lesson.Now that I'm done defining Steampunk I'll describe how the book meshes Steampunk and GURPS. The one word version is: Superbly!!!The much longer version is that the author (William Stoddard, my absolutely favorite GURPS author, if you hadn't guessed) has done a superb job of luring people into the Steampunk genre and then showing them the amazing roleplaying possibilities it contains.He starts with a dash of history, don't worry, it's brief, to the point, and very interesting. For example, when was the first vibrator invented and what was the reaction of the stodgy Victorian doctors to it? You will be amazed!Imagine people who are giants in their fields of endeavor (political, scientific, business, etc.), striding intellectually and physically across the continents, changing the course of history to fit their whims and clashing with each other in memorable ways. They make brilliant discoveries and create empires but their mistakes will haunt the world for generations to come. Sound like an implausible sci-fi story? No, it all happened, just as I've described.Now throw in a mad-science element. This can be anything from magic as technology to sentient steam computers to tiny little changes that have huge ripple effects.I ran a Steampunk campaign for multiple years that had only two little twists, magic exists (but works very slowly and with limitations) and steam-powered computers and robots. You wouldn't believe how much fun the players had with this. The player's favorite session was a duel between the characters and a bunch of steam-powered mecha using improvised lightning cannons on a volcanic island that was about to erupt.The second favorite episode was a sad, sweet story involving machine gun-toting, man-eating semi-evolved dinosaurs in the mountains of Somalia on the edges of the British Empire.The third favorite involved voodoo rites and inter-dimensional travel in New Orleans. And I didn't even get to send them to Mars! Oh boy would they have had fun there!But back to the book. I couldn't have done ANYTHING without Mr. Stoddard's information and advice. He seems to have somehow swiped some TARDIS technology because this book contains far more material than should be able to fit in a book of this size.Another advantage of Steampunk is that you can harness television shows, history lessons, and many other sources to help the players imagine this new, and yet strikingly familiar, world. Have them cross wits with Sherlock Holmes. Have them cross swords with Allen Quartermain (warning, he cheats!). How about a submarine duel with Captain Nemo? Rewrite Dracula or Frankenstein to your preferences! Explore the ancient mysteries of China and/or India with completely insufficient preparation!Excited yet? If not, go to the Emergency Room because there's something seriously wrong with you."},{"Title":"Gurps Steampunk","review":"Do you love the novels of Jules Verne and H.G. Wells? Have you ever dreamt of becoming the hero of one of their novels? This is a source book for the GURPS roleplaying system which will allow you to do exactly that. It provides lots of information on building a world, characters, and a story for your campaign. Actually this book has a lot of background information on the age and I really enjoyed reading it. This is my favorite GURPS source book and I recommend you pick it up."},{"Title":"In Defense of Sin","review":"John Portman's In Defense of Sin is a reasonably interesting anthology. Some of the items are familiar - Wilde, Seneca - others less so. Its philisophy lite. Its greatest appeal will be to someone who has just started to explore philisophy, and would like to get an idea of some of the arguments without going into a mass of technical detail. For that purpose, its quite useful, and some of the extracts are quite good. I particularly like the Wilde. If this anthology gets people to read deeper, it will have served its purpose.The anthology is a quick read, and I'd recommend it for philisophy beginners... and those curious to see what can be said for sin."},{"Title":"Wicca for Beginners: Fundamentals of Philosophy & Practice (For Beginners (Llewellyn's))","review":"As a teacher of Wicca for many years, I'm always looking for better materials to use for training. I am grateful to Ms. Sabin for providing what will undoubtedly be the introductory book I will recommend for the foreseeable future. She presents the basics without pushing any given path or tradition, often presenting varying interpretations and viewpoints in a non-judgemental manner. This is a solid foundation for seekers to use as a springboard to whatever flavor of Wicca they choose to explore.I appreciate that she addresses ethics within Wicca, which many authors seem to avoid, or present in a highly simplistic manner.The book is clearly meant for beginners, hence the title, and is possibly the best overall introduction I have yet seen."},{"Title":"Wicca for Beginners: Fundamentals of Philosophy & Practice (For Beginners (Llewellyn's))","review":"As a Buddhist with Wiccan tendencies, I found that Sabin's thoroughly engaging, witty, non-threatening introduction to earth-based spirituality was just the ticket to satisfy a lifelong curiosity and a nagging sense that modernity and monotheistic religions are strangling our collective connection to the Divine in its feminine and masculine totality. The historical context, the DIY common sense and the conversational style reveal a mystical writer with an academic's intellect and a believer's heart. I've actually used some of the protective skills and guided imagery, and I think that as I become more comfortable with my own skin, I'll explore her teachings in more depth. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Wicca for Beginners: Fundamentals of Philosophy & Practice (For Beginners (Llewellyn's))","review":"I bought this book to learn more about the wiccan religion as my girlfriend is wiccan and I had no prior (correct) knowledge of the religion.

In general I would reccomend this book to anyone just starting out who wants to learn more about the religion."},{"Title":"Wicca for Beginners: Fundamentals of Philosophy & Practice (For Beginners (Llewellyn's))","review":"I have been exploring different religions for some time now. I have been having trouble finding anything that did not contradict things that I felt were fundamentally true about the universe and about life. I was reluctant to pick up Wicca because my husband was raised Catholic and his whole family is very religious.This is a fabulous book! And I have found my true religion. The ideas of Wicca coincide with what I have always felt. This book is truly a wonderful resource. It is informative in a gentle way. There is not a lot of bibitty bobbity boo, just good old fashioned facts. The meditation exercises are wonderful.Now, as long as I don't talk about this near my husband and his family, all will be well."},{"Title":"Wicca for Beginners: Fundamentals of Philosophy & Practice (For Beginners (Llewellyn's))","review":"As a new Wiccan with my only pagan friend hundreds of miles away, I was searching for something to help answer many questions I had. Was I on the right path? Did I truly understand where I was going?Something made me click the link to this book and I'm glad I did. I bought the book based on the previous good reviews, and it paid off for me.Thea Sabin starts the book with a wonderful introduction into the history of Wicca. Bits of humor are littered among the facts, keeping it from being too dry (hey, history is boring to me). From there she goes into a full chapter on the principles and ethics...topped off with a great section of \\"What Wicca is NOT\\".I appreciated the first two chapters and the scope of what they covered. She made sure to point out that everyone's path is unique and that while you may not practice everything mentioned, it is important to know about it.By the end of the second chapter so many of my questions were answered I was eager to read on. The exercises she gives to help you along are fun and challenging, working your magical muscles in an effective way.For me this book was a great start, and a wonderful accompaniment to the aide of friendship I have in my pagan friend so far away."},{"Title":"Wicca for Beginners: Fundamentals of Philosophy & Practice (For Beginners (Llewellyn's))","review":"So you've discovered Wicca and think it might be the Path for you? Then do yourself a favor and read this book, along with \`Practical Magic For Beginners: Techniques And Rituals To Focus Magical Energy' by Brandy Williams. The combo of these two beginners books is enough to get you on your Path. Williams focuses more on ritual while Sabin focuses more on feelings and beliefs.This book covers the Sabbats (the Wheel Of The Year), although briefly) introducing us to the celebrations of Sabbats and Esbats. Sabin discusses some of the Wiccan Gods and Goddesses, the practical tools of the witch including the invisible (grounding, centering, visualization, casting a circle) and the physical tools (the altar, athame, bells, candles, wands, etc). Your altar can be as simple or elaborate as you wish.She covers the Elements and the Quarters (directions associated with Elements), Meditation, Ethics, the Wiccan Rede, and lastly putting together all the information you've gathered and putting it to good use. I highly recommend making Sabin's book and Williams' book your first books along the way to finding your own Path. There are many other books to branch out from, including the highly recommended \`The Way Of Four' by Deborah Lipp that gets into intimate detail regarding the Four Elements (a special focus of mine, along with celebrating Sabbats). I highly recommend this book. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Wicca for Beginners: Fundamentals of Philosophy & Practice (For Beginners (Llewellyn's))","review":"This was the first book I read on Wicca and it is one of the best introductory books I've ever read on any subject. Thea breaks the basics of the craft down in a concise logical meaningful and approachable manner. She not only includes a great explanation of the topics but also practical exercises so the student can experience them for firsthand which makes sense because Wicca is supposed to be an experiential path. The author does a good job of driving that point home. This book is an excellent starting point and provides enough information to get a taste of Wicca so one can decide if its for them and if they desire further study."},{"Title":"Wicca for Beginners: Fundamentals of Philosophy & Practice (For Beginners (Llewellyn's))","review":"I love this book so much... I have been studying wicca for about nine years now and this is the first book where I actually felt like the author wasn't trying to push their own wiccan beliefs on to the reader. After reading the first chapter, I knew that this book was going to teach me so much and I was not mistaken.I have read almost all of the famous authors: Buckland, Silverwolf, Cunningham, but for some reason I feel like Ms. Sabin is the only author who is realistic enough to know that she can not possibly know everything about Wicca. In my opinion, Buckland clearly thinks that he knows it all, Silverwolf is more subtle in her know it all attitude and Cunningham merely implies that he is a know it all.So far Ms. Sabin, is the only author of wicca who seems to be able to give me the facts and teach me without being preachy or self-indulgent. She is humble and tells it like it is, qualities that are rare to find in an author who writes books about and/or for Wicca/Witchcraft. Then she somehow finds a way to allow me to go my own way. I have many friends who are into practicing with a coven and they love this book as well (fyi: I am a solitary witch who also practices Buddhism).I am so thankful that I happened across this book (I thank the God and Goddess everyday), and I honestly believe that this book has completely changed the way I do ritual and set up my alter. Even though I am not a beginner by any means, I still reach for this book often when I am practicing, because it is always good to brush up on the fundamental beliefs and the basics."},{"Title":"Wicca for Beginners: Fundamentals of Philosophy & Practice (For Beginners (Llewellyn's))","review":"This book is one of the best I have read for beginners so far. I bought this book mainly because of the title (yes I tend to judge a book by its cover), but I am very happy that I did. The author gives the readers a brief overview with enough information to get started but not so much that you get overwhelmed. I did find myself having questions after I finished reading the book but that is why I am looking for more advanced books. The author never makes any claims that the book is something its not and is very open with saying this is for beginner and is by no means a complete manual for everything you need to know, but it will get you off to a great start.I read a few of the bad reviews (1 and 2 stars) and I can not believe these people. First off this book is not a complete book on herbs and the author even tells you that you do not have to use everything that they talk about but are simply giving you the information so you have and so you have an idea of what you could use. I never saw the author write once that you absolutely have to use a candle or herb or whatever. It is more about giving you ideas and they even tell you to do what feels best to you. The author explains several times that it is more important that you energy and will is right rather than the mundane tools you use to conduct the ritual. The author also states to acquire what you need gradually, that there is no need to run out and get everything right now. Also to those that say it is a boring read you must be easily bored because I thought this book was fascinating and could not put it down. I finished in like 3 days and I am a slow reader.I personally did not try any of the rituals or techniques (yet), I was mainly using the book for information and I got plenty of it. I will be going back soon and trying some of the mediation techniques but like I said I was not looking for a spell or ritual book just information on the subject. If you want to try that stuff while you do the book that is great and you will probably get more out of it but if you want to just get a basic (beginner) over view it does that as well.I hope this helps someone decide. Sorry if this seems a little scattered this is my first review.

Not only was the book informative for beginners, but also those just curious about the Wiccan way.

The Star Wars parallels cleared a lot of confusion. This book described to me the importance of understanding Wicca as an energy and as a way of seeing things from another perspective. I didn't feel that the author was pushing me to join or change my lifestyle, I felt that they wanted me to find my own understanding of the practice."},{"Title":"Wicca for Beginners: Fundamentals of Philosophy & Practice (For Beginners (Llewellyn's))","review":"I just finished this book about a week ago and really got a lot from it! It's easy to understand but not dummed down. Everything is well organized so it is easy to find what your looking for when you refer back to it. She basically gives you a good introduction to what wicca is, casting circles, calling the quarters, doing rituals and spell work, the God and Goddess, etc. And she just tells it like it is, she doesn't try to make everything sound overly magickal or mysterious. When explaining how to perform rituals and spell work she gives good example rituals/spells so you can put everything she has taught you together. This is a great book for anyone regardless if they are a solitary or in a coven/tradition.

My first was cunningham's green book, but this one has a deeper jet easier explanation about meditation, trance, the wheel of the year etc. I REALLY recommend it for the begginer who wants to know what wicca is about. This is definitely a 101 wicca begginers book, nothing new if you are a little advanced, it's a great start.

It's straightforward and explains all the basics in a clear fashion that doesn't insult the readers' intelligence. I was delighted with some of the exercises she suggests in her book - shielding, grounding, the basics of energy and spell work, all very useful in getting someone who is new to Wicca started on a good foot. I feel confident that those seeking to learn about Wicca will get some good ideas to chew on, delivered by someone who knows their Craft. Thank you for this great book."},{"Title":"Wicca for Beginners: Fundamentals of Philosophy & Practice (For Beginners (Llewellyn's))","review":"A wonderful intro to Wicca.

I really enjoyed the authors voice and style of writing."},{"Title":"Wicca for Beginners: Fundamentals of Philosophy & Practice (For Beginners (Llewellyn's))","review":"This book is a decent read, reasonably accessible without being simplistic. The section on the nature of deity is better than most, as is the section on circle casting. I also quite liked the suggestions on grounding and shielding, topics that many authors seem to find difficult to convey. The chapter on the Wheel of the Year is a bit disordered but I think that's hard to avoid, especially in an overview.

My favorite is still The Truth About Wicca and Witchcraft by James Aten, but this one is a very close second. It does give a nice history, as well as examples, and it's thoughtfully written.

I ordered the book, amoungst other sundries, and was surprised at how thorough and accurate Ms. Sabin was. It isn't a book of spells or words to make your ex turn into a frog. It's insightful, philosophical, and just a good read in general. I highly recommend it for anyone researching religions."},{"Title":"Wicca for Beginners: Fundamentals of Philosophy & Practice (For Beginners (Llewellyn's))","review":"This is a pretty darn good book. Simply worded, fast read and has plenty good exercises for the beginning Wiccan. Like grounding and God and Goddess introductions. This book also makes a point to discuss cultural appropriation when choosing your pantheon (if you do so) and ethics, like the Rede, and Rule of 3.

The author does not have an overly preachy tone, but still asks her readers to question and educate themselves.This author covers a lot of material before jumping into magic. She gives you lots of ideas for working with energy,pathworking, meditation,and developing a relationship with deity. She encourages readers to build solid foundations before going to the next level.You may not find a bunch of glittery magic in this book, but what you will find is an author who seriously cares about her reader's spiritual growth.High,highly recommended for the beginner!"},{"Title":"Wicca for Beginners: Fundamentals of Philosophy & Practice (For Beginners (Llewellyn's))","review":"I am interested in pursuing the path of Wicca, so I went to the bookstore one day to pick up a book on it so that I could learn a little and see if I wanted to learn more. I ultimately decided to start with this book, and I am very glad I did! Sabin did a fantastic job! It was easy to understand and interesting to read, and it gave me a lot of options. I didn't feel stifled by it or scared; I felt encouraged and engaged. She ultimately emphasizes that Wicca is very personal, and is different for everyone, and I really appreciated that. Overall, her writing is simple yet powerful, and surprisingly she gave off a rather unbiased feel for a book about a religion that she herself practices. I am excited to learn more! I would recommend this to anyone who is interested in Wicca or simply wants to learn about a religion that is often misunderstood.Also, I want to address a review that stated that there were \\"shopping lists\\" included in Sabin's book. There weren't. There were, however, suggestions of things you might want to look into, if you so chose, throughout the book that were relevant to her topics.

Mrs. Sabin put everything into focus and is good for the very basics. Her instructions for grounding and centering are perfect and they work. She only gives one spell, but that is a good thing for the very begginers. The thing to look for with this book is the explination of the wiccan beliefs and ethics, everything you need to give you the choice of wether or not to choose this path.

I didn't get past the first few pages when I noticed shopping lists. Great, even more money to spend! So, I'm looking through this shopping list and I find that on them are things like \\"myrrh resin or dried, powdered orris root\\" and more and more herbs that I've NEVER heard of. First, I'm not into herbology so if you're going to make an instructional book then tell me what these things are. Now I have to do research on a book that I bought for research. Second, not everyone lives in a part of the country where religions outside of the Christian realm are in any way acceptable, so there isn't any type of new age or herbal shop near. This would be the time to provide alternatives to these ingredients and even though I searched the back where the resources are I didn't find a store carrying the first 30 days of herbs. Meaning I'd have to pay two sets of shipping charges and order from two different places just in the first 30 days. I can only imagine as the book progresses how much of a pain it will be to find these things. Maybe I'm so used to the laid back and helpful writings of Scott Cunningham that I'm expecting the same from this Wiccan author but none the less, I am left disapointed and out money."},{"Title":"Wicca for Beginners: Fundamentals of Philosophy & Practice (For Beginners (Llewellyn's))","review":"This book was dull and not very useful.

I am a painter.\\" --Paul KleeThis book contains 48 full-color plates. They are of high quality and full page (I'm not sure the exact dimensions of the book, but it is quite large). I'm not sure how I feel about Klee's work as a whole, since there isn't a large enough sample contained here, but the paintings contained in this book are amazing, or most of them are at least. Klee was truly an astounding artist. That, though, brings up my only fault with the book, it is such a brief book that you don't get enough of Klee's work. Hopefully there are other surveys of his work out there, one that is more complete. And if not, I hope that one soon will be, from what I've seen here, he certainly deserves one.The book starts with a medium length essay by Douglas Hall, who I understand to be one of the world's leading experts on Klee. It's not as inclusive as a book-length biography, but Hall definitely gives you a fair sense of Klee's life and a good idea of how to look at Klee's work. He goes in depth on several of the paintings represented within.I believe this book is out of print so you will have to go to your local library and check out a copy, but it is worth doing so, so that you can get an introduction to one of our more important artists."},{"Title":"Complexities: Women in Mathematics","review":"While the opportunities for women still lag behind men in some areas, in general there are equal opportunities between the sexes. Most of the women under forty today have no idea how different it was for women thirty years ago. Before the twentieth century, it was even worse. Women such as Sophie Germain had to study mathematics in secret or publish their results under a male byline. This book starts with the biographies of fifteen female mathematicians born before 1920 and chronicles their struggles and achievements. While these biographies are interesting, they are probably too distant to be considered relevant by the modern student. In their other studies, they will have encountered facts such as women lacking the right to vote, so the fifteen women will simply be additional examples of women held in check by the prevailing social and legal norms.The real power of the book is in the accounts that are much more recent. Less than fifty years ago, women were rare in mathematics and those who managed to succeed were often considered oddities. Many graduate programs had either formal or informal policies against admitting women and those accepted generally were given little encouragement. Nevertheless, determined women managed to succeed and provide inspiration to future generations of mathematicians. This is their story and they are all to be commended for their success and their willingness to encourage the next generation to succeed. It is largely due to their hard work and occasional suffering that there are now so many opportunities for women in all areas of mathematics. I strongly recommend this book as required reading in any history of mathematics class. It is also suitable as supplemental material for courses in women's studies and the history of education.Published in Journal of Recreational Mathematics, reprinted with permission."},{"Title":"Love: My Search for Truth","review":"When I reached my 51st year, I revised my goals for the upcoming 50 (I hope!).

Love: My Search for Truth, truly allows you to answer many questions that you have within yourself, about Love. What is Love to you? What could love mean to someone else, and how do we respect those differences among each individual? This book allows you to look at different ideas and concepts surrounding that word, Love. Such a powerful word, with so many deep meanings and outcomes. The writers use of God within the text is also one that allows the reader to extract upon their personal idea of who God is and put it to use within their personal goal of finding the truth within Love.

Annie has managed in this short, yet enduring book of love truths, to guide the reader back into the joy of their heart, to let go of the hurts of the past and to embrace the love and hope of the present. I found this book to be a wonderful \\"pick me up\\" at times in my life when life's challenges brought me down and I forgot to focus on love. \\"The greatest lessons of love can be learned through the pain of our mistakes\\". Each and every one of the \\"truths\\" presented within will warm you and leave you in a oh so much better place along with a smile not only on your face, but also deep within your soul.The illustrations by Rachelle Rouse lend such an endearing quality and fit so perfectly within the love messages. One cannot help but smile and have a warm fuzzy feeling come over them as they traverse the book's message. This book would be so perfect after any challenge in one's life or just as gentle reminder to let love back in to work its' magic in your life. We all need those gentle reminders in our lives every once in awhile! Read this book and let the healing qualities of love waft and weave its magic back into your heart and soul.

I stopped and read the first couple of pages and started discussing it with her. The name of the book was Love: My Search for Truth. After a while we discussed the main focus of the book, and the author conceded that it was meant to diffuse some animosity in the world. I was about to leave, and I told her I would be back, but she stopped me, and gave me a complimentary copy of the book. She was very warm and very interesting. I went home, and immediately started reading the book. I thought each and every page was worth a great deal of merit. The way she juxtaposed some of the phrases was especially informative and thought-provoking. The focus of this book is not to push it's literary merit and creativity on the reader, but rather to provoke thought inside the reader's mind. If someone were to say that this book has no substance, then that means that person has no substance because, as I have pointed out, the book asks the reader to think.

Thus, the book stands on its own as a most useful educational tool. Although deregulation has somehow changed the way power systems operation and control are handled, the book stands strong in providing a coherent understanding of concepts and methods involved. My graduates, working in industry, have found the course (and of course the book) most useful for their careers."},{"Title":"Power Generation, Operation, and Control","review":"This is the first authoritative and comprehensive text on power system operations and control. The book provides an excellent overview of the basic topics that need to be covered in such a course at either the advanced undergraduate or the introductory graduate level. The improved second edition of the book has been widely used in various power programs throughout the world. I learned everything about &quot;power system operation and control&quot; by studying the first edition of this book in the mid 1980. I have used it as a professor and recommended it to all my students. This book still has no rivals in the market and is the single best source for a text in the subject area."},{"Title":"Power Generation, Operation, and Control","review":"This is the second edition of an extremely well written and carefully thought out book. The material is systematically developed and is a graduate text book which provides a solid foundation in various aspects of power system operation and control. At Iowa State University we have used this book ever since the first edition was published for an introductory graduate course in our graduate curriculum. The book has been extremely well received by our students. It provides detailed analysis of the steps involved in each aspect of power system operation and complements this with excellent examples. The problems at the end of each chapter reinforce the material presented and test the understanding of the student. The diskette which accompanies the book is also very helpful in working the problems and provides rich experience to the student.This book is ideally suited for the serious student who takes time to carefully read the material, assimilate the material and applies it in a practical setting.This was also one of the first texts to introduce several important concepts related to the deregulation of the utility industry."},{"Title":"Power Generation, Operation, and Control","review":"We have used this book at ASU for quite a while. The book is well done and clear in its writing style. All the traditional dispatch methods are covered in detail. The section on dynamic programming is excellent. There are a number of very usefuyl tricks and tidbits in the book, and this give students a feel for the subject. If there is any weakness, it is too short -- I would like to see this expanded to two volumes. The section on state estimation is a good introduction."},{"Title":"Power Generation, Operation, and Control","review":"This book covers many of the most significant areas in power system operations and computations. Its unique features include detailed coverage of the fundamentals of economic operations and system computational support. From the competition point of view,I doubt if you will find an equal to the well thought out examples and problems in this book. I wish that the authors would produce a new edition covering the latest in the deregualted environment,"},{"Title":"Power Generation, Operation, and Control","review":"I found this book to be even better than the excellent first edition. While it requires undergraduate electrical engineering education and an understanding of steady state power analysis, it provides exceptional coverage of to various aspects of power generation, operation and control. I have recommended this book and the first edition to my colleagues in the past, after insuring that they had the background to understand the material presented."},{"Title":"Power Generation, Operation, and Control","review":"I have used this text for many years. It is an excellent text to understand power system operation and optimization. I have found no other book as qualified for this task.I find it displeasing that another reviewer would rate the book so poorly without allowing others to review his credentials as closely. Amazon should qualify reviewers if the reviewing is to be held in any honor."},{"Title":"Power Generation, Operation, and Control","review":"This book is a must for any one who needs to learn about advanced topics in Power System Computational Methods with emphasis on generation economics and Control. The examples are extremely helpful to the reader without being overly simplistic. The degree of detail is just about right for the intended audience. The book has been the chosen text for many generations of power system practioners, and is highly recommended."},{"Title":"Power Generation, Operation, and Control","review":"I have used the first and second edition of this book for almost twenty years and I believe that it is a classic. It is not an introductory text but all engineers with an understanding of the basics of power systems should find it a very useful introduction to the mathematical methods used in power system operation. I have recommended it to my graduate students and to engineers from industry who were taking a continuing education course based on this text. I am looking forward to a third edition."},{"Title":"Power Generation, Operation, and Control","review":"Overall this is a good book in terms of coverage and explanation of methods. My background is in math and physics, however, so sudden shifts of notation (avoidable with just a few lines of explanation) lose me. In chapter 4 we find &quot;The transmission network consists of complex impedances&quot; followed by a definition of the network Y matrix. But wait: the Y matrix is defined in terms of a y value for each line. What is the y value for a line? Is it an impedance? No, it's an admittance, but the text doesn't mention that conceptual inversion. Another example is in problem 4.2 of the same chapter. This problem contains a diagram with values of X for each transmission line. What is X? It looks like it should be Y, judging from the previous problem. But wait, there are no capacitors in our problem diagram, so it's not clear. I scan through the preceding chapter for some variable whose standard notation is X. No luck. This makes an otherwise conceptually clear and methodologically informative book VERY frustrating, at least for those of us not steeped in the typical notation of power systems analysis."},{"Title":"Power Generation, Operation, and Control","review":"The code that goes with this book uses Pascal. This is difficult as it is hard to get Pascal compiler nowadays. It would be useful if it was written in C. The authors do not have a website for this book. They could have put errata, comments from purchasers and book updates, etc."},{"Title":"Power Generation, Operation, and Control","review":"This book is essential for the understanding of how generation is dispatched in the US. Great for engineers beginning in the power industry as well as seasoned professionals."},{"Title":"Power Generation, Operation, and Control","review":"From a new grad student's perspective, i have to say that this book is absolutely terrible!! The writers provided NO useful examples in the chapters and for the examples that are there, they never showed how they generated the results. Its pretty obvious that these guys are not interested in teaching and that very little thought was put into this book. I would recommend this book be banned from the classroom!"},{"Title":"Power Generation, Operation, and Control","review":"I am interested in methods for pricing electricity related with a reference bus called the market bus. Penalty factors or nodal factors for all generation and load buses are calculated in reference to that bus. If reference bus is changed, nodal factors change but difference between any two remain the same, that means that we can choose any reference bus. I am interested in demonstrating this."},{"Title":"The Circle","review":"I've been reading Peter Lovesey for some time now, and I thoroughly enjoy his writing. This book picks up with a character that was first brought in with his last Peter Diamond book - \\"The House Sitter\\". I'm talking about Hen Mallen who is the DCI placed in charge of a series of arsons in the tiny village of Chichester where this book is set. I must admit that I loved Hen when Lovesey first introduced her and this book is a delight with her in it. She is a great creation! A tough talking, cigar smoking lady DCI that has no problem cutting through all the red herrings, plot twists and devious suspects. Lovesey's humour is as wicked and direct as in any of his previous books, and this book will keep the reader guessing right up until the end. I can hardly wait for another Hen Mallin book!"},{"Title":"The Circle","review":"Series: Detective Chief Inspector Henrietta \`Hen' Mallin (first book, there is something of a prequel as she appeared in the 2003 \\"The House Sitter\\" Peter Diamond book).Characters:The Chichester Writer's Circle: Chairman: Maurice McDade (first suspect, had a book titled \\"Unsolved\\" about unsolved crimes about to be published by the publisher Edgar Blacker); Founding Ladies: Dagmar Bumstead (the unpublished romantic novelist under the name Desiree Eliot, most recent work: \\"Passion Fruit\\") and Thomasine O'Loughlin (erotic poetry); The Married Couple: Naomi (witchcraft book, her stare frightens others, very nosy, writes up the activities on an internet website, calling it an e-book) and Basil Green (gardener, somewhat laid back); Secretary and Treasurer: Amelia Snow (proper older woman writing book about the famous Snows: \\"The Snows of Yesteryear\\"; Others: Zach Beale (long-haired fantasy writer, \\"Madrigor: The Coming of the Warrior\\"), Sharon (\\"dumb blonde\\" who doodles and doesn't talk much at the meetings; a hairdresser), Tudor Thomas (autobiography, name-dropper), Anton (retired civil servant, constantly on the look-out for cliches and the like), Jessie Warmington-Smith (widow of an Archdeacon, technophobe, working on a book about tips from the past for living in 21th century); Newcomer: Bob Naylor (quick witted poems, and the one of three that is investigating the matter).The Police: Inspector Henrietta Mallin sent in when the local Detective wasn't getting the job done (DI Johnny Cherry).Minor Characters: Marcus Chalybeate (Lord Chalybeate of Boxgrove, ex-Mark Kiddlewick) - publisher of magazines in previous life, now big in health clubs and a politician. Naylor's 14 year old daughter Sue. Fran, Maurice's above seventy-year-old wife (Maurice is somewhere in his 50s). Fran had been previously married to a notorious criminal.Special Appearance by: Peter Diamond (very brief).Plot: A man (Maurice) that runs a writer's circle is happy to finally get his book published, and invites the publisher (Blacker) to come give a talk to the circle (and make comments on some of the member's work). Blacker says some nice things but is mostly dismissive of their work. Later Blacker tries to get Maurice to pay for the publication of Maurice's book. Blacker, it turns out, is an undisclosed vanity publisher (vanity publisher = publishing house that publishes an author's work with the author paying for the publication; undisclosed = Blacker hides the fact that he will require the author to pay for the publication until the last moment, right before publication). The book opens with Blacker's death. Maurice is picked up by the police and various members of the circle attempt to investigate the matter. Dagmar, Bob Nalyor and Thomasine work together to try to prove Maurice's innocence (with Bob the one mostly at the forefront, and Dagmar mostly in the shadows). Naomi and Zach attempt to investigate the matter themselves, while using the crisis as an opportunity to come up with an e-book (Naomi is gung-ho, Zach doesn't particularly like the idea). Eventually the police step to the forefront in the guise of DCI Hen Mallin.Review: This book is similar to two previous Lovesey books, \\"Bloodhounds\\" and \\"The Last Detective\\" (both in the Peter Diamond series). Like \\"Bloodhounds,\\" this book deals with a local social club. In the \\"Bloodhounds,\\" it was a club for readers, in \\"The Circle\\" it is a club of writers. The structure of \\"The Circle\\" is similar to the structure in \\"The Last Detective.\\" Both books follow the structure of having amateurs moving through some crisis in the first half of the book, while the second half of the book is taken over by the police. In \\"The Circle,\\" the main character in the first half of the book is Bob Naylor, a newcomer to the Chichester Writer's Circle, who is somewhat pressured to try to prove the innocence of Maurice for the murder of Blacker. The second half of the book follows DCI Hen Mallin's investigation of the murders (more than one murder). Neither Naylor nor Mallin are the sole points of view in their sections, and Naylor's point of view continues, somewhat at a lesser level, in the second half of the book.The first half of the book is very good and riveting. When the book adds in DCI Hen Mallin, the book begins to become a little disappointing. When I read \\"The Last Detective,\\" I had a similar feeling, though there I liked the Peter Diamond character better than the Hen Mallin character. The characterization of the main characters is outstanding, and even something of the personality of the first murder victim is revealed along the way. All of the writer's circle members are given a satisfactory characterization, though the main characters have a deeper personality. The setting is well-laid out. The mystery is well-thought-out and interesting. Overall, I would give the book 4.35 stars."},{"Title":"The Circle","review":"I like a nice traditional British mystery as much as the next person, but this effort from the prolific Lovesey just doesn't measure up. Set in the \\"city\\" of Chichester (population roughly 25,000) just inland from the English Channel, the story is a classic whodunit. A small-time vanity publisher is killed by an arsonist, and suspicion falls upon the amateur writer's group he recently spoke before. A series of further arson attacks ensue, and Lovesey tries to play a shell game to keep the reader from figure out who had motive, means, and opportunity to be the culprit (or culprits). Most readers will suspect that the solution lies in the background of the initial victim, and they'd be right -- which is why the amount of time it takes for the police to ferret his background out feels rather artificially prolonged.Of course, this allows more scope in the first half of the book for the amateur (and rather inexplicable) sleuthing of the newest member of the group, a quick-witted delivery driver named Bob Naylor. Then, about halfway into the book, a new lead investigator is appointed. Cue the entrance of tough talking, no BS-taking Hen Mallin -- it's her perspective dominates the second half of the story. It's a rather awkward shift in point-of-view to introduce a co-protagonist so deep into the story, and it doesn't work very well. Worse than this is the cast of supporting characters, who have barely a hint of any life beyond the confines of the book. The group of amateur writers doesn't have any family or friends beyond those needed to serve various plot points or act as red herrings, and the same goes for their life histories. There's also a very weak subplot about a leak from within the police department, the motive for which makes no sense whatsoever, and seems only to exist to give D.I. Mallin something else to do besides solve the relatively straightforward mystery.The whole thing feels quite creaky, from the love interest subplot for Bob, to the strange co-protagonist construction, to the somewhat lame solution to the murder. Despite being published only five years ago, it feels much older, especially some of the language and parts of the story relating to computers. Lovesey would have been about 70 when this came out, and I have to wonder to what extent his powers have faded."},{"Title":"The Circle","review":"The police investigate the fiery murder of unpopular publisher Edgar Blacker, who died following a talk he gave to the Chichester Writers' Circle, an unpublished writers' group. The motive seems obvious as Blacker conned the wannabes into investing in a doomed vanity press con making one of the group most likely the arsonist-killer. The prime suspect is the group's chair Maurice McDade as Blacker shammed the true crime author of the unpublished Unsolved into a hefty investment and gave nothing back.Meanwhile two more fatal fires occur and the newest member Bob Naylor barely survives an attempt to fry him. As the group investigates one another; Inspector Henrietta \\"Hen\\" Mallin takes over the official investigation that has been fumbled while a serial arsonists-murderer has escaped identification.Cigar smoking Hen is a diamond of a cop who turns Peter Lovesey's latest police procedural into a fabulous reading experience. The story line is typical of the grandmaster as the cast seems real especially the wannabe writers turned amateur sleuths and the who-done-it complex yet interesting. As usual the plot contains plenty of red herrings and twists as well as humor as Hen, who played a secondary role in THE HOUSE SITTER, takes the starring role carrying a terrific investigative tale on her pint sized back.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"The Circle","review":"Peter Lovesey, one of the grand masters of the traditional British mystery, doesn't disappoint with this one. His great skill with drawing the character in few strokes, fits perfectly in this amusing and gripping novel. I am a big fan of his Peter Diamond series, and even if this book is not in the same league , it is so much better than the drivel produced in last few years , aimed at impatient, short attention span readers of today.Writing for over 50 years, putting on the marker a book every year, of stunning quality, is an amazing feat.

This one's about a Writers' Circle--a support group for aspiring writers--of all types: fantasy, erotic poetry, even comic strips--so it reminds one of Lovesey'sBloodhounds (Soho Crime)about a mystery readers' circle. Foiled again! However, in this one, the protagonist isn't Peter Diamond (as in Bloodhounds) but Hen Mallin. I like her better than Diamond--she's less narcissistic & unnecessarily caustic. The mystery is intricate & engaging. True, the 1st part of the book centers on the Circle (establishing background or context) & the 2nd part on Hen & the solution. There are also some good lines such as on P. 30: \\"This announcement went down like garlic bread in Transylvania.\\"This is a fun read--but tough to figure out.

Also included are completely new takes on a few of the run of the mill entries common in many entry level books on natural mysteries.As a wildlife artist interested in unusual and rare zoology, I was pleased to have learned of Karl Shuker's writings several years ago.

I wasn't quite sure what all the fuss was about-- it didn't look like my kind of book at all-- but it made her happy.About a week ago, I found myself with nothing to read. In my life, this is a tragedy: the equivalent of being abandoned, swimming in mid-ocean without raft or life jacket. Then I saw my wife's copy of THE FOUR GRACES (read and re-read by her), thought to myself \\"You only live once\\" and picked it up.I was very pleasantly surprised. It is a delightful book, light and lovely, hearkening back to a time and style long since past. It is the story of one summer in England during the Second World War, and it details the lives and adventures of the four daughters of the Rev. Mr. Grace in a small country village.D.E. Stevenson is the grandaughter of Robert Louis Stevenson, but her style owes a great deal more to Austen and Trollope (two writers directly referred to in the novel) than it does to the creator of Long John Silver and Mr. Hyde. That being said, the author she perhaps most closey resembles would be Angela Thirkell.Stevenson's dialogue is smooth, rich, and a treat to listen to (because that is what you do when you read conversations between her characters, you hear them), and the plot, while simple and straightforward, is fun to follow.I really enjoyed myself, and while it is still not my style of book (at least not for a steady diet) as a change of pace, it is the equivalent of a new and tasty light dessert.

Her grandmother's farm and the surrounding area are brought to life through the memories of a child, the commentary of family and friends, and detailed research. One need not be familiar with Kent Island to feel a stir of nostalgia for the simpler times she describes.No romanticized sentiment is found here. Hardships are made clear (\\"the shocking cold of January linoleum\\" in an unheated bedroom, for example, or a coat handed down through six children), but they are tempered with descriptions of the bounty provided by land and water and the reassurance of routine. The security offered by close family ties is evident throughout.Emphasis is placed on accurate and fond description of the region, though recent comers might be hard pressed to reconcile the dirt roads and general stores of Freedman's childhood with the asphalt and strip malls of today's Kent Island. A selection of period photographs augments the author's colorful prose, giving a visual record of structures that have fallen vicitim to \\"progress\\" and the people who helped shape this story.Sadly, the book's poignancy is derived from what we've lost; the concept of controlled development has come too late to save much of Kent Island's appeal. Freedman's work will stand as a testament to what was and a warning of how quickly such things can be lost."},{"Title":"Kent Island: The Land That Once Was Eden","review":"This book is a wonderful tapestry of history and memory that makes for a warm, enjoyable read, despite its message: what is lost. From Native American Matapeake Indians to Baltimore's great fire, and the \\"second\\" Bay Bridge construction, the history reveals the natural resources, economy, and community values of early Kent Island, and its present reality of tract housing, expressways, and strip malls. Freedman's microcosm of Kent Island is a macro for what's happening all over the U.S. Character and charm are no more. We live in vinyl boxes and shop the same chains. As you drive around your town, have you ever really looked to see how ugly most of the landscape is? Try it. The book's images are quite extraordinary though. The author's memories and cherished photos of family and place possess an honesty that reached out for my own distinct early memories, and begged me to appreciate them. She also reinforced my appetite for finding value and beauty in simple things and ways that deserve human note and care. A few of my favorite parts of the book: Recipes Served on the Porch, My Mother's Coat, and the twelve days of Christmas. This book was personally enriching for me, and it's a wake-up call for those of us who've known a finer quality of life. We do know better. Janet Freedman came right out and said it."},{"Title":"Kent Island: The Land That Once Was Eden","review":"I read with interest Janet Freedman's book, KENT ISLAND and was saddened by the great loss of American landscape, folkways and individual freedom that goes along with the vast real estate grab that has been occurring everywhere on the East Coast of the United States during the last 50 years. Except for a few state and federal parks, the coastline is completely owned by the wealthy. Where there were once families and communities engaged in agriculture or seafood harvesting we now have a blight of ticky-tacky housing and high rise hotels. Where there were once farmers and watermen working the land and the water there are now yachtsmen and other pleasure boat owners filling our bays and inlets to such an extent that nobody can derive any pleasure from fishing or sailing.Wherein lies the &quot;pleasure&quot;?

Still, it was a surprise to find so many General officers drawn from the fighting arm who were inadequate. One completes the book with a healthy respect for Lincoln, whose abilities were amazing, particularly given his background.The book focuses on command and control, and in 1952 when it was first published, the world of war was not yet as sharply defined for us as it is today.

Lincoln was not just a great politician, but he was an excellent war strategist. If he had been a general, he would of held his own with the greats such as Lee, Jackson, Sherman, and Grant. In this book, Williams details the interactions of Lincoln, Stanton, Halleck, and such generals as Pope, McClellan, Grant, Sheridan, and Sherman. Lincoln kept an eye on all orders going to these generals and contributed positively to the strategy of the union. When a general screwed up (McClellan, Pope, Burnside, Hooker), Lincoln was there to make suggestions and work with these leaders. It is amazing the patience Lincoln displayed with these huge ego leaders. Some even thought they had more sense than their leader. Lincoln's brillance shins through on all these interactions. He displayed a fatherly attitude toward these individuals.This is great history by a well known historian. This should be one of the books read by all Civil War historians. Lincoln is the center of all these crisises.

Poring over the orders that passed back and forth between Lincoln and his top commanders, Williams paints a highly opinionated portrait of Lincoln's efforts to find the commander who will at last win the war. Williams' portrait of McClellan is extensive - and unforgiving. How this classic study could have been allowed to pass exclusively into the realm of the used book seller is a mystery to this reviewer."},{"Title":"Lincoln and His Generals","review":"In Lincoln and His Generals, T. Harry Williams concentrated on telling the story of Lincoln as commander in chief during America's greatest and most devastating war. In the preface he states his goals clearly; \\"my theme is Lincoln as a director of war and his place in the high command and his influence in developing a modern command system for his nation.\\" Williams expertly develops this theme throughout this fascinating book. Though many may disagree with some of his conclusions about how effective Lincoln was in this role, few, after reading this book, would dispute the fact that it is a well written and reasoned account of the topic, and that it is an important contribution both to Civil War and Lincoln studies.William's views Lincoln as a genius - a man, who came into office with no military knowledge, yet had the flexibility of mind to adapt and learn from his mistakes to guide his country to victory through its greatest wartime crisis. He states that, \\"Lincoln, by the power of his mind, became a fine strategist...a better natural strategist than were most of the trained soldiers.\\" He claims that Lincoln grasped the war's big picture from the very beginning, and even claims that Grant's final end-game strategy from 1864 on was fundamentally Lincoln's plan, though the details and execution were Grant's. I believe that he overreaches with some of these claims, yet he still makes a great case for Lincoln's genius, and his role as the indispensable man behind Union victory.Williams also writes of the generals who were Lincoln's tools for winning the war. McClellan and Grant get the most ink, the former because, despite his great talent, he was ultimately a failure and Lincoln's greatest disappointment and the latter because, in William's estimation, he was the greatest general on either side of the war. Of Lincoln's other generals, Williams writes more about the ineffective, incompetent ones such as Fremont and Banks than he does of effective and even great generals like Sherman and Thomas. He explains in his preface that the reason for this is that the incompetent generals were headaches to Lincoln, forcing him to have intimate command relationships with them, while he had to interfere very little with the moves of the effective Sherman and Thomas.Whether or not you agree with all or even any of the author's conclusions, he has written what still stands as the definitive work on this topic - the launching point for discussion and debate on Lincoln's role as commander in chief. Not only that, he has done it in fine style, creating a clear, interesting, and well-written book that stands as a masterpiece in its field. I give it my highest recommendation.Theo Logos"},{"Title":"Lincoln and His Generals","review":"An absolutely engrossing explanation of how Lincoln and his top generals fought the Civil War and how the war forced the adoption of a modern command structure.If you've seen pictures of Lincoln when elected in 1861 and compared them to pictures from 1865 and wondered why he looked so worn, here's the answer: he had generals (and oh what generals they were!).The fault I find is that it gives too much emphasis to Mclellan and most of the remaining attention to Grant. While these were the major Generals in Chief, I would have liked to have seen more on the other generals who served under them."},{"Title":"Lincoln and His Generals","review":"T. Harry Williams spent a lifetime seeking to understand the role of leadership and power in American history. This book is an elegant analysis of how a wartime president with little military service led a nation during its most desperate era, and rose to the occasion not only to get by but to excel. Williams agrees that Lincoln is the United States' most impressive leader, holding together the nation while desperate centrifugal tendencies tore it asunder. He asserts that Lincoln understood that the Civil War was the first \\"total war,\\" in which all elements of the population, economy, and every other aspect of society must be mobilized. \\"Lincoln and his Generals\\" is an elegant narrative of the evolution of the Civil War from the standpoint of Lincoln and his high command.Williams argues most eloquently the thesis that Lincoln was a brilliant military strategist. His generals did not understand this, wedded as they were to older Napoleonic battlefield tactics that were outmoded with the weaponry available during the Civil War. The drama in this book, and it is considerable, revolves around the controversies between Lincoln and the Union Army's leadership. The central foil for Lincoln's brilliance was Gen. William B. McClellan, the first commander of the Army of the Potomac and overall a superb general, at least as measured against the standards of Napoleonic warfare. He brought together an army, trained it well, organized its logistics, and failed to use it effectively during his time in command. Lincoln was not pleased at his reticence to fight, complaining that \\"He has got the slows\\" in his willingness to take the field.Conversely, Williams describes the effectiveness of Gen. U.S. Grant, who started the war as a minor commander in the Midwest but who demonstrated quickly and effectively that he understood the nature of modern, total war. His concepts of war, and his sense of military strategy matched well with Lincoln's. t. Harry Williams gets into the debate over who was the better general, Grant or Robert E. Lee, and sides resolutely with Grant's place in the pantheon of great military commanders. But he goes a step further, arguing that Lincoln was an even more effective \\"general\\" than both Grant and Lee. Both Lee and Grant admirers may dislike that assessment, and there are reasons to question it.Williams establishes that Lincoln had a superb grasp of strategy and some sense of how to accomplish it. Grant appreciated and accepted that strategy, according to Williams, and designed effective tactical plans to accomplish it. This made them an exceptionally successful team that played to each others strengths and minimized their individual faults. The author also criticizes Lee by questioning his grasp of a strategy for victory in the war. This may be a valid criticism, but as Avery O. Craven pointed out in his review of this book, Lee \\"served under a West Point graduate as the Confederate president, Jefferson Davis, took over the \`global' side of things; Lee, of necessity, commanded the Army of Northern Virginia. How well he did his job compared with how well Grant did his is a matter of opinion and bias and little else\\" (Avery O. Craven review in \\"Mississippi Valley Historical Review,\\" 39 (September 1952): 338).This is first and foremost a magnificent narrative of this titanic struggle between great armies. Almost as important, it is an eloquent statement on behalf of Lincoln as a superb commander-in-chief. It is still a significant book more than fifty years after its publication."},{"Title":"Lincoln and His Generals","review":"This book is a wonderful look at Lincoln and his relationship with his generals and why he went through so many prior to finally appointing Grant, he just couldn't find one that would not when under pressure find all the reason they could not to attack.The book also does an excellent job of detailing Lincoln's involvement in strategic policy for the Union armies. Surprisingly for a man who'd never held a high military rank, Lincoln displayed an incredible grasp of strategy and frequently understood things generals such as Meade did not. Williams also expands into how upon the appointment of Grant to general in chief, the Union high command evolved into a modern military command, the first of its kind in the world, even more advanced than anything seen in Europe until Moltke the Elder, with the Union army high command consisiting of Commander in Cheif, General in Chief, and a new office designed for Halleck and to keep Grant from having to be in Washington, Chief of Staff. Williams also makes clear the different military culture of the 19th century, in stark contrast to most instances today, a general who disagreed with Lincoln or thought his plan to have dissatisfied the president or simply disliked somone they were told to collaborate with in a battle, instead of trying to work out differences, asked to be relieved of command.The one major drawback to this book is its lack of maps. There are no maps to follow the action along, so its advisable to have a Civil War atlas at hand in order to be able to place some of the places the battles take place. Also, if you're looking for a detailed &quot;what happend&quot; in the many battles, in most cases you won't get it with this book. This book is purely about the command and control structure of the Union army and how the players interacted with each other. My one final and biggest grip with Williams is that he at many points assumes too much in my opinion. There are many instances where the documentary record when he wrote the book did not state what happend, so Williams assumes that things &quot;must have&quot; or &quot;certainly happend&quot; a certain way without in some cases anything approaching a clear reason why he draws this conclusion.Other than these few gripes, this is a wonderful book and should be read by anyone wishing to understand why Lincoln went through so many generals."},{"Title":"Lincoln and His Generals","review":"While I enjoyed this book, I felt the title was deceptive. The author, T. Harry Williams, trys to convince us, that Lincoln was a master strategist, and it basically was his strategy that helped win the war. ( I HAD thought this book would be about Union Generals, as Douglass Freemans- Lee's Lt's was about his. That may have been my fault, for misunderstanding)I read this book with an open mind, yet with a good knowledge of the Civil War, and of McClellen, Meade, Grant, Hooker, Burnside, Pope and McDowell. McClellen stated many times, that Lincoln could not hold on to a secret, and that was his reason for not keeping him informed. Also, many of the plans McClellen devised, were later used by Grant. Hooker built the Union Military up, and did a fantastic job of organization, from the bottom ranks up. Meade, did much of the work, that we give Grant credit for, ( though Meade did make the newspapers mad at him, and refused to name him)Lincoln is a very interesting man, but I feel it is a stretch to call him a master military strategist.If you enjoy reading someone elses view, or opinion of the Civil War, this is a really nice book. But, that is why I can only give it three stars, it is good, but too much of the authors opinion."},{"Title":"Lincoln and His Generals","review":"Williams notes in the preface of my 1952 edition that it is not about the Generals of the Union, but rather about Lincoln and his problems with the Union military commanders. While much of the text is dry details about this letter or that between Lincoln and his generals, the Williams does interject some bits of interesting facts and educated theories on why Lincoln often acted as he did. This is a well researched book, with most pages having between about 3 footnotes, and it is very helpful in understanding the political climate of the American Civil War."},{"Title":"Lincoln and His Generals","review":"There are so many people that dance across the stage of the Civil War. So many names come up again and again in the story, and its hard to know and remember each general's particular contribution and role in the War.This is a GREAT BOOK for explaining Lincoln as Commander in Chief and his relationship with EACH of the Generals along the way.This book is well written, and is GREAT for learning of the Generals and their style's.This book doesn't get bogged down in the boring minutiae of every little statistic along the way.BIG PICTURE, and how the Generals fit into Lincoln's plans.So many books get bogged down into this battle or that person and its hard to rise above and see that BIG PICTURE of how the war could be won.Lincoln had the big picture, and this book proves he was even a better strategist than his career military officers.If you're looking for a GREAT BOOK, about Lincoln's relationship with his Generals, and their style.......THIS IS THE BOOK. IT'S A MUST READ FOR YOU CIVIL WAR BUFFS.Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Lincoln and His Generals","review":"Although published some 50 years ago, Williams' book is a fascinating read of the relationships President Lincoln had with his various generals. While some were quite strained (McClellan, Butler, Pope), others worked quite well (Grant, Sherman, Thomas). Williams takes each relationship to show how Lincoln was truly a brilliant strategist who had a much firmer grasp of the North's true strategy of defeating and destroying Southern armies instead of the strategy of many Northern generals - just controlling territory.The narrative is smooth and flows freely and the writing style is simple without being simplistic. While other more learned students of the Civil War may have issues with some of the author's conclusions, I thought Williams was resonably sound in his analysis.The only problem I had with the book was the lack of maps. Granted, this book is a study of the relationship between Lincoln and his generals and the Northern command structure during the Civil War. However, in my humble opinion, having a few maps would have enhanced the reader's grasp of the strategy Lincoln was trying to implement during the war.Complaint aside, I heartily recommend this book as an excellent study. Read and enjoy!"},{"Title":"Lincoln and His Generals","review":"This is not a history of the war or a detailed description of the battles (see Foote's trilogy for that). It's just what it says it is -- a history of Lincoln's dealings with his generals.At the onset of the war, the US had almost no army, few weapons, no officers trained in large strategic warfare and an outmoded system of command. Lincoln himself had no real military experience. It took time and many blunders before Grant marched south in 1864 with a clear strategy for ending the war behind the most powerful, well equipped army in the world.Lincoln was highly intelligent and had an innate strategic vision that outclassed all of his generals (the prime objective was to destroy Lee's army, not capture Richmond). Lincoln took his commander in chief role seriously and often took an active part in the campaigns, at least before he finally found Grant. The strengths and (mostly) weaknesses of McClellan, Hallack, Buell, Fremont, Banks, Burnside, Hooker, Rosecrans, and others are explored in just the right amount of detail.While Williams concludes that Lincoln was our greatest war president, there is no hero worship in this book. He relies on facts, as shown by telegrams (Lincoln lived at the telegraph office during battles), letters, journals and memoirs. Lincoln wrote some wonderfully pithy telegrams, like the one to Grant as he was flanking Lee's army down to Petersburg (\\"Hold on with a bulldog grip, and chew and choke as much as possible\\").This book is very well written and moves along at a smart pace. It's certainly one of the best Lincoln books. Although out of print, I was able to get a new hardcover through Amazon."},{"Title":"The Place No One Knew: Glen Canyon on the Colorado (A Sierra Club-Ballantine Book)","review":"I'm at something of a loss to explain why I've been so moved by a place I never saw and (barring visionary leadership and luck) never will. I was born about two years before the diversion tunnels closed in 1963. I, and most likely you, never had a chance to know what was there.What was there was, quite simply, the most beautiful place in the world, and Eliot Porter's photographs make this abundantly clear. A calm Colorado River gently whisked travelers through nearly two hundred miles of Glen Canyon, past zebra-striped 2,000-foot walls and twisted domes and spires of bare rock. Dozens of old mining camps and thousands of Anasazi sites, pictographs and petroglyphs lined the banks. Hundreds of smaller side canyons branched from the river. Some opened into massive ampitheaters like Music Temple and Cathedral in the Desert. Others twisted and turned for miles into salmon-colored sandstone, the rock's convolutions hiding the sky from view. In spots you could span the width of a canyon 500 feet deep with your outstretched arms. These were canyons lush with moss and trees, watered by streams and springs and rich with wildlife - all in the heart of one of America's most forbidding regions, all accessible to anyone with a canoe or rubber raft and a week or two of extra time.Now all of this is gone. The reservoir has inundated almost every scene portrayed in Porter's photographs with hundreds of feet of water and mud. A few pathetic fragments of the canyon's beauty and solitude remain along the northern edge of Escalante National Monument, but all of its most magical places have been obliterated beneath a faceless sump of oily water across which houseboats rumble and jetskis roar.The NPS and Bureau of Reclamation harp upon the &quot;improved accessibilty&quot; afforded by the lake. They neglect to mention the inaccessibility of permanently submerged canyons and the financial cost of trying to explore Glen Canyon in its current lobotomized state. To leaf through this book is to know what we had - an incredibly beautiful place, of National Park caliber - and also to know that we threw it away for the sake of a few megawatts of electricity, a net annual loss of available water for downstream use and for the purpose of boosting gasoline and boat sales in Coconino County, Arizona.Perhaps there's an emotional explanation for being haunted by a place I'll never see - an outraged sense of having been robbed."},{"Title":"The Place No One Knew: Glen Canyon on the Colorado (A Sierra Club-Ballantine Book)","review":"I was expecting a reprint similar to the small-sized Ballantine issue of the late 1960s. I was surprised to receive a book almost as large as the original Sierra Club hardback! The color in several of the photographs is even better than in the original (and difficult to find/very expensive) book, thanks in part to the cooperation of the museum which received Porter's works as a bequest."},{"Title":"The Place No One Knew: Glen Canyon on the Colorado (A Sierra Club-Ballantine Book)","review":"I got a copy of Eliot Porter's Glen Canyon book after reading Edward Abbey's &quot;Desert Solitaire,&quot; a chapter of which is devoted to a downriver rafting trip along this stretch of the Colorado River just before the dam was built. While Abbey's descriptions are vivid, I wanted to see with my own eyes what he was describing. And Porter's camera is the closest you can get to doing that today.His pictures are, of course, not the real thing, but they are about as breathtaking as photography can be. The colors, textures, reflections, and the play of light and shadow are wonderful, and each photograph is distinctly different. His own description of the canyon's display of color and light in the introductory essay &quot;The Living Canyon&quot; give an instructive insight into the eye of the photographer. His awareness of what he is looking at and his ways of choosing to look help the reader to see even more in the 80 photographs that follow.While some of the photographs capture the monumental scale of the canyon walls and formations, many focus on the myriad surfaces that are revealed to the eye: erosion patterns, lichen, rippling water flow, the dark streaking mineral stains extending from seeps, the rough texture of weathered sandstone in glancing sunlight, smooth river stones, the layered stripes of exposed sediment, the trickling spread of water falling from overhead springs, the hanging tapestry coloration of the walls, whorled and striated rock, dry sand. There are also photographs of plants: moonflower, maidenhair fern, willow, tamarisk, redbud, columbine, cane. Above all, there is the rich array of colors, capturing a great variety of moods and attitudes.Porter was recognized for his photography of birds, and while there are no birds visible in these photographs, his introductory essay makes mention of them, and when looked at with that awareness, many of the pictures also seem to capture a sense of &quot;air space&quot; for flight. Before turning to photography, Porter was a Harvard professor of biochemistry and bacteriology, and it's interesting to see the somewhat dispassionate eye of the scientist in the way he uses the camera. While the story of Glen Canyon may induce sorrow or anger, the photographs are strong for their lack of sentimentality.The pictures also excite a curiosity about the geology of the river, and the book concludes with a short essay describing how the canyon walls reveal the geological ages that have gone into forming this part of the earth, going back millions of years. The book also includes a catalog of all the plants and animals that inhabited Glen Canyon before its inundation. Altogether, with its quotes from other writers, including Loren Eiseley, Joseph Wood Krutch, Wallace Stegner, and members of John Wesley Powell's expedition in the 19th century, this book is a fitting record of a great lost national treasure."},{"Title":"The Place No One Knew: Glen Canyon on the Colorado (A Sierra Club-Ballantine Book)","review":"These photographs are just about all that is left of Glen Canyon. After the Sierra Club and other environmentalists had lost the battle to prevent the Glen Canyon River Dam from being built, Eliot Porter took this extraordinary series of photographs to memorialize the gorgeous area that has been lost forever. Few people at the time knew much about the Canyon. It was too remote, too difficult to get to. Although it was one of the areas that John Wesley Powell found most beautiful in his first expedition down the Green and Colorado Rivers, no access roads or paths were ever built to make it possible for many people to view the areas firsthand. As a result, very few people knew precisely what we were about to lose.The tragedy is that these areas are really, truly are gone. Even if the Glen Canyon River Dam were magically removed, many of the areas viewed in these gorgeous photographs have already been silted up. The Green and Colorado Rivers carry extreme quantities of minerals, and when the dam stops the flow to form a reservoir, they tend to drop to the bottom. All dams have a limited life. They don't last for as long as one might imagine. Basically, they create a new landmass behind them over the course of a century or so. Many of the spots photographed in these pictures are now solid earth.One would hope that such beautiful photographs as these, photos that create tremendous longing for what we have already lost, would make us more concerned to preserve what is left. But with the current presidency even today as I write this review opening the national parks to snowmobiles and with people speculating that there will be new attempts to open arctic areas in Alaska to oil exploration, we can't assume that in the least. These photographs may end up being emblematic of all endangered areas, of the ongoing fragility of all of nature."},{"Title":"The Place No One Knew: Glen Canyon on the Colorado (A Sierra Club-Ballantine Book)","review":"\\"The Place No One Knew\\" is the famous book that comes up anytime someone mentions the submersion of Glen Canyon. It was the Sierra Club's--and the environmental movement in general's--first major statement on the construction of Glen Canyon Dam, the flooding of Glen Canyon, and the filling of Lake Powell.The book is a companion, or I should say the polar opposite, of \\"Lake Powell: Jewel of the Colorado,\\" a book by Floyd Dominy, then Commisioner of the dam-building Bureau of Reclamation.Both books are basically propaganda, though for seperate sides of the same issue; both feature scenic photos of a place, praising text, and pertinent quotes.Glen Canyon was referred as to \\"the place no one knew\\" because its lack of national park status (and protection) was a major factor in its being inundated by the trapped water of the Colorado River. In actuality, a lot of people knew it--just not many with the Sierra Club. In fact, more people rafted through Glen Canyon a year than did through the Grand Canyon. C. Gregory Crampton wrote ten books about Glen Canyon before its demise, and liked to joke that THIS book should have been called \\"The Place the Sierra Club Didn't Know.\\"Which would have been more correct.All that said, this book is a valuable historical document--for its role in the Glen Canyon controversy, and for its role in this century's environmental movement.But it's not that good of a book. The photos are below average: many have a grainy, low quality-feel to them, and most of them are of very small things, and fail to give the true scope and grandeur of what Glen Canyon was. They are not Eliot Porter's best work, and some of the photos aren't even of Glen Canyon, but of other red rock from other places in Utah. (That's true, believe it or not, and it's well-documented.)The quotes that accompany the photos are all right, but they're not amazing, they won't make you jump up.A far, far better book featuring photos of Glen Canyon is Eleanor Inskip's \\"The Colorado River Through Glen Canyon: Before Lake Powell.\\" Check it out.And a far, far better collection of Eiliot Porter's is \\"Eliot Porter's Southwest.\\" It's full of gorgeous black and white images from all over the Interior West."},{"Title":"The Place No One Knew: Glen Canyon on the Colorado (A Sierra Club-Ballantine Book)","review":"Glen Canyon is a 200 mile stretch of the Colorado, full of pristine views, side tributaries, canyons, buttes, bluffs, sheer canyon walls of beauty leading from Utah to the Grand Canyon and the Glen Canyon Dam which was constructed in the 1950's and early sixties closed the dam gates in 1963 to fill Lake Powell, behind the Glen Canyon Dam, with water up to a hundred feet deep all through Glen Canyon... Eliot Porter, a well-known color landscape photographer of the day, was able to get in early and preserve the scenery in photographic images, and he was the very first color landscape photographer in the world so this book published in the mid 1960's is priceless, both from a historical perspective of his color techniques of color dye transfer using three negative plates per image, to the historical view of government's dam mandates, without regard to the destruction of nature or the cutting off of water to the Grand Canyon. This book Eliot Porter was instrumental in having published, and beauty of the images he created, resulted in a huge public uproar in the late 1960's, the 1970's and the 1980's over the public's furor that the dam had destroyed Glen Canyon, had been created without public consult and without public hearings. It took a full 20 years for Lake Powell behind the dam to become full, and birds and wildlife were dying in the Grand Canyon as their habitats needing water were destroyed. This book should be required reading for any Environmental topics course. Eliot Porter's fame grew, world-wide when this book was published. His color techniques were very advanced from any known to photographers of that decade. Very few photographers were using color dye transfer for color landscape photography as Ansel Adams and black and white photographs for landscapes was still the rage of the decade. No one believed color photography would last. When this book was published in the 1960's it sold for $3.95 USD, because the publishers didn't think people would like it. Read it... and be as awed with this photography as I was... it is a historical masterpiece by Eliot Porter and contains an Acknowledgment right after the Forward, by David Brower of the Sierra Club, dated March 14, 1963, Berkeley, California.C.

It is literally a memorial to the death of Glen Canyon. It is a reminder of our obligation to stay informed.Glen Canyon Dam should never have been built and would never be built today. The American people would never stand for it. Ironically and sadly, it was the loss of Glen Canyon that inspired many to say, \\"Never again.\\" When the Bureau of Reclamation attempted to follow Glen Canyon Dam with a series of dams down stream in the Grand Canyon, the agency met a solid wall of opposition. In ways, the river still flows free through the Grand Canyon because of the sacrifice that was made with Glen Canyon.Even former staunch proponents of Glen Canyon Dam lived to regret their support. As late as 1974, Senator Barry Goldwater still felt the dam was an improvement over the untamed river. But by the mid-80s, he felt otherwise. In one interview, in fact, Goldwater lamented that if he could change just one Senate vote he'd cast in 30 years, it would have been his vote to approve construction of Glen Canyon Dam.Sad."},{"Title":"The Place No One Knew: Glen Canyon on the Colorado (A Sierra Club-Ballantine Book)","review":"This book brought back memories.

Eliot Porter did an excellent job of documenting a very picturesque place before its destruction."},{"Title":"The Place No One Knew: Glen Canyon on the Colorado (A Sierra Club-Ballantine Book)","review":"I missed Glen Canyon by about five years. By the time I first visited the area in 1968, it was Lake Powell. I was eighteen years old and I thought the ultramarine lake spreading through all that red rock was pretty cool. Having been born and raised in Pennsylvania, I did not have the experience or imagination to realize that what had been submerged by the dam and the lake was much more beautiful, more extraordinary, more magical and mystical.This book was part of my education. It's raison d'etre is 77 color plates taken by Eliot Porter during seven or eight trips to the Glen Canyon in the 1960's. Glorious as they are, they still comprise only feeble documentation of the beauty, magic, and mystery that was sacrificed to the then-prevailing mindset of re-shaping the earth via grand-scale technology in the name of amorphous Progress.Even now, almost fifty years later, the photographs are worth a trip to the library or purchase of this book. The colors are rich and vibrant, sometimes seemingly psychedelic. The thoughts kept crossing my mind: \\"Do such images really exist on this planet?\\" (or, more properly in most cases, \\"Did they really exist once upon a time?\\"), and \\"What an incredible eye Porter had!\\"But THE PLACE NO ONE KNEW is not perfect. The photos are on every other page, on the right-hand page of each two-page spread. On the facing left-hand page there is a quotation from such luminaries of the West and/or the conservation movement as Wallace Stegner, Henry David Thoreau, Aldo Leopold, Loren Eiseley, and William O. Douglas. (My favorite is the one from Frank Waters borrowed for the title of this review.) If a reader were to come across these quoted passages in their original context, many would indeed be noteworthy. Isolated and then strung together, however, they have been politicized and commercialized and they become precious and sappy.Also, for a book that purports to be a memorial of sorts to the now-defunct Glen Canyon, there are two odd things about the photos themselves. One is that some of the photos were taken OUTSIDE the area that was submerged. The other is that the photographs are so rich in color and many are so abstract (they are shot or cropped so that most are not obviously landscapes) that they have an otherworldly, almost timeless, immortal feel. While that is part of their grandeur and beauty, as a group they don't have the elegiac feel of the black-and-white photos of Tad Nichols, as published in \\"Glen Canyon: Images of a Lost World.\\" Thus, in the end, the book seems at bottom to be a collection of \\"art\\" photographs (not documentary photographs) assembled and marketed under a political conservationist banner."},{"Title":"The Place No One Knew: Glen Canyon on the Colorado (A Sierra Club-Ballantine Book)","review":"The Glen Canyon dam flooded possibly the most amazing stretch of the Colorado River.

The six projects--a horsie, a salamander, a sweater for a stuffed cat, a &quot;magical&quot; quilt, a &quot;secret code&quot; pullover sweater, and a whimsical knitted breakfast--are all attractive. My favorite part of the book is the photos of the young designers, and their individual stories about designing and making their projects.I teach knitting to 6-10 year olds. My students, most at the high beginner level, have been fascinated by the photos of the kids and their projects. Trouble is, the projects vary greatly in levels of difficulty, and this is not indicated in their respective descriptions. Of the six projects, my students could aspire to knit four of them, with some guidance. It is important for potential buyers to realize that at least two of the projects require intermediate to advanced skills.There is a slight flaw in the text, which provides basic knitting instructions and illustrations in the beginning. The knitted breakfast project requires the ability to make i-cords, yet instructions for making i-cords are not included in the text. This omission should be remedied in subsequent editions.Kids Knit is a nice inspirational booklet of what knitting kids are capable of, but not all knitting kids will be ready for these projects. A more comprehensive, and more useable book for teaching kids to knit is the excellent Kids Knitting (just a slight change in title) by Melanie Falick. Falick's book is just awesome!"},{"Title":"Cognitive Development (4th Edition)","review":"I am a personal growth coach who studied in the areas of biology, biochemistry, physiology and psychology.

One's ability to multi-task definitely grows with children. Ms. Ellison is able to pull together information from many, many sources and present a body of knowledge in an easy to read and understand format. Rather than thinking that \\"mothers\\" make poor employees and are unable to cope because of their \\"home\\" responsibilities this book should open eyes. And hopefully also show the advantages of being an involved parent."},{"Title":"The Mommy Brain: How Motherhood Makes Us Smarter","review":"Ellison's book assures us mothers that we're not nuts. There is indeed a scientific explanation for the temporary insanity that new mothers experience. But what follows as we begin to settle in to motherhood is even more fascinating, as evidenced by the research The Mommy Brain presents. Readers may be skeptical that intelligence in the book is defined in unconventional ways. But this is something educators now know--that not all intelligence shows up on an IQ test. Ellison's book lets you uncover all of a woman's smarts unleashed by motherhood."},{"Title":"The Mommy Brain: How Motherhood Makes Us Smarter","review":"The truth is that as moms we have many skills that improve with the birth of our babes. This book does an excellent job of highlighting all the research that points to the idea that moms' brains are ever evolving and making strides in learning and skills once we become parents. It describes how our perception improves which touches on all our senses (like your improved smelling abilities that begin at pregnancy), then to how we become masters at multitasking and keep a ton of information in our brains (where did that binky go), the ability to manage stress by calming ourselves and our little ones down, the motivation to keep caring for our children, and how our emotional intelligence improves with the need to connect with other moms (to survive). It is research heavy so I found myself skimming through some sections just to get to the final points of each section (we moms don't always have much time).If you're looking for other great books on motherhood, visit the website, allmomsareperfect.com and look under Motherhood books.

The advertising and sales via Internet,together with the exhibitions of toy soldiers, such as my site, will come even more to the forefront into the next century.The 220-page spiral bound book, contains articles which will provide the reader with much background into all aspects of our hobby. There one article from Jonathan on \\"Better Toy Soldier Modeling, Casting &amp; Painting\\" which has help helped me with my painting, simple tips, but things that I hadn't thought about.Both British and American plastics have historical articles that trace their rise in the 1950's and also Composition Figures are well covered in Jack Matthews pages covering Elastolin, Lionel, other manufacturers, types of figures and collecting hints. Heyde Figures also feature so this has been an awakening to me about this German manufacturer .I really enjoyed reading the pages on \\"Getting Started\\", \\"So You Want To Collect\\" and \\"Thoughts On Collecting\\", they are most relevant to all of us who are collecting, What era should I specialise in? What type of figures? Should I only collect one particular country, corps, pose, or age. The possibilties are endless, but read these pages and hopefully you may be able to rationalise your collection, or make it bigger!Britains is heading in a new direction, so you can meet the people who will be guiding it into 2000. There are interview with both the UK and USA staff so we can all get to know who is at the helm of the flagship of toy soldiers. I had not realised what had been going on behind the scenes but by reading the interviews you will appreciate the work that has and will be happening with the new releases of their figures.They wide use of images that have been well placed into all the articles are most relevant to the text, and enhance the content. They say, \\"a picture is worth a thousand words\\", so you are getting quite a coverage of toy soldiers from all around the world. I found the advertising very useful and as it gives many contacts to follow up if you are searching for a particular type of soldier or manufacturer. The Photo Picture Page are a great addition, I can put face to names that I read about, maybe it's a bit of a rogues gallery, but I leave it to you to see and comment.The extensive use of URLs and email addresses in the advertising has showed me how much the Internet is growing and it use in sales of toy soldiers. Many of the manufactures and suppliers and shops now have websites or email addresses. This means that you can sit in front of your computer and converse with the manufacturer, shop owner, or publisher and find out what is new, is it in stock, can you order it, all at the touch of a key pad. The comprehensive \\"Yellow Pages\\" Directory list not only dealers, stores and manufacturers, but also casting and suppliers, auction houses, restoration services and publications. They have been arranged by country, and classification, so it is very easy to check \\"Where is my closest supplier?\\", or \\"Who is the contact there?\\". One very useful page lists the time chart so you know what time to telephone, and includes the International Telephone County Codes (for those without email!)What more can I say, \\"get out and buy one\\" and see for yourself.I can recommend this book as a valuable resource to today's toy soldier collector."},{"Title":"The World Toy Soldier Directory and Compendium","review":"Everything a collector needs to know is in this book, and the price was a bargain."},{"Title":"The World Toy Soldier Directory and Compendium","review":"Everything a collector needs to know is in this book, and the price was a bargain."},{"Title":"Introducing Cultural and Media Studies: A Semiotic Approach","review":"Very good condition, postage and shipping process a bit slow and I was disappointed that the book was so cheap, but ended up costing nearly the same price of buying it new in a retail store because of the shipping charges, so I probably wouldn't buy something like that again."},{"Title":"Robert E. Lee","review":"Several generals of the American Civil war are enigmas, to various extents. Thomas J. (Stonewall) Jackson, for instance, is very difficult to read, because he left so little in the way of letters or whatever that tell you anything of what he was thinking. Robert E. Lee was equally close-mouthed about this sort of thing, and amazingly stiff and standoffish with most male acquaintances and friends, to boot. The result is that we know very little of what he thought or felt about a variety of things, and must piece together opinions from various sources.So it was with some trepidation that I approached the Penguin Lives version of Robert E. Lee. These are intended to be very short biographies: sketches rather than anything detailed. In addition to the fact that it's a short book, the series editor took a chance and commissioned Roy Blount Jr. to write the book. Blount is a Southerner (though he lives mostly in the North now) who writes newspaper columns and books, and is generally what's called a humorist. He also appears on the radio. This is (as far as I know) his first venture into real non-fiction (as opposed to funny stuff that's based on reality) and I'll admit I was some what curious and a bit apprehensive as to what he would do with the book. I needn't have worried.Blount is an accomplished writer (obviously) and does a good job of outlining Lee's life and career. He's also a Southerner, and understands the mystic attachment people of the south have for their culture and society, and recreates what things must have been like for Lee in the mid-19th century. The military aspects of Lee's life are dealt with only in outline (as you would expect in a book with ca. 170 pages of text, but they're explained in enough detail that you get the gist of what's happening. There's a fair amount of information on Lee's life, little of it new, but much of interpreted in a fashion different at least in nuance from previous biographers.Unusually, Blount relegates his speculation about Lee, his character, and such things as his sexuality, to an appendix labeled \\"Speculation.\\" This is very unusual in a biography, and I would encourage other writers to use a similar device. While I didn't agree with every one of Blount's judgments, I could see how he came to the conclusions, anyway. On that note, I enjoyed the book a great deal, and think it valuable, in spite of its small size."},{"Title":"Robert E. Lee","review":"This is the fourth Penguin Lives title I've read (the other three being Auchincloss on Wilson, Keegan on Churchill, and Johnson on Napoleon), and for pure biography, this one is the best of the four. Other reviewers who criticize the relative superficiality of Blount's analysis need to recognize that the Penguin Lives are not intended to be comprehensive, ground-breaking studies. That just couldn't be done in under 200 pages.No, these books -- essays, almost -- are introductions to, surveys of, key historical figures. The question shouldn't be, Did Blount give us all the answers about Lee? but rather, Has Blount painted a sharp enough portrait that we have a clear idea of who the man was, why he did what he did, and what impact his life had? I think the answer to that latter question is a decisive Yes.Unlike Keegan and Johnson, Blount is not a professional historian. But he's done a fine job with a subject all biographers admit to be a man very difficult to get close to. This fact in itself forms part of Blount's theme, as he explores the roots of Lee's famous reserve and inapproachability. He largely avoids pop psychoanalysis -- when he wades into those waters, he tells us he's doing so -- and his insights seem to make sense.I particularly appreciated the way Blount addressed the issue that defines (many, if not most) modern treatments of Lee: the question of whether he can justly be called a Great Man while having fought, if not explicitly for slavery itself, at least for a nation and a culture in which slavery played a central role. The fact that Blount sees nuances to the discussion, instead of making the absolute, unarguable, definitive statement \\"Lee = slavery = evil\\", may cause ideologues, or people who just don't know any better, to reject his reasonings entirely. But that would be their loss because this section, too, is rewarding reading.I said this book is good pure biography. That's because Blount is an excellent writer and storyteller, as well as a fine presenter and interpreter of facts. As a \\"humorist,\\" (I've always hated that term), he has a keen eye for the ridiculous, both in human behavior and in historians' more labored interpretations.So, no, this isn't a scholarly, definitive, biography that will become the new gold standard in Civil War Studies. But as a highly readable thumbnail portrait of one of the most loved and reviled, admired, misunderstood, and dare I say, greatest, figures in American history, I think it will be hard to beat."},{"Title":"Robert E. Lee","review":"Roy Blount, Jr. is an interesting choice to write the short biography of Robert E. Lee for the Penguin Lives series. Historians have had their chance and now it is Blount's and he makes good use of many of their interpretations, in addition to his selective, yet effective, use of primary sources. All the facts are in evidence and the details feel right. The narrative is straight forward and moves at a brisk pace appropriate to the small format of this impressive series of biographies. The usual witty style of the author breaks through on occasion and he lets his best self come out in the appendices, including one on the humour of Lee and Lee's attitude to slavery. A biography of Lee still suffers a little as Lee never seems to come across as colourfully as most of the Civil War leaders but the author does his best to provide his own colour commentary. A quick, interesting read."},{"Title":"Robert E. Lee","review":"Blount helps us understand the real Lee for a change, not the &quot;marble man&quot; admired and revered by simple Civil War buffs. Those looking for yet another breathless account of the same old stories will be intellectually overmatched by the insightful, sensitive and illuminating portrait Blount presents. A real contribution to understanding Lee, the Civil War, and the mindset which led the nation to and through that disaster."},{"Title":"Robert E. Lee","review":"Too much psychoanalysis and too little factual information. Almost 140 years after the Civil War and Blount searchs for personality quirks to define a complex and interesting gentleman, general and leader.I'm disappointed too in the general trend for many historians to ever search and highlight as much negative as they can about our historical figures, especially military leaders.It's easy to second guess and use modern beliefs to define the past. Blount (or anyone else for that matter go lead men in battle for four years) and then write your book."},{"Title":"Robert E. Lee","review":"Robert E. Lee remains one of the great heroic figures--and one of the great enigmas--of the Civil War era.A host of factors, from his own noble stocism and reticince, to his adoption as a symbol of reconciliation in the decades after the great war, have conspired to rob Lee of much of his humanity. More than 130 years after Lee's death, Roy Blount does a remarkable job of transfusing the blood of life back into the marble man.If you're looking for a comprehensive biography of Lee, Emory Thomas' might be a better choice. But if you're looking for a briefer sketch that manages to cover the outline of his life, while providing some insights to the upbringing, education and other factors that shaped his character, this book is an excellent choice."},{"Title":"Robert E. Lee","review":"The Penguin Lives series purports itself to be \\"A beautifully designed, innovative series of biographies pairing celebrated writers with famous individuals who have shaped our thinking.\\" Larry McMurtry on Crazy Horse. Thomas Keneally on Abraham Lincoln. And, unfortunately, Roy Blount, Jr. on Robert E. Lee. I'm wondering if Penguin assigned the biographies or if the writers picked their topics--I'm looking to place the blame here.Blount's bio of Lee is rambling (strange for a bio of less than 200 pages) and at times pointless. Its as if the task of distilling this giant of American history down to a couple hundred pages was so daunting that Blount just couldn't get his arms around it. He wades into Lee's life, seems to get hopelessly lost, realizes he's bumping into the space constraints of the series, and kills the man off. That's the good part.Then, he adds a couple of appendices. The first is called \\"Speculation\\" in which he psychologizes (badly and amateurishly) about Lee, quoting from a text on the psychology of gifted children and from contemporary letters regarding the erotic view of feet in the 19th century. It seems it all boils down to Lee's small feet, or to his mother's feet, or to women's feet in general, not sure and neither is Blount. Consider this passage: \\"Elvis (Presley) and his mother made a great deal over each other's feet, calling them 'sooties.' Did Robert (E. Lee) and his mother? We don't know. (P.180)\\" And we don't even know what character traits or flaws or strengths that Blount is ascribing to the small foot issue (apparently Lee liked to have his kids massage his feet in the evening--which explains I suppose his decision to send Pickett against the center of the Union line on the third day at Gettysburg.) Blount spends the better part of a page speculating on whether Robert Duvall will make a good Lee in an upcoming TV show. I guess it all lacks focus and that's what bothers me most--a time waster. I think Blount wanted to say something about Lee, something new maybe, something important maybe, but he never figured out what it was, so he fell upon Lee's small feet and Elvis's mother. Fortunately, I bought the book used.The second appendix is on Lee's sense of humor. A great deal of it is spent trying to explain a remark Lee made to some cronies regarding \\"pussyism.\\" Roy, as a humorist, should know, if you gotta explain it, it ain't funny. This section does, however, contain an interesting anecdote about a Lee letter to a friend that for while was taken as a confession of the murder of a Canadian lighthouse keeper, but was, in fact a joke on Lee's part about the killing of a snake.The third appendix is on Lee's views on slavery. He was apparently a reluctant slaveholder, receiving all of his chattel through inheritance. Blount sheds nothing new on this topic.If I go on any longer, I will have taken more space to decry this biography than the actual biography takes to present the life of Lee. I am hoping that some of the other \\"celeberated writers\\" manage better with their subjects."},{"Title":"Robert E. Lee","review":"I like the Penquin series of short biographies but this one was too much of a strange psychohistory. As other reviewers have pointed out, author Roy Blount seems to have a need to go into details 9at fairly great legnth) such as Lee's small feet and that he liked to play games with his children where they tickled his feet. First of all, I knew this because as a Civil way buff, I have read a lot about Lee so I come across such material. However, someone who knows less about Lee who is reading a very short biography would want to know more substance and less psycho nonsense in those few pages.There is not a lot of military history but, then again, this is a short book. Still, military history is basic to an initial understanding of Lee, therefore, perhaps Blount should have been more carefully in allocating scarce page space in this short book. In general, I have enjoyed reading short biographies of historical figures I am familiar with. I have read several biographies of Grant, for example, and I found two short biographies to be worthwhile in that in the few pages, they added insights. I suppose this book is OK for someone who knows nothing about Lee but it would be better to include more of the military and political facts. However, I found that it didn't really add much to my personal understanding of Lee."},{"Title":"Robert E. Lee","review":"I came away from this biography of Robert E. Lee feeling that the author didn't like his subject very much. It was almost like he wanted to prove that General Lee was just another man with more than his share of faults. He kept trying to pick Lee's personality apart and gave meaning to every gesture and casual comment that Lee had ever made. I felt that the historic facts in this book seemed accurate as far as I could remember from other things that I had read, but I also felt that there was not enough information given to substantiate some of the negative comments. He painted Lee as somewhat of a flirt, ignoring his wife, and being a cold and indifferent father to his children.If you want to read about General Lee, there are better biographies available."},{"Title":"Robert E. Lee","review":"I found this book to be very disappointing. Significant parts of Lee's life are poorly covered. The author seems to want to psychoanalyze Lee. Inordinate time is spend on Lee's realtionship with his mother (mostly conjuncture) and the flaws in his personality.This book is a very poor treatment of a great and complex man.If you want an insight in to Lee, don't buy this book."},{"Title":"Robert E. Lee","review":"This book is highly readable and fascinating in its insights. For a short biography, it is packed with information that one would not find in a more encyclopedia-type treatment. Blount's narrative style flows nicely and he includes enough humor to make the book sparkle. In fact there is a section at the end just on Lee's humor. Blount does a good job of explaining Lee's upbringing, marriage and early adult life, and especially his relationships with other people, both in and out of the military. By the time we get to the Lee's leadership in the Civil War, a great deal of his behavior and decision-making becomes clearer. Blount pays appropriate attention to Lee's considerable talents and achievements but also goes into the famous man's shortcomings and personality quirks. The result is a believeable picture of Lee that is, like with all other great people, a mixture of amazing abilities and personal failures. Along the way, Blount gives some fascinating vignettes of other memorable people such as JEB Stuart, US Grant, Stonewall Jackson, Lee's children and especially Lee's father Light Horse Harry Lee. I wish the book had told a bit more about Lee's life after the Civil War but to keep within the length limits of the short biography series, I'm sure that wasn't possible. It does give some interesting information on that five-year period, though. I enthusiastically recommend this book to anyone who is interested in Lee, the Civil War or the psychology of notable people under great historical pressures."},{"Title":"Robert E. Lee","review":"Obviously, to get a REALLY good idea of who someone was, one must read more than one biography, but Roy Blount, Jr.'s \\"Robert E. Lee: A Life\\" is a pretty good start for anyone who has slight trouble wading through the heavy stuff. It keeps a lighthearted air while still managing to be extremely informative. I learned some little things about Lee, which I hadn't heard anywhere else before, and it was presented in such an enjoyable fashion. I already have two people asking to borrow this book, and I'm confident that they will come out of it with no complaints, just as I have. Enjoy. There's no way you can regret this purchase."},{"Title":"Robert E. Lee","review":"I know little more about Robert E. Lee now than I did before reading this book. Unlike the other Penguin Lives I've read, this one does not fit much significant information into a compact book."},{"Title":"Robert E. Lee","review":"In the pantheon of American history, few figures are as elusive and unknowable as Robert E. Lee, the commanding general of the Army of Northern Virginia and the principal Confederate military leader in the Civil War. To try and encapsulate his life into one small, concise little book is pretty much impossible, but Roy Blount Jr. tries his best. And for that, he is to be applauded.Over the course of less than 200 pages, Blount examines Lee's life from his troubled past (Light-Horse Harry Lee, his Revolutionary War hero of a father, abandons the family and leaves his mother to raise their children), to his early military career (including brave missions for Winfield Scott during the Mexican-American War), up through his Civil War generalship and subsequent retirement to a small college to live out his last years. And Blount does it with the charm and wit that make him one of America's (and the South's) most treasured writers.Robert E. Lee, more a marble giant than a man in most other biographers' attempts, is fleshed out by Blount as a stoic, almost Calvinist man with some unusual attributes that make him more attractive than before. Blount does not try to apologize for Lee's decision to side with his state over the Federal Government, he also tries to illuminate Lee's human side with interactions with his children and various ladies other than his wife over the course of his life. The Robert E. Lee that emerges is a man who had a hard life, with little hope for more than a passing whiff of happiness, who saw his duty to his state and his class overreaching that of the nation he served so gallantly before. And he paid the price for that in the end.Blount is at his best when describing Lee's human side (such as his flirtations with other women, his relationships with his children, his care of pupils while in charge of West Point), and also in showing that Lee's military record during the Civil War was less than perfect. Indeed, the book focuses on what Blount calls Lee's \\"instinctive\\" generalship and how his inability to communicate with his subordinates cost him victory at Gettysburg. Lee's war is not a success in the end, but his image as a fatherly leader of his men helps to cement the postwar elevation to Godlike status among the defeated Southerners who clung to the ideals of the Confederacy.Robert E. Lee is too complex a figure to be summed up in the space of 200 pages, but what Blount does is provide a quick survey of his life and infuse it with enough detail to make for a great brief appreciation. In appendices to the main book, Blount also discusses Lee's humor (his fondness for a certain, almost obscene phrase a highlight) and his attitudes to slavery (Lee was sadly a product of his times, no matter how \\"kind\\" he may have been to his own slaves). Blount, a southerner himself, takes pains to show Lee in real terms, not as the demigod he has been promoted to in the wake of postwar nostalgia. Robert E. Lee was not an easy man to know, and Blount makes no attempt to act as if his is the \\"definitive\\" study. But through clever and interesting sidetracks into Lee's personality, Blount comes as close as anyone yet to getting a handle on the man behind the curtain, the real Robert E. Lee and not the myth.Roy Blount Jr., through the auspices of Penguin's Brief Lives series, gives us a portrait of Robert E. Lee than transcends the myth and looks at the facts behind the myth. The result is a man that emerges as a troubled and complicated leader of men whose failings had as much to do with his legend as his successes. Blount makes Lee human, something that other more esteemed historians seem to miss. For that, he should be commended. The Marble Giant comes alive, however briefly, and fans and detractors alike can find something to treasure in Roy Blount's honest appraisal of his life and times."},{"Title":"Robert E. Lee","review":"I am not familiar with the author, Roy Blount, from his previous writings, but I believe that he showed himself quite an able biographer with this latest edition of the Penguin Lives series. In some ways, his assignment was the most difficult of characters to study. Robert E. Lee is one of the more enigmatic figures in American history, but it is hard to say why he is not just a footnote instead of a figure of reverence, to some folks.Unlike, say Lincoln or Jefferson, he wrote very little beyond chatty personal letters and so we cannot study his writings and speeches to better understand his character and development (the exception is his often quoted statement of following his state of Virginia if she chooses secession or union. Curiously, those who mostly cite this statement fail to read the clause Lee also inserts of his belief that secession is doubtfully Constitutional. Blount gives the full quote). Unlike Grant and Napoleon, his orders of battle were usually vague and (on its face) uninspired (except when given to superior general such as Jackson, and Stuart, as has been noted in numerous other biographies and histories of the Civil War).Lee is noted for some spectacular victories, but he also can be recalled for equally spectacular failures and it is doubtful that his most famous strategies would have worked over more astute generals rather than McClellan, Burnside, and Hooker. Just imagine his splitting his army against Sherman, or Grant or leaving himself without a line of retreat against these gentlemen?But, Lee's endearment is mostly traceable to the paucity of insight into his character. He is there for everyone to read what they want to in his person. Blount takes this opportunity to speculate into Lee's psyche by considering the influence on him by his parents, one of whom was an American hero, but a neglectful-embarrassing father; the other a virtuous mother, but emotionally-physically dependent on young Robert. Blount is not a psychologist, but as opposed to other biographers with no significant psychological training (see e.g., Doris Kearns Goodwin's bio on Lyndon Johnson), he does not try to insert this form of speculation as fact. The bulk of this thesis is reserved for a section titled, \\"Speculation.\\"As a person with clinical training, I found his psychological notations perfectly reasonable. And let's face it, those who only see goodness and deity in Lee (see e.g., Jeffrey Shaara's pathetically simplistic \\"historical\\" novels) are also just speculating. There is little left that I can see to write about Lee. However, I think the more interesting question for future writing is the psychological, sociological, and anthropological aspects of those who use Lee as the symbol for a \\"pure\\" society that, in fact, never existed. To clarify, Blount does not attack Lee, he is simply seeking to understand Lee. The author seems to be an admirer of the general, but not blind with passion.I also recommend Tony Horwitz, \\"Confederates in the Attic;\\" Emory Thomas, \\"Robert E. Lee,\\" and especially, William Davis, \\"Look Away! A History of the Confederate States of American.\\""},{"Title":"Robert E. Lee","review":"The Penguin Lives series has shown that, in the hands of a good writer and clear-thinking historian, short, popular biographies can be really worthwhile. Roy Blount Jr's \\"biography\\" of Lee shows what happens when the task is taken up by a poor writer with no historical imagination, judgment, or gift for storytelling.Admittedly, Robert E Lee is a difficult subject to tackle. Blount seems to have despaired of the task early on and just given up. He is seemingly uninterested in History or in Lee and so turned instead to things that he WAS interested in (Freudian hypotheses about oedipal complexes and pop psychologizing about \\"the gifted child,\\" titillating Richmond gossip about parties and flirting with other peoples wives and daughters, 19th century attitudes towards feet as erotic, and interesting if not particularly insightful musings on the institution of slavery).To be fair, there are a few interesting facts and anecdotes to be gleaned here and there. But not enough of them to justify the roughly six hours necessary to wade through the caract of irrelevancies and intermittently awful prose. His descriptions of Civil War campaigns are so slapdash that I can't imagine anyone who was not already familiar with them gaining anything at all from Blount. With the exception of Stuart and Jackson, all of the players in the drama are faceless names. But then, there's very little drama in this telling and no useful historical analysis. If you're trapped on a train with nothing else to read, take a look at the last two appendices (on Lee's humor and his attitude towards slavery) then take a nap.I'm just glad I picked it up at a library sale instead of spending good money on it. I'll be a little more discriminating about this series in the future."},{"Title":"Robert E. Lee","review":"ROBERT E. LEE is a brief, anecdotal biography of the Confederate general. Very little of the information is new. Blount also psychoanalyzes Lee, plus whines that Lee doesnt comply with 21st Century politically correct standards.Blount isnt qualified to psychoanalyze anyone."},{"Title":"Robert E. Lee","review":"Well, Blount gives us the biography of Robert E. Lee and then some. Blount tries to give us the psychology of Lee and tends to put the focus off Lee when he does this. I am sure Blount is a real good cynic, but Robert E. Lee and the Civil War need better than this. When you do a biography of a great man like Lee, why spend excessive time talking of his tiny feet. For that matter, why talk about a joke called Pusyism and then spend ten or more pages reviewing this. (Pusyism was a movement in the Church of England, instilling more Roman Catholic traditions into the church, such as unmarried priests and the lead proponent was Father Pusy). Blount focuses on this an awful lot, when he should expand on Robert E. Lee.Blount does an alright job reviewing the personal life of Robert E. Lee. However he does very poorly in analysis of his professional life and focuses a great deal on areas not relevant. I would have loved to have had Blount's opinion of the relationship between Lee and Davis, but sadly this is missing. What we get is jokes about feet and Pusyism. Jeepers, I could have done better with another book about Lee, by somebody more professional like Burke Davis."},{"Title":"Robert E. Lee","review":"A nice little overview of Lee's life is marred by Blount's incessant, cynical wit. The tone of the book is basically &quot;Hey everybody, check out this guy Lee - what a square he is!! And these people in the 19th century - weren't they silly?!?&quot;If that kind of history appeals to you, then go for it."},{"Title":"Robert E. Lee","review":"This work is enjoyable although not exhaustive as it was not meant to be. The author should have stopped at page 163 as appendix's I, II, and III were a bit rambling and boring."},{"Title":"Robert E. Lee","review":"this book was a basic biography of one of the greatest men in history. I learned a lot about Lee's non-war years in this book but I felt the author looked at some things and made them out to be more then they truely where. So what if Lee liked to have his feet tickled it doesn't make who he is I like to make my self sneeze does that change who I am no so some of he things looked into are kind of stupid and he talks about them for way to long.This is a good book though because you do learn about Lee also as another reviewer states the appendixes are kind of rambling and probably could do with out them all together."},{"Title":"Robert E. Lee","review":"This book fails Gen. Robert E. Lee.It's noble in intent and confused in reality; like the Confederate army, half of which deserted, it greatly misses its full potential; like Lee's ability to overawe Northern generals, the topic seems to have overawed Blount; and like the Confederacy itself, it's a sadly flawed effort in defence of a doomed cause. In other words, it's a fitting portrayal of the Slave-ocracy itself, all smoke and mirrors and little substance. People who live off the labour of others are rarely noble, decent, competent or useful; that is why the Confederacy failed, not due to the shortcomings of General Lee or any of his soldiers.Again and again, Blount approaches fatal flaws in Lee's character and comes away uninspired; he writes \\"Lee was a great defensive general but on offense he got away with murder.\\" It's an astute assessment. But he doesn't suggest the outcome had Lee fought a solely defensive war instead of wasting his best troops in futile attacks.Even his assessment of Lee as a \\"great defensive general\\" can be questioned. At the start of his long retreat to Appomattox Courthouse, Lee had 64,000 troops. He inflicted 63,000 casualties on Union forces; but, at Appomattox, his army was less than 10,000. Lee lost 53,000 men, or 83 percent of his army. Had the Germans lost the same proportion in Normandy in 1944, World War II would have ended by Thanksgiving.Blount touches major issues again and again, then retreats without a single thought. He spends more time psychobabbling about Lee's shoe size, a 4 1/2 C, than discussing Gettysburg. Surely, in a 206-page book about one of the great flawed figures of American history, there is more intellectual depth than to report, \\"We have no evidence that Lee and his wife, Mary, ever massaged each other's feet.\\"\\"No one has ascribed any psychological significance to this socks fixation,\\" Blount writes later about Lee's complaint that his wife sent only 64 pairs of socks, instead of 67 pairs. Although his soldiers often subsisted on mule meat and green corn, Blount can't find any psychobabble to explain Lee's order to have a soldier at Antietam shot for carrying a \\"stolen\\" pig. But he explains in great detail Lee's murder of a Canadian \\"snake\\" early in his career.When it comes to pure babble, Blount says Lee's joining the Confederacy \\"is one of the most famous American decisions.\\" So, he compares it to the purely fictional decision by Huck Finn to help Jim, a runaway slave, to escape. Such insight is surely equivalent to saying Roosevelt's action after Pearl Harbour was inspired by Superman's decision to save Gotham. This is history? Or is it Blount's sense of humour, testing the acumen of readers hoping for anything more serious.Having wrapped up Lee's life in 163 pages, perhaps the strangest element is three Appendix afterthoughts that fill up the otherwise blank space from page 165 to the end. Maybe those pages should have been left blank for readers to fill in their own notes, observations and ideas. Or he could have psychobabbled about 'General Lee', the Dukes of Hazard car.Regardless of anyone's opinion of him, Lee deserves better."},{"Title":"Philip the Fair and Boniface VIII: State Vs. Papacy","review":"Nowadays, the Pope is typically seen as a benign figure, even by those who do not share his beliefs. Well, Wood's collection of essays about an earlier pope, Boniface 8, and his dealings with Philip the Fair of France, is a jarring reminder of an earlier era. When a pope wielded real secular power, as a de jure monarch in his own right.The rise of Benedict Gaetani to the Papacy in 1294 is chronicled. He is described as an ambitious schemer, amongst other appelations. Attracted to the office's power. But the book then describes how during his reign, his miscalculations greatly weakened the Vatican. Inadvertantly, he aided the rise of various nationalisms."},{"Title":"Campaigns of the One hundred and Forty-sixth Regiment, New York State Volunteers,: Also known as Halleck's Infantry, the Fifth Oneida, and Garrard's Tigers;","review":"This book was of high interest based on a family connection to the regiment.Great content, but this soft cover edition is not a high quality reproduction. Pages seem copied by xerox, don't even fill the page, fuzzy print and pictures, and bleed through on to the back of some pages. Throughout the book there are blank pages. (They do warn about some of that at the front of the book).I was disappointed in the quality, and then out of the blue found a used hardcover version.

In his introduction Bernstein makes the claims that Jewish mothers are like all other mothers but only more so, that is in the caring, worrying, pushing end of things. It was interesting to hear the mother of Bob Dylan stand up for him and for whatever turn he happened to take, religious-wise, or any other wise.This stuff especially consider the great weight of most of the personalities included is 'fluff' but it is pleasant fluff. It is also nice that Bernstein has a chapter on his own mother who he pays tribute to."},{"Title":"'LONDON MIDLAND, THEN AND NOW'","review":"A logical follow-up to GWR then and now, this book focuses on the former LMS, but omitting the S as it only covers England and Wales. Although by a different author, the format is essentially the same.For this book, the author took a selection of old photographs of scenes in and around railway stations and attempted, with the help of other photographers, to re-photograph the equivalent scenes in December 1994 and the first two months of 1995. The original photographs are mainly from the fifties and early sixties but some are older and a few are much older. The author and his assistants found that it wasn't always possible to re-photograph from the original locations for a variety of reasons. Sometimes it wasn't physically possible because of re-development or because trees blocked the original view. At other times, the original location had become part of private land from which permission to photograph was unobtainable, although such permission was apparently given most of the time. With these caveats, this book shows how things have changed - sometimes dramatically, sometimes not at all. All the pictures are in black and white, which is fair enough because the originals would be mostly in black and white. To make a proper comparison, it is therefore necessary to show the more recent pictures in black and white too.Although this is mainly a photographic book, the text is interesting and informative, sometimes pointing out things that are not immediately apparent from the photographs and at other times pointing out the common reference point in both photographs, which may be just a single building or a line of trees. Of course, in a lot of cases the changes are less dramatic. Often the biggest change is in the trains themselves, with the original photographs featuring steam locomotives and the more recent ones featuring diesels. Many of the newer photographs don't feature a train at all (even where this could have been done) because, with all the standardization that has taken place, there are very few classes of either locomotives or multiple-unit stock. Photographs without trains are sometimes more effective at showing what has changed. Of course, there are some locations where the trains no longer run anyway and these provide some of the most interesting contrasts. The author makes clear that he preferred to focus mainly on locations where trains still operate (even though in some cases the actual station has vanished) but he has nevertheless included a reasonable selection of other locations. I suspect that if Paul Atterbury were to do a similar project, he would include a much higher proportion of locations from lost lines, but it's all a matter of personal preference.The book is divided into sections, each covering a different constituent of the old LMS, beginning with the old LNWR, which gets 73 pages compared to 72 for the old MR. At the start of each section there is a brief history of the pre-1923 company together with some commentary on how much survives from its heyday, including where you can find preserved steam locomotives as well as what remains of the commercial network. My only disappointment is that no maps are included. I suppose they aren't essential but they would be helpful. I can always go to the reference library if I want to look up a map of the old network but it's still inconvenient.Looking at the photographs then and now as a whole, it is easy to see the effect of the declining importance of trains during the second half of the twentieth century. Apart from the stations and lines that no longer exist, freight yards and some station platforms have disappeared, some other lines have been reduced from double to single track, station track layouts have been simplified. Since this book was published, British trains have become more popular with passengers, perhaps due to road congestion, and it may be that the end of the twentieth century marked a low point in railway traffic. If so, this book will provide a permanent reminder of that low point. Yet there is one other contrast that is worth noting. Despite the increased air of dilapidation and decay, the trains, stations and other buildings in the more recent photographs are generally much cleaner than those in the earlier photographs.The most dramatic comparisons occur where trains no longer run or where radical changes have been made to stations, or where marshalling yards and other freight handling facilities have disappeared. The author nominates Normanton (in Yorkshire) and Manchester as locations showing the most dramatic changes and among those places where trains still run, there aren't many more startling contrasts. Nevertheless, I suspect that quite a few people would nominate London Euston before and after its modernization in the sixties. Lessons seem to have been learned as the modernization of St Pancras for Channel tunnel services, carried out since this book was published, is much more sympathetic. Stavely (on the Windermere branch) had its attractive station building replaced by a bus shelter, while Windermere itself has had its station moved to allow the old site to be sold for redevelopment. Of course, some of these sites (not just St Pancras) may have undergone further change since these photographs were taken.One of the featured locations no longer served by trains is Grassington in Yorkshire, where houses now occupy the land. The author was able to solve a resident's mystery, explaining why his garden contains lots of ballast.This is a fascinating book that should interest historians and railway enthusiasts alike."},{"Title":"Ordaining Women: Culture and Conflict in Religious Organizations","review":"Mark Chaves book looks at the ordination of women from a different angle than other books on this topic that I have read in my 20 years as an ordained woman in a mainline denomination. He helps to clarify the confusion that some ordained women have felt after spending years in school training for ministry and then finding that congregations are hesitant to call us as pastors or downright against the idea. Chaves shows how much of the impetus for ordaining women came from outside of the church itself and originated in the surrounding culture that was moving, however slowly at times, toward equity for women. The book is well thought through and ably presented. I highly recommend it to any persons interested in the current state of leadership in the church in North America."},{"Title":"A Banner with a Strange Device: A Novel","review":"I have kept my decades-old copies of \\"A Banner With a Strange Device\\" and its sequel, \\"The Seacoast of Bohemia\\" through many purges of my bookshelves. Needless to say, they're among my favorite novels. They're basically concerned with the relationships among a group of young people-- the youngest is 19 when the story begins-- mostly graduate students and medical students, in post-WWII Boston. These novels have a LOT of dialogue, but the characters seem so real to me that I don't mind when an entire chapter is taken up by two of them taking a walk and talking (usually about their relationship or about some other character). There is too much (stilted-seeming) discussion of literary matters among the English grad students, but other than that, the dialogue rings true. And the characters grow (at least a little). If you are a woman over, say, 50, who can tolerate a novel with little plot (but love, pre-Pill sex, death, childbirth and pre-Women's Lib angst) take a chance on Debbie, Sally, Matthew, Mike, Dudley and the other inhabitants of these books.

Vanderbilt has had a life that reads like a preposterous soap opera. Goldsmith details all of it, particularly the notorious custody trial in which Gloria's paternal aunt, Gertrude Vanderbilt Whitney, battled Gloria's notorious mother for custody. The fact that the focus of this well-publicized battle was just a single little girl too often is forgotten. This book is a thorough look into a fascinating footnote to history, and a glimpse at the lifestyle of America's richest family from the Gilded Age through the early years of the 20th Century. LITTLE GLORIA is required reading for students of American social history."},{"Title":"Little Gloria ... happy at last","review":"Barbara Goldsmith has combined highly extensive research and interesting insight to produce a book which is thought provoking as well as entertaining. Sad though the situation of the trial is, the book does not focus entirely on the court battle, but gives a thorough picture of the worlds of wealth in the early twentieth century - both of the mega-rich and caf&eacute; society variety.In relation to 'little Gloria' herself, Goldsmith's presentation is grounded in a theory that Gloria could not coherently express, yet was totally dominated by, a fear of kidnapping, in light of the Lindbergh incident. Throughout, I found myself puzzled as to why none of the adults pursued the reason for her terror. The endless medical nightmares which this child endured, largely because of her nurse's obsessions, were all the more tragic because no one grasped the underlying fear. Though the author is open about this being speculation, and containing elements she grasps because of being of the same age group, her presentation is very plausible.The work as a whole is an amazing portrait of the lavish, ostentatious, sordid but secretive world of the very wealthy. 'Big' Gloria seems flighty and narcissistic, yet one can be hang jawed that this young widow married into a family, with wealth that can hardly be matched by today's standards, which left her to auction her belongings and plead right of dower with the state of New York - assisting her would have been an easy matter that would have certainly been far from a hardship, yet they spent ostentatiously and cared nothing for others.Goldsmith does not speculate beyond the theory that little Gloria feared kidnapping. For example, she quotes the testimony of the accusation of a lesbian affair on \\"big\\" Gloria's part, but without any embellishment. Many questions are left unanswered, but I found this wise rather than evasive.The reader receives a picture of the era in many varieties - royalty, 'old money,' the emerging caf&eacute; society. The thoroughness was totally intriguing."},{"Title":"Little Gloria ... happy at last","review":"If you like historical biography, this one is a gem. It's a better story than any soap opera, Hollywood drama, or Aaron Spelling miniseries could come up with. In the early twentieth century, dictatorial Naney Morgan pushes her three pretty daughters to marry well. Daughter \\"Big Gloria\\" obligingly weds a playboy heir to the Vanderbilt fortune, who quickly succumbs to the effects of too much partying, but not before he fathers a daughter, \\"Little Gloria\\" Vanderbilt. Living on the income from her daughter's trust, \\"Big Gloria\\" builds a new life for herself (her twin sister having become in the meantime the wife of an English lord and eventually, the mistress of the Prince of Wales). Naney and faithful nanny Dodo take care of Little Gloria while her glamorous young mother travels and parties with wealthy friends.All goes well until \\"Big Gloria\\" falls in love with the wrong man, a German prince who wants to marry her. Terrified that Little Gloria's fortune will fall into foreign hands (and be out of her own control), Naney enlists the help of Little Gloria's aunt, Gertrude Vanderbilt Whitney. Uber-rich, powerful Mrs. Whitney is a closet lesbian, a sculptress, a lover and patroness of artists, and accustomed to having control of a situation at all times. Mrs. Whitney sets out to get custody of Little Gloria on the basis of Naney's allegations that Big Gloria is an unfit mother with (of all things) lesbian tendencies. The resulting court action and its outcome traumatized both Glorias for years.The history of both the Morgan and Vanderbilt families is interestingly and colorfully told. The saga of Gertrude Vanderbilt Whitney's life is especially detailed and clearly shows how she matured into the powerful, autocratic dowager she was at the time of the custody battle for Little Gloria. The book is very easy to follow, even with the large number of characters and locales. If you are planning to read Gloria Vanderbilt's own books on her childhood, such sa \\"Once Upon a Time\\" or \\"Black Knight, White Knight\\", I strongly suggest you read this book first, as Vanderbilt's own books are told in first-person stream-of-consciousness that makes it almost impossible to understand what is going on if you don't already know the story."},{"Title":"Little Gloria ... happy at last","review":"Little Gloria is a detailed family biography - very, very interesting to read!

But his latest housekeeper/nanny is Marta, a Ukranian who barely speaks English. She is an unhappy exile from her homeland, and is sad because the kitchen has no \\"good place\\"-- an altar with candles and an icon of Mary and the Infant Jesus. At home, the kitchen would have been a warm and cozy place with a candle-lit icon twinkling with little jewels in a dim corner.For some reason, Marta's inchoate expression of her homesickness touches Peter, and he goes about making an icon for Marta. The story of how he finds materials to make the icon including foiled toffee wrapper \\"jewels\\" is a great little adventure and the puzzlement of Peter's parents, who have written him off as cold and strange is delightful.

Gregory and Janet aren't sappy or spoiled. They are a bit neglected by their parents though and as a result are remarkably self-reliant and what we now call \\"proactive.\\"The children, especially Gregory, are worried their current maid/cook/etc., an immigrant from the Ukraine called Marta, isn't happy and will leave, as so many of the previous \\"help\\" did. Marta thinks their modern kitchen is rather cold and she tells the children of the custom in her Ukrainian home to have a devotional nook with a special kind of icon. Gregory, who is a withdrawn, aloof young fellow, decides to find a picture for Marta like she had at home. He and Janet range farther afield in London than they have parental permission to do. They visit museums and shops to further this quest. They suffer some setbacks and have to stretch their ingenuity. Gregory is the artistic one while Janet provides back-up for her usually reticent brother and sometimes suggests practical ways to overcome a hurdle. Gregory's determination to give something truly special to Marta transports him from his isolation to a a more social orientation. He learns that giving is loving and that creating something beautiful and meaningful requires commitment and sacrifice.THE KITCHEN MADONNA is a forty-five-year-old tale that has lost none of its charm and purity. Told unsentimentally but with precision and a touch of urban enchantment, it is as much, if not more, for adults as for children. It illuminates, as so many of Godden's books do, a resounding goodness that human beings carry inside but need a prod to develop. This is a golden piece of fiction.By the way, I read the edition with the original drawings by Carol Barker, and I thought they flawlessly, colorfully accompanied the text."},{"Title":"The Kitchen Madonna","review":"Shy, possessive and tired of changes, Gregory is attached to the family's housekeeper, Marta.

In that sense, it is dated.Having said that, I thought it was a touching story about a boy (and his sister) who seem to come to life as they go about making a creative collage, involving various adults in their project along the way, so they can show their affection to their beloved nanny.As an adult, I enjoyed the story very much.

It takes place in our time shortly after Dom and Honor (the hero/heroine of Heaven's Rogue) are spirited back to Renaissance Italy. Time has progressed six years in there, to 1505. Dom and Honor are the parents of two lovely children, a young daughter who is very ill, and small son.The present:Former Police officer Nick Escavido (a major side character in Heaven's Rogue) no longer believes in heroes. He'd followed his conscience and it has cost him his wife, his job, and his faith in the system and in God. No, Nick doesn't believe in angels either, though his brother Ernie insists he's seen one. Their other roommate, Dom's descendant Rafe, could back Ernie up but he doesn't want to talk about it.In spite of everything Nick has still has a good heart. He is his younger brother's self-appointed protector. Ernie is a scholar not a fighter and who because of his alternative lifestyle and slighter build is an easy victim. Nick is worried about Ernie delusions and is on the brink of getting professional help for him.Ernie has been having troublesome dreams regarding Honor. She is pleading to him for help. Her daughter is gravely ill. Isabella, the chatelaine of Castello di Giovanni has attempted to heal the child with her herbal remedies, to no avail. Honor is depending on Ernie to find a way to deliver modern medicines to this day gone by.Ernie has spent his entire inheritance on a \\"magic\\" mirror and Nick is deeply worried. His worry turns to shock and wonder as an angel appears and the mirror changes shape. His brother leaps in eagerly and Nick is not fast enough to prevent it. Nick is at a loss as to what to do, but the angel allows him to see what is about to occur. Ernie is in grave danger. Poor Ernie is about to be run to ground by a knight on horseback sporting a large lance. Without hesitation, Nick does what come naturally. He follows to defend his brother.Renaissance Italy 1505:Imagine Nicks surprise when he unseats the knight to find not a ferocious warrior but a stunning young woman. He is even more surprised at the instant chemistry between them. Isabella has enemies though, and is not inclined to trust him. Because of her friendship with Honor and Dom and her love for their sick daughter, she takes Nick and Ernie to see them. This makes a believer out of Nick but he still doesn't want to be a hero. Heaven, however, has a different plan. Ernie is in his element in this age of enlightenment.Even after her friends vouch for the brothers, Isabella is not sure she wants to trust Nick. He is still a threat - to her independence!Isabella Catherine Giovanni is a woman born ahead of her time. She is strong and independent. She alone has protected her lands and her younger brother from the threat of Luccio Landucci an ally of the hated de Medicis. Landucci is power hungry and evil. He will stop at nothing to acquire Giovanni lands and Isabella. Isabella has no wish to be a man's possession. She does not expect to ever wed, but if she did it would be to a man could view her as his equal. She does not believe such a man exists. Nick inspires altogether different feelings in her. He seems to respect her but his protective instincts could be an obstacle to a relationship. Nick knows he must soon return to his own time and begins to wonder if Isabella could be happy with him there. Before Isabella can give him her complete trust, another occurrence makes the decision for her. For the two to be truly happy Nick must learn to believe in heaven, heroes, and the power of love.I enjoyed this story very much. It was a very complete story but left room for a third story about Dom's descendant Rafe who did not appear much in the story but showed a definite uneasiness about the mirror in Ernie's room, and he's also been restless of late. I hope Ms. Shannon will write a story for him. I love big tough, vulnerable heroes and Rafe has definite potential. Besides I think he need to be a hero again to feel good about himself. I have heard whispers of a possible futuristic tale for him, so keep you fingers crossed."},{"Title":"Heaven's Hero (Romance of the Millennium)","review":"A great sequel to Heaven's Rogue!

H.G. Wells appealed to the most fantastic parts of my imagination, and he still does. As a kid, I also read this book once, \\"In the Days of the Comet,\\" but I don't remember being quite as impressed.As an adult however, I have re-read \\"War of the Worlds\\" and \\"The Time Machine,\\" and while I still enjoyed them, found them to be more along the lines of paperback thrillers. When I re-read this book, however, I found a treasure.This book tells the story of a world changed by a comet--a comet that passes by the earth and allows everyone to see themselves and one another as they truly are. It affects everything from relationships, to the structures of towns, to how people look at one another. It allows the world to become truly socialist in a non-political way. It shows the world as what it could be if only everyone viewed one another as equally important as one's self. It is not a political manifesto, because by its very premise it suggests the impossibility of such a wondrous happening and of such a change. It is not a violent, dynamic book that hurtles itself forward the way \\"War of the Worlds\\" and \\"The Time Machine\\" do--it is a gentle, thoughtful look at people, at people's motivations, at the problems of the world, and at a wish to be better than we have been.It is also astoundingly well written. That's what hit me the most about it. It is full of powerful phrases, poetic sentences, and clearly expressed ideas and metaphors. As an adult, I recommend this book as one of Wells's very best.It's a treat that I plan to re-read yet again."},{"Title":"In the Days of the Comet","review":"H.G. Wells was a known socialist for much of his life, although his opinions seemed to have change after the rise of the Stalinist Soviet Union. This book, with the misleading title, is NOT science fiction in the classic sense. However, this 1906 Wells' work is clearly an effort by Wells to show why the world should become socialist. He constantly ridicules the capitalist world by pointing out how capitalism breeds social classes which in turn breeds an unequal lifestyle among human beings. The rich get all the benefits of life, while the poor are left in squalor. Perhaps Wells' best illustration of this comes late in the book when the mother of the main character tells how her daughter died because she couldn't afford to pay the doctors who demanded their fee up front. Wells' also tries to convince the reader that socialism will not mean an end to the family, although it apparantly will mean the end of the single family home, all of which are destroyed in several! English cities by the socialists in this book. In fact, Wells claims people will find true love as a result of socialism because people will no longer think they are better than others. If you are looking for something in the realms of WAR OF THE WORLDS, THE INVISIBLE MAN or THE TIME MACHINE, this book is not for you. If you are a die-hard Wells fan you will probably enjoy this look into Wells' socialist ideas."},{"Title":"In the Days of the Comet","review":"I thought that I was familiar with most of Well's body of work, until I stumbled over this unique novel.First of all, do not be put off by the first part of this book- it is intended to be depressing. It is meant to paint the pettiness, ugliness, and just plain bloody-mindedness of human society in 1906. It does this quite well for I almost set the book aside several times in disgust. It is all unpleasantness after unpleasantness in the life of a working class young man (obviously modeled largely after the author's youth.) Even the fact of the approach of the great comet is almost mentioned only in passing as a minor occurrence.Then everything changes when the comet hits. Mankind is transformed. That is to say that all of mankind is suddenly mentally and spiritually enlightened and awakened. I've read nothing quite like it in literature. The first part of the book makes it jump out at you all the more. All the meanness, pettiness, guile, and evil evaporate in the human species. The story of how these enlightened men put an end to want, injustice, and war around the world is breathtaking and inspirational. Wells attributes this to a chemical change in earth's atmosphere, but there is a surprising amount of spirituality also incorporated (surprising for Wells.)All of this reminded me of the change that is said to occur when a human soul leaves the material world and enters the astral. All of the old heaviness and stupidity drop away. Only the highest of what it means to be human remains- the old ego dies. Even in the story everyone speculated if perhaps they were not dead and transported to a different world. Some even declared that this great Change was the Second Advent.There is one thing about this novel that leaves a lingering element of disappointment. This is the fact that the core causes of all the economic, social, and political injustices and stupidities described in the first part of the book in 1906 are still with us. After 101 years these same problems are still with us. I'm sure that this would have also disappointed Mr. Wells."},{"Title":"In the Days of the Comet","review":"An extremely verbose book on the social and political issues between the Boer War and World War I in England with a solution to the world's problem via the green mist left by Earth passing through a comet's tail. I truly enjoyed the movie renderings of \\"The War of the Worlds\\" (the first version with Gene Barry), \\"The Time Machine\\" and \\"First Man on the Moon\\"; but I am let down by the wordiness of this novel and hope my reading of \\"War of the Worlds\\" and \\"Time Machine\\" do not do the same."},{"Title":"In the Days of the Comet","review":"Next to War of the Worlds and The Time Machine, this book isn't nearly as well known. I enjoyed the book, but can see why it doesn't have the popularity of the other two, as much of the book is an extended discussion on the politics of the day, and especially the socialist views of one of the main characters, who is basically Wells's mouthpiece. Much of the time is spent with the two main characters, one of whom is an astronomy buff who is tracking the comet, and the other his politically fevered friend, who spends much of the time ranting to his geek buddy about politics while his friend painstakingly goes about his comet-tracking work and patiently listens.I also have to admit I found all the discussion and detail about Leadford (the socialist friend) and his relationship with his beloved Nettie pretty dull stuff also. While this does serve as the romantic interest in the book (and there is some discussion of sex, too) I still found these passages pretty dull sledding. After all, this is still Victorian England, and so you're not exactly getting Henry Miller's Tropic of Cancer here. :-)The book does have a dramatic backdrop and setting, taking place during a global war and a worker's uprising, although most of the action doesn't have anything to do with that. With the war already on, the appearance of the comet is like another dreaded omen, creating further apprehension about the possible fate of the world and humanity. When this book was written almost 100 years ago, WWI was still in the distant future. But the universal conflagration in the book is reminsicent of what was to transpire only a decade later. But if you're looking for the sort of action one finds in War of the Worlds or the wonder of the time machine and the drama and tension of the class struggle between the Eloi and the Morlocks in that book, this isn't it.The book has a positive ending though, as the earth passes through the comet and the entire population of the earth becomes briefly comatose. When they awake, humans are transformed; they are peaceful and no longer aggressive and warlike (truly a forlorn fantasy if there ever was one, but oh well, one can hope), the war is ended, and even the crime rate almost drops to zero. (I want to know if we can bring such a comet over here right now).Overall, still a good Wells read, but if you haven't read the other two more popular books, I'd read those first, or even The Food of the Gods. Then you could pick this one up after that if you wanted."},{"Title":"In the Days of the Comet","review":"H.G. Wells had a strong streak in him of the social reformer. This relatively early work, from 1906, shows that more clearly (if ham-handedly) than any other work that I've read by him.It starts with a snapshot of Dickensian dichotomy between haves and have-nots. Haves, in this case, are so rare and distant that they can safely be ignored. Instead, the narrator is one of the underclass, worrying whether his shoes will fall apart before the end of his day's walk. Malnourished, marginally educated, and economically marginalized, he seizes upon the one bright spot in his life, love of a charming woman. But in a \\"Young Werther\\" burst of emotion, that passion twists itself into its own homicidal inversion. At the same time, warships stand off within sight of the British shore, lobbing shells at each other across the night sky.But there's a new star in that sky, and one that has incredible effect on human life. Suppose, just suppose, that one day, everyone in the world suddenly started acting reasonable, or mostly reasonable. Suppose that all the world leaders, all the soldiers in the trenches, all the capitalist barons, all the socialist firebrands, and even the lovers suddenly woke up, and said, \\"I've been stupid. Let's do better.\\" This examination of humankind's entry into a better world foreshadows Wells's later \\"Modern Utopia.\\" In \\"Comet,\\" he imagines mankind reworked into the beings who could support that ideal world - with the striking examples of those few who need only minor adjustments. \\"Modern Utopia\\" assumes that unidealized people will populate the ideal world, so the ideal must have places in it for them. I find the combination of similarities and reversals between these two books equally interesting. By itself, \\"Comet\\" might not be Wells's best. In the context of his entire ouvre, however, it holds a fascinating and possibly transitional place.-- wiredweird"},{"Title":"In the Days of the Comet","review":"I thought that I was familiar with most of Well's body of work, until I stumbled over this unique novel.First of all, do not be put off by the first part of this book- it is intended to be depressing.

Wells attributes this to a chemical change in earth's atmosphere, but there is a surprising amount of spirituality also incorporated (surprising for Wells.)All of this reminded me of the change that is said to occur when a human soul leaves the material world and enters the astral. All of the old heaviness and stupidity drop away. Only the highest of what it means to be human remains- the old ego dies. Even in the story everyone speculated if perhaps they were not dead and transported to a different world. Some even declared that this great Change was the Second Advent.There is one thing about this novel that leaves a lingering element of disappointment. This is the fact that the core causes of all the economic, social, and political injustices and stupidities described in the first part of the book in 1906 are still with us. After 101 years these same problems are still with us. I'm sure that this would have also disappointed Mr. Wells."},{"Title":"In the Days of the Comet","review":"How nice to read a novel that uses big words but is completely comprehensible. It's not \\"sentences for sentences sake\\" but the images that they produce.

The main character's descriptions of his angry youth are humorous, much like the character in Old School who goes on an Ayn Rand binge.How nice to read a novel with a social conscious that does not express itself as a complicated mathematical problem dependent upon sweeping generalizations that do not add up in the end.

This book, if I can offer a summation, should be called an anti-blockbuster, which is what many of Welles's novels should be called. If one compares the socialist utopia at the end of this novel with the cinematic dreck of the Bruce Willis ordeal Armageddon, we see polar opposites."},{"Title":"In the Days of the Comet","review":"While not his earliest or most typical work,In The Days of The Comet is a great introduction to Well'sliterature for those interested but uninitiated into themind and writings of this great author.Dramatic, full of suspense and intrigue, with a dose ofromance to boot, this story has something for everyone...including a great social lesson.The story is set in Edwardian England and has some of theflavor of Dickens' stories. However, whereas it requiredthe visitation of all three spirits of Christmas to reformEbeneezer Scrooge, the entire human race gets reformed bythe visitation of a single comet in this masterful story byH.G. Wells.Once you've read it, check out &quot;Mr. Britling Sees It Through&quot;for a superb examination of WWI and war in general. Wellswas one of the great thinkers of all time and we owe it toourselves to familiarize ourselves with his works. Many ofhis ponderings on human nature and problems are applicableeven today. His science fiction works are far from beinghis best, though they are the best-known."},{"Title":"In the Days of the Comet","review":"This was one of H.G.Wells early books and a little drawn but still good. I would recommend that anyone who wants to follow his works start with the real early ones and work their way up."},{"Title":"In the Days of the Comet","review":"I think In The Days of the Comet is a literary masterpiece that is vastly underappreciated amongst Wells' other, granted, also spectactular works. Furthermore, a perusal of the reviews here and elsewhere on my internet searches suggests that there is a singular reason why people don't seem to like it as much. Since no one else seems to have noticed this perhaps I am simply misinterpreting the ending, but I think there was an essential point made in the epilogue that I've seen no reviewer make mention of. (Be forewarned if you've yet to read it; if I'm right, this is quite a spoiler.) Wells' has a tradition in his scientific romances of adding a 'twist' to the end of his books. In all fairness the term twist has been bastardized fearfully by folks in Hollywood who do it very poorly. His precise technique is rather, in the last few pages, to gracefully inform you of an underlying thread that connects all the disparate concepts that he has hitherto brought into your mind.But I digress. The effect of the comet on humanity and all air-breathing animals is emphasized as being a momentary injection of rapture. As such, the generation born after the change has the same violence and irrationality that was prevalent before, and the purpose of the narrator who writes the prologue and epilogue is to emphasize this contrast. In the epilogue, Willie Leadford's generation has established itself as a godlike aristocracy over those born after the Change. Notice how the narrator seems to have no idea as to the context that placed him in the tower, and is generally characterized as infantile and maybe unknowingly subservient to Leadford.The way I felt this wraps everything together is that certain aspects of the Change were intended to be totalitarian and inhuman. I would imagine an avid reader like Wells wouldn't consider the burning of books and almost all pre-Change 'rubish' to be salubrious. Also polygamy, which even the protagonists resisted at first to preserve their last vestige of humanity, seems to illustrate a removal of the affected generation from essential characteristics of humanity. I think that Wells' point is that while the world would unquestionably be a better place if such a Change were to happen, the species in charge would no longer be human. The epilogue characterizes Leadford as deific, and his relationship with the narrator is as to a pet kitten, who he is good-heartedly sharing his thoughts with.Again, a fair argument could be made that I'm reading too much into it. But, Wells' does write a lot that warrants reading into."},{"Title":"In the Days of the Comet","review":"In the Days of the Comet may not be Wells' finest scientific romance, but it is a provocative, insightful, often humorous and finally scandalous look at how the world may be transformed into a prelapsarian wonderland. The comet of the title dusts the earth and transforms the jealous and possessive behaviors of men and women into passions for cooperation and peace.Idyllic as it may seem, contemporary readers were aghast by the suggestion that religion, marriage, and capitalism, would (or should) be replaced by a primitivistic urge to help, share, and love. Granted, Wells was by no means a proto-hippie, but in this book we get the softer side of a writer who is elsewhere concerned with destroying the world and recreating it in his own image. This novel is the perfect antidote for the anti-social Wells we can find in his nonfiction.Bison's edition, unfortunately, does not include Wells' original epigraph (from Shelley), but does include a fair introduction by Ben Bova."},{"Title":"In the Days of the Comet","review":"In what is perhaps Wells' most obscure book, this is less sci-fi than it is his socialistic vision for the world where everyone is happy and equal and the capitalist system collapses. Of course, he would live through two world wars and see socialism rear its ugly head. Perhaps at the end he might have written a different book. Also, he disdains religion and his ideas on relationships fit into the '60s more than the early 1900s. Today, none of this would be shocking. His prediction of war between England and Germany would soon come true. His dislike of war is perhaps the only high point of this book. Controversal book then, but not so much now. Not as timeless has his others, but at the very least will let you see into the mind of this famous writer."},{"Title":"In the Days of the Comet","review":"I usually love Wells' books, but this one was so dripping with socialist mantra and ideals that I came away from it a bit taken back. If you are expecting what I was expecting, the struggle for life, while dealing with a comet strike, then don't bother reading this, it will only make you mad.If you are looking for a book that takes you through the thought process of how people were in the pre-WWI industrial movement and how British workers felt, then this is a good historical \\"accounting\\".This is far from his normal fight for survival or exploration into the possible books. I wont be reading this one again, that is for certain.As far at the writing, itself. It is well written, but does tend to drag in places with some \\"over description\\", but again that is classic Wells' writing, and is also the norm for that era as well."},{"Title":"In the Days of the Comet","review":"More than a few people have used this idea over the last few decades.The people of Earth are going about their normal dodgy business, untilthey realise that a comet may actually strike the planet.A most definitely political novel, this looks at the upheaval sucha catastrophic event can cause, and what happens to the society as aresult.It seems here that humanity will improve in the face of such calamity."},{"Title":"In the Days of the Comet","review":"This was my first HG Wells book and it was very good.

Used as a resorce book for my book \\"Three Toes Lives On!\\""},{"Title":"Love and War In the Apennines (Picador)","review":"This delightful and beautifully crafted book tells the story of what happened when British soldier Eric Newby -- later to gain fame as a travel writer -- was captured in 1943 after a farcical commando raid on a German air base in Sicily. The story of the raid is hilarious but the narrative soon bogs down badly when he describes the prisoner of war camp in northern Italy and spends page after page on the various classes of officer and who would talk to whom and who wouldn't. This book was written at a time when Britain was still pretty obsessed with its class structure and you can easily skip to the chapter when Italy surrenders and the prisoners flee before the Nazi forces can take over.Newby said he wrote the book to reveal how ordinary Italians helped prisoners despite the terrible reprisals which they knew would rain down on them if the Germans learned what they were doing. When Italy surrenders Newby has just fractured his ankle and needs help from a friendly doctor. He is gradually passed down the line into more and more remote parts of the Appenine mountain range and along the way meets a young woman who tries to teach him Italian to boost his chances of survival. They gradually fall in love but before they can make any plans Newby is on the move again. He is spirited onto a farm in a tiny impoverished village where the farmer orders him to remove a mass of rocks and boulders from a field the family desperately needs to plough. In return he can stay with. Newby painstakingly describes the primitive life the farmer, his wife and children lead, a life which really cannot have changed very much since the 16th century.The threat of denunciation is never far away and as winter draws in, Newby has to move on and eventually winds up in a tiny cave deep in the mountains with a small heater. His beloved sends him little notes through a long and convoluted network of friends and once -- for a couple of hours -- they actually meet.Shortly afterwards he is recaptured by the Italians and that is where this wonderful book ends. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Love and War In the Apennines (Picador)","review":"I devoured this book in just 24 hours and enjoyed every page. Eric Newby was captured in Italy after an abortive SAS style raid and spent several years as a prisoner of war - ironically he found his life partner in a little village in the mountains where the brave Italian villagers sheltered him and many, many other allied troops. Not a story that I have heard much about before - and nor had the author, so, as he explains, he wrote this book. He seems to have written several more about his subsequent world-wanderings.I shall be buying and reading them too now - found another author to read and to enjoy."},{"Title":"Love and War In the Apennines (Picador)","review":"Newby applies his usual deft touch to recount his largely involuntary travel throughout northern Italy while held as a POW, and subsequently on the run, throughout late 1943. The Newby talent for observing places and mannerisms, and the heartfelt manner in which he illustrates the essential decency of those Italians he encounters en route (including his helpers, those too afraid or indifferent to assist him, and even his original captors) make this a book well worth reading, and three aspects of the book in particular gave me food for thought.The first chapter recounts Newby's capture during an ill-fated mission to sabotage a German airfield on Sicily. While the author downplays his role for comic effect, it is clear that not only was there little prospect of returning home safely, poor planning and inadequate resources (other than a reliance on the bravery and initiative of those involved) ensured the mission had almost no chance of success. How many other young men were asked to throw away their lives for objectives that may have been important but clearly unattainable?Newby's description of life in the POW camp and the emergence of an informal elite (which he terms the 'OK people') based largely on social status - and definitely not on military rank or prowess - is a fascinating pen portrait and reminiscent of my own experience in an officer training institution and as a junior officer (like Newby, I was occasionally entertaining to my own 'OK set' at best and definitely not of them!).'Ho paura' (I have fear) is a phrase Newby gets to hear a great deal - and with good reason. It is a marvel that people with no hope of monetary reward or protection from brutal reprisal were willing to run such enormous risks on behalf of Newby and so many others like him. The author certainly wrestled with the question - equally valid today - of how much cooperation a soldier can reasonably expect from a civilian population he is unable (or unwilling) to protect from violence.Fans of Newby's will delight in the usual wit and acute eye of his work, and in this case may - as I did - find something further to think about than his usual amusing and diverting travelogue."},{"Title":"Love and War In the Apennines (Picador)","review":"The late Eric Newby's memoir of his travails as a prionser-of-war escapee in World War II Italy, \\"Love and War in the Apennines,\\" has been touted both as a true love story and a dramatic real-life war adventure. (It was even made into a Hallmark Hall of Fame TV movie in 2001 titled \\"In Love and War.\\") But while acknowledging both those lures, I was seduced most by the vivid image it paints of impoverished rural Italy some 70 years past, illuminating how much day-to-day life in Europe and the western world has changed since that time.On the lam in 1943, running from both the Nazis and local Facisti still in charge after Mussolini's downfall, Newby is aided by scores of Italian civilians tired of war and Germans, risking their lives on his behalf. Among them, pivotally, is the beautiful Slovene exile Wanda, Newby's destined life partner.While the love story and the war story are both threaded throughout the book weaving it together, the fabric consists of the bravery, cunning and generosity of the people who housed, hid and fed him, at great personal risk: execution by the Germans for harboring an escaped POW. Enfolded within that fabric is Newby's recounting of their simple lives: the meagre food they grew and ate, the wine and grappa they produced and drank, the threadbare clothes they wore, their rustic homes and beds, their animals, entertainments, superstitions and beliefs. Lives whose substance had not much changed over centuries, but now unrecognizable from an early 21st century perspective.It reminded me how much our post-war Western lives have changed--for the better, in most regards, I'd say, though one could argue as to the quality of changes that have separated so many of us from the land, tradition and self-reliance. But in the war-weary Italy of 1943, rural life was grim and brutal: food scarce, labor unrelieved, fear rampant. Those \\"good old days\\" seem indeed old but hardly good."},{"Title":"Love and War In the Apennines (Picador)","review":"What's amazing about Eric Newby is the fact that he considered himself the lesser known author of that name. There was an older English author by the same name who was considered more famous in England. And indeed judging by this Eric Newby's adventures you could say success was in the eye of the beholder. But now all American knowledge of the author by that name is this very humble Eric Newby, and better off we are for it.With this particular tale it's one of beating extreme odds. He defies capture so many times in so many ways and literally like a storybook again in the end (no spoilers). A movie script couldn't do this tale justice; CBS tried to make a TV movie out of it but it wasn't nearly so powerful as this story. Reading this story will make you understand why Eric Newby never cared whether he succeeded in making the goals of his adventures afterward, because his life was already the adventure. No doubt he learned this along with the self-perseverance in this tale. By the time he sets out from the British sub it becomes a mission impossible he dubs \\"operation whynot\\" ostensibly to attack the Nazi airfield on the island of Sicily nearly single-handedly. From the beginning this book will capture you as he is captured.The love of his life he gains in this story is the ultimate time he truly beats the odds though. Wanda Newby herself is an amazing woman and the fact that she stuck with him until he passed away in 2006 is incredible given the misadventures that followed in tales likeSlowly Down the Ganges.Eric Newby to me is the real life Tom Bombadil of JRR Tolkien's LOTR; down to the very canyon he hikes crawls and falls down into the gorgeous river valley and the old man he meets there with a skeleton key to his house the size of a castle lock which he forged himself. Eric Newby found meaning in life most of us cannot fathom. At least read this book and you will have catch a glimpse.

They were operating on an informed heart, on the Golden Rule, wanting to give aid to those who opposed the hated Fascists and Nazis as they would hope someone would help their own sons. And while the Allies were protected by the Geneva Convention should they be captured, the citizens were not and they were subject to less humane punishment, sometimes torture and death, if their actions were found out. But they did it anyway. It is these people, who otherwise lived a pastoral, ancient way of life, whom travel writer extraordinaire Eric Newby profiles in his memoir, LOVE AND WAR IN THE APENNINES.Those familiar with Newby's other books will find his signature wit, self-deprecating humor and descriptive powers at work here, but his curiosity and appreciation of other people and cultures is in highest gear. He comes to meet the peasantry of northern Italy after fleeing a prison during the chaos following the ouster of Mussolini in September 1943. He is helped by a succession of individuals and families, including the woman who would become his wife and companion in later adventures, the estimable Wanda. The book ends with his unfortunate recapture by the Germans and in an epilogue he revisits the people who took him in ten years after.Newby is a hugely gifted writer, his sentences are knowing and clear as a bell. He orders information rhythmically, always knows when less is more and more is more. He never bows to sentimentality, never sells anyone out. He does a remarkable job of expressing the fear and dispiritedness that politics and war heave on a people, at the same time revealing their resilience. There is much to admire in this book."},{"Title":"Love and War In the Apennines (Picador)","review":"The Italians Newby depicts in this memoir (and also in his &quot;A Small Place in Italy&quot;) are often funny, but never buffoonish.

It must have weighed half a ton. Then, when he had finished caressing it, he called for a sledgehammer and hit it deliberately but not particularly hard and it broke into two almost equal halves.

Having passed through this countryside so many times traveling between Milan and Florence, I know first hand how rugged it is. Just to get through these mountains by train is an adventure, as there are dozens of tunnels to pass through after one leaves Bologna. Newby brings the setting to life for the reader, and we walk in his footsteps as he falls upon adverture after another.

The cultural aspects of the early portion of the book are worth exploring as yet another insight into the Irish ascendency in politics, with a rather unusual twist of the WASP frontman.The last twenty per cent of the book is a disappointment, filled as it is with percentages of wages, expenses and other numdane matters. It is not that the book is too long, it is that the writer apparently ran out of steam or information. He failed to capture the excitement that the new way of governing created and the innovations which the late Mayor Whalen inspired.

The illustrations are magical and gorgeous, and the text is full of dreamy imagery that will appeal to young children as well as older readers."},{"Title":"The Savage Mind","review":"Academic scholarship does not generally lend itself to masterpieces. One tends to balance detail and complexity against efficiency, to narrow one's audience while deepening argumentation. Thus the truly great books of a particular discipline are often incomprehensible outside it, while the wonderfully accessible books rarely do more than describe what others have done.The Savage Mind is one of a small number of exceptions to this rule. In a book that requires no prior knowledge of anthropology, L&eacute;vi-Strauss succeeds in leveling a major challenge to his discipline and simultaneously to every reader. In elegant, graceful prose, he meticulously dissects his objects, formulates his arguments, and stretches the range of theoretical speculation to cover an extraordinary range of material from all over the world-including the modern.In the nearly fifty years since this book first appeared, however, much has changed. Structuralism, for which The Savage Mind served as something of a manifesto, has collapsed beneath the weight of its own logical formation and the critical assaults of various respondents-not all of them well-informed. But even that most scathing critic of structuralism, Jacques Derrida, has noted repeatedly that we can never really go back: structuralism is part of our thinking now, and the only way out is through. To put it simply, if you never read this book, you will never gain the right to criticize structuralism as a method for studying culture.Another thing that has changed is basic education. L&eacute;vi-Strauss takes it for granted that we all know quite a bit about European literature, music, and art; that we know who the painter Clouet was, and the difference between Mannerism and Impressionism. He doesn't assume expertise, but a kind of general cultural education no longer usual. This can make some of his analyses opaque, where they are intended to be illustrative. Just as you can skim these arguments, which are often problematic anyway, you don't actually need to know much about totemic practices to understand; he summarizes what's important, and so long as you don't intend to challenge through data, you need no background.L&eacute;vi-Strauss's arguments proceed methodically and exceedingly rapidly. Their weight lies in their logic, not their particulars; that is, it really doesn't matter whether his interpretation of any one myth or ritual is correct, but rather whether the means of going about it makes rigorous sense. He is not expert on everything, and he often inserts such phrases as, \\"Without presuming to decide this issue....\\" This is not mere qualification: he distinguishes between illustration of method and rigorous analysis of particular material. If you want him to analyze material, go read The Raw and the Cooked; if you want to know how he does it, read The Savage Mind.To put this differently, to pick on trivia here is to miss the point. Perhaps you do name your pets differently than he does. Perhaps the Murngin creation-myth has a step he forgets to mention. Perhaps the interpretation of Clouet doesn't really quite make sense if you know much about Clouet. So what? These are illustrations, not proofs. The same happens with the famous essay \\"The Structural Study of Myth\\": L&eacute;vi-Strauss proposes a reading of Oedipus which, though wildly suggestive and interesting, really doesn't make a lot of sense for Oedipus, and leads to a stunningly silly conclusion. No matter: the point is to demonstrate how the method works. Again, if you want to see him analyze something, you don't read his pure theory books; you read The Raw and the Cooked, or Totemism, or (especially) The Elementary Structures of Kinship. So long as you can work out how the method functions, L&eacute;vi-Strauss thinks you should go test it yourself, on material you know. Then, if it doesn't work, you can come back and criticize.As we read The Savage Mind, we are constantly forced to slow down. L&eacute;vi-Strauss has a tendency to condense an enormous argument into a paragraph, then move on; unlike his best American and English counterparts, who make their analyses as explicit as possible, L&eacute;vi-Strauss takes the classically French approach of hitting the highlights in the topic and concluding sentences of a paragraph, then putting all the illustrative detail of logic and material into the middle. This is a matter of style, a choice and not a vice. So if you really want to understand the book, you actually have to work through his examples very slowly and carefully. Otherwise one has a tendency to lose the thread and simply become bewildered.Unfortunately, this translation is, as Clifford Geertz and everyone else has noticed, execrable. Some sentences are not even acceptable English grammar, to say nothing of their failures to render L&eacute;vi-Strauss's beautiful, dense French. Mercifully, the various translators involved all recognized their failures and refused to sign their names. Some day, a really good translation will come along, I suppose, but in the meantime at least this one is hyper-literalist-far better than simply wandering off course. If you read French perfectly, read La pens&eacute;e sauvage; it's genius!The Savage Mind is an endlessly fascinating, stimulating, brilliant book, a true masterpiece of the human sciences. It happens that L&eacute;vi-Strauss is quite often wrong, but the fact remains that this is a landmark of scholarship and a book everyone seriously interested in culture needs to read. Durkheim, Weber, Freud, and Marx are all wrong too. So are Eliade, Geertz, and Turner, for that matter. Does this mean we shouldn't read them? To think we can simply jump to the most recent people and skip what came before is to submit to ignorance and laziness. L&eacute;vi-Strauss is perhaps the last of the great French intellectuals, and his work will stand for a long time as a challenge and a landmark; you must take up his challenge, read him, and thoroughly master his thought. Only then can you move on.Read now, and see a (slightly misguided) genius at work."},{"Title":"The Savage Mind","review":"Unlike some of Lev-Strauss' other book (Myth and Meaning, Tristes Tropiques), this one is heavy going. LS sets forth his theories in abstract almost mathematical terms. It's a hard slog but well worth it. You get a real sense of his very deep thinking and understand why he is one of the giants of anthropology."},{"Title":"The Savage Mind","review":"'The Savage Mind' is probably the best known work of structural anthropology despite its difficult and technical nature. Levi-Strauss is searching for the universal structures of myth in archaic societies-through in application of Saussure's theory of signification, Levi-Strauss seeks to reveal the underlying process of mythological signification. The difficulty lies in Levi-Strauss' privileging of the synchronic over the diachronic-his approach removes the temporal aspect anthropological inquiry. There are interesting revelations in this text, such as the claim that the content of myth is arbitrary and infinitely variable. However, Levi-Strauss' attempts to reach the universal structure of myth have proven to be erroneous by all contemporary accounts. Still, this text is an important object of the history of 20th century structuralism."},{"Title":"The Savage Mind","review":"Claude Levi - Strauss' The Savage Mind (1962) is a densely - composed book that winds a circuitous path through several important thematic areas of the anthropological minefield. As multiple passages attest, Levi - Strauss was capable of writing and thinking clearly. Quoted passages - many of admirable simplicity - reveal that Levi - Strauss also appreciated straightforward writing, thinking, and scholarship in others.Nonetheless, much of the book's content is bogged down in miasmic discussions concerning simplistic points of fact or interpretation that are obvious in many cases (&quot;the principle underlying a classification can never be postulated in advance,&quot; or the unsurprising fact that Indian tribes from opposite regions of North America regarded the crow in entirely different lights), thus further obscuring his already ambiguous theses. Levi - Strauss conjures up extended metaphors which he manipulates haphazardly (the most prominent being the comparison of the myth - making process to the 'bricoleur'), and makes outright, seemingly willful mistakes of logic, such as the passage in which he refers to an eagle hunter cleverly hidden within a self - devised trap as &quot;both the hunter and the hunted&quot; merely because the man has situated himself on the inside of the trapping mechanism: within the trap he may be, but hunted by the eagle, or by anything else, he is not. That the hunter remains in firm control over the successful capture of the eagle is a fact Levi - Strauss slyly chooses to look away from.Elsewhere, Levi - Strauss makes laughably incorrect suppositions when attempting to correct the broad generalizations of others, stating, for instance, after tacitly acknowledging the existence of such dietary cravings, that &quot;there is no evidence that pregnant women the world over have cravings.&quot; Moving from literal to figurative meaning and jumping from objective fact to subjective interpretation without restraint (&quot;Nature is not in itself contradictory. It can become so only in terms of some specific human activity which takes part in it; and the characteristics of the environment take on a different meaning according to the particular historical and technical form assumed in it by this or that type of activity&quot;), the author's sentences intertwine recklessly together until the reader can reasonably conclude that entire passages are dazzlingly free of definite, cohesive content of any kind. Though he has literally hundreds of objective facts at his fingertips, Levi - Strauss' confidence in his ability to build them into a sustained, persuasive presentation seems illusory at best.Readers who have thus far found the book almost impossible to absorb will find their judgment richly rewarded when Levi - Strauss discusses the role of domesticated animals in Western civilization - a subject most readers have had some degree of everyday familiarity with - in Chapter Seven, &quot;The Individual As A Species.&quot; Beginning with the absurd statement that &quot;birds are given human christian [sic] names in accordance with the species to which they belong more easily than any other zoological classes, because they can be permitted to resemble men for the very reason that they are so different,&quot; and continuing &quot;consequently everything objective conspires to make us think of the bird world as a metaphorical human society: is it not after all literally parallel to it on another level?&quot;, the author's discussion of what he believes constitutes the underlying processes in naming dogs, cows, and horses in the West is so transparently ludicrous that it exposes everything that has come before as the intellectual hokum that it is.The main supporting audience for The Savage Mind has been masochistic American academics who bow reflexively to European theorists, particularly French theorists, as if on command, building author cults small and large in the process, and thus entering suicidally into intellectual perdition. For such academics, the more obtuse a work, the better; most esteemed is a book completely beyond comprehension. The Savage Mind, a work of anti - knowledge, warrants that level of criticism: it completely fails to succinctly outline its ideas, or prove, finally, that its incommunicable &quot;theories&quot; have any appreciable merit whatsoever."},{"Title":"The Savage Mind","review":"hmmmm..... I can't see why this book has got such humble and unskilled review till now. This book is the easiest material to understand the tenet of structuralism. Personally I don't like the disposition of structuralism at all and I suspect whether in 50 years, anybody remember that kind of school existed at all except writers of history of philosophy.Anyway, this book made structuralism floating on the vogue with its ease to understand and constructed the intellectual fashion of structuralsim which dominated the whether of discourse in human science in the 1960s and 1970s. Yep. now nobody read Levi-Strauss, even anthropolgists don't read his books. But if you want to understand structuralism, post-structuralsim and postmodernism, you'd better begin with this book for it's the easiest and fun to read."},{"Title":"The Savage Mind","review":"This is the first anthropology book I read. It may be considered difficult to read this book. A scholarly and heavy description however very rewarding in my opinion. Spanning a real wide scope."},{"Title":"Places in the Sand","review":"The desert is the essence of nothing, Courtney-Clarke writes in the introduction to Places in the Sand, her nostalgic photographic tribute to the Namib Desert. Far from embracing the nihilistic meaning that the word \\"nothing\\" normally denotes in our every-day language, the \\"nothing\\" of Places in the Sand is full of meaning and substance, of memory and life. Anyone who has spent serious time in the Namib Desert will know and recognize in an instant where the symbiosis of the nothingness of sand, wind and sun have forged this essence.Places in the Sun emerged from Courtney-Clarke's intimate knowledge of Namibia, the land of her birth, as well as her keen eye as a photographer and photojournalist. Places in the Sand is a memoir in form of \\"a visual journey through my (Courtney-Clarke's) place.\\"This is also the title of the first photograph of the book and in a sense its dedication. It shows the sand-swept interior of a house in the desert long since abandoned to the ravages of time and place. But it also hints at life once lived here through the sky-blue, ochre and green colours of the fading paint on the crumbling walls and the open door against which the steady motion of the wind has lodged a tiny mountain of desert sand.It is hard to pick favourites among the 48 colour and 16 black-and-white illustrations. Sensuous dunes unfold, blown into form by the hot desert wind. Dreamlike roads lead nowhere and fragile cracked earth stretches endlessly toward the shimmering horizon. Earth touches sky in the far distance diffusing the point of their contact like in a Fata Morgana; and abandoned shelters engulfed by sand and time give back to the desert their vibrant structure inch by inch. The ghosts of the lives once lived in the Namib Desert, so it seems, are ever present.Beige, blue and the many shades of ochre are the predominant colours in Courtney-Clarke's desert photographs. Beige for the white bleached sand under the blazing sky which does not invite one to rest for long; blue for the infinite vastness of the Namibian sky which stretches to the end of the horizon and invites one to ruminate; and ochre for the sand's iron oxide pigments which have given the dunes their deeply rich hues.There are two black-and-white photographs of the famous Dune 45 on the way to Sossuvlei. The first is taken in the morning and the second in the afternoon light. What is brilliantly illuminated early in the day is transformed into a brooding shadow in the afternoon, giving the dune its distinctly architectural shape.In fact, many of the photographs seem like architectural compositions. Most of the landscapes, taken on the ground, are presented as small, oblong boxes, approx. 11 x 3 cm in size. This gives the photograph and its subject a distinct contour but also adds depth on the square page which measures approx. 22 x 22 cm. For example, Star Dune of the Namib moves the star point of the dune to the far right of the photograph and thereby arranging sharp fields of light and shadow like a tipsy star fruit.The huge pointed finger of one face of the dune in Seven-year drought almost seems to take off from the parched earth like the slender tail of the Concorde precipitously alighting from an airfield into the sky.Courtney-Clarke's dunes also reveal distinct patterns if seen from above. Sand in flight shows several dunes in various stages of formation, straining to grow taller and wider and trailing their wispy tails like the dyes in a silk Ikat fabric from Central Asia.Perhaps inadvertently, Places in the Sand also contains poignant ecological messages. The tracks in Going somewhere are those of a car navigated most likely in an area not under nature conservation protection. In more delicate desert areas these tracks could last for hundreds of years and if carelessly imposed could destroy fragile desert environments for ever. I have driven on the Long Road to Solitaire in the blazing sun, for ever aware that a breakdown of my bakkie could amount to more than just an annoying inconvenience.There have been more years of drought than of rain in Namibia's recent history, and the cycle in favour of drought seems to be lengthening with every turn.Thus numerous photographs record stumped or fallen skeleton trees, some still desperately straining for life in the barren sand; or of the odd piece of farm equipment that has long ago ceased to be useful.After such an abundant display of desolation one's eye nearly jumps with relief onto the page with the small photograph entitled After the rain. Almost rendered like a primitive painting, this is one of the most joyful in the book. The blades of green grass behind the wire fence stand upright, the mountains hover serenely in the distance and the brilliant blue sky seems infinitely benign.Anyone who has been to Kolmanskop or to the ghost towns in Diamond Area 1 south of Luderitz is intrigued by how wind and sand have conspired to transform, for example, the Mine manager's residence and even Courtney-Clarke's childhood home, Liebig House, on the farm Neu-Heusis at the edge of the Namib Desert (Memories of Neu-Heusis) into testimonies of the past.However stunning the photographs, Places in the Sand is ultimately about Courtney-Clarke's memories of early years spent in Namibia, on its expansive farmlands and in her beloved desert, near the cool shore of the Atlantic and along the desolate Skeleton Coast to the north..."},{"Title":"Places in the Sand","review":"Wow.

I can see how the author would have found interviewing and possibly 'relating' to teachers in a more easygoing natural way. But the presentation of the views of others was not as extensive.This book gave me some excellent information and probably insight into the experience of the West Indian black immigrant to a society that is predominantly white. Although I have lived and worked in the West Indies, I had not realized that for these people, coming from a society where black people run their own governments and decide on curriculum for students and everything else, in their societies, how difficult it is for them to live in a place where blacks are not a significant group as in the West Indies. I especially had not considered the culture clash between West Indian and American blacks.The book is highly readable and very informative. The reason I gave this review 3 stars has to do more with what I would consider to be a preponderance of interviews of a population subgroup as opoposed to a general, random survey across the board of West Indian immigrants to New York.Where are the delivery guys, the letter carriers, the car mechanics..... Or are they under-represented because they could be less articulate? Or is it just a comfort factor for the author to interview people who, although they are from a totally different cultural background, are at least familiar in that they are invovled with the academic? Or is it just easier to find teachers since they work in institutions? Whereas perhaps non-professional West Indians working in hourly wage jobs are difficult to influence to believe that the interview is just that and their privacy would be respected?The thing is though, a survey, in order to be valid, should contain a representative sample of all the West Indian black immigrants to New York.Regardless, a potential reader should not be put off by my criticisms. This study is well worth the read.

With such negative attitudes, how do you expect to enjoy this book? You have closed your minds from the beginning, or so it seems, and not waited to see if the book is worth reading. I, too, read this book not by choice, but by obligation; it was required this year (sophomore) at my high school. After my horrible experience with _Jane Eyre_ last year, which was pure agony, I was not particularly enthusiastic; however, I was pleasantly surprised to find that _The Scarlet Letter_ is well-written, interesting, and rich in symbolism -- some obvious, some not. This book does tend to include long descriptions and go into detail, but this only helps increase understanding of the author's point, as well as make the story more realistic and easily imagined. There are several memorable events in this book -- Hester's brief removal of her letter, the scaffold scene, etc. Although at times difficult, if you persevere, I think you will be richly rewarded.However, I do acknowledge that there are some people who are not fond of this style of writing, and I respect all opinions.

When he went to the U. of Chicago, he would pay 25 cents to dance to LW live each Saturday night).This book is an Autobiography of Lawrence Welk, so it tells much about his private life from birth on up. He got into having his own band during the 1920's when radio was new and he had to really struggle to get anybody to hear him at all. It was worse than a Gypsy's life on the road.He tells many very interesting stories of playing engagements, how they were promoted, what different audiences were like, etc.One story that made me laugh out loud was how in certain areas of the country it was not uncommon for people to bring a gun to a dance, and if someone's girlfriend got looked at by an undesireable competitor, shots would be fired. LW and his band got to where they didn't even bother getting off the stage. They would just hide behind the piano until the shooting was over, then they would get out and keep playing, while members of the crowd would haul off the injured parties. I don't think anybody died at any of his concerts, but it seems clear that the spirit of the American Frontier was still alive into the 30's, at least.I gained a real appreciation for Lawrence Welk after reading this book.--George Stancliffe"},{"Title":"Ah-one, ah-two!: Life with my musical family","review":"This book is a good addition to all the other books I have acquired regarding LW and his Musical Family.

My Life: How To Breakthrough To The Life You Really Want","review":"When life give you lemons - make lemonade. Now how many times have you heard that cliche when your way looks rough? But, even when you add plenty of sugar, it can still zing your taste buds, and make your lips pucker. Well, have you ever seen a purple sweet potato? They are from the same family as the orange shaded variety, except the flesh is a lavender hue. Sounds kinda exotic, doesn't it? And, the purple tuber is sweeter than the regular one. So now when your way looks rough, say to yourself - When life gives you an ordinary sweet potato, add a little food coloring and make purple sweet potato pie.\\"I Almost Missed...My Life\\" begins with what I'm going to call an ordinary beginning. You see, the author experienced some trials in her life, which are really no different from what a lot of women in the 21st century have had to face. At the age of thirty-one, she had two children, who had different fathers, and she wanted to divorce her third husband. What did she do in this familiar scenario? She took the knowledge that she had (an orange sweet potato), and combined it with the teachings of Anthony Robbins, Dr. Wayne Dyer, Dr. Norman Vincent Peale, the Dalai Lama and more (the food coloring), to result in a life filled with fun, excitement, passion, love and success (the exotic purple sweet potato pie).Debra Russell jots down her recipe with 52 ingredients, which can be added to your dish of life. After stirring, there's a \\"Give It A Go\\" assignment, to help bring out the flavor. She also encourages the reader to start journaling for increased success, and to start your own recipe. I recommend \\"I Almost Missed...My Life: How to Breakthrough To the Life You Really Want\\" to those who want to color the ordinariness of their lives into something new - well maybe not exotic, but definitely in a different pigment."},{"Title":"I Almost Missed... My Life: How To Breakthrough To The Life You Really Want","review":"&quot;I Almost Missed My Life&quot; contains 52 short (2 page) chapters that can best be described as instructional, self-help guidance on things you can do to change your life into the E Ticket life you would like to have. The E Ticket reference is used in the book and accurately represents the author's purpose with the book. Several years ago if you went to Disney World you would purchase a packet of tickets that contained A, B, C, D, and E tickets. The most popular, most exciting rides were E Ticket rides. My memories as a child include a trip to Disney World where we purchased one of these books of tickets. One thing I recall is that the A and B ticket rides were ones that I was not interested in and only rode them because I had a ticket that was no good for anything else. Many people seem to live their lives that way - life has dealt them a book of A and B tickets and so that is the limit of what they can ride. The purpose of the book is to change your life from an A or B Ticket ride to an E Ticket journey.Each week you can take one of the chapters and focus on it for that week. Chapters include encouragement and direction on such things as &quot;Practice Outcome Thinking&quot;, &quot;Trust and Follow your Knowing&quot;, &quot;Treasure and Nurture Your Friends&quot;, &quot;Don't Take Yourself Too Seriously&quot;, &quot;Listen&quot;, &quot;Let Go of Regrets&quot;, &quot;Be the Change You Want To See&quot;, and &quot;Be Grateful&quot;.

I wondered while reading it why Mr. Englund wasn't mentioned by name in the autobiography, but that is made clear toward the end of Mr. Englund's work. A few comments regarding the handful of negative reviews on this site. Brando's legacy as a great actor is not diminished in any way by some of the brutal revelations regarding his personal life. Perhaps a few sordid details could have been left out but I never got the sense that they were thrown in out of a sense of animus directed at Brando. In fact what comes through repeatedly is the author's deep affection for his subject, a mutual bond that was forged through their shared misfortune at having self-absorbed and destructive fathers. To their credit they achieved great material and artistic success in spite of the psychological burdens they both stuggled with throughout their lives.Now, as for the book itself. There is one chapter dealing with Mr. Englund's relation to his father that is absolutely riveting. Not only did I find it so but Brando himself was absorbed in this story, seeing as it touched on the same issues at the core of his own personality. There are also numerous other anecdotes that shed light on the main question: who is Marlon Brando, what is he really like when the veil of his movie star personna is lifted. In many respects it's a sad picture. It's the classic case of the mistreated child who grows up to perpetuate the wrongs that were once unfairly inflicted on him. As for his acting, he was able to overcome all obstacles and develop his great talent, though there's no doubt that the fuel that fired him was drawn from the well of his bitter early years."},{"Title":"The Way It's Never Been Done Before : My Friendship with Marlon Brando","review":"After reading this book, I had to respect the author for surviving the friendship of Marlon Brando. With Brando's keen perception and ability to read people, he stripped friends and acquaintances of their defenses in record time. There is one part describing Marlon's encounter with a cop that is worth the price of the book by itself. The book is both amusing and sad but even the sad parts have a humorous side. I think Mr. Englund tells us more than we need to know about Brando's final days. This part is indeed plain spoken and it's a tribute to the author's writing skills that it was not offensive. For some reason, no matter what we read about Brando, it seems we admire him more. I think it has something to do with the fact he was real and human. And he comes across as both in this book written by his friend."},{"Title":"The Way It's Never Been Done Before : My Friendship with Marlon Brando","review":"One would think that George Englund has good reason to regard himself as one of Marlon Brando's closest friends. The two first met in 1956, and remained in touch until the actor's death forty-eight years later. Despite this, I must sadly admit that this book, THE WAY IT'S NEVER BEEN DONE BEFORE: MY FRIENDSHIP WITH MARLON BRANDO, leaves me with the uncomfortable feeling that Englund's major motivation for keeping the relationship alive on his part, was to assure himself some status as the \\"friend\\" of a celebrity. Obviously, I can't confirm whether this was on his mind from the very beginning, but at least I found little in the book to support his claim to be a genuine \\"friend.\\" To be frank, I'd probably have found the book disturbing regardless of its content; Brando loathed being a celebrity, he could not stand being written about and analyzed, and publicly expressed his disappointment in former friends who'd wound up writing intimate biographies about him. The only possible excuse I can think of to justify a \\"friend-writ' biography\\" in this case, would be if the friend wished to do the actor a favor by sharing fond anecdotes ignored in other media, in order to confirm that there was more to Brando than a chaotic sex-life and bothersome behavior on film sets. However, in my opinion, Englund seems not to be particularly concerned with sharing \\"fond anecdotes\\" of his \\"friendship with Marlon Brando.\\"I find it not only tasteless but also completely unnecessary of Englund to transcribe long excerpts of telephone conversations with Marlon, which he'd recorded on tape through the years (admittedly, according to Englund, Brando himself encouraged the author to record their conversations on occasion; but I'd have a hard time being convinced that the actor envisioned how these recordings were eventually going to be used). I also wonder what I am to do with detailed recollections of how a nurse was obliged to assist the actor cleaning his rear end towards the very end of his life; if Englund had to cover this, would not a sentence like \\"by this time, Marlon was in need of constant care\\" have been enough? Even in this day and age, I do not think readers have lost the ability to read between lines altogether. However, these are minor objections compared to what fills other parts of the book. Certain comments regarding the tragic Drollet-murder are astonishing (in 1990, Brando's eldest son shot and killed his sister's boyfriend while heavily intoxicated). Englund admits that he did not attend court during the trials, and did not even catch glimpses of it on TV or anywhere else, but while reading in the papers that Marlon had begun to cry in court, he knew the actor was lying: \\"he acted. But this wasn't the greatest actor of his time seizing everyone's imagination, this was a former champion, overweight, out of shape, sloppy with his technique.\\" A true friend would not write this. In the end, Englund is the one who turns out to be sloppy with his technique.However, if I had to pick out one thing to represent the dominating tone of this book, it would be how Englund at one point recollects an incident involving Brando's childhood nanny, which the actor consciously avoided mentioning in his autobiography because he did not want the world to know about it. I won't go into details, but feel obliged to ask: why did you have to mention this, George Englund, when Brando told you, confidentially as a friend, that he did not want this memory to be shared with the world? I am quite clueless as to how the author can claim that he wrote this book as a \\"gift\\" for Marlon, trying to convince readers that he intended to have the book published before the actor's death. Brando would never have approved of this; in an interview with Playboy, he is quoted as saying that friends who write books about him \\"were not friends from the beginning,\\" and this attitude had not changed when he wrote his memoirs several years later. All these objections taken aside, I still found THE WAY IT'S NEVER BEEN DONE BEFORE to be a quite unengaging read for the most part. While covering the launching meeting of Brando's production company Pennebaker, Englund basically spends page after page recalling how the actor nearly fell asleep. I also found the book to be quite chaotically organized; Englund changes the time perspective every so often, making the narrative confusing to follow at times.Marlon Brando's memoirs SONGS MY MOTHER TAUGHT ME remains my primal recommendation to anyone interested in the actor's story. At the very least, try to avoid friend-written biographies because you won't get what the title indicates. I am sad to say that with THE WAY IT'S NEVER BEEN DONE BEFORE, George Englund ends up in a very unsympathetic light to me."},{"Title":"The Way It's Never Been Done Before : My Friendship with Marlon Brando","review":"When I heard that George Englund was writing about his 50 year friendship with actor Marlon Brando, my curiosity of course piqued. I have met several people who have related first hand life experiences with Mr. Brando and after the many stories I've heard, he still had remained an enigma to me and probably to his millions of fans around the world. In \\"The Way It's Never Been Done Before\\" Mr. Englund gives us a rare look into the personal life, which differs vastly from his public persona. I found the book to be fascinating. It should be a big seller."},{"Title":"The Way It's Never Been Done Before : My Friendship with Marlon Brando","review":"Good book, but I have one major reservation:In an interview, George Englund said he penned this account of Marlon Brando with, \\"Brando's dignity in my hand\\". So presumptively, Englund as a best friend wouldn't think to ever reveal personal information or details that Brando would have never wanted known, right? Isn't that what best friends are for?Um, quite the contrary here: Englund's telling of Brando's last days were too dam detailed, at times vile and completely unnecessary. Surely, this is not what people want to remember of the revered legend.I'm unafraid to say that I wept on the day Brando died like I had lost someone I knew and loved. For fans who really loved him a good portion of this thing -in excruciating pain from his disease and lying in helpless condition on a deathbed- you will find incredibly depressing. I'd recommend skipping some parts if you wanna keep the image of Brando the Almighty One intact.Dark clouds away this was indeed a pure delight to pore through... when is the subject ever boring afterall? I was happy Mr.Englund released this very personal tale of his friendship with Brando I only wish the actor himself were still alive to admire even more."},{"Title":"The Way It's Never Been Done Before : My Friendship with Marlon Brando","review":"George Englund's memoir of Marlon Brando is that, a memoir and far from a full-scale biography. It is a touching remembrance, filled with genuine affection for its subject, but not so much as to make the author blind to the shortcomings and warts of the greatest of all our film actors. In its affection it is a welcome departure from some of the more vicious tabloid-like portrayals of Brando--Peter Manso's biography comes to mind. At its best Englund's work is distinguished by some really beautiful interludes and gripping passages--his description of visiting his own absentee father after decades is especially moving. One senses that Englund believed he was privy to the whole of Brando, the insider of all insiders. His graphic description of Brando's last night is almost an exercise in trying to prove to himself, and us, how close he was to Brando. And it is a rare occurrence of Englund going perhaps too far. But for all that he was allowed to see, it is also apparent to the reader, if not to Englund himself, that Georgie was kept at arms length from various facets and compartments of his famous subject. There are dramatic and notable gaps in the book, and one gets the feeling that Englund's import as a macho and intellectual sidekick grew once Wally Cox died. It is perhaps too much to ask any single book to cover the whole of Brando--the subject is simply too complex. But this is a useful glimpse inside at least some aspects of Brando's life."},{"Title":"The Way It's Never Been Done Before : My Friendship with Marlon Brando","review":"TERRIFIC READ!I HAVE JUST READ A MESMERIZING BOOK ABOUT MARLON BRANDO.

I KNOW YOU'LL LOVE IT"},{"Title":"The Way It's Never Been Done Before : My Friendship with Marlon Brando","review":"This book comes straight from the heart. As 3rd son of author George Englund, I, George Englund Jr. am closer my dad than anyone else. I grew up with Marlon and his children; Christian, Miko, and Cheyenne. I spent time with them all in Tahiti on his atoll and worked with Marlon on several projects directly and extensively.Before giving my review on the book I must comment on the Publisher's Weakley review which misses the mark almost completely.This book was intentionally non-chronological, is in no way an attempt to document Brando's career or establish his place in film history. That is another book which I truly hope my father writes and one for which he is eminently qualified.GE Sr. was arguably Marlon's closest lifelong friend and this book is his truth about their relationship and his deepest most honest perception of who Marlon was. It was finished in an insanely compressed schedule after Marlon's death requiring the author to balance the bereavement of a lost best friend with the pressure of writing a serious comprehensive book with an extremely limited deadline. Contrary to the Publishers Weekly author, I found that Englund's take was consistently un-self centered and reflected the reality of their experiences. They are both spectacularly talented in different and similar ways.The reviewer mentioned that GE Sr.s career was never fully developed....That is an ignorant statement. It was the opposite of an ego trip. The Publishers Weekly review claimed that the narration ruled out any multi-layered insight but their shared experiences illustrate a deep and complex picture of two highly unique guys sharing a rare set of experiences. Brando was accurately revealed in this book and Englund appropriately represented his role and stature.Imagine if you had to write a book about your best friend, the greatest actor in the world, within 30 days of his death.I'm a hard grader on my dad but I think he kicked ass on this one big time. It is honest, fair and balanced"},{"Title":"The Way It's Never Been Done Before : My Friendship with Marlon Brando","review":"Mr. Englund knew Brando very well, and even got to the point where he would call Brando on his bad behavior. The two of tem developed a film production company together, along with Marlon Brando Senior, and this association with one of Hollywood's top stars catapulted Mr. Englund into the world of the big leagues, where he became a film director. He was also married for a long time to the actress Cloris Leachman, who makes a few cameo appearances in the book but who doesn't seem to have half the affection for Brando that her husband did. Inevitably rumors arose that Brando and Englund were lovers, and Englund addresses these rumors right away, as though to ward off further contagion. He discusses an incident that took place when a cop began hassling Brando and Mr. Englund for sitting alone in a parked car off the side of the road. Usually when men do that, claimed the cop, they are \\"two males having sex.\\" After they get rid of the cop, they laugh at him on page 20 and then Marlon asks Mr. Englund, \\"Ever done fruity?\\" Englund says he has nothing against it, just never wanted to do it. Brando addresses the rumors about himself and Wally Cox, etc. But Englund doesn't convince the reader that there was nothing sexual in their friendship. He denies it too much.There's an amusing part where Englund and Leachman are chaperones on Brando's date with Anna Magnani. Magnani's all over Brando and can't keep her hands off his crotch, and he is terrified of her. \\"Cloris and I sat upright, like two Grant Wood figures.\\" In this one instance Brando betrays a fear of women, elsewhere in the book he is the greatest Casanova in the 20th century, and Englund analyzes why in long, admiring paragraphs. Both Englund and Brando had father problems. Brando says that as a father, \\"he didn't care. He was an absentee landlord.\\"Sadly, both men's father difficulties carried over into the next generation. Brando's daughter Cheyenne killed herself, and his son turned out to be a killer. In Englund's case, his rebel boy Bryan dies a crack addict after breaking his parents' heart over and over again, while little Max died, not even a teen, of a degenerative muscle disease. Relating these terrible stories, Englund gives dimension to his portrait. I found them all very moving. Perhaps it is because Brando comes off as so selfish and self-absorbed that his fans don't care for this book. He is so full of himself and throws around his own considerable weight so often you wonder how anyone could put up with him. As for Englund, he comes off like a man who lived vicariously through the sex exploits of his famous chum, even if it meant kissing his ass for forty years.The most revealing chapter is the one in which Brando wants to raise money by writing a memoir, and he charges Mr Englund with peddling it for him to the big NY publishers. Englund successfully sells the unwritten book to Harold Evans from Random House for $5,000,000. The ethics of the situation seem totally out of whack. Englund can't promise Evans that the book will be good or even written by Brando. Evans seems star struck. people wonder what's wrong with publishing, this is a good example of the catastrophic thinking of mainstream publishers. By the way, Brando had nothing good to say about Evans' wife, Tina Brown, calling her \\"self-promoting\\" and \\"sinister.\\"By the way, Englund directed some great little movies, including one of my alltime favorites SIGNPOST TO MURDER (maybe Joanne Woodward's greatest part). Why isn't this one on DVD?"},{"Title":"The Way It's Never Been Done Before : My Friendship with Marlon Brando","review":"George Englund's book is the product of 50 years of a friendship with Marlon Brando, the lives of two men and their families intertwined, loving and suffering through the best and worst times. His book portrays the pain and grief of loss, the exultation of success, and the double-edge of fame and reality. George's book goes beyond the commonplace biography, and digs down deep. I recommend reading it."},{"Title":"The Way It's Never Been Done Before : My Friendship with Marlon Brando","review":"If you must know more about Brando, borrow this from the library. Thank God I didn't pay for this one-sided farce. Englund comes off as a jealous hanger on with no talent of his own. Did it ever occur to Englund that Brando wasn't entirely himself with him either? Like the part where Brando claims he hated his father...but Englund said it was ironic that Brando greeted his dad with a hug in the mornings at their film production office. That says a lot. Brando did still love his father and was grateful to have him around, especially since his mom had died. Two emotions can exist at once. Englund lacks Psych 101 or the maturity or depth to understand Brando's true nature, much less his drug addict son. This book was written by a moron.Why was it necessary to detail the moments of illness when Brando was dying, writing how he pees in to a plastic flask, there were medications everywhere. That is how most sick, old people die. It's as if Englund, the loser --what are his accomplishments anyways? --had to live in Brando's shadow, chose to follow his glamour, confidence, luck, brains, tremendous talent, but was too stupid to learn anything, too weak to try harder at his own marriage, and career, and couldn't wait until Brando stumbled, got old, looked bad. How could two narcissistic absentee fathers help their loser sons or eachother? Brando albeit a horrible parent, at least had career success. Englund has neither greatness in his career or his personal life, losing 2 kids and his marriages. He lived off his mother's success as a TV actress, grew up feeling priveleged in Beverly Hills and couldn't wait to make money writing negative things about someone who did work hard, did have an amazing career.Brando even gave him valuable advice, that he built his career by remembering faces and names, when Englund admits he was trying to have a career in television but forgot the name of the person he met with that day. Talk about lazy, entitled, talentless. Notice how he can't write about his own ideas, or his own vision --its about someone he was a parasite of, and then a disparaging, negative, inaccurate one.The saddest part is where Brando is on a diet and Englund keeps needling him to eat more, have more, and by the end of their dinner, Brando is eating a pound of ice cream. What evil creep, no talent, scum would do this to a friend?Brando should have run like hell from Englund. Instead, he generously offerred to have Englund and his drug addict son stay with him in Tahiti, where Brando's kids seemed normal. They were playing on the beach, boating, fishing, swimming, being in nature. Englund's son was a few years older and was very likely a terrible influence on Brando's kids who were then untroubled. What is it about Hollywood parents being so horrible? Read the book Hollywood, Interrupted, which makes the case that Hollywood people should simply never become parents because they are self-centered messes."},{"Title":"The Way It's Never Been Done Before : My Friendship with Marlon Brando","review":"This was a fantastic look inside the private life of Marlon Brando. I felt as is Gerorge Englund was sitting right beside me telling his story. I loved reading about a side of Brando only a true friend would be able to tell. I truly did not want the book to end."},{"Title":"The Way It's Never Been Done Before : My Friendship with Marlon Brando","review":"I believe that Mr. Englund has set a new standard on how biographies should be written. He showed us a side of Marlon that should be included in every biography, and so rarely is.I also applaud Mr. Englund's passion as a true friend. In this wonderful book, he has shown what a REAL friend is, which is something that most of us can only aspire to."},{"Title":"The Way It's Never Been Done Before : My Friendship with Marlon Brando","review":"The problem with biographies of Marlon Brando, and celebrities in general, is that they are often written by an outsider, someone who had little or no personal acquaintance with the subject and is sometimes just out to cash in on their celebrity. It is these problems with most biographies that makes George Englund's biography of Marlon Brando such a joy to read.Englund's friendhip with Brando started in 1956 and his biography therefore thrusts us directly into the height of his fame and spares us the date and details of his birth and upbringing. These often constitute the more tedious parts of other biographies. Another common problem with biographies is that they have a tendency to simply list off the actions and professional achievements of their subjects, sometimes giving them the appearance of a prolonged C.V. This is another area where Englund's book comes into its own. His close relationship with Brando allows him to recount many very personal and revealing tales that allow the reader to feel a closeness to Marlon that is difficult considering how private a man he was. The difficulties of Brando's life are well documented, but the accounts offered here are far more vivid and moving. The writer is not pre-occupied with sensationalism or scandal, merely the real story and the emotion felt.'The way it's never been done before' is a fascinating read and is a must have for anyone that is passionate about the work of Marlon Brando, surely the screen's greatest ever actor"},{"Title":"The Way It's Never Been Done Before : My Friendship with Marlon Brando","review":"A REAL downer. I realize Marlon Brando's life had many sadnesses, but this book really seemed to dwell on them. Mr Englund told of how HE thought. I wanted to hear how Mr Brando thought.The ending really ticked me off...I saw no need for the story of Butch, the dog.A TOO SAD story.I do agree with the review by Book Review Weekly."},{"Title":"The Way It's Never Been Done Before : My Friendship with Marlon Brando","review":"Marlon Brando once said that his friends don't write books about him. So what does that make Englund? Marlon said about Carlo Fiore, a once questionable so-called friend, that he probably wrote his book about Marlon because that's all he had left. The same seems to apply to Englund. I mean, why describe the gory details of Marlon's last night on earth in such a disgusting manner that leaves such a bad taste in our mouths about the ultimate acting icon? Seriously, would a real 'friend' have done such a thing? Why not leave us with some glorious memory of Marlon as a true friend would. I mean, without the help of Englund's book, Marlon left behind a legacy of fine art and entertainment that still amazes, inspires and motivates young actors and the world at large today. Why taint that legacy with a discussion of backsides and dung as the last thing said about the Brando legend? If Marlon could go his whole lifetime and remain an enigma (why we love him), and I believe he did it on purpose, what gives this so-called closest lifelong friend of his the right to expose him by sharing intimate details that he probably knows Marlon would never approve of and still call himself a friend? He's a sell-out jerk to me, but that's just my opinion. Would Alice Marchak (Marlon's assistant) or Jocelyn (Marlon's sister) ever write a book about Marlon? I don't think so. And they knew him best and would probably have gotten paid major big bucks to write something, anything about Marlon. They didn't because people who truly love you don't do that. Englund would have been more of a friend if he had just kept his big mouth shut and respected the greatest actor ever, but instead he proved just how much of a friend he may have been in life, but not at all in death. That is the lowest of all the slimballs because Marlon probably died thinking this sell-out was his friend. NOT!!!Now that I think about it, while this guy is trying to make everybody think that once Marlon had made his peace with him he could go on and die now, Marlon, in all his glorious brilliance to the end, may have set this guy up, knowing his greed would lead him to go public with Marlon's backside and dung details and show what a jerk he is. Now that sounds like a Marlon prank, being transparent and naked enough even in his darkest hour to expose the greed that lied in this so-called lifelong friend's heart. Obviously Marlon knew Englund and that he wasn't a friend. Marlon knew Englund would prove his greed, along with his disloyalty, by making the stupid choice of painting for the world such a gory picture of Marlon's last night when Marlon was brilliant enough and deserved better from a \\"FRIEND\\". The ultimate acting icon pulling the ultimate set-up. Way to go Marlon! You were a genius to the end. I see clearly, this bum for what he is. Englund said that even on his death bed Marlon said \\"F death\\". Well I say even on his death bed Marlon said \\"F You Georgie\\"."},{"Title":"A Sangre Fria / In Cold Blood (Spanish Edition)","review":"A sangre fr&iacute;a es una novela de Truman Capote, que narra el brutal asesinato de los cuatro miembros de una familia de Kansas.

Even when the condition is actually diagnosed, orthodox medicine has little to offer the HHS sufferer, except for symptom-suppressive drugs and dangerous surgery in extreme cases. The problem is often treated as a nuisance which the patient must &quot;learn to live with.&quot; Theodore Baroody, the author of the featured book, offers a more encouraging viewpoint. A chiropractor and naturopath, who also holds a doctorate in nutrition, Dr. Baroody has identified an astoundingly wide range of symptoms that can be traced to the HHS, a condition which he estimates is undermining the health of 85% of the population. Having successfully treated numerous HHS patients, he is convinced that persistent application of the corrective measures detailed in the book can bring lasting relief to even the most difficult cases.When the HHS is present, the stomach is forced upward through a weakened, stretched diaphragm, for minutes or hours at a time, seriously impairing the individual's ability to properly digest and assimilate food. Symptoms typical of the HHS are belching, nausea, and regurgitation. With other seemingly unrelated complaints, such as breathing difficulties, allergies, irregular heartbeat, anxiety attacks, and colic or hyperactivity in children, involvement of the HHS is seldom suspected. Drawing on his profound understanding of physiology and nutritional symptomatology, Dr. Baroody offers the reader clear and insightful explanations of why these and numerous other conditions may be linked to the HHS.What causes a hiatal hernia, and why does it affect such a large number of individuals? Although sometimes the condition may have been induced by a mechanical injury, Dr. Baroody believes that the majority of cases are directly traceable to stress, more specifically our inappropriate reaction to stress. Emotions such as anxiety, anger, and frustration are always accompanied by tension in the stomach and the solar plexus, which has the second largest number of nerve interconnections in the body. The resultant contraction of the stomach and spasm in the disphragm ultimately produce the hiatal hernia.The most significant ensuing pathological change is pinching of the vagus nerve, which extends throughout the entire body, and is largely responsible for controlling the production of hydrochloric acid (HCL). When the vagus nerve is pinched, HCL secretion is curtailed, resulting in incomplete digestion of foods, thus catapulting the body into a state of malnutrition. The book's clear and precise explanations of the many aspects involved in this rather complicated process lay the necessary groundwork for understanding the self-help recommendations that follow.Dr. Baroody's nutritional recommendations for HHS sufferers emphasize a correct ratio of alkaline- and acid-forming foods (80/20 per cent); avoidance of refined foods; proper food combining; and quality supplements to aid in digestion and counteract deficiencies. In addition, there is a specific nutritional program for each HHS-linked health condition listed. Other points of interest include an illustrated explanation of how to check the abdominal area to determine if the HHS is present, and 'hands-on' instructions on how to manually correct the HHS in oneself or others, both for the relief of acute discomfort and the long-term prevention of a recurrence.A special chapter for health professionals lists the most frequently noted spinal misalignments accompanying the HHS, as well as other techniques which Dr. Baroody has found helpful in his own practice.This is an invaluable source book for both the HHS patient and the practitioner seeking to help those afflicted with the condition. Along with his well-researched and logically-presented professional advice, Dr. Baroody provides a generous dose of encouragement. Drawing on his extensive experience, he claims that &quot;if the stomach can be kept in place for four to six months and proper measures taken to maintain correction by continued diet and one or more of the exercises given in the book, there is definite hope for long-term repair of the damaged disphragmatic muscle.&quot; For the millions of people who daily experience the considerable discomforts associated with a hiatal hernia, this is an infinitely better prospect than having to 'learn to live with' their problem!"},{"Title":"Hiatal Hernia Syndrome: Insidious Link to Major Illness Guide to Healing","review":"Most opinions seem to either criticize or laud the holistic approach of this book. I believe there's a balance between the two - while I am presently taking a prescription medication for GERD (that only seems to work moderately), I have had unbelievable relief from a chiropractor that used the methods in Chap. 34. I've been able to control a crisis with the instructions for helping yourself in that chapter. The exercise and diet recommended are working for me as well as the stress reduction techniques. If there's a way to HEAL my problem and not just cover it over with medication for years and years, I can't understand why anyone wouldn't at least try it."},{"Title":"Hiatal Hernia Syndrome: Insidious Link to Major Illness Guide to Healing","review":"My teenage daughter and I both had digestive problems that were diagnosed as Hiatal Hernia Syndrome. We didn't want to take medicine or consider surgery, so we consulted a Holographic Health chiropractor who recommended techniques in this book. We both greatly improved, so we got the book and now know what to do for ourselves whenever symptoms arise. The main technique is a simple manuever to move the diaphragm downward (we wondered why our doctor didn't know that).This book is paperback and still in print, and is available new from Holographic Health for $11.95.

I will be getting this book"},{"Title":"Hiatal Hernia Syndrome: Insidious Link to Major Illness Guide to Healing","review":"I read the 1998 version of this book recently, having been diagnosed with a moderate HH and having done a lot of research. The author has a hard time establishing credibility with the reader. First, he flies in the face of modern research by writing a foreward that describes HHS in the most egregiously hyperbolic terms as essentially a modern black plague that will adversely affect 85% of the population, when most doctors describe it as a relatively inoccuous condition affecting a minority -- in other words, he comes off like he's trying to sell something. Second, he has the writing skills of a third-grader (hopefully because he is not a native english speaker) and did not bother to hire a translator, use a spell-checker or even a dictionary. Third, though the book is clearly intended for the layperson, he launches in medical jargon so thick and opaque that one gets the impression he is trying to buy the reader's respect for him as a doctor through the sheer volume of latin words.Most alarmingly, he rarely backs up any of his arguments, and when he does, the reasoning is specious. For example, he draws conclusions about the effect of stimulation of the vagus nerve on human digestion by referring to an inconclusive study of the sciatic nerve in rats, an unrelated subject, but one the layperson is unlikely to be able to question. There is no hard scientific evidence to back him up, and it is unsettling that a doctor will give advice in the absence of such evidence.To be sure, the anecdotal evidence he's gathered over many years as a practicing physician has merit, and you come away from the book thinking that HHS may be more complicated than your doctor tells you. Unfortunately, you come away no better informed, since much of what he's saying is obviously garbage, but you don't know which parts. Stick to medical journals &amp; Medscape for information, not witch doctors with something to sell."},{"Title":"Hiatal Hernia Syndrome: Insidious Link to Major Illness Guide to Healing","review":"I was diagnosed with a hiatal hernia in Jan 2003. I ordered this book with the hope of finding and alternative treatment for healing. I was very disappointed to say the least.This book mainly consists of theories that hiatal hernia CAUSES other conditions, from arthritis to ear infections, with little to no scientific evidence to back it up.The &quot;treatment&quot; section describes ways to &quot;push down&quot; the stomach, as well as a yoga move (which is a good exercise...but you don't need this book for that). In one chapter he recommends using a wooden egg on yourself to force the stomach down into position. He assumes throughout this book that a hiatal hernia &quot;pinches&quot; the vagus nerve (a nerve that runs through the body) that it must cause every other condition known to man. It's almost enough to make me a hypochondriac.Instead of this book, I recommend the &quot;Positive Options&quot; book since it provides clear, concise explanation of what Hiatal Hernia is, how it is treated, and what options exist for surgery.Do not buy into this witch doctor's theories."},{"Title":"They Wear What Under Their Kilts?","review":"Allow me to just state right up front that I not only am not a YA, but I am over the hill and halfway down the other side.

When most girls take a work experience class, they get an office job or clerk somewhere. Emily and her best English friend, Holly, are different.

Right off the bat, Emily knows things are going to be interesting, when her uncle is somewhat like Sean Connery, and the farm hand, Ruaraidh (Rory), is a total Schottie, or Scottish hottie. The only thing is, Holly wants him as much as she does. Over the course of a month, Emily faithfully emails her best friend friend, Dru in the States, about her competition with Holly and the adventures they run into as they rack up points in the love games. From drenching sheep to rescuing two headed oddities, the two find they are getting more experiences than they planned on at the start.**** Readers both young and slightly more than young will get a laugh out of this book.

This book clearly points a way to gain that edge by differentiating my offerings from a large majority of my competitors. I've often thought that most photographs used in e-bay marketing are mediocre, at best, my own included. When I see a good e-bay photographic presentation, I recognize the selling power that it represents, but I have rarely accomplished it myself. Sinclair and Livingston have produced a terrific book. If you read it and apply the material, almost anyone (including me) can produce \\"above average\\" photographs for their e-bay marketing. The book is a quick-read, but provides an excellent reference souce for later application of the material it contains. I've read a couple other e-bay books by Joe Sinclair and one thing I like about all these books is that they have a nice clean easy-to-read layout. Each chapter in this book has substantial stand-alone value. A chapter that may be a trinket to you might be a treasure to me, and vice versa. In total, however, the book will have great value to any serious e-bay marketer. If \\"a picture is worth a thousand words\\", then several very good pictures make a powerful e-bay sales presentaion, indeed. My conclusion ... a great book, complete, perfect for practical application."},{"Title":"eBay Photography the Smart Way: Creating Great Product Pictures that Will Attract Higher Bids and Sell Your Items Faster","review":"I have a good grounding in photography and was hoping for more detailed instruction on product photography.

Since I'm taking photos for my e-commerce site I needed to have more advanced methods. This book is one that I keep coming back to as a reference as I worked and learned. As always when I find an especially useful book I buy it used from Amazon. Maybe someone who knows photography really well would not find this book useful, but I only needed tips on shooting items for the web. Not portraits or scenery or any other type of photography that I find taking up most of the \\"real\\" photography books.With no formal training in photography I have quickly learned to make decent pictures that inspire people to buy my items. I needed to photograph hundreds of items quickly and with high quality. This book is the best I've found so far among the large numbers of books on photography. I have learned to take good photos from the very start with proper lighting. But along with that I've discovered that doing basic photo touch-ups are essential, even if done in a batch process. I have to process up to 500 or more photos after doing a shoot on a new batch of items, about 5 shots per item. Almost any other type of photography would pay much more attention on a per image basis than this, but I don't have time for that. It's hard enough getting all of these shots onto the web and cataloged. If I only make a few dollars I am not going to spend more than a few minutes on that item.This book has some specific techniques that I found invaluable.

I have always been a fan of Michael J. Fox, as he always seemed so likable in every role in which he has been cast. His book is no different. His wit, charm, and self-deprecating humor resonate throughout this intensely personal memoir of his life. He is not only likable, he is a fine man who has come to terms with the hand with which he has been dealt and is making the most of it.The book traces his beginnings as a Canadian army brat, his father having been in the military. He tells the reader about growing up in Canada, part of a closely knit, working class family. He credits his short stature with helping him get his start in the theatre and film business in Canada, as it enabled him to play children's roles. From there, he did a segue into the United States, where he eventually won the coveted role of Alex P. Keaton in the hit situation comedy \\"Family Ties.\\". From then on, he was on the path to fame and fortune.Alas, the path to fame and fortune is not always an easy one. His take on his celebrity status is astute, and he describes the impact that it has had on his life, both good and bad. He details some mistakes that he has made while growing up, such as the drinking binges that were out of control and threatened to derail his life. He also discusses some of the good decisions he has made, such as his marriage to the intelligent and lovely Tracy Pollan. He also details where these mistakes and choices have taken him and how they have shaped him into the man he is today.The specter of Young Onset Parkinson's Disease has overshadowed his life since 1990, when he first noticed the physical manifestations of the disease by an uncontrollable trembling and twitching of his left pinkie. At the time, he was still in his twenties. He would go on to live in a state of denial for some time. When denial was no longer an option, he spent years hiding his disease from everyone except for his immediate family. When he finally did the television series Spin City, he let the people with whom he worked closely in on his secret., until the day came when it could be kept secret no more.In 1998, Michael J. Fox decided to go public with his diagnosis and prognosis and share with the general public his experiences with Young Onset Parkinson's Disease. He has been liberated by doing so. The book details how he has come to terms with the disease and how it has impacted on his life. He describes the disease in detail, as well his involvement in Parkinson's advocacy. He has certainly been an ardent spokesperson, directing his efforts to research fundraising in an attempt to find a cure for this disease. His celebrity status has served to put the spotlight on this debilitating and, eventually, fatal disease.This is a very well-written, compelling memoir by a very fine man, intelligent and introspective. He is a family man who has a deep appreciation for his beloved and loyal wife, who has stood by her man through thick and thin. He is also a devoted father to his two children. Though he has met with much material success in life, Michael J, Fox has managed to remain grounded and true to himself. This no-holds-barred book reminds me as to why I have always liked Michael J. Fox. He is, indeed, a lucky man."},{"Title":"Russian Tanks of World War II","review":"This book provides a good overview of the development of Soviet tanks from the early 1920s to the end of World War II and beyond. It also provides a good explanation of the Soviet's strategic military aims after the Revolution and Civil War and the tactics that these aims would entail. The tank was central to these tactics and Soviet armor design has to be seen in that light. In other words this book is not just a list of the tanks and their statistics.The book also provides a detailed background to the design, manufacture and use of each major tank type. The T-34 and KV-1 are given the most coverage, as is only proper. The book also includes, but does not overemphasize, some of the odd prototypes and experimental vehicles that the Soviets developed. The book concludes with a discussion of the legacy of WWII Soviet armor and tactics down to the present day.The book is attractively laid out and there are many good pictures and line drawings. There are also a number of interesting tables in the back of the book.Unfortunately this is a very good book that is marred by numerous instances of lack of proof reading in the text and one badly mislabeled picture (an ISU 122 self propelled gun is labeled as a IS-2 tank on pg 26). I was able ignore these problems the first couple of times but it kept happening and became a bit annoying.Errors and all, I read the book all the way to the end and enjoyed it. The authors obviously know the subject and I learned some things I didn't know. Even with the errors I give it 4 stars. If the publisher would clean up the editorial mistakes in the next printing this would be 5 star book."},{"Title":"Russian Tanks of World War II","review":"Finally, a decent well-rounded book on the Soviet tanks of WW2. This book covers the history of the development, use in battle, and future impact of the major tank designs. Assault gun and tank destroyer variants of these tanks are also covered, which is a real bonus. There are many good pictures which I hadn't already seen myself. Captured and lend-lease tanks are also covered. In my opinion, this is the best book, to-date, on this subject. It is not an encyclopedia, like one of the books on German tanks that I have (which this book stands proudly alongside), but one must remember that the Soviets focussed on fewer designs and variants, thus avoiding many of the production, attririon, and maintenance problems that the Germans encountered with so much diversity.A few minor nitpicks: While the main data is included, I would have liked to see more tables detailing armour thicknesses, slope, etc. Also, a lot of information is provided on the major tanks and variants, but some of the lesser known tanks are either briefly, or not, covered.In summary, I heartily recommend this book to eastern front armour enthusiasts."},{"Title":"Russian Tanks of World War II","review":"Overall a good introduction for those interested in the tanks that the Soviet Union produced as well as their design histories. A few problems persist in the fact that some errors are quite clear, for example when describing an Order of Battle instead of an artillery battalion an 'artillery division' is listed, the problem here is that artillery 'divizion' in Russian means battalion, whereas a 'divizia' is a division and at least one picture has apparently been mislabeled (as mentioned by a previous reviewer, on page 26).Aside from these errors there are many interesting facts and the histories behind each design is quite interesting and eye opening. Many of the first tank units that were formed by the Red Army in the 1920's contained only foreign tanks. When Soviet tank production began it was helped along and mainly based on foriegn tanks that were sold to the Soviet Union through various companies from England and the US. The Germans and the Soviets signed a treaty which helped the Germans develop their tanks on the territory of the Soviet Union and that s well proved helpful to future designs. But many of the better tanks were less so influenced from 'outside' the Soviet Union, like the T-34 and KV-1 which went on to be a huge shock to German troops during the first few years after Germany's invasion of the Soviet Union.Again, a good reference for beginners, not an expensive book and gives a good account of where the various tanks excelled and in what ways they proved inferior in in the midst of battle."},{"Title":"Russian Tanks of World War II","review":"Though the author as shown on the amazon page is different than the one I have (Tim Bean and Will Fowler), this book was a find for me. It covers the history of Soviet tanks from British, French, and American tank designs in the beginning to designs on their own by the end of WWII. The descriptions of how the tanks were designed were essential to my understanding of the Soviet tank warfare with its strengths and limitations.A side note, on The History Channel it was noted that the steel process by which the T-34 was made came from American technology, maybe something the Soviets did not want to acknowledge. There is no mention of that in the book. The Christie suspesnion system also was of American origin for the T-34 as well as other Soviet tanks, which was in the book.I noticed that there were no reference notes or bibliography by which facts and data could be verified and other sources acknowledged. I would have liked to see other sources for further information. There is a disclaimer regarding this on the copyright page, \\"The information in this book is true and complete to the best of our knowledge\\". Which is the only possible weakness in the book.I use the book whenever I run across a photo in a text where I do not recognize the Soviet tank. It is very useful for this."},{"Title":"Russian Tanks of World War II","review":"I was looking for general info on WWII russian tanks as reference for building my 1/35 models.

Reading it with 14 for the first time I didn't know very much about archeology. Through this book I got so interested in Archeology that I read many more books about ancient Crete, Egytpt, Greece, Sumer, and the Mexican civilizations. Although anyone who really is looking for exact facts can easily find them, it is not just a simple heap of facts. Its purpose was never to be a sober school book, but Ceram himself wrote that it is intended to be a &quot;novel of archeology that shows the suspence in reality, but lets imagination sparkle&quot;. Masterfully written this book pays it's respect not only to the masterfinds but also to the masterminds of archeology. This book will open anyone's mind to appreciate this fascinating science."},{"Title":"Gods, graves, and scholars;: The story of archaeology,","review":"If there's an archeologist inside you struggling to get out, here's an inspiring book.This is an old book and much has happened in the field since its publication, but since this book presents the stories behind past archeological discoveries, that is not a crucial weakness.It's great strength is the writing.

An intellectual's idea of adventure.I haven't been the same since I first read it."},{"Title":"Gods, graves, and scholars;: The story of archaeology,","review":"This book was first published in 1949 and then enlarged in 1967. Altogether it has been translated into 26 languages and read by many millions of people. It is easy to see why.This book traces the origins of Archaeology and those who were involved in the great discoveries. Commencing with the great statues of Pompeii, Troy, Mycenae and Crete, we then move on to the Pyramids - with sections about all those who became involved from Napoleon to Carter. Next we find the great Towers of Assyria, Babylon and Sumeria before concluding with the great Temples of the Aztecs, Mayas and Toltecs.This is a fascinating book which is able to give the layman an expert's insight into the greatest archaeological finds of history.NM"},{"Title":"Gods, graves, and scholars;: The story of archaeology,","review":"I first stumbled across this book in my parents' bookcase in the '50s. Now I'm in MY 50s and I still remember the thrill I felt reading about Schliemann's discovery of Troy, the translation of the Rosetta Stone...This book presents fascinating information in an interesting, but never sensationalized, way that grabbed this pre-teen and hasn't let go yet. I reread it every few years and always find new goodies. And because of it, a trip to Troy has been on my dream list for the past 35 years. Someday I will see what I've been reading about so avidly all these years...

The 482 pages seemed daunting, even for a small paperback. But, beginning with page three and continuing through to the end, I found this book a real page-turner. Ceram successfully and craftfully takes the reader through archaeology's history, captivates the reader with personal anecdotes, and is unpretentious with language and content.

It gives a concise but inclusive account of most of the ancient cultures known today.p 402:''Now, several of these pyramids located at different sites from Tula to Monte Alban have been discussed, yet one of the most important has yet to be mentioned. This is the Pyramid of Cuicuilco, which stands on a mound 22.4 feet high, situated at the southern limits of Mexico City. The Pyramid of Cuicuilco rises up out of a weird landscape of darkly stony aspect. At one time the volcanoes Ajusco and Xitli (perhaps only the latter) erupted. The god within the pyramid was apparently remiss in diverting the glowing flood of lava that flowed about the pyramid, for half the structure was drowned in bubbling muck. The archaeologists investigating this phenomenon called on colleagues from another faculty, the geologists, for help. How old is the lava, they inquired. The geologists, not realizing that their answer was knocking a world picture awry, answered: &quot;Eight thousand years.&quot; ...Yet late research is more inclined to consider it false.''"},{"Title":"Gods, graves, and scholars;: The story of archaeology,","review":"I highly enjoyed this book.

He shows the civilized man who yearns to learn more about his predecessor, and by extention more about himself. This comparison is an invaluable tool for a civilization--if only the Babylonians had had it!Some past reviewer seems to suggest that for every achievement of a man you must also list a proportionate failure. The truth is that as archaeologists, Carter, Layard, Champollion, Botta, Evans, Koldewey and all the others in the book were the exceptions of their times, and their merits deserve to stand by themselves. The preveous reviewer is in fact a fitting example of the kind of obstacles these men faced in their times.Those intellelctually inclined and with a positive outlook will be encouraged by Ceram to explore further into the past, and his book covers ample topics to start out in virtually any direction you wish to take."},{"Title":"Gods, graves, and scholars;: The story of archaeology,","review":"Although I'm not an archeologist (or even a history student), this book does give the reader a great amount of information regarding ancient civilizations and how we came to know all we know nowadays about them.It's written in plain english, and it seems the author was aiming for us archeology illetrates. Plus, true to it's subtitle, it's written in a way the reader feels it's almost a novel about archeology; and the investigators responsible for us knowing what we now know about ancient people are justly enough portrayed as heroes.This book is a little bit old, and I've heard for some friends who know a little bit more about archeology than me that some of it's statements are outdated.

It is pretty good, but the translation (original is in German) seems different from what I remember, also, there are quite a few typos. In addition, in the table of contents I do not see where the photographic plates are, so I am wondering if those are included - if not, my rating goes down. I have not searched them yet, since I would have to do quite a bit of paging to see if they exist or not.

Once upon a time, in Dubrovnik, Croatia, I woke up, washed my face, shaved, counted the pigeons sitting disconsolately in the rain on the house opposite, ate some bread from the pekarnica up the stone alley on the main road. Oh, yeah, I had some fig jam too. \\"Another day in old Ragusa.\\" I thought. It sounded like an Italian dish to me. In the Stari Grad (old town), it was dripping rain. I didn't feel like visiting any more museums, so I walked into a book store. My wife, from a faroff land, decided to buy a book by Dubravka Ugresic. I'd never heard of her. Just then, a dog ran in with something in his mouth. It was a purple turnip in the shape of a zeppelin. I knew what that meant when I began to read LEND ME YOUR CHARACTER, though turnips never rated a mention. Neither did zeppelins, so you see... I happen to be a big fan of absurdist novels, or even novels with highly unusual plots---Lewis Carroll, Nikolay Gogol, Amos Tutuola, Milorad Pavic, and even good old Jos&eacute; Saramago. Well, you know, Ugresic's sense of humor and absurdity didn't put me off. I don't like \\"guy\\" novels, though, never been any kind of fan of war, cowboy, sports, or Mickey Spillane type \\"my gun is quick\\" novels. Even Hemingway tires me out soon with his relentless machismo. So, tell me why I should fall in love with chick-lit. Nope, I don't. It's just a mirror image of machismo. The main novella in this book \\"Steffie Cvek in the Jaws of Life\\" was aimed solely at women. It's got something written all over it and that is \\"It's a woman thang, you wouldn't understand.\\" Fair enough. I did read it, though, because I was looking for something Croatian and interesting. Sorry, maybe Ugresic is a very serious writer, but these stories are quite derivative. Humor---check, but I bet she could do better if she didn't imitate famous authors so much. I know I'll be upbraided by people, especially women, who will say, \\"Aw, Bob, you just didn't get it.\\" But I DID get it, I just didn't think the book was very good except for the \\"Kharms Correspondence\\" which is all too accurate a picture of publishing and life, and for the writer's explanation of her work which I liked very much for its honesty."},{"Title":"Imperial Eyes: Travel Writing and Transculturation","review":"While I understand this book presents a challenge to the reader, it is a seminal book in several fields: Mary Louise Pratt's prose is clear for a literary theorist and her vocabulary/jargon is appropriate to the subject. _Imperial Eyes_ takes the reader through several stages of European travel writing, and the effects these works have upon European representations and constructions of the &quot;other.&quot; Pratt's strongest arguments deal with Mary Kingsley and Africa, in my personal opinion, but her work on Linneaus is important and relevant to history and to identity studies as well. As a professor, I would assign this book to an upper-division undergraduate course, and would expect students to have the ability to grapple with her argument and her prose. I recommend this book to anyone who wants to have a better understanding of the formation of modern European identity, the ideological underpinnings of colonialism, and the construction of the &quot;other.&quot;"},{"Title":"Imperial Eyes: Travel Writing and Transculturation","review":"Vituperative, scathing truths about the world they don't teach you in high school make this an excellent book for anyone who likes to uncover the scandal beneath social, economic, and political realities formed in history.

Princess and William seem to have a cold interaction, yet he claims he's in love with her, or could it be just in lust with her? The book gives the perspective mostly through William's point of view, but should also reflect the Princess to make their interaction and feelings towards each other more real. I think if the author wrote more of the background of the Princess within the story, then it would make the story more interesting. I've enjoyed most of Lois Greiman's books, but found this one needs improvement on a lot of areas. It was a dry reading for me."},{"Title":"Seducing a Princess","review":"I thought the book was good -- I like the mostly male perspective (although another reviewer was right in that a little more female perspective would've been better). This is a dark book -- the main characters were tortured, miserable people. In fact, all of the characters were tortured and miserable. I almost put the book down for the depression of it all. But I didn't because the writing was good, I wanted to know what happened next, and the story ended very well -- in fact, this ends the series of her 3 princess novels and draws everybody into its conclusion.

When highwaymen attacked their carriage, courageous perhaps foolish Elli, told the hostler to stride away from them, but the coach took a turn too fast and toppled. A lantern burned the carriage and its riders. The thieves caught up, but never stole her jewelry. Now in 1819 still wondering why she left and why he stayed silent when she said she was going, William vows vengeance.William enters Darkdowne, a den of iniquity run by thieves who attack him. The Princess rescues him and takes William to her leader Poke. William is fascinated by the Princess, the first woman to stir him since the tragedy and in a deep honesty to himself long before the calamity. As they fall in love while working on a robbery, Princess knows she has secrets that once revealed will send Will running back to either polite society or drink.The third \\"Princess\\" tale (see the delightful THE PRINCESS AND HER PIRATE and THE PRINCESS MASQUERADE) is a fabulous early nineteenth century romantic suspense that is a fitting climax t o a strong trilogy. The story line is action-packed yet character driven as William and the Princess struggle with respective issues that would destroy lesser beings and almost devastate them. It is with each other that they begin to overcome their particular trauma although new ones surface. Lois Greiman is a reigning monarch in the Regency sub-genre.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Seducing a Princess","review":"This book was told from a man's perspective which I enjoyed, butI found the story to be depressing.

Macpherson's &quot;Real World of Democracy&quot;. This book was well written and fairly easy to understand. It gave insight into all aspects of Democracy and how it exists in Liberal states, Communist states and underdeveloped states. He describes how Democracy exists in each society and what the main drives of the particular societies are. The book describes about the profit-driven societies of the Western Capitalist states and how Democracy is applied to Capitalism and how it was brought into the Liberal state. Macpherson writes, &quot;the Liberal state was democratized and Democracy was Liberalized.&quot; Machpherson then describes the Communist and underdeveloped societies and how democracy can and does survive.I found this book very interesting and it gave me great insight into Democracy and how societies across the world respond to it. Macpherson describes that Democracy can be possible in Communist countries, were one party generally dominates, by allowing easy access to join the party, fair representation of the people and critics within the party.The final chapters of the book greatly interested me, as Macpherson began to raise questions about Democracy, Society and Mankind. Macpherson tell us that Capitalism was responsible for creating the Unlimited wants of mankind which was not a natural attribute of mankind. He tells us that,&quot;An overmastering consciousness of scarcity had to be created in order to justify the capitalist society and to give it its driving force&quot;.He then describes how the liberal capitalist societies have placed emphasis on individual freedom and how they have denied full-humanity. He discuss that becasue of this decision liberal capitalist states are in danger and something must be done. He makes an interesting point when stating,&quot;I shall suggest that the communist revolutions and the revolutions in the underdeveloped countries, which together seem to threaten our way of life, may be the saving of it&quot;.Does this mean that a revolution of somekind is approaching to save society and save liberalism?? He also argues that communist countries who have rejected the market, have not lost power but gained strength. He states, &quot;Market power is no longer the sole source of power.&quot;Macpherson's main point in this book is to illustrate how Democracy survives and raise questions about the future of democracy. This can be summerized in my favorite line in this book which states, &quot;If men were angels, government would not be neccessary.&quot;"},{"Title":"The Real World of Democracy","review":"MacPherson was once an internationally-acclaimed thinker. He won much praise in Canada and abroad for his books. &quot;The Real World of Democracy&quot; is a short, dated book, full of irrelevancies and preposterous logic. Here McPherson argues that work in a society where free markets exist, even work in the public sector, involves dehumanizing &quot;transfer of power&quot; to those who own capital. He further assumes that such &quot;transfer of power&quot; does not occur in communist countries. This book contains almost no facts. It is one trecherous web of anti-market and anti-private property propaganda, delivered intelligently and rather carefully. The book illustrates much that is wrong with this type of political theorizing: untestable generalizations, one-sided arguments, selective avoidance of facts, etc. At the end of the book, he goes so far as to implicitly equate the power of the Soviet state with the power of individuals living in the Soviet Union. Absurd.MacPherson's ideology differs very little from that of Marx. He considers private property evil, even if he does not use the word. The conclusion of his book degenerates into utopian and absurd musings about what he calls &quot;abolition of scarcity,&quot; and about the &quot;moral advantage&quot; that communist countries were supposedly enjoying in the 1970s. In the penultimate paragraph he finally loses his cool and his starched pretense to objective rationality and raves about how the world has reached the era when &quot;morality and power will coincide.&quot; He then says that he knows he gave no practical (only theoretical) solutions, and, as a last gasp, offers a nutty advice to write &quot;your politicians,&quot; urging them to give &quot;nothing less than massive aid&quot; to poor nations. And mercifully, it is all over."},{"Title":"Earth Prayers From around the World: 365 Prayers, Poems, and Invocations for Honoring the Earth","review":"Thank you Elizabeth and Elias for compiling this wonderful book of earth honoring prayers.

Adams writes in the style of Ernest Haycox and Max Brand, among others. A wandering cowboy, between jobs, happens by the camp of a U.S. Marshal and his three prisoners whom he is taking to the \\"Hanging Judge\\". The Marshal and one of the prisoners has come down with smallpox and is getting weaker by the hour. The prisoner is even in worse condition. He has securely chained all three prisoners, and set food and water close by in event he cannot later tend to them. Jones arrives, and the Marshal prevails on the very-reluctant puncher to take a position of Deputy U.S. Marshal and deliver the prisoners to the judge for hanging. Soon after the Marshal dies. Jones takes off with the two remaining prisoners after the sick prisoner also dies. One of the prisoners has let it be known that anyone who gets him free from the Marshal (now Deputy) will be paid double what the bounty is on him. They are set upon by three bounty hunters who have them in dire straits till suddenly shots ring out in support of the Deputy and his two prisoners. Thus begins a strange journey, with the rescuing schoolmarm coming back to help instead of continuing her journey to her new school assignment. They eventually realize they are in love but it is a frustrating read in that area - the reader knows very well what is happening, but the lady and Deputy don't. It is a very-warm ending with a wonderful future ahead of them. I cannot recommend it too highly."},{"Title":"Alan Simpson's Windows XP Bible","review":"This book is a great assistance to understanding the use and features of Window's XP."},{"Title":"Alan Simpson's Windows XP Bible","review":"Great help for most problems.

Aimed at a mass audience, it is probably more crash resistant and easier to use than its predecessors.Its uses are probably innumerable, due to such a large user base. But the book tries to group the uses into various broad areas. Like printing documents or editing a document. You get a quick introduction to WordPad, for the latter usage. Simpson walks you through easy stuff like changing the font family, size and style. Deliberately, the editing program is WordPad, not Microsoft Word. Simpson shows enough to get you started, without overloading you with too many options. In fact, even in WordPad itself, I don't think he shows all its capabilities.These days, of course, a big reason for having a PC is to hook it to the Internet. Some would claim, and Microsoft fears precisely this, that the main value of a PC is for just this purpose. Anyway, Simpson devotes several chapters to your Internet interaction via XP. Like using the browser (IE of course) and sending and getting email.Lots more stuff is also discussed. Well explained, with a minimum of jargon."},{"Title":"Alan Simpson's Windows XP Bible","review":"I am not often moved to write a negative review. But paying $30 for a \\"comprehensive\\" 1200 page \\"Bible\\" on XP should prove more useful than a paperweight. Admittedly I have not used it a lot. But I have already lost confidence in its thoroughness. With hectic schedules, engineers don't have a lot of time to waste looking for answers in places that \\"might\\" have them.The very first topic I tried to explore was \\"RAID\\", a formidable topic that I had no doubt would be covered in an XP \\"bible\\". Out of 1200 pages, at least a few of them, or even an entire chapter, should cover the complexities of RAID on XP -- F6 driver installs, slipstreamed installs, benefits of mirrored v striped, hardware v software, tradeoffs, driver mechanics, ad infinitum. But when I looked up \\"RAID\\" in the index, I found but one (1) page out of the entire 1200 referring to the subject. And all that page did was give instructions on how to disable it. According to the author, RAID is a \\"server\\" issue, not XP, so the only XP-related knowledge you should need is how to turn it off, which is the recommended action for any and all XP users/administrators. WHAT?!?! That is flat out ridiculous, misleading, and wrong.What other vital XP know-how is missing or incorrect because the author never found a use for it or is simply too naive to know what it means? Frankly, I just don't have time to give it a second chance. Off to the goodwill with it.This so-called \\"bible\\" is a poor example, lending to a questionable reputation for any other [B]ooks that may share the \\"Bible\\" name. Publishers ought to think twice about what they are willing to pass off as a comprehensive bible.Sincerely,Mike Jalkut"},{"Title":"Alan Simpson's Windows XP Bible","review":"Has as a lot of useful information but is not as all inclusive as they claim.Not one word about how to handle .dll problems, for example."},{"Title":"Alan Simpson's Windows XP Bible","review":"I have used the bible books before, and they have always proven to be useful reference books.

If you're fairly new to Windows, then you'll probably find it useful, as it provides a good introduction to the new operating system. But this is hardly an XP 'bible'. It's extraordinarily light on for details, insights or advanced tips. It was also written while XP was still very much in beta testing, so there are large holes and even some incorrect information.

I purchased this book because i wanted to upgrade to Windows XP. THIS BOOK TAUGHT ME NOTHING!I have read other Windows Bibles by Alan Simpson and have found them useful; however, that is not the case with this book.I have several criticisms of this book:1- I read Window 98 Bible 4 years ago and am now upgrading to Windows XP. This book contains almost no new information and is in many ways, almost identical to the one i read 4 years ago.2- The information it does contain is so basic and in many ways unrelated specifically to Windows XP. The first 200 pages are devoted to explaining what a mouse is, the difference between a monitor and a keyboard, how to click on an icon and close a window, and how to read and send an e-mail.3- The information it does contain about Windows XP is so elementary and devoid of any detail. For instance, while describing a particular concept, the author will show a picture of a dialog box, then, under it, list all the tabs in the dialog box, followed by a one-sentence description of what each tab is. There is no explanation of the many choices within each tab and menu, nor any discussion of what the myriad of functions actually do.In summary, if you have ever had a computer before with a Windows 95 or later and are fairly comfortable using it - especially if you have read one of the Windows Bible books before - you will not learn anything, at all from this book.It is basically a carbon copy of the previous Windows Bibles, containing the most elementary, undetailed information about the Windows operating system, and even less information specific to Window XP.However, if your grandson just gave you your first computer and he doesn't have the time to show you how to use it, then this just might be the book for you. It even tells you where the 'On button' is.

My personal machines are all using W2K, and I'm perfectly happy with it. But I'll be buying a new desktop unit pretty soon, and at least part of the box will be running XP. I'll need a good reference book, and so I decided to review Windows XP Bible (2nd Edition) by Alan Simpson. While I know a lot of what's in there, there is some value for me.Section List: Getting Started; Customizing Windows XP; Managing Files and Folders; Printing and Faxing; Securing Your System; Power Using the Internet; Using and Creating Digital Media; Installing and Removing Programs; Installing, Using, and Troubleshooting Hardware; Performance and Maintenance Issues; Home and Small-Business Networking; Appendixes; IndexNormally I'd list each of the chapters, but there's 64 of them. It'd take too long, and Amazon probably would reject the review for being over the word limit... :-)The author calls this an intermediate/advanced book, as he assumes some basic computing skills before you get into the book. I'm thinking that a fair amount of the material is still beginner level stuff if you've worked with Windows at all in your life. That's not to say you can't learn some new tricks along the way, but explanations of files and folders is pretty basic. Having said that, the book doesn't stay at that level. The chapters on networking, digital media, and firewalls will get some attention from me when I get my new machine. Likewise, I'll also be closely reading the parts on system restore, performance tuning, and driver/device management. There are features in XP in those areas that I'm not up to speed on...Simpson covers a lot of ground in this book. There's something in here for nearly everyone but the long-time XP user or the hard-core Microsoft techie. This is one of those books that will used for a lot of first-line research. The answer will probably often be found in these pages.

Often, with the domination of Lonely Planet suggestions being taken by travelers, certain &quot;Gringo trails&quot; are forged and well trampled. Footprint gives the next best comprehensive review of traveling in South America, but makes the travler leave more to their own judgement instead of relying on a guide. I traveled with both my Footprint Guide and my partner's Lonely Planet. The LP is a better guide for nuts and bolts, but the prices are often inacurate because of the popularity increase, which rapidly rises prices in South America. But the Guide has its drawbacks. If you are extremely map based, then go with the LP. Footprint's maps are not nearly as good. Also, for specific suggestions on exactly what a traveler SHOULD do, LP is better. Bottom line is, if you can fit them both in, do it. Take the LP for those late night bus stops in a tiny southern Ecuadorian town, and take the Footprint for those days and nights when you want to make more judgements for yourself than the guidebook makes for you."},{"Title":"Footprint South American Handbook 2001","review":"I am a budget backpacker. I owned and used the 2003 S.A. edition three years ago and must say that the 2007 S.A. edition is not as budget friendly when it comes to accommodations. I am in South America for 5 months and left the 2003 edition at home thinking that the 2007 edition would have the same listings along with new listings. Not so. For example, one of my favorite budget hostels in Argentina that still exists and was once in the book is no longer in it. When I asked the hostel why they are not in the 2007 Footprint book they said that one has to pay several hundred dollars to be in it these days. And that's just to have a few sentences about the place. I have just about found each city's budget accommodations (i.e. youth hostels) on the internet during this trip because the 2007 Footprint just doesn't cut it in this department.Otherwise, the book does have good information in other areas. But I don't know if I'd be carrying this thick book all over the place for 5 months if I had known about its lack of budget accommodations listings."},{"Title":"Footprint South American Handbook 2001","review":"My wife and I relied primarily on the South American handbook, now in its 77th year (the longest-running travel guide in the English language, apparently) during a 3-month period of backpacking through Ecuador, Peru, Chile, and Argentina not too long ago, and along with other information we gleaned from a variety of sources (i.e. fellow backpackers, some maps and other material I had gotten off the internet) it served us extremely well. However, I can understand why some people might consider the book to be difficult to use in the sense that there's almost too much information and not enough informed opinion/recommendations about what the authors think you SHOULD do. In many ways, this book is information overload, and not opinionated ENOUGH! Some of the fun of reading guide books, I have found in my many travels, is listening to someone who has a strong (as long as it is well-informed) opinion, and then seeing for myself what I think. Also, SOMETIMES it's a relief to be able to turn off my brain for a while and just have someone TELL me what to do if I've got, let's say, just 3 days in a particular city.But, the bottom line is if you don't mind/prefer to think for yourself, are not particularly into listening to other people's suggested itineraries for you, and are willing to wade through the vast amount of material provided in this guidebook, then you will be richly rewarded with the Handbook, which is truly an amazing creation, and obviously a labor of love! It sometimes seems, for instance, like the Handbook has a detailed street map on every interesting (and even not-so-interesting) town in South America! Plus, listings of hotels/hostels and restaurants in numerous price ranges. Plus, \\"Places of Interest\\", listings of museums, information on excursions, local festivals, archeology, culture, language schools, laundramats, and just about everything else you could possibly need!This book probably should not be the main reference for those wanting to travel first class all the way (or to be led by the hand), but for the budget traveler it's great (Lonely Planet is excellent as well, and would be a fine companion to the Handbook). Just be prepared to use your brain while wading through a veritable jungle of information on South America! Don't leave home without the Handbook!!"},{"Title":"Footprint South American Handbook 2001","review":"From Planeta Journal - The Handbook looks better than ever.

The only problem is that unlike the Lonely Planet books, the handbook gives very little information about prices of lodging, restaurants,etc.which I feel is very important as prices vary a lot. So while the Handbook 2000 has some good information, South America on a Shoestring (or one of their country specific guides) is more essential especially when you are looking for a place to sleep at night. I personally don't use guidebooks to do most of my planning for my trips. But in a pinch when you get off the bus late at night in some strange city and you want to know what hotel to tell the taxi driver to take you, you can't beat the Lonely Planet series of Guidebooks."},{"Title":"Footprint South American Handbook 2001","review":"This Footprint guide definitely compares to Lonely Planet.

The best thing about this book is that it is based on peoples recomendations and not just hostels and guides paying money to a company (ie:Lonley Planet). This book goes into good depth on not only hostel and restuaraunts but also guides for the amazon, tour companies for Machu Pichu, etc... Without this book we never would have found Papa Rancon in the town of Borbon in the middle on know where. This book is a bit more exspensive but it is definitely worth it. The only draw back is that the maps are terrible. Real bad. But if you can hook up a good map before you go you should be all good."},{"Title":"Footprint South American Handbook 2001","review":"If you are travelling through a few countries in South America, then this footprint guide just cannot be beaten. Has all the fun topics and places covered like some other common guidebooks, but much more history, culture, food and accomodation info, all wrapped up in the same size package. My travel companions all grew to rely on Footprints' accuracy, and appreciated the lack of sarcastic, put-down comments that one other common guide often had."},{"Title":"Footprint South American Handbook 2001","review":"Although written more as a reference guide than the Lonely Planet equivalent, it is far more comprehensive in its list of available hotels and restaurants. It is very accurate too. Also, it does discuss areas to watch out for (i.e. crime) better than the LP. What you get in quantity and objectivity of information with this book, you lose in depth. The LP gives you more depth of the (fewer) hotels and restaurants it does list. They make good companions for each other, if you have the space in your suitcase/backpack!"},{"Title":"Footprint South American Handbook 2001","review":"I have only been in five of the fourteen countries covered in this handbook, but of those I have travel through, I found this all-in-one guide to be succinct, reliable and valuable. That said, it does not replace the comprehensiveness of a specific country guide. Basically, this handbook is a digested compilation of the specific country handbooks that Footprint produces. Thus, if you are only visiting one or two countries, buy those handbooks. If you are going to explore South America and want only one guide, this guide will be valuable.Each country section is condensed, comprehensive and reliable. Though smaller towns will be omitted, the most important cities, towns and sites will be covered. Each country has been segmented into regions, as noted by the country's map, and within each region Footprint covers the top two, three or four cities or towns in a region. Basic travel information is given at the beginning of each country.As with all Footprint Handbooks this guide has excellent color maps. In the back of the guide you will find ... exceptional color maps of South America. Also, throughout the book, I found the b&w; maps of regions and cities to be very good.Another impressive aspect of this guide is found at the beginning, in the 'Essentials' section, where there is a very good discussion of bringing and using a car/SUV throughout South America. This section also includes information on motorcycling and a section on cycling throughout South America.Though each country section does have a 'futher reading & useful websites' section, this is very basic. The section on health/vaccination is bare bone basic.On the \\"downside\\" I often found that the brevity of the restaurant and lodging remarks were so terse (or no remarks at all) that they were not helpful, i.e.,. Hotel Barros Arana (Chile):modern, or a restaurant remark: good not cheap, or a hostel: helpful. Also I find the intrusive paid advertisements for hotels, tour companies, hostels, calling cards and travelservices throughout the book (a half-page, a full-page, a quarter page) offensive. The purchase ... should be more than enough to make a profit, but Footprint chooses to afflict its readers with uninvited advertising to increase its profits.For those using glasses, the small type that the publishers uses will cause you to strain to read in low or poorly lighted areas. Also, the pricing for accommodations is a cumbersome rating system that could be simplified. It is not user friendly. There is no pricing guide for restaurants.That said, this is an adequate, to good, guide for those who are going to visit a multitude of countries while in South America. The information is current and reliable. Especially recommended for those that plan to motor through South America.

I had the Fodor's guide to South America and the Footprint Handbook. My experience was that the Fodor's guide is much better than the Footprint book for lodging and food assuming you are looking for something better than hostels and cheap food. If you are traveling with more of a budget than a backpackers, the Fodor's will serve you better.Footprint is useful for some general background information, general customs, airport taxes, bus station information -- general travel information. The Fodor's had slightly different information so using both of the guides was helpful sometimes. If you are looking for an alternative to Lonely Planet books, this is worth considering as it seemed geared for backpacking and adventure travel.The weight of the book is a drawback vs. the value you receive for lugging it around. Better maps would definitely make the book more useful. The historical information on various sites is fairly thin which is frustrating if you are interested in visiting sites of historical relevance.Overall, I would give this 3 to 3.5 stars for the usefulness.

I was a bit leery of checking out a relatively unknown publisher. Usually I stick with Frommers. Well in this case the weight of books was a big deal. I needed one book that had it all. Kindle based approach was less secure. Frommers guide to South America was full of expensive and mid-level places. I did't need a book to tell me that Hilton or Monasterio were good places to stay. But I needed a book to tell me where I could find a $15 hotel on a short notice.Having a Footprint on the road was absolutely indispensable. Losing this book was tantamount to losing a passport or a credit card. In fact losing a passport would have been better because nobody in South America sold this book. I also relied on HostelWorld to book hostels but only because I hesitated in arriving into an unknown city without a booking. Once in a city, it was very easy to look up a place in a Footprint and book it on the spot. Having maps for just about any listed city or town was immensely helpful. Overall, this book was excellent for everything: top attractions for each country, restaurants in all price levels, hotels in all price levels with well represented budget tier, logistics like bus schedules and bus trip times, travel agencies and approximate tour prices.

I bought this based on the strong reputation it carries here and learned too late I'd been hornswoggled.Pros:... 1. Nice hard cover and binding - the book is durable. It's also reasonably sized and portable.... 2. Good breadth of information in terms of cities/towns to visit; seems to include places farther off the so-called \\"Gringo Trail\\".Cons:... 1. The quality of the detailed information varied by author. Argentina and Chile, for instance, were not bad, but Colombia and Bolivia were often poor. This would probably not be worth mentioning if the latter wasn't so consistently flawed. I cite a precise examples for Colombia, which I even have page-numbers for as I noted them in moments of lucid fury:...... (A) \\"Eating\\" in Bogot&aacute;, p. 909: \\"Moros y Cristianos\\" is priced as a \\"one fork\\" (under $6) restaurant, but the plates are about $13 apiece; \\"Rock and Pizza\\" simply doesn't exist; and \\"Sopas de Mama y Postres de Abuela\\" is a chain spread throughout the city that is only open from noon to 4 PM - one would think a small detail like \\"only open for lunch\\" would be mentioned somewhere in the suspiciously saccharine review of the place....... (B) Transport to Volc&aacute;n del Totumo, p. 950: The guide mentions a bus from the terminal to Galerazamba that leaves in the \\"morning\\". What time in the morning? And how do you get back to Cartagena from there? The answers to such questions are left as exercises to the reader. Tours to Totumo, it says, will cost \\"more\\", but roughly how much more is again an unimportant detail (if you're curious, it will only be a buck or two, so you're better off going with one, unless you thrive on DIY adventure and stress)....... (C) Side trip to Minca, p. 961: The village is mentioned as a good place to visit but no information is given about how to get there. Turns out you have to catch a car at the corner of C11 and Car12, and it's $6000 COP to do so. Why was this information missing?... 2. No Spanish/Portugese phrasebook. What __is__ there in the way of language prep, the \\"Second Languages and Anomalies\\" section (p. 44), is useless if you don't speak the languages, and superfluous if you do.... 3. Descriptions of places lack structure and read like rambling reminisces of a grandparent, relying on vague, subjective descriptions, as well as undefined terms such as \\"high/low season\\" (it doesn't help knowing that prices are half off in \\"low\\" season if there is no definition of what months that actually falls into). A place will be described in the review as \\"recommended\\" -- golly! and here I was, navely assuming that if a place were listed in the guidebook, it was ipso facto recommended. But does the hostel have internet? Is it free or pay-by-the-hour? Is there a kitchen? Is breakfast included and if so, is it bread and jam or something substantial? Such things, which happen to be more useful and important than subjective descriptions like \\"good value\\", were usually only mentioned as afterthoughts, if at all.... 4. No place in the book for jotting notes. The page-formatting is claustrophobic, and the lack of a few blank pages to record recommendations or directions proved frustrating.... 5. Finally, and perhaps decisively, the book is rammed with advertisements. I noticed that every place that had a large advertisement was also listed as a recommended site. To the book's credit, these places didn't seem to receive preferential treatment in the reviews. It's also possible that the publisher refuses to recommend bad places even if these places are willing to pay for advertising. Nonetheless it's a conflict of interest, and gives the book more of a Conde Nast feel than it otherwise might have.Some of the negatives are part-and-parcel of the print guidebook business -- for instance, places can go out of business very suddenly after a book is published, leading to inaccuracies at no fault of the authors. I noticed the same problem with the Central America on a Shoestring LP guide I had -- mediocre and gimmicky as it was, though, in all honesty it was slightly better than this book was -- undoubtedly due to the fact that it appeals directly to a budget traveler and can therefore meet the demand more precisely, while this is forced to be all things to all travelers, and therefore more limited in its depth.Which leads me to the conclusions:... 1. If you're going to make a trip somewhere, spend a few months doing your research ahead of time using the internet and a notebook. The information you retrieve in this manner will be just as - if not more - accurate than what you find in guidebooks like this, and will certainly be more current and detailed. If you want a general overview of a place, you can always browse old editions of the guidebooks at a library.... 2. If you're going the hostel route, always ask other travelers for recommendations; if you can get local advice, that's obviously nice, although most locals in places like South America usually don't have the luxury of doing much travel (and what they do see is just as touristy as what you'll see).... 3. When arriving at a new city or town there are almost always tourist offices that hand out free maps. These are always better than the maps in the guidebook and they're free. In the event that the town you're in doesn't have a tourist office (e.g. Puente del Inca in west Argentina), that's because it's too small to need one.Should you be pressed for time and desperate for the sort of safety net a guidebook provides, this book serves as well as any other -- although, as I've taken pains to point out, that won't always be a good thing."},{"Title":"Footprint South American Handbook 2001","review":"My husband and I traveled through South America for 4 months and had both the Lonely Planet South America on a Shoestring and the Footprint guide.

We stand to gain tremendous lesson's by witnessing children in action. How often have you been stopped dead in your tracks by the unedited words of a child, smiled at their carefree attitude toward life or awed their determination to achieve peace? We've grown up beyond the reason. The accompanying Bible passages in this book cement the authors' perceptive observations. This book is packed with big messages in small bites. I think every religious education program for children should make this book a recommended read for the parents. It's true -- our best teachers are pure in heart and spirit and you need look no further than your own child to find the real meaning of spirituality."},{"Title":"Dancing in the Aisle: Spiritual Lessons We'Ve Learned from Children","review":"Dancing in the Aisle is the type of book to read and then return to time and again to savor. Each short passage represents a child's view of the world and reminds us of the lessons to be learned from children. What I appreciated most about the book is that, while the lessons are relayed through a child's perspective, the authors don't take an overly simplistic approach to their topic. They remind us of the complexity of our lives and acknowledge that self-reflection and communication are necessary if we wish to return to this childlike way of being in the world."},{"Title":"Dancing in the Aisle: Spiritual Lessons We'Ve Learned from Children","review":"In Dancing In The Aisle, Rochelle Melander and Harold Eppley collaborate to show how adults can learn important spiritual lessons by opening themselves to the children around them. By witnessing how children relay messages in unsubtle terms, without fear of potential consequences or care of offense, adults can learn to resist being too conscious of boundaries, rules, and restraints toward acting lovingly. Dancing In The Aisle effectively presents a unique perspective on spontaneous expression of Christian spiritual values through captivating real-life stories about children. Each chapter concludes with meditation that can be used for personal reflection and for family discussion. A scripture passage accompanies each meditation, followed by questions and a &quot;challenge&quot; for readers to further explore how the readings can be applied to their personal spiritual journey. Dancing In The Aisle is ideal for personal inquiry, small group study, and family education in Christian values and expression."},{"Title":"Dancing in the Aisle: Spiritual Lessons We'Ve Learned from Children","review":"This is an excellent book with lovely images and thoughtful prose.

Not real as in \\"just like you and me\\", but real as in strong, weak, smart, dumb, driven and driving. Jan Little wants to homestead, and is not deterred by minor facts such as a 3 year old daughter, impending blindness and deafness, and other inconveniences. She pairs with a demanding, selfish, egotistical and very knowledgeable man, and off they go into the Mexican and Brazilian wilderness. In the process, through Jan's excellent memory and John Man's succinct writing, we see a life that not many of us are likely to see in person.I read this while floating down the Amazon River (note there is no \\".com\\" there), and was, to put it mildly, blown away by the account.

It is about triumphing over blindness and deafness and living in an environment that very few able-bodied people would be able to endure for days, much less years.Both Jan Little's daughter and husband died in the jungle and there were questions about the circumstances.

The maestro puts his experience of yesteryears with the accuracy of present day. Insights and the minute details is what makes him one of the greatest prolific writers of all time. One needs to look at the world of Nirad-babu to fully appreciate his work without marring your thoughts without your prejudices. If anyone, wants to get lost in the laid-back life of Bengal, this is where your quest should end. I wish he could have more writings in English so that more people could appreciate the master."},{"Title":"The Autobiography of an Unknown Indian","review":"Nirad Chaudhuri was often unfairly dismissed in his lifetime as a 20th-century equivalent to the notorious mimic men evoked in Macaulay's infamous &quot;Minute on Indian Education&quot;: he adopts the attitudes of the British ruling class during the Raj so thoroughly he might at a casual glance be dismissed as such. But Chaudhuri's fierce and iconoclastic intelligence makes him far much more: a singular and independent thinker, and in truth a true original. This book, his masterpiece, is a brilliant semi-autobiographical study of the political situation of the first half of the Indian twentieth century. It works best in the lovely and lyrical opening hundred pages, which give a very evocative sense of his Bengali childhood. Unfortunately later, when Chaudhuri surrenders reminiscence for political analysis, he becomes more tedious than illuminating (you get the suspicion that, were you to visit him as Ian Jack , who provided the book's fine introduction, you would have been compelled despite yourself to check your watch discreetly during one of Chaudhuri's lengthy and self-satisfied tirades)."},{"Title":"The Autobiography of an Unknown Indian","review":"I took Chaudhuri's autobiography along on both legs of a cross-country plane trip. Good choice: this tale of old Bengal is sufficiently remote from the cares and demands of my ordinary life, I would have been a long time getting to it at home. But the constraints of coach class are just the place to come to terms with its prickly, difficult and high-principled author. At 535 pages, the book is not short, but I don't think I would want it shorter. Chaudhuri has a big subject -- not just himself, but the whole of a culture -- and you need this breadth to capture it. Besides, it is not really one book; it is at least three. It is a bildungsroman: the story of a boy's maturation in a dark time. It's a magic-lantern guided tour through the Bengal of his youth, now irretrievably lost in the mists of history. Finally it is a shrewd and challenging--and highly personal--account of life under British rule. As they say on SNL, it's a candy mint /and/ a breath mint, a floor wax and a dessert topping.More specifically--Chaudhuri is full of (pardonable?) rage against the gobsmacking cheek of the old-fashioned British occupiers, their pretense and their presumption. But he is the product of a British education, the child of Mill and Burke, and at the end of the day, he wouldn't have it any other way. Such a dual perspective makes him at best a a reluctant and critical onlooker in the great subcontinental uprising. It positions him as a critic of even that most untouchable of 20th Century icons, Mahatma Gandhi. Indeed, far from wishing for less of a book from Chaudhuri, still when it comes to politics, I can only wish there were more (I haven't read &quot;They Hand, Great Anarch!&quot;, his other big book, which I gather is a kind of a pendant to this one). Still, it's a gift as it is. &quot;India has merged,&quot; he says near the end of this great work &quot;in the stream of European expansion, and forms part of those portions of the world which constitute a greater Europe, which, as I see it, will ultimately come to mean the whole world.&quot; Maybe. At least from the standpoint of 1951 when he first published, it seems prescient. And it is wonderful to have him along as a guide."},{"Title":"The Autobiography of an Unknown Indian","review":"This voluminous autobiography of Nirad Chaudhuri runs to 600+ pages on a book size that is larger than a pocket book. It is characterized by the author's keen sense of observation, with indication in every page, of his erudition especially in English literature, so much so that sometimes it becomes difficult for the lay reader to grasp the full purport of his account without the reader's own ability to appreciate the generous quotations from literary works of the Victorian Era.As a fellow Indian and coming from a family background similar to Nirad's (middle class, emphasis on morality and education during formative years, etc), the book is very engaging in that I could \\"live through\\" what the author recounts of his immediate and extended families, his home, town, school, teachers and life in general, although I come from a region in India far removed from East Bengal (which by the way was not a separate country then) both geographically, linguistically and to some extent culturally too.I have found a few things striking in Nirad's life, family and the general milieu that he grew up in: amazed by his liberal upbringing even in \\"those days\\" - especially his mother's independent nature and \`going against the grain' that too for a woman; my confirmation of the Bengali's pre-eminent position amongst Indians in matters of literature (as well as art). People, I mean the educated class, would quote from literary works in everyday conversations and arguments; surprised by, how Bengali intelligentsia had fallen head over heels with Shakespeare's works.The book is more a treatise than an autobiography - a treatise on Indian polity at that time, Indian history and Hinduism - all these are obviously loaded topics and one cannot expect profound treatment of the subjects but the author gleans on all these topics with ease and offers his own well formulated views - views that sometimes prove difficult to digest. Nirad comes across as opinionated at times, but if one reads him carefully one appreciates that these are opinions formulated with sufficient ground. But, personally I feel he has been uncharitable to Hinduism and the East in general. He makes no secret of his unabashed adulation of the West and its ways but being the inveterate critic that he is, doesn't hesitate to wield his whip against the English and Westerners in general. Nirad is even caustic in his remarks, especially of Hindus and Hinduism. He is definitely a confirmed liberal but one does not understand why that should mean the foreigner is right most of the times. He conveniently fails to mention the West's fallacies. Instead, he never missed an opportunity to point out the \`civilizing' effect of the West on India and Indians. Did not the West learn anything? One fails to understand why the author is silent on the storied spirituality of the East and India in particular. (I have not read any of the author's other works, so I make this remark with some caution). Similarly, about Turks, Persians and other Muslim invaders. The meekness of Hindus in the face of the marauding Muslim invaders is something that no Indian is proud about, but Nirad could have taken a moment to condemn that it was patently wrong to desecrate religious places of the vanquished. He mentions proselytization in passing but could have taken a harder stance against it.Another astonishing feature about this \\"autobiography\\" is, while the author provides a graphic description of his childhood and of the places where he spent his childhood, it is totally opaque when it comes to throwing light on his later years. His silence on his career should lead one to believe that he had nothing to be proud of nor even enjoyed it. He brooks no hesitation in admitting his total dislike of his first job which was dreary to say the least, albeit better paying than that of a college professor that he had hoped to become. The reader is unable to fathom why Nirad, while very clear as a student about his career ambition to become a professor, did not complete his Master's degree knowing very well that one could not hope to fulfill this ambition without the said degree. He attributes his lack of aspiration to his inability to concentrate, in spite of completing his Bachelor's in flying colors. Given his scholarly achievements in the literary field and his penchant for scholarly reading, one would have thought that he could take to advance studies like a duck taking to water. The reader is not clear about the exact reasons for this anomalous development in Nirad's life except guessing that he wanted to study in \\"his own terms\\" and did not want to be straight jacketed into any particular regimen or \`syllabus', howsoever enticing the rewards were to be. Personally I am filled with pity for the author on this count - not only because he could not, or rather did not pursue something that would have been natural to his being, but also because a large swath of his life became listless. I am coming to this significant conclusion about the \`listlessness' based on his silence on anything remotely connected to his career during, what would have otherwise been his prime working years. There is also no mention of his family life as a married man - how did he meet his wife, what kind of a family life did he have. He mentions in a different context that he had only sons but no daughters. I would not like to speculate the reasons for this silence but would safely assume that, perhaps the author wanted to remain silent for reasons of privacy.I also have a complaint against the publisher (Jaico Books) - they have not cared to provide any footnotes whatsoever nor translations of the French/German quotations from books that Nirad quotes liberally. The most that has been done is italicizing non-English words.Lastly, in spite of disappointments on several counts as already mentioned, I would give a thumbs up to this work without any hesitation. My reasons are rich language, scholarship and the close insight into Indian consciousness as it developed through the 19th and the first half of 20th century. The author's views appeal to a rational mind and is a direct hit at the parochial minded.It is a book I would recommend every Indian to read.- Anand D N, Dec 28th 2011"},{"Title":"The Autobiography of an Unknown Indian","review":"I cannot recommend this book highly enough for anyone interested in Indian history, British colonialism, Bengali renaissance, cultural effects of Islam in India, etc.I have rarely read a book so quickly and been so engrossed. The final chapter gives the reader a sense of the long arc of Indian history. Well worth the read and fascinating.Erudition flows through these pages."},{"Title":"The Autobiography of an Unknown Indian","review":"A classic, informative and detailed book - not easy reading. The author is a middle class Indian intellectual, deeply critical of his country and its leadership. In particular he is alienated from Ghandi on a personal and intellectual level, breaking ranks with the overwhelming numbers of the Indian public who revers Ghandi and puts hi almost beyond criticism.The massive amount of detail in this book may be off-putting to some readers, but any sections that seem tedious or irrelevant to the reader may be skipped, Separate the wheat from the chaff and this book is well worth a little effort."},{"Title":"The Autobiography of an Unknown Indian","review":"I enjoyed most of this book, though the first part was more engrossing (about his childhood in Bengal). After he moved to Calcutta, the political analysis became much more and descriptions of detailed events in his own life, less. Also there are some pages in a row now and then with long-winded descriptions of, say, street-by-street buildings in Calcutta, or books he liked and comments regarding the authors. The final part was all about politics, which started to be downright tedious (to be fair, I am not a big fan of politics). The book as a whole is, however, very valuable for the mountain of information it contains."},{"Title":"Algebra 2: Practice Book: Additional Practice for Every Lesson: Prentice Hall Mathematics","review":"Here's what Customer Service at Pearson/Prentice Hall had to say when I inquired about the answer key for this workbook: \\"We do apologize the answer key is in the Teachers Resource Kit only and not sold separately.

This book found its way to me and I discovered such valuable information about myself and my husband. The author is genuine and inspiring. It was a \\"happy accident\\" for this book to fall in my lap.I reccommend it to those that already have a relationship to deepen what you have and to those who are not in a relationship as a way to create a fulfilling one. Great read."},{"Title":"Gods and Goddesses in Love: Making the Myth a Reality for You","review":"Gods and Goddesses in Love by Agapi Stassinopoulos is a dream read. Informative, honest, fun, sexy and transformational, I have been using what I learned about the archtypes literally each and every day. Agapi helped me understand my marriage in a way I had not imagined. She helped me understand other people's relationship both personal and celebrity. She also invoked in me a new sense of who I am, all the aspects combined! and an awareness of how to use my strength, my wisdom, my feminine, my nurturer, my creativity, my magic to make all my dreams come true. Her willingness to share her own story was inspirational. This book is a gem. And she is a true goddess."},{"Title":"Gods and Goddesses in Love: Making the Myth a Reality for You","review":"Agapi's book is both inspiring and informative. Having studied mythology for many years, I found new fun aspects of the gods and goddesses to contemplate and perhaps even to incorporate. Desire, love, and passion are marvelously complex; Agapi's approach offers useful tools of awareness for self and others, plus ways to enhance and enrich the heavenly experience of being In Love. It's my new favourite gift for birthdays, engagements, and weddings."},{"Title":"Gods and Goddesses in Love: Making the Myth a Reality for You","review":"I didn,t like it, to me it's too new age. I preferred the book by Jean Shinoda Bolen Goddesses in every woman or The gods of greece by Arianna Huffington which is beautifully illustrated with modern art."},{"Title":"Gods and Goddesses in Love: Making the Myth a Reality for You","review":"Gods and Goddesses in Love is a very informative book if you want to know all about your personality. I found out a lot about myself and personality, along with past relationships. I understood why some things were they way they were in the past. And why I feel the way I feel now. I just wish she would've added Cronus as one of the gods for someone's personality type. (lol)."},{"Title":"Gods and Goddesses in Love: Making the Myth a Reality for You","review":"After taking the quiz in Gods and Goddesses in Love, I gained valuable insights into my relationship with my husband (and with myself)! I have always been intrigued by Greek mythology, and Agapi Stassinopolous brings it to life. She explains to readers how the characters' qualities play out in our own behavior and that of our loved ones. My husband and I enjoy a happy relationship, and I still learned a great deal from this fun-to-read and engaging book. Women (and men!) who hope to be more self-aware and to attract a wonderful partner would do well to read it."},{"Title":"Hawaii The Big Island Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"This is an excellent guide book of The Big Island! It has so much great information!! I will be going to The Big Island in April 2008 for the first time. I can't imagine going without this book! Best guide book! Thank you!"},{"Title":"Hawaii The Big Island Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"Reading the book itself was like experiencing everything the author had while researching it, the writing is candid, humorous, insightful. It made our three day (I know, short) trip to the Big Island a great success. Except for one thing: the winds that the author describes as being strong in the afternoon on the Kohala coast are actually strong in the morning, but (according to our hotel) only in the summer (around September). If you spend such a short time on the island, this book is totally worth it. I just wish we had been considered \\"locals\\" like him, because in the low season (September), Hawaiians just aren't as friendly. There were hardly any tourists (weather is less predictable, it's past the main travel season in both US and Asia) and the locals appeared to be enjoying their time away from the crowds. But that's our experience, and don't let it stop you from buying this guide."},{"Title":"Hawaii The Big Island Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"We have two vacation rentals on the Big Island and we recommend this book in every initial email we send to prospective renters.

It is not only well written, but full of fun. We took advantage of a great deal of information found in the book and had the best vacation of our lives.

We haven't been there since 1975 so we wanted to get an idea of the latest and greatest things to do there. We have used the \\"Revealed\\" series of books for Kauai and Maui. We have found these books to be very helpful and invaluable to finding some of those \\"little known\\" but wonderful places on each of these islands. We have been to the islands many times and we always find the \\"revealed\\" guidebooks helpful."},{"Title":"Hawaii The Big Island Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"I have all the guidebooks of Hawaii written by Andrew Dougthty and I think they are the best ones.

It had such delicious food and unique atmosphere. Great travel guide."},{"Title":"Hawaii The Big Island Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"This guidebook is excellent. It is very informative, exact, and full of humor. The maps are a big help to find places. We also enjoyed the stories and legends."},{"Title":"Hawaii The Big Island Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"Extremely conversational style so it reads well all by itself. It's even better if read aloud as drive, e.g. Saddle Road to Mauna Kea Observatory (which truly is just like riding a roller coaster in your rental car. It's even better if you take it fast as you try to get someone out of danger for Acute Altitude Sickness!)Gives concise history to better understand what the island has gone through with the relative cultural upheavals. Gives Must Sees/Must Do's and how to not get taken. One caveat: may not always tell you when you really want a 4-wheel drive rather than that rental car.Quite Enjoyable for just reading, too.P.S. If you forget to get this before you go, just pick up a copy at Costco!"},{"Title":"Hawaii The Big Island Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"Invaluable as 1) a pre-visit resource for both background and depth of understanding on the what, where, who and how to best experience the Big Island: 2) for use on-the-move to guide you to the rich (and away from the wary) experiences, and help you get the most of your overall visit; 3) to help explain to others, upon your return home, just what you did, what you saw, what you felt during your visit - and why you will be going back; and 4) a gift of compass and wisdom, which is now combined with your own annotations and experiences, to pass on to the next person you know (and now convinced) who will now be visiting the Big Island too.Oh yes, and it is entertaining as heck!Glad I used it, glad I can tell you about it!Enjoy on your own special journey!"},{"Title":"Hawaii The Big Island Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"Even the Locals we met on the trip use this book to find things to do when they have visitors. We were there during the 6.9 earthquake and it came in handy to find stores open and potential closed roads"},{"Title":"Hawaii The Big Island Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"I just returned from 9 days on the Big Island and found this \\"Revealed\\" book and the Moon Handbook to be my two best resources (I brought a total 5 guidebooks with me). I used the Moon Handbook predominantly on the windward side while I was staying in Volcanoes Nat'l Park and the \\"Revealed\\" book predominantly on the leeward side while I was staying in Kona. I used the dining recommendation from both books.I had pre-booked my accommodations, so I did not use that section of the book, although I looked up my condo and found their review accurate.Contrary to the comments of another reviewers (probably written a couple of editions ago) I did not find that the authors encouraged illegal or unethical activity, although they do emphasize that public beach access is the law in Hawaii. However, as noted, I did notice that many, many of the other tourists were carrying around copies of this book.This book was particulary helpful when trying to find beaches to play & snorkel - they are listed in order as you drive up or down the coast and the \\"gems\\" are truly noteworthy, although all the beaches were crowded since the local schools had let out for the holidays.The detailed maps were terrific. I used them quite a bit to get around. They also have a website that lists current updates and changes to their book, such as closures due to the earthquake last fall.The only critique I would have is that I could have use a bit more description of the hiking/walking required to get to each of the sights. Distance, elevation change/steepness (or stairs), terrain descriptions would have been helpful since I had a mobility-impaired grandparent with me. (Rather than \\"15-20 min hike\\" because that's dependent on physical status).Overall, I would highly recommend this book if you were only taking one with you to the Big Island."},{"Title":"Hawaii The Big Island Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"This book has practical, detailed information.

There is alot of information with complete details on finding everything there. I would highly recommend getting this book for anyone wanting to visit the Big Island!"},{"Title":"Hawaii The Big Island Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"Overall the book is excellent particularly the information about snorkeling and general things to do, the meticulious directions and instruction about what to do and how to do is just fantastic in this book.Beware because most the \\"hikes\\" they describe are by and large more difficult than they make it sound and will take you to some insanely remote and possibly dangerous places. In otherwords you could really get screwed following there advice. Just use common sense.In general I thought the section about places to stay was somewhat off in some respects. I was going to stay at the Mauna Kea but a last second date change forced me to stay at the Hapuna Beach Resort. They give the Mauna Kea excellent reviews and we visted it, it was a cool place but seemed packed.I stayed at the Hapuna Beach resort and had the best beach vacation of my life (I have been all over the world) and this book (internet review) completely panned the Hapuna with some whimsical obtuse comment like \\"The place just doesn't work for us..\\". Also I went to 1 restaurant in particular whose food I would not feed to my dog. They gave it an excellent review.I would suggest taking their advice about restaurants and hotels with a grain of salt and cross referencing some of their information. You will probably be better served this way."},{"Title":"Hawaii The Big Island Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"I have nothing but good things to say about this series. The maps (so many of them!) are much easier to use than most others, because of the topographic shading. The trail maps are detailed, and mile markers on the road maps are a great help. The layout is very handy, with sights arranged in the order you would encounter them geographically. Lots of good photos, since so many places can't be adequately described with words."},{"Title":"Hawaii The Big Island Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"I purchased \\"Maui Revealed\\" prior to enjoying my honeymoon on Maui. That book was an excellent guide and I used it time and again to plan sightseeing, activities, dinners, daytrips, etc. It never failed to provide all it claims. Now that I'm planning a trip to Hawaii, I am reading the Big Island book and I can't wait to use it for that trip. I highly recommend using these guides and I hope the authors consider making more guides for other U.S. vacation destinations (Yellowstone? Grand Canyon? Grand Tetons? Alaska? The Keys?)"},{"Title":"Hawaii The Big Island Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"Our family just returned from a wonderful trip to Hawaii, and can't say enough good things about this guide. We bought three others as well, and abandoned them not far into the planning process. We covered a lot of territory and saw things we never would have known about otherwise. We did not encounter any problems (or many,if any, other people) accessing these \\"hidden\\" treasures. The directions and maps were exactly right, and we found that we nearly always agreed with the assessment of the sites and the restaurants.

In fact, we met at least two families that also were using and raved about these books.The books are well organized so it is easy to research different activites or places. The author has a real sense of humor. They are a great read. He provides a range of options from easy to hard. For instance, you might explore some of the best coffee growing area in the world (Kona) or hike a little-known trail through a rain forest to view a volcanic crater (Hilo).

Pat DavisonKauai, Hawaii"},{"Title":"Hawaii The Big Island Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"This is an excellent book with a lot of good maps. The Kona side of the Big Island is developing so fast, with sprawl lining both sides of the highway, that you can't expect the authors to keep up with every new Walmart, Costco, restaurant, etc. The authors and publishers of other guidebooks are more devoted to reviewing hotels, restaurants, and other commercial operations. So use this one for planning sightseeing, Lonely Planet or Fodors for picking a hotel (or look at West Hawaii Today, the hardcopy/online newspaper, or just search for condo rentals), and talk to the locals for the rest."},{"Title":"Hawaii The Big Island Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"this book is an absolute gem for those love to travel. it's not written for people who likes to lay on the beach and sip mai tai all day long. it contains tons of travel treasures about the big island and if you are willing to explore, you'll see some amazing stuff. the chapters are self-contained and can be browsed through very quickly, the maps are illustrative and helpful (though not necessarily complete and has a few mistakes).I just came back from the big island and I have the following recommendations based on my own experience (traveling alone):1. get a real 4x4 rental, trust me there are places you want to see where only a 4WD can take you there.2. bring plenty to sunblocks and a beach towel (which I forgot).3. if you are tight on budget and don't mind roughin' it a little, car camp can be a great way to save some money.4. verizonwireless has coverage at hilo, kona and a good portion of saddle road.5. DO NOT get stuck, I repeat, DO NOT get stuck. I didn't but I almost did a couple times, it's not a simple tow out of some of these places.6. go see mauna kea before you scuba dive, especially if the weather is nice up in the mountain (weather can change very quickly up there). I waited to go to the summit and when I was ready to go the summit weather had turned bad.7. be adventurous but don't do anything stupid, there are a lot of places where you can get hurt.8. be flexible with your travel plan. the island is big and going back to the same hotel each night can be a pain.9. trust the book, these guys know what they are talking about.10. respect the locals, I found them to be very nice and helpful.11. respect the island, it'll treat you well."},{"Title":"Hawaii The Big Island Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"These books have created a new (sub)species of Hawaii tourist - the intrepid rental car driver clutching a little blue book. Like Mao's Red Guard waving their small copies of Quotations from Chairman Mao Zedong, this breed is an unstoppable (and sometimes destructive) wave of energy, pushing into heretofore rarely visited areas of the island to spread the \\"Revealed\\" doctrine: \\"It IS safe to leave the big resorts behind! You CAN hike around to find beautiful spots!\\" In doing so, this book and its thundering herd has shifted the balance of local culture. No longer are dirty looks and angry hand-lettered signs sufficient to keep the mobs at bay. These books, rightly or wrongly, says you can go, and so office-workers on holiday from Tulsa and Minneapolis now troop where formerly only the initiated dared venture. In doing so, this new breed may inadvertently force resolution of long running land disputes -- or even force state and local governments to actually maintain/clean/protect sites and lands in their care. Can one haphazardly written series of guidebooks accomplish all this? It's a moot question - it already has.I have used the Maui and Big Island books during visits to these islands, and have largely enjoyed them. First, these books are worth the money simply for the excellent maps - these are easy to read and show you just where to go. Second, these books are worth the money for describing numerous beautiful locations that simply aren't described elsewhere. This is not to say that these locations aren't crowded - just that you find a lot of blue-book waving zealots when you get there.Negatives:(1) The books are written in an eccentric and verbose style in search of an editor. The authors never met an aside, anecdote, pun or parenthetical that they didn't like. I imagine Doughty and Friedman as affable locals I'd like to have a drink with, but that I'd equally like to escape from after three or four drinks. These two have an axe to grind or a story to tell about pretty much everything. The reader will be informed that of the authors got stung by a bee while singing on a motorcycle, receive blow-by-blow accounts of visits to certain restaurants and hotels, receive harangues on big government, etc. This results in guidebooks at least twice as long as necessary. Some of the verbosity is fun - these are guides telling us about their home. Some of the verbosity creates guidebooks at least twice as long as necessary.(2) Another issue is the confusing organization. There is a main section describing an area, and then segregated sections describing hikes, \\"adventures\\" and other activities. If you're doing a hike that's also an adventure, you may need all three sections -- and three maps -- to navigate to the area.(3) The restaurant reviews are dispensable. The authors seem to love fancy meals at expensive resorts, beachside bars, and coffee shops. They cover the places that you would find anyway - stalwarts with big signs and parking lots. They throw in a few local places, but have missed a lot of gems along the way.(4) Since a lot of the information is meant to be \\"insider\\" and therefore cutting edge, much information is out of date. We searched in vain for several defunct restaurants and have found that the access situation for some areas has changed. As changes do not seem to be reflected by new editions, it may be that the sheer amount of information included in these books may be too daunting to keep up to date.Putting these negatives aside, these guides are valuable for the new visitor, so much so that it really does create a different species of traveler. Hawaii has its own brand of protectionist local culture. When you go to certain areas and get out of your shiny late-model rental car, you are almost certain to get a few hard looks and may see a few unwelcoming signs. It is very, very helpful to have a chatty, friendly guidebook telling you that yes, you can be at that spot and yes, this is public land. By the by, I have no idea if all the information about public access and public lands is correct - and I have heard elsewhere that it is not."},{"Title":"Hawaii The Big Island Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"While occasionally helpful, this books' pervasive sense of entitlement to the natural beauty and wonder of Hawaii overshadows its usefulness. This can be dangerous advice and lead to tensions between visitors and locals as well as destruction of that very beauty. Please kokua and ignore anything in this book suggesting you ignore private property signs or fences. Take all lodging and dining suggestions and opinions with skepticism and do your own independent research. Read through the beaches and adventures for ideas of what would make your vacation wonderful then get independent verification. This book also makes some hikes seem shorter and easier than they really are, and doesn't tell you how much time you will lose on a \\"diversion alert.\\" Lastly - the ranking system is completely subjective. What is a \\"real gem\\" and \\"not to be missed\\" is entirely dependent upon each individual. Know what you want do see and do, then do it. Don't let a book tell you what to do. Good luck and happy travels!"},{"Title":"Hawaii The Big Island Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"If you are going to the Big Island of Hawaii then you REALLY need this book. I found this book amazingly helpful when we visited Hawaii on the Pride of America. I saw MANY people on this island carrying the same book with them.The Big Island - known as Hawaii, not to be confused with the entire state of Hawaii - is a gorgeous location. It contains the southernmost point in the entire United States. It has black beaches that large sea turtles come up onto, where you can stand a few feet away. It has an active volcano that you can walk on! Many of these things are not clearly labeled with signs.That's where this book comes in. You are given precise, step by step directions about how to get somewhere, with the exact mile marker to look for and things to watch out for. You're told that you should NOT pay a parking fee in location xxx because the person there is just a huckster trying to get your cash. You're told to be careful of vandals in spot yyyy because it's known for having cars broken into. These are really valuable things for a tourist to know, that they would otherwise have no idea about.I found the information here just incredible. It meant that our day on the island was planned out very well and we saw exactly what I wanted to see, with plenty of time in between spots. We knew what direction to travel Volcano National Park in. We knew to bring flashlights in the lava tube!! That one tip alone was WELL worth the price of the book. Everyone else did NOT bring a flashlight and literally hundreds of people watched us as we went into the dark depths of the unlit lava tube, wishing they could come along too. If they'd had the book and read it, they would have known about the flashlights.The book is good about letting you know what is legal and what is NOT. We most definitely never went on private property or anything like that. The book even warns you about dangerous swimming conditions and advises you when to stay out of the water.Now, some might have the complaint that \\"well without that book, only 3 people would find the southernmost point - and now 30 people could find it with the book, so that ruined it for me\\". By that logic, websites shouldn't talk about locations either. Heck, nobody should talk about locations. Which leads to the question of, how would *anybody* find out about a location then? Is the aim to have nobody at all in the entire world visit the Southernmost Point in the US? Is it bad if people who want to go somewhere, go somewhere?This is a big island. It's the size of Connecticut. Everybody has different interests. If 30 people all love sea turtles, then I say all 30 people should know how to find the sea turtles and enjoy their vacation with the sea turtles. Heck, you had to fly thousands of miles to get TO this island, and you had to pay for the lodging either here or on the cruise ship. To say after all of that effort that only \\"certain people\\" should be able to go to spot X and that the others shouldn't know about it seems really unfair to me. Every one of us humans has the right to enjoy a natural beauty and this book helps us all make an informed decision about what to see.A must-have book if you're going to this island!"},{"Title":"Hawaii The Big Island Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"This is the most amazing guidebook. It's very detailed and gives excellent information and advice! I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Hawaii The Big Island Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"Purchased this guide book for our trip to the Big Island of Hawaii and found it to be extremely helpful!!"},{"Title":"Hawaii The Big Island Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"The strengths of this book lie in the authors' thorough local knowledge of the island. For example, if you're interested in finding hidden beaches, volcanic pools, self-drive advice into the Waipio Valley, and so forth, this is probably the best book for these kinds of tips. They are excellent at detailing the logistics of seeing island sights on your own (exactly when, how, etc.). They also warn about potential difficulties you might encounter, such as tourist scams or signs indicating a private road when the road is in fact public (Waipi'o Valley).It has some serious weaknesses, however, when it comes to its sometimes heavy-handed opinions on local businesses. One example is the Red Sail Dive operation in Kohala. I signed up with them despite the authors' description: \\"Groups are held on a tight leash. Get in, get out, let's go, next site. We received no briefing whatsoever.\\" Since they had a desk at the hotel where I was staying, I dove with them, and found this description to be completely inaccurate. I asked one of the instructors about that, and he said that it was like that 10 years ago (certainly not in the five years he worked there). This advice was been repeated in the newest edition, leading me to believe that once the authors form an opinion, they often stick with it rather than re-evaluating it for subsequent editions. It would be more accurate for them to say \\"When we last dove with them in 1996,...\\"Another glaring example for me was their review of the Hapuna Beach Prince Hotel, which they don't recommend. I more often than not stay at 4* properties, and this is one of the nicest hotels at which I've stayed. It's rated #1 out of 70 hotels on the island of Hawaii on tripadvisor.com (based on 229 reviews), so my opinion doesn't seem to be off-base. What's even more striking is that they recommend the sister property, the Mauna Kea Hotel, which is over 30 years older, has smaller rooms, less attractive common areas, and a less attractive beach.Their restaurant reviews also seemed based on the authors' limited experience. They didn't recommend the Tres Hombres in Kawaihae, yet I found this to be one of the only affordable places for a decent meal in the northern Kohala resort area (where it's otherwise nearly impossible to get a dinner for two without drinks for under $100). They did recommend the Grand Palace Chinese restaurant in southern Kohala which had some of the blandest Chinese food I've had.As a final example, their helicopter section doesn't even mention Paradise Helicopters, which not only has the lowest-priced volcano/falls tour from Hilo, but also has all-window seat flights (unlike most companies) with 2-way headphones. We found them (and got a discount) through Tom Barefoot.In summary, if you have a car and time to tour the island, you will probably want to buy this book for its precise and accurate geographical and logistical information. It also has good background information in an easy-to-read writing style. I would be very wary of their opinions on local businesses, however, since these opinions seem to be made on the basis of limited experience. Therefore, this book wouldn't be too useful for someone who plans to just spend a few days in his hotel and not rent a car."},{"Title":"Hawaii The Big Island Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"Best guide to the big island by far. None even come close. Not only details available nowhere else, but updates on line. This feature was very valuable as our trip included three days at the volcano and the eastern areas of Hawaii including Puna and the northern coast. Suggestions about restaurants and stops were consistently accurate and informative. Very helpful in planning a trip as well. Organization of t he book is supberb! If I were to plan a trip to Mars, Venus or the moon, I would search for a guidebook by these authors"},{"Title":"Hawaii The Big Island Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"We think that these guidebooks are the best for all the islands. However, be skeptical of restaurant recommendations. Also comments and recommendations are frequently out of date. Small example: 2007 edition for the Big Island recommends the Mauna Kea hotel and golf course which have been closed for over one year."},{"Title":"Hawaii The Big Island Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"I should say I'm not a fan of guidebooks in general, and indeed did not buy a copy of this one until several locals in Hilo recommended it to me. They were right-- it really is a key that can unlock much of the Big Island for the adventurous traveler. While it may not be worth the effort if you're just planning on hanging around the resorts on Kona side, this was the perfect guide for my wife and I as we spent a week based in a rainforest cabin several miles east of Mountain View south of Hilo. We traveled most of the paved roads (and a good portion of the unpaved/lava roads) on the island and saw far more than we would have without such a great guide. Beaches are listed counter-clockwise around the entire island. Trails are well described, and the \\"hidden gems,\\" while not always all that hidden, are almost always worth the drive/walk. Places like the steam caves in Puna, the Champagne Pond, and the more remote reaches of South Point we likely would not have discovered with our usual method of using a map alone. The info provided for such tourist-drawing activities as driving up Mona Kea to the observatories was very solid (even a bit on the conservative side) and our experiences with the restaurant reviews found them spot on (disclaimer: we ate in only four restaurants over an eight-day period, preferring to purchase food at farmer's markets and fish on the bayfront).On the balance an excellent guide book, aided in our case only by advice from a few locals and some friends who grew up in Hilo. My only reservation has also been expressed by others, i.e. that some of these places are really pretty special and should not be overrun by tourists OR locals-- they'd be better off remaining secrets for the few who live in the area and will take care of them. We tended to avoid places that fit that bill, and in most cases even the lava roads to the more remote sites were dotted with other rental Jeeps, most of whose drivers were also clutching a copy of this guidebook!"},{"Title":"Hawaii The Big Island Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"My family has a house on the Kailua Coast, and I have been vacationing there 2 or 3 times per year for the past 30 years. I thought we'd seen it all until my boyfriend bought this book. We've found fantastic hikes and other recommendations that we hadn't found in years of visits. If you are looking for a guide book for the Big Island, or even if you plan on staying at a hotel and don't think you need a guide book, this is the one to buy, hands down."},{"Title":"Hawaii The Big Island Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"I cannot say enough good things about this book and these authors. I purchased a book for 4 of the islands written by these guys. Our vacation wouldn't have been the same without the information in these books. Don't go to Hawaii without this book! I got spoiled by the information in their books, and will want a book (written by them) for every vacation I take from now on."},{"Title":"Hawaii The Big Island Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"I grew up in the Islands and this book gives the visitor a locals', inside view of the Big Island from the best food to the best beach to special hikes and off-track sights."},{"Title":"Hawaii The Big Island Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"Just returned from a great visit to the Big Island, made even greater by this book. Went from lava fields to rain forests in less than 2 hours and took some incredible back road tours that would have been impossible without this book. Found directions very clear, restaurant reviews impeccable and site reviews invaluable. On top of all that, authors have a very enjoyable way of writing, which my entire family enjoyed. Do get this book. I had also taken the Fodor and Frommer books, which I rarely opened."},{"Title":"Hawaii The Big Island Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"I love this book! It's so thoroughly researched and detailed and covers everything you need to know about the Big Island, including what to do and how to get there. Find yourself in a tiny, tiny town on the Big Island and wondering where is the best place to eat? Ask the book. Want to know the history of and the kind of food served at a luau? Ask the book. Need to know the closest way to get from point A to B? Ask the book. Wondering why there are wild goats on the side of the road? Ask the book. Not only is the author thorough, detailed and incredibly knowledgeable about Hawaii, he's witty. I appreciated the humor and personal tidbits the author threw in. When he advises you to buy mosquitoes or risk the \\"bloodletting of your life\\", he's not kidding - he knows from experience! We took this book everywhere with us on this trip and it never disappointed. By the end of the trip I felt like the author was a good friend - just one that I've never actually met in person. I will definitely be buying the other Hawaiian island books for our next trips!"},{"Title":"Hawaii The Big Island Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"With the purchase of Hawaii The Big Island Revealed I now have the entire set of \\"Revealed\\" books about Hawaii. I just LOVE all of them. To my thinking these books offer you an honest opinion of what to expect. The writer's opinion is fresh, honest, well written, and not biased by the hotels and/or travel companies. If you are going to visit Hawaii, and you want information that will absolutely make a difference in what you do - this book is a must!"},{"Title":"Hawaii The Big Island Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"A year ago I took a vacation on the island of Maui. Before the trip I purchased the Maui Revealed book and found it an excellent resource and one I would highly recommend for anyone going there. Now I am planning a trip to the islands again and will be spending a week on the Big Island. I didn't want to go before I had this book in hand.

It's a fantastic resource."},{"Title":"Hawaii The Big Island Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"An absolutely \\"must\\" guide to The Big Island of Hawaii. Whatever you want to know and wherever you want to go, you'll find this book indispensible. I was born and raised in Hawaii and thought I knew enough about this largest of the Hawaiian Islands to qualify as a tour guide. Never! This gives you detailed information on anything and everything you could possibly be interested in. Where to eat, what to eat, what to see and when to see it, whom to contact for special events and information --- this is an incredible publication."},{"Title":"Hawaii The Big Island Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"Awesome book. Very well researched. A great guide for adventurous people"},{"Title":"Hawaii The Big Island Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"I own three of the Hawaiian island guidebooks written by Andrew Doughty and they are by far the best guidebooks to use to plan your Hawaiian vacations, and to help you find different locations once you get there. There are many pictures, maps, detailed directions, and honest reviews. The book is also much more interesting to read than most other guidebooks. There are many places we would not have known about on our trips to Hawaii had it not been for these books."},{"Title":"Hawaii The Big Island Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"My husband and I have purchased 3 out of 4 of the Hawaii revealed books to use on our Hawaiian adventures and have never been disappointed. These books get you to the hidden gems of Hawaii like South Point and the Green Sand Beach and the dark end of the Thurston Lava Tube. It takes you away from the tourist spots to see the real Hawaii. The one time we ignored their warnings and ate at a restaurant they gave a bad rating, we vowed to never ignore them again! They are always right on the money with their reviews and ratings and tell you the good, bad and the ugly when necessary. We found Hawaii Revealed to be the book that we used the most and we followed it exclusively on our trip around the island. We head to Kauai this summer and won't be without our Kauai Revealed Book."},{"Title":"Hawaii The Big Island Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"We spent a week on the Big Island in November of 2006. This guidebook provided valuable information about everything from the natural history of the island to the best places to eat and shop - we really felt like we got all we could out of the trip thanks to this book. The authors were never wrong about anything - even the humorous commentary was right on. The pictures and maps were also invaluable. I wish all guidebooks were as good as this one."},{"Title":"Hawaii The Big Island Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"This is the second \\"Revealed\\" book for Hawaii we have purchased. We wouldn't go to one of the islands without it. Invaluable for everything from restaurants, tours and off the beaten path stuff to do. If you go to Hawaii without it you will be missing many opportunities."},{"Title":"Hawaii The Big Island Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"You won't find a better guide book for the Big Island. Everything mentioned in the book did not dissapoint. Although we could not find the green sand beaches based on the directions in the book and because there were too many paths created by 4 wheelers, which made the off-roading confusing, I still would highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Hawaii The Big Island Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"This book is fun to read and relatively easy to navigate. Everywhere we went, we saw people carrying the same book. I also purchased another Big Island book just to cross reference. It's confusing to tour around the Island. It's very large and the city names sound the same. This book is an essential tool."},{"Title":"Hawaii The Big Island Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"Book was recommended to me and I too would recommend it if you are taking a trip to the Big Island.

It was an invaluable resource in chosing the right things to see and do in the limited amount of time we had. There was great insight into both the virtues and shortcomings of activities and sights, and his commentaries allowed us to be prepared when we arrived at each place.Upon returning home, I had to have my own copy to own to prepare for our next trip, where we attempt to make up for the things that we didn't have time for the first time around."},{"Title":"Hawaii The Big Island Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"I just returned from the Big Island with a large group.

Conversationally-written and fun to read, it will definitely make you excited about your upcoming vacation. My only complaint is that I didn't see in the book that state beaches are closed on Wednesdays for \\"cleaning\\" and was therefore pretty disappointed after having made a Wednesday (day before I left) my day to beach-hop. Perhaps I missed this detail, but I consider it a crucial one and so it should have been posted everywhere very clearly.

Since the main attractions of the Big Island are largely natural, it can be a bit tricky describing where to find a particular site to snorkel or a certain waterfall, but this books does a nice job of trying to point out these spots. However, I have seen some of them mention in other books. The key, though, is that this guide provides detailed opinions of what is worth seeing and what is simply tourist fare.If you are looking for an active vacation, this book is probably for you. For families looking to take guided tours, this book provides some nice narrative about famous sites, but there are paperbacks that can better serve as reference material. For me, this was a great way to help budget my time, since it mentions some hypes sites that it describes as avoidable, while pointing to places and activities that pop up between major landmarks."},{"Title":"Hawaii The Big Island Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"Although we have a vacation home on island and have been traveling to the Big Island for over 9 years, this book was still an fantastic resource for us during our latest visit while hosting another couple."},{"Title":"Hawaii The Big Island Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"This guide covers everything you could ever want to know for your vacation on the Big Island.

I felt like I had a tour guide with me the whole time I was on the Island and I know my vacation would not have been as enjoyable without this book. I also have been to Kauai and used the Ultimate Kauai Guidebook which is every bit as well written, informative, and useful as this Big Island book.

Would highly recommend it again, and again for those new to Hawaii, or seasoned travelers."},{"Title":"Hawaii The Big Island Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"Purchased this to get a heads up idea on what to do when we made our trip at Christmas/New Year 2006/07. I found this to be very informative on almost everything we did! We found the reviews to be right on, and made our excursions more productive and less of a waste of time. The only thing that bums me out is that I loaned it to a family member and never saw it again. I highly recommend this book!"},{"Title":"Hawaii The Big Island Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"great book! it was my first time visiting big island, and I definitely owe it to this book! without it, I wouldn't have known what to do, where to go, what to eat!! highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Hawaii The Big Island Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"This book is such an easy read. The author has a sense of humor, too, which is nice. The reviews are very honest, and do not try to steer you into one activity over another. There are detailed maps to show you how to get to remote/interesting destinations. It lets you know prices, as well as what days to see certain things. I really enjoyed this book and am planning my whole trip around it."},{"Title":"Hawaii The Big Island Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"I studied this book inside out before going and made a plan.. This was the best book I could have had and am greatful for choosing it. The little scenic turnouts that I would have never found made my trip, and is owed to this book. If your going to a resort and staying there your whole trip, save your money for those expensive mai tais, but if your going there to see the island, this is a prerequisite, but this is a big island, so having a prioritized list of to do's will make your trip more than a driving experience..."},{"Title":"Hawaii The Big Island Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"This is the ONLY guide book you'll need for The Big Island! It's like having a local friend show you around. Everything was right on the money. And the online accommodations guide you access with the \\"secret code\\" found in the book is fantastic!"},{"Title":"Hawaii The Big Island Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"I have used this series of books for years during my many trips to Hawaii. They've saved me a fortune and they really provide honest reviews on several topics. I highly recommend them and have found them to be spot on."},{"Title":"Hawaii The Big Island Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"This is the absolute best book on Hawaii that I have ever read, and I have read many. There is a very good balance with photos and commentary, and though the descriptions are not always lengthy - that is to be expected getting in as many attractions as they do. I have taken it with me the last four trips to the big island, and I discover something new every time.I would never have discovered the green sand beach on my own, and it is my favorite now. It takes a hike to get there, but it is worth it! I found several remote beaches that I would never have known about without this book.One word of warning..... when the book states a site is hard to get to and you will rarely see any other people there, believe it. I had a very lonely nervous drive out to South Point."},{"Title":"Hawaii The Big Island Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"I have used this book on three visits to the Big Island. Insider's perspective has been valuable on where to go eat and where to see some of the impressive sights. I finally rented a 4 WD drive and did the Saddle Back Rd. and Mauna Kea summit tour. Saddle Back Rd. is not as severe as the book describes and can be used without much risk as mentioned in the book to go between Waikoloa and Hilo. If you plan to go to the summit of Mauna Kea, you should use a 4WD vehicle with authorization from your rental company contract to do it. We used the local rental agency, Harper Autos, who will let you go to the summit. Spectacular views."},{"Title":"Hawaii The Big Island Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"My family and I have gotten endless good advice from this guidebook. We have had this book on hand for 2 of our 3 trips to the Big Island and it has helped us make the most of our vacation. The book features clear, helpful information about everything: food, hotels, parks, beaches, tourist activities, and just about anything you could think of. It has very clear maps and tons of beautiful color photos. Another great feature is that the authors have reviewed nearly everything there is to do on the island, so you can skip the trial and error and get to the best of the best.Here are my personal must-see and do things if you're going to the Big Island: In Hawi, have dinner at the Bamboo Caf&eacute; and order the pot stickers. But I should warn you that you won't be able to order just one! If you have a 4 wheel drive, go to Kekaha Kai State Park on the Kona side between mile markers 89 and 90. Hike past the service gate, past an abandoned house, past two \`regular' beaches and awaiting you is your own personal beach- one of the best on the island. [...] And my third pick is the Hawaii Tropical Botanical Gardens. Pack a lunch and be prepared to spend hours lost with some of the most beautiful, exotic plants in the world and stunning views of the water.Some people have said this book reveals too much and intrudes on the local's way of life. I disagree. All beaches in Hawaii (yes, even the ones on hotel property) are public access. By law, they can't refuse entry. The book does not encourage law-breaking in any fashion and actually offers helpful advice to stay out of trouble while on the island. Such as, island police are few and far between but if you come across one, you might get a large ticket for not wearing a seatbelt. Locals have devised their own way to warn others of the presence of police- they flash their headlights! So if you see that, slow down and buckle up. Also, theft is somewhat of a problem on the island so lock up ALL valuables.If you're lucky enough to be headed to paradise, this book is highly recommended. Aloha!"},{"Title":"Hawaii The Big Island Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"We just got back from our trip to Hawaii and I have to say that this book made our vacation fantastic! We used this book to get to places off the beaten path, which really helped us enjoy our vacation even more. It contained maps to various locations (although we still purchased and used a regular map as well). It gave us clear directions to may 'off road' destinations such as the green sand beach and some other beaches.All-in-all, I HIGHLY recommend this book and was money well spent."},{"Title":"Hawaii The Big Island Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"I must agree with Robert Graves (other review) on the pluses and minuses of these \\"Revealed\\" books. They are the best guides to be found, but sadly some of the readers are making it bad for everyone with their indescretions and disregard of the land.That said, if you have an older edition, you don't HAVE to get this new edition....but this new edition does have a few updates and new things not mentioned in previous editions so it is worth the purchase."},{"Title":"Hawaii The Big Island Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"We have used Andrew Doughty other book for Kauai and his comments were right-on. His writings are so entertaining. We like how he is so open and honest with his comments. Looking forward to using our book on the Big Island come November. I would highly recommend his books."},{"Title":"Hawaii The Big Island Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"We definitely love our REVEALED guide books. They're very informative, covering the islands like no other guide book I've seen. The writers are honest (and not always positively so) which helped us decide what we wanted to see and do, and to know what we can skip for whatever reason. We found the remarks to be right on track with what we found while there. If you're looking for a very well written, humorous, and detailed guide book, this is it. We brought ours with us as we drove around, constantly finding things to do and see. The history and island lore made it even more interesting."},{"Title":"Hawaii The Big Island Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"This is probably the best guide to the Big Island currently in print.The Author(s) include great maps, honest opinions, and great detail not found elsewhere. We have traveled to the Big Island several times in the past five years and have used the 3rd edition extensively.The recently published 4th edition is disappointing however since it is almost identical to the previous edition. While some of the restaurant reviews have changed slightly and the newly re-opened Sheraton Keauhou Bay resort has been added many other reviews are outdated and show some \\"laziness\\" on the part of the author. I also disagree with some of the hotel reviews including the Hapuna Prince review which needlessly pans a fine property which is a \\"super value\\" when compared with the much more expensive resorts in the Kohala area. The review for the Kekaha Kai State Park and the Makalawawena beach is also terribly outdated. The author lists the road as partially paved and being considered for re-paving in the five year old edition and the current copy. In fact the road is virtually unpassable for all but full sized SUVs. There are craters in the road which will swallow a small car.Too bad the author thought it was OK to \\"rip off\\" the consumer rather than put in the time to truely upgrade this fine guidebook."},{"Title":"Hawaii The Big Island Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"We used this book for our week-long vacation on the Big Island. It's well-researched and well-written, with easy-to-follow directions and helpful maps as well as lists of best-bets for restaurants, shopping, and attractions. I would never have known how to find two-thirds of the amazing places we visited without this book, nor known the back stories and folklore about the various sites. I plan to use the rest of the series on our next island visits."},{"Title":"Hawaii The Big Island Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"I have used several of the books in this series, and they are hands down the best tour books of Hawaii. This book was no exception. All the books give list details, activities, and local information that you don't find anywhere else."},{"Title":"Hawaii The Big Island Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"This book is really the best. This book helps us find many places and plan our tours in Hawaii. The author is so truthful to the facts that he shows the actual pictures of the lava that should be generally expected, in the book. This book doesnot exaggerate the pictures. For ex: The book suggests that we should not believe in all those helicopter rides where you see pictures showing red color lava (in day time-with full of sunlight)with the helicopter so near by. Do you really think that the helicopter goes so nearby to the volcano !!! and the lava looks so red in bright sunlight !!! Let me tell you...during day time, it is almost impossible to see red color lava even if you are in few feet distance. You can only see the steam coming out of the vents...from such a distance. It is only during the nights or after sunset, you can see red color lava flowing.It is better to inquire with the volcano park to know the status and plan to go there.Because some times, even in the night you can't see anything except the steam. About the helicopter tours, I would say it is not a good idea to take the helicopter tour in Bigisland. It was worth taking the tour in Kaui though !! and that's what the book says too !!I liked the book so much that I tried to go to all the restaurants that were suggested in this book. It says about a restaurant ' U-TOP-IT'...which was a hawaiin style food... yet really tasty and you can have your own toppings. The food was really good. But, be sure to go either for lunch or breakfast. Because the restaurant is not open for dinner (atleast when we went).The only drawback in this book is the lack of complete maps. It would really complete the book if they can give the complete maps. But, I don't think this is a reason to reduce the stars/rating. Because, you can still manage with the information available in this book."},{"Title":"Hawaii The Big Island Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"We loved this book! The recommendations are great and very truthfully written. And the narratives are hysterical. It was like having the writer along for your own private tour. We followed atleast half a dozen restaurant recommendations and everything was always exactly as expected. We took their dare for a \\"doors off\\" helicopter tour of the volcano and loved it. The only suggestion we would make would be beter organization of their maps. We did find ourselves flipping back and forth through the book while driving down the road trying to figure out what street or mile marker we were looking for. This book was recommended to us by a native Hawaiian who uses it when she goes home for vacation.

The authors live in Hawaii and go to great effort to make sure everything they write is accurate by revisiting everything, retrying each restaurant, etc. with each new edition. In reading the book you experience the authors' passions for their home and all that it has to offer. Whether you are looking for that secluded beach with great snorkeling and no people or the restaurant that serves the best Thai food on the island, this is the book to get.

The big features of this book versus other guide books are great maps and numerous color photos. It is also fun to read. I was surprised to find restaurant and comprehensive lodging info included, particularly if you refer to their website for more info. They even have links to the properties' websites.The only drawback is the lack of detail on each of the hiking trails. Lots of description but the basic information such as length of the trail is often left out. It also seems the authors really want you to go to the out of the way trails. Many take all day or multiple days to do. Perhaps they are all like that on the Big Island and on Kauai (the other book in this series I've purchased.)"},{"Title":"Hawaii The Big Island Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"I found this guide to be very accurate and complete. I liked the way things were grouped with basics in one section followed by detailed descriptions (including mile markers) starting from one point and working their way around the island, then a separate section for beaches, activities, hikes and adventures. The writer's comments are very funny which made for easy, enjoyable reading too. The maps were very accurate and easy to read as well. I would have been lost with out this book!"},{"Title":"Hawaii The Big Island Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"The proAs mentioned in the previous reviews, you can't find a better tour book. For those planning a trip to the islands, you can't go wrong reading the Ultimate Guidebook series. Do yourself a favor and read them before planning a trip to Hawaii. It gives the reader/planner insights not found in any other tour/guide book. Only then would you know (depending on your traveling habits) what to plan for, where and for how long. The detailed maps with side road markers and accurate, no holds back-down to earth reviews of sites and places to stay truly make this guide book stand above the rest. Their accompaning website goes further in providing the latest in up to the minute information and accomodation reviews and photos of the sites.I bought this book as well as the other in the series a few weeks before actually booking the trip and I ended up booking much later after reading all the information such as the hotel was being renovated and under constant noise, plus it was quite further away from the activities that I was more interested in and getting a 4wd vehicle which they recommend for hard to reach places. Something I would not have done had I not had these books. Truly outstanding. Other guide books should be like this.The conThis book makes you want to do and see so much in the little time one plans on the island that I find myself wanting a vacation after the vacation. But hey, I wouldn't want it any other way. Being that everyone and their mother already knows that these books are the best one to have, some of the sights might not be as secret as the book entails.Bottom line,Get the book (or all of them if visiting numerous islands) and read them to plan out your trip. Then take them with you and have fun. You won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"Hawaii The Big Island Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"We are sorry we didn't buy this book the first day. If we had had it before we left the mainland, we would have been even happier. This book made our stay on the Big Island a really great experience. There is so much Big Island to discover and so little time for (most of) us to experience it, that this book is very helpful in helping you get the most out of your visit. It isn't perfect (what guidebook is?) but surely much better than any of the other guidebooks out there. The lady at Borders said the only book they sell more of is the current Harry Potter. She said even the locals use it."},{"Title":"Betty and Rita Go to Paris","review":"The dogs on their own are adorable, the words on their own are wonderful, the sights of Paris are beautiful - but put them all together in this lovely book and you get the dreamy package that is &quot;Betty &amp; Rita Go to Paris&quot;.

I actually am a lover of Paris and photography, and of course who can resist a dog, let alone two? I really hope the authors make this into a series, maybe London, Florence, Venice?

The first one I normally talk about is &quot;UNIX Backup and Recovery&quot; by W. Curtis Preston. But where as that book is written from a core UNIX world-view, this book is written from a Veritas Netbackup view of the world. Netbackup is one of the serious BIG THREE computer backup software packages on the market today, the others being IBM Tivoli Storage Manager and Legato Networker. There are other software packages out there for backing up lots of computers, but I wouldn't call them serious... not matter how large of market share they may have.This book, coming from the Veritas worldview is a good addition to the small, but growing, computer backup book market. It is good to see all the general backup principles laid down in writing and then discussed in relation to Veritas Netbackup.Myself, I am an expert with IBM Tivoli Storage Manger (ITSM/TSM/ADSM) and find the discussion of Veritas Netbackup good to know about. I have had fancy titles in the past, but the usually boil down to meaning \\"backup boy\\".The principles this book sets up for the reader are the time-tested methods of computer system backup and disaster recovery. Many people would be amazed by the fact that even after 9/11 many large businesses and organizations are still not taking the principles behind disaster recovery preparedness seriously. Books like this one will help \\"backup boys\\" who need to perform the tasks of protecting large-scale computer systems."},{"Title":"Implementing Backup and Recovery: The Readiness Guide for the Enterprise (Veritas Series)","review":"If you are setting up a new backup and recovery environment, or if you are maintaining an existing strategy, this book is a must read. Not only does it walk you through backup and recovery process from start to finish, it helps you to understand that there is more required to backup - and especially recovery - than simply performing daily backups."},{"Title":"Implementing Backup and Recovery: The Readiness Guide for the Enterprise (Veritas Series)","review":"The authors, Little and Chapa, have taken their deep knowledge of the backup space and applied it using the VERITAS NetBackup product. This should be viewed as the definitive guide to anyone implementing NetBackup or any other backup product. Many of the concepts transcend NetBackup and can be applied in general.Chapter 10 does a nice job of exploring the future of backup approaches, offering insight into what we might expect to see in the coming years. As important, this book provides two appendices covering &quot;Disaster Recovering Planning&quot; (Appendix D) and &quot;Business Impact Analysis&quot; (Appendix E) which could pay for the book in their own right.This book should be a requirement for any organization which utilizes or is considering the use of NetBackup."},{"Title":"Implementing Backup and Recovery: The Readiness Guide for the Enterprise (Veritas Series)","review":"This book is a must have for the person doing backup and recovery in an enterprise environment. It cuts through all the chase and gets right to the point. A great book for the novice or expert!!!!

Except for the examples, its very high level. At least half the book is allocated to middle management-esque writing regarding how the best way to manage \\"enterprize systems.\\" There is some good information here, but it seems a little too Politically Correct to my tastes. I have not seen a data center that actually operates as the book describes. Also, the author has a relationship with Veritas, so how many of Vertitas' shortcomings can we expect from a book like this? The entire manuscript would have to have passed through Veritas' legal and PR department before getting anywhere near the publisher. So much for getting the real story. As far as alternatives, if the reader is looking for corporate/unix information, Unix Backup and Recovery for UNIX is the way to go. For PC users, you can't beat How to Backup Your Windows Computer. Really, there are very few titles in this area."},{"Title":"Implementing Backup and Recovery: The Readiness Guide for the Enterprise (Veritas Series)","review":"I don't normally find value in general topic books that use a specific product to illustrate concepts; however, this book is an exception. The authors thoroughly cover all of the issues associated with back-up and recovery, including those related to business continuity, disaster recovery, and the affect that back-up and recovery has on service and availability.Given the pervasiveness of both UNIX (including Linux), and Windows, I like the fact that both operating systems are addressed in the book. I am firmly in the UNIX camp, but it's nearly impossible to find a Linux or UNIX shop that doesn't have at least some critical applications running on Windows servers.Of course, if you use Netbackup this book is going to be all the more valuable; however, if you don't, do not let the fact that the authors base the concepts and examples on this product dissuade you from buying this book. It is one of the best books on back-up and recovery issues and challenges, regardless of vendor solution used."},{"Title":"Implementing Backup and Recovery: The Readiness Guide for the Enterprise (Veritas Series)","review":"I thought the book was a waste of money.

Schuyler was one of the premier black journalists of his, or any other, day. Between his own acerbic style and being published in The American Mercury, he was referred to as the Black Mencken. In addition, he wrote one great satirical novel, Black No More, and a fair amount of pulp fiction. Two of those pulp titles, The Black Internationale : Story of Black Genius Against the World and the sequel, Black Empire : An Imaginative Story of a Great New Civilization in Modern Africa, are reproduced here in one volume. Written under the pseudonym, Samuel I . Brooks, for a black weekly newspaper, The Pittsburgh Courier, these sixty two serial installments in an ongoing adventure story originally appeared between 1936 and 1938.Reminiscent of Sax Rohmer's Fu Manchu, Schuyler tells the story of Carl Slater, writer for the Harlem Blade, who accidentally witnesses the murder of a white woman. The black assailant forces Slater into a waiting car at gunpoint, whereupon he is drugged. When he wakens, the murderer reveals himself to be Dr. Henry Belsidus, leader of the Black Internationale, an elite organization of black professionals whom the Doctor plans to lead in his mission to liberate Africa and restore blacks to their rightful position of dominance on the world stage. He explains that the woman had been one of his agents and her murder was punishment for failure. It turns out that Slater was on a list of blacks whom Belsidus planned to eventually recruit to his cause, and now circumstances force him to choose between joining up or being killed. He joins.Dr. Belsidus is clearly maniacal, but he is also possessed of a compelling vision :My son, all great schemes appear mad in the beginning. Christians, Communists, Fascists and Nazis were at first called scary. Success made them sane. With brains, courage and wealth even the most fantastic scheme can become a reality. I have dedicated my life, Slater, to destroying white world supremacy. My ideal and objective is very frankly to cast down Caucasians and elevate the colored people in their places. I plan to do this by every means within my power. I intend to stop at nothing, Slater, whether right or wrong. Right is success. Wrong is failure. I will not fail because I am ruthless. Those who fail are them men who get sentimental, who weaken, who balk at a little bloodshed. Such vermin deserve to fail. Every great movement the world has ever seen has collapsed because it grew weak. I shall never become weak, nor shall I ever tolerate weakness around me. Weakness means failure, Slater, and I do not intend to fail.In the ensuing chapters he realizes this vision, along the way utilizing such visionary technological wizardry as solar power, hydroponics and death rays, and such social measures as as his own new religion, the Church of Love. Carl Slater witnesses it all and--at the behest of Schuyler's editors and readers--falls in love with Patricia Givens, the beautiful aviatrix who commands the Black Internationale's Air Force. The serial ends with Belsidus and his followers triumphant and white Europe expelled from Africa.Stylistically this is pretty standard fare, following the over-the-top, melodramatic, cliff-hanging, conventions of the pulp fiction formula. It's well written and exciting, though overwrought. What really makes it interesting though is it's politics. Schuyler, particularly late in life, was a conservative. He moved farther Right as he became more vehemently anti-Communist and finished his career writing for publications put out by the John Birch Society (see hyperlinked Essays below). Part of this evolution entailed becoming generally hostile to the Civil Rights movement and to African Nationalism, but apparently in the 1930's he was himself a Pan-Africanist, especially concerned with the fate of Ethiopia after the Italians invaded and with liberating Liberia. There's a tendency to dismiss black conservatives as somehow self-loathing, as if conservative values are necessarily at odds with the advancement of the black race. And you can see something of a dichotomy in Schuyler's writings if you take for instance one of his comments on Marcus Garvey, of whom he was generally skeptical :Marcus Garvey has a vision. He sees plainly that everywhere in the Western and Eastern hemispheres the Negro, regardless of his religion or nationality, is being crushed under the heel of white imperialism and exploitation. Rapidly the population of the world is being aligned in two rival camps: white and black. The whites have arms, power, organization, wealth; the blacks have only their intelligence and their potential power. If they are to be saved, they must be organized so they can present united opposition to those who seek to continue their enslavement. (George S. Schuyler, writing in the Interstate Tattler, August 23, 1929)and compare it to what he had to say about the success of Black Empire :I have been greatly amused by the public enthusiasm for 'The Black Internationale,' which is hokum and hack work of the purest vein. I deliberately set out to crowd as much race chauvinism and sheer improbability into it as my fertile imagination could conjure. The result vindicates my low opinion of the human race. (George S. Schuyler, from a Letter to P.L. Prattis, April 4, 1937)Taken at face value, he seems to be criticizing his black readership for enjoying stories based on the vision he had extolled in Garvey.But perhaps this conflict is more easily reconciled than critics would have us believe. Throughout his career, Schuyler seems to have been entirely consistent in his hostility towards those who sought to speak for blacks. It is this general stance which explains his opposition to Garvey, Communists, Martin Luther King, Malcolm X, and so on. In Black Empire, he presents Belsidus as quite a monster, willing to use mass murder and near genocide to achieve his ends. It's easy to read the story as reflecting both his most treasured dream--the triumph of blacks over racial oppression--and his inherent pessimism about the leaders and means that would be required to achieve that goal.At any rate, the story is great fun and Schuyler's personal conflicts only serve to add a few layers of tension. The reader is often unsure whether he's writing with his tongue firmly planted in his cheek or whether he's allowing characters to speak his own forbidden thoughts. That you can read it on various levels merely adds to the enjoyment. There's also a terrific Afterword by Robert A. Hill and R.

First, this book by Hugh Bicheno is part of the excellent Cassell Field of battle series, which is marked by high-quality maps, data and writing. Second, the historiography of the Battle of Gettysburg has become so entrenched in popular mythology that this examination by a foreign observer serves to put the battle in a different light. Bicheno admits that his book is primarily a synthesis of earlier works by Coddington and Pfanz, but nobody really expects original research on this heavily documented subject. The main value of this book are the excellent color maps, two very detailed orders of battle and the author's insight into what occurred. Readers may not agree with everything that Bicheno asserts (I did not), but his views do stimulate new thinking about the classic battle of the American Civil War.Gettysburg consists of fifteen chapters, beginning with the pre-battle movements into Pennsylvania. There are three chapters on the first day fighting, eight on the second day, and three on the third day. Each chapter includes a full-page color map that depicts the primary action described in that chapter - an excellent methodology. In fact, the maps are the heart and soul of this work. On the negative side, the maps lack a scale, a chronology or exact enumeration of all units depicted, so it can be difficult to relate events on one map to events on another. On the plus side, the maps are simple but accurate and Bicheno has included a number of maps on the wheat field and the peach orchard - actions usually neglected in other accounts. Finally, Bicheno ends his narrative with a concluding chapter, a bibliography and four appendices. The photographs in this volume are decent but not particularly original (oddly, there is not a single photo of the modern battlefield).Bicheno sees his task as correcting the inherent &quot;Lost Cause&quot; bias that claims that Lee lost this battle due a variety of unfortunate circumstances. Instead, Bicheno asserts that Meade and the Union army WON the battle, despite the best efforts of Lee and the Army of Northern Virginia. The author also seeks to break the narrative of Gettysburg out of the conventional Buford-Longstreet-Chamberlain-Pickett-Armistead perspective that became entrenched by Michael Shaara's popular The Killer Angels (which completely ignored events on Culp's Hill), Bicheno is particularly persuasive when arguing which events were later considered important and why. For example, Chamberlain's defense of Little Round Top has been mythologized into one of the decisive events of the battle, but Bicheno asks why similar events like the bayonet charge of the 1st Minnesota, the stand of the 17th Maine at Plum Run or Greene's defense of Culp's Hill shouldn't be regarded in the same light. Indeed, why single out Chamberlain's 20th Maine for praise when the rest of Vincent's brigade fought just as hard for the other side of Little Round Top? In an example from the Confederate side, why does Pickett's division attract all the attention when the assault of Pettigrew's division accomplished more? Bicheno does cover all the standard episodes of the battle, but he puts them in perspective. Certainly anyone interested in Gettysburg should consider the amazing attack of Barksdale's Louisiana brigade at the Peach Orchard, just as much as Buford's or Chamberlain's actions.One aspect of the book that will either intrigue or enrage readers is Bicheno's tendency to depict all the major characters as more or less flawed individuals (sometimes based on innuendo). In these pages, Lincoln appears as a devious politician, A P Hill has gonorrhea, Longstreet is a second-rate general who thinks he knows best, Chamberlain is a self-promoter (along with Sickles and Jubal Early), Rebel General Johnson pounds his men with a walking stick, Hancock claims credit for other officer's deeds and Lee is a listless commander, veering between apathy and bloodlust. Personally, I believe Bicheno goes too far in his interpretations, particularly in regard to his evident loathing of Lincoln. While Bicheno does bring a few obscure heroes to light - such as the Union Colonel Philippe de Trobriand on Cemetery Hill - there is too much negativism in these interpretations.Overall, Gettysburg is a good account of the classic battle, particularly in the way that it sheds light on aspects of the fighting that are ignored in popular accounts. When you read Bicheno's account, particularly of the second day's fighting, you will see that actions on various sectors influenced each other and were not merely individual episodes. Bicheno concludes that, &quot;it was no accident that Union reserves appeared at the right place time and again,&quot; and by linking the various sectors together in his narrative he is able to demonstrate General Meade's accomplishment in shuffling troops from one sector to another."},{"Title":"Gettysburg","review":"This is a very well-written book on the most famous battle of the Civil War.Richard Holmes says 'it is a seriously good book,by far the best thing written on the subject to date\\". As thisbook is part of the \\"Fields of Battle\\" series and Holmes is theseries editor he cannot be regarded as impartial.Regardless, I found the book fascinating. The theme is that theUnion won the battle rather than that the Confederates lost. Healso makes the point that Meade never received the credit dueto him.The author expresses very forthright views on the principal players - there are no shades of grey.Barlow and Sickles(as might be expected) have their reputations shot to pieces.There is quite a good overall map and each chapter has a mapto enable the relevant action to be followed. There are alsophotos of many of the principal players and of parts of thebattlefield. Finally the command tree of each army is set out and there are detailed casualty figures.All in all a very good book."},{"Title":"Where Love Has Gone","review":"Based unofficially on the then-Lana Turner/Johnny Stompanato trial that involved a knife and the daughter of the late movie star, this sordid tale follows the same track-type puzzling murder, but goes once step further by including the omitted denouement thought by all regarding the real-life case. Protagonist Luke Lurey is the ex-husband caught in the middle, whose ever-present guidance helps put the pieces back together. And what wicked pieces they end up being. Just like any scandal sheet type magazine of the time, this Harold Robbins offering is pulp fiction at its best. With its effervescent plot scheme and narratively swinging point of view, this \\"fictional\\" delivery by the man who once has been hailed as a master storyteller is one addictive read that surely will please fans of the melodrama, and that, despite the toned-down sex scenes of its time (1962).-----Martin Boucher"},{"Title":"Where Love Has Gone","review":"The name Harold Robbins brings to mind words such as \\"trash\\", \\"sleaze\\" and the like. I have only read a couple of his books and they have been of varying quality, from the awful Descent to Xanadu to the not-bad Spellbinder, and the fascinating Blood Royal (although that last one was written by Junius Podrug).I've heard that \\"Where Love Has Gone\\" is regarded as a roman a clef about the Lana Turner/Cheryl Crane/Johnny Stompanato murder scandal. That may be true; I'm sure Robbins was inspired by it when he wrote the book. But he still makes the characters and the story his own. The narrator is Luke Carey, now happily married and expecting a baby with his wife Elizabeth. He learns that his daughter, Danielle, from his previous marriage to rich sculptress Nora Hayden. Luke goes back to San Francisco to help his daughter, whom he hasn't seen in six years. Through flashbacks we get to know the characters and their history, and Luke and Nora's miserable marriage. Luke narrates most of the book, but there are scenes where he's not present that are told in third person. The present-time story works as a frame story for the flashbacks where the real meat of the story is. And Robbins has created a great, three dimensional character in Luke, and he shows a tenderness and insight into the human nature that I haven't noticed in the other books I've read by him.\\"Where Love Has Gone\\" is not a suspense novel, but it's still a page turner. Highly recommended. This deserves to still be in print."},{"Title":"Where Love Has Gone","review":"Only the author of The Carpetbaggers could have written this explosive novel about the moment of truth for a group of people trapped between a disastrous past and a precarious future.You will meet Luke Carey, who woke up one night to the telephone call that altered his entire life; Nora, his first wife, who believed that her only responsibility was to her ever hungry body; Dani their daughter, fourteen and rudderless in a glittering adult world; Marguerite Cecilia Hayden, Dani's grandmother, who could manage two huge fortunes but not her amoral daughter; and Elizabeth, Luke's second wife, who took a gamble few women would willing to take. --from book's back cover"},{"Title":"Where Love Has Gone","review":"This Harold Robbins novel is one of the most beautifully written novels about humanity.

Just as families have parents (those who wield authority) and children (those who look to parents for guidance and social cues) so churches also have members who fill each of these functions. Much of the analysis and advice Cosgrove and Hatfield give revolve around the systemic identification of who occupies the position of a congregational parent and who is a congregational child (as well as identifying your own role). Such systemic mapping is beneficial in both the short- and long-run.Another major theme presented by Cosgrove and Hatfield is their push to create healthier systems through fostering effective, honest communication. Much communication theory is presented in these pages, including the relationship between type of communication and various emotional bonds, triangles, affirmation, and various models of influence/leadership.There are many positive aspects of this book-many of which are previously mentioned. It is highly readable, highly practical, and thorough. The authors illustrate their theories with many examples and give helpful techniques. Also, their focus is not on immediate (urgent) conflicts, but encourages a proactive, long-term systemic involvement to improve the communication style and interrelationships within a congregation. While there are not many negatives, I do wish the authors would've addressed some related topics as I walk away with some questions. The authors thoroughly cover the parent/child relationship, but how does one become a child or a parent? How can one gain influence in a congregation? How can parents relate to one another and is this different from the way in which children relate to one another? What is to be done with \\"ghosts\\"? In the chapter on \\"games,\\" how does one begin to get the congregation to stop playing a game (short of using the rules to your advantage, thus playing the game)?In all, I highly recommend this book. It is a great introduction to systems theory, congregational dynamics, and even pastoral leadership styles. If you have interest in any of these, you will do well to make a study of this highly readable book."},{"Title":"Church Conflict","review":"This book advances a theory of conflict management called \\"systems theory.\\" At the core of this theory is the concept that individuals in the congregation are not responsible or accountable for their aberrant behavior. The fault lies in how the community interacts within itself, the unwritten rules it has established, and the secret games it plays. To improve a conflicted congregation, one must fix the system and not confront any individual.Sadly lacking are biblical references that either support the \\"systems theory\\" approach to conflict management or show \\"systems theory\\" in use by God. In fact, a systems approach to conflict resolution is at odds with revealed Scripture, since Scripture places individuals on the hotseat for repentance, resolving their personal disputes, and making restitution.Assuming you value biblical methods for dealing with life, pick up a copy of Ken Sande's \\"The Peacemaker\\" instead."},{"Title":"Church Conflict","review":"This book was a waste of money.

This is a spectacular comic version of the folk hero epic Beowulf (certainly not the first - it was adapted by First Comics in the late 80s, I believe, but this one is much better). Gareth Hinds does a great job with the story and artwork. He has chosen to forgo chopping the poem into word ballons and dialogue, opting instead to present actual lines from the poem on the pages, mixed in with the art. It seems to lend this adaptation more weight. Now, let's talk about the incredible graphic style: the original series was presented in 3 issues, each one concentrating on one of Beowulf's adventures (Grendel, the Sea Hag, and the Dragon). Each part is done in a different art medium. &quot;Grendel&quot; is heavy pen &amp; ink with color, &quot;Sea Hag&quot; is painted on wood, and &quot;Dragon&quot; looks like fine lines and light watercolor accents. Add some other interesting visual touches, such as constellation charts for the night sky and howls appearing as winding parchment, and you have a true feast for the eyes. Gareth Hinds is truly talented. Give this book a try."},{"Title":"The Collected Beowulf","review":"It's nice to see that Old English poetry has received so much attention as of late. Irish poet Seamus Heaney's recent verse translation revived interest in the poem, and about the same time an adaptation of Michael Crichton's \\"Eaters of the Dead\\" (the author's own version of the Beowulf story), called \\"The 13th Warrior,\\" did well at the box office. Around the same time Gareth Hinds hit comic stores with his funnybook adaptation of the poem, now collected in this volume.The story is timeless. Beowulf, a Dane, comes to Sweden to help the Geats fight Grendel, who has taken over the great mead-hall the Geats built to celebrate victory. After some feasting and storytelling, Beowulf tears Grendel's arm off, and the creature flees howling into the night. Then, Grendel's mother shows up and Beowulf has to take care of her, too. Cut to late in the warrior's life. Now, he must face a dragon when all but his loyal squire have left him.In other words, the stuff legendary poems are made of.Hinds' adaptation liberally borrows from what little Anglo-Saxon art remains (mostly sculpture). The characters are all drawn in that blocky style, almost as if they are made of stone. The exception is Grendel, who looks like some dripping fiend that crawled out of a swamp (which is basically how he is described). The art captures the chill and danger of a time long past, when Grendels still walked the earth and people were not safe, even in the largest mead-hall. The entire poem is not represented - the action sequences themselves are left to the comic form - and what is used, is used for narrative purposes.Still, this Beowulf would make an excellent companion to a classroom study of the poem. It uses an older (1910) translation, so there are some antiquated words that don't appear in the Heaney version. There is enough to capture the meaning of the poem, even if it doesn't appear in its entirety. And Hinds' drawings (ink, woodcarvings, and pencils all) paint a compelling, if bleak, picture of life in Europe's dark age. This version makes a welcome addition to the study of Saxon poetry.Final Grade: B+"},{"Title":"The Collected Beowulf","review":"Beowulf is an amazing story of adventure & determination. As soon as the book starts you are sailing the seas to save a nation. Beowulf goes to a far off land and defends the people from the evil demon Grendel, who is killing and eating the people. Finding her son dead Grendels mother seeks revenge and kills once again. Beowulf is very angry with this and goes out to kill her. The story goes on as Beowulf kills the beast, gains fame and riches. In the end, his life is ended but his ledgend lives on.

There were times when I spent two or three minutes on a single paragraph trying to puzzle out whether some letters were Ts or Fs, in places where both letters made sense. That sort of thing bugs me almost as much as heavy dialect that changes writing into another language (think Riddley Walker here).Other than that, though, quite an enjoyable (if very abbreviated) retelling of Beowulf here; Hinds takes the whole \\"a picture is worth a thousand words\\" thing literally, leaving the words to narration, and having almost no dialogue; the pictures tell the story. Think of it as a silent movie in graphic novel form, and you've got the idea. Hinds' expressive artwork does his story far more justice than the tough-to-read narration, and the (minor) liberties he took with the final part of the story, which he spells out in an afterword, do achieve Hinds' stated intention of improving the dramatic flow of the final third of the story. Good stuff, this, as long as you can get past the bits of the script that'll drive you nuts. ***"},{"Title":"The Collected Beowulf","review":"Gareth Hinds' work in this graphic novel is nothing less than impressive, though that is not so surprising as you review his collection of works on his website (garethhinds.com) - The level of detail in his images reflects the skill and passion of a refined artist and his respectful treatment of the original text gives a glimpse of a high appreciation of his subjects. This book is magnificently executed and complete. As such, his books are an ideal resource for teachers looking for a vehicle to inspire the elusive hearts of students, collectors looking for new art, or friends in need of a great gift. I recommend that you buy this book, enter into Hinds' artistic perspective of historic literature and then try your best to outdo the praises that were in this recent New York Times Book Review: http://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/17/books/review/McGrath-t.html?_r=1&oref=slogin"},{"Title":"The Collected Beowulf","review":"I am a print-oriented person trying to learn to appreciate graphic novels.

I also thought that too often there was either way too much text on a single page or else too many pages with no text at all.

A little background on how i got this is as followed, we just got done reading \\"Beowulf\\" in class and were assigned a little report type assignment. Many people chose their own creative ways to do the report and three students actually made a Video out of it (Which i do have to say was hilarious to watch... Try to imagine a plastic monster on a string jumping up and down in an aquarium being attacked by a hand with a pocket knife) My friend and I choose to do a few sketches for our report (Something Comic book like). So i searched the web for pictures of Grendel and stumbled upon the comic book collection by Gareth Hinds. I showed it to my teacher and she was absolutely amazed. After a couple of days i found out that the teacher was having a birthday and i decided to play a little trick on her, i came to amazon and ordered the comic and told the teacher that we would be doing our presentation on the comic book itself, she was thrilled. So we waited for the comic book to come and it finally arrived. When i first got it and read it at home it was ABSOLUTELY amazing. The quality of the art work was amazing and all the text was written in an Old-English kind of fashion. There was a kind of Dictonary at the very begining of the book too to show what certain words were used inside the comic and what they meant. The next day came and we did our presentation and the class was amazed at the quality of the book, i did see one thing that might of not made it \\"School Material\\" when you could actually see the mother of Grendel Breats (But i noticed when the class was reading through the comic that they didnt even notice it.) I was going to give my teacher the comic right after the presentation but had to deal with a few other things real quick and i couldnt do it the rest of the day so the next day i went to her before class started and said \\"I didnt buy this comic just for the report, Happy Birthday Mrs. Cornelius!\\" And she said \\"Are you kidding?!\\" and then led to say \\"Do you want me to pay you for this\\" in which i replied to her \\"No, its a birthday gift, the person that you give it to isnt suppose to pay for it\\". She absolutely loves it and i think anyone who buys this will too. The Artwork is amazing (And you can buy poster size copies of them off of Gareth Hinds website, in which you can also buy a Signed copy from the author himself), The text is amazing, the story has barely changed if at all, Its just one of the best investments/gifts i have ever bought for anyone.

His early novels are exciting, full of cliff-hanging situations, and rife with clever \\"detection\\" in the classical sense: MacLean plays by the classical detective rules, placing all of the clues in front of the reader, and - at his most cunning - daring the reader to figure out who the criminal mastermind is.But the detection - and the undertones of \\"espionage\\" - are superficial elements used to keep the narrative moving briskly along between action set pieces that pit the protagonist against impossible odds and, very often, against the severest imaginable environmental extremes. By these standards, \\"The Golden Rendezvous\\" is one of his better books.It is an excellent blend of mystery, suspense, clever bluffs and double bluffs, self-deprecating wit, action, and our protagonist's determined efforts to overcome painful injuries and antagonistic environmental extremes.A luxury cruise ship is hijacked at sea by a master criminal whose intention is not a simple ransoming of the wealthy hostages on board. Exactly what his goal is forms part of the mystery that is left for our hero - the injured First Officer of the ship, John Carter - to ferret out. And to undermine.\\"The Golden Rendezvous\\" finds MacLean at near-top form. The book does not have quite the verve of \\"The Satan Bug\\", \\"The Dark Crusader\\", or \\"When Eight Bells Toll\\", but it comes close. Which - at the high level that MacLean delivers excitement and page-turning suspense - makes for outstanding adventure story reading."},{"Title":"THE GOLDEN RENDEZVOUS.","review":"\\"My shirt was no longer a shirt but just a limp and sticky rag soaked with sweat.\\" MacLean is one of the few authors who actually cares about his first sentences. And he cares about his plotlines as much as his first sentences as well. Both are gripping and force you to read, and keep reading... just to see what happens next.What I like about MacLean's formula is that every book is suspenseful and nearly full of twists. I say 'nearly' because sometimes MacLean will churn out a weaker tale for some reason. But there is no doubt in my mind that The Golden Rendezvous is one of his best works.The older 1960s/70s books (see \\"customer images\\" for the paperback version) don't always clarify what the story is about. Chief Officer John Carter is the typical pseudo-tragic hero who has his faults but also his strengths. He works under Capt. Bullen, on the interesting freight ship Campari, altered by millions of dollars to provide ultra-rich passengers superb living and dining experiences, all the while travelling to unknown destinations. The ship is only running its regular course of delivering freight around the world, so the passengers aren't booking a holiday fare, but rather a surprising adventure. And on this particular voyage, the adventure threatens to bury everyone deep in Davy Jones's Locker.MacLean's description of Carter being dragged alongside the ship, unable to do anything but inhale salt water, violently resigning himself to his impending doom of a drowning death, had me on the edge of my seat, stomach churning at the idea.That's literally about all you can say without giving too much plot away. This book had me reading late into the night, far more so than many of his other books. I rank it up there with Ice Station Zebra, and Where Eagles Dare."},{"Title":"THE GOLDEN RENDEZVOUS.","review":"Alistair MacLean was one of the best adventure writers of all time. He does it all on the strength of plot; style and characterization are nearly non-existent, but they aren't the reason you read MacLean books. I dare say that virtually every major adventure plot is covered in one of his novels, and his influence is such that subsequent authors have paid homage to scenes of his. (For example, there's a scene in Clive Cussler's &quot;The Mediterranean Caper&quot; that's a virtual reprise of a scene from &quot;The Secret Ways.&quot;)&quot;The Golden Rendezvous&quot; is a classic ocean hijacking story, where the hero is the ship's First Officer (John Carter). The ship is a converted ocean liner, full of guests, some mysterious, and carrying some secret cargo. During the cruise, the ship gets hijacked by some violent but devious criminals. Some of the ship's officers are killed, and others, including Carter, are wounded. Still, Carter attempts to stop the hijackers. . . .This is one of the best MacLean novels, written in the 1960s along with a stellar run that includes &quot;The Satan Bug,&quot; &quot;Where Eagles Dare,&quot; &quot;Puppet on a Chain,&quot; and &quot;The Guns of Navarone.&quot; Most of those were turned into movies, and in the 1970s, Hollywood adapted &quot;The Golden Rendezvous&quot; into a so-so Richard Harris movie titled &quot;Nuclear Terror.&quot;"},{"Title":"THE GOLDEN RENDEZVOUS.","review":"Alistair Maclean was a literary force of nature who influenced whole generations of thriller writers with his gripping stories, exotic settings and timely plots.

Maclean didn't waste words on gratuitous sex, techno-babble or political ramblings--his stories are all plot, action and suspense.\\"The Golden Rendezvous\\" combines a high seas murder mystery, piracy and nuclear terrorism in a gripping narrative that really goes into overdrive around the middle of the book. In typical Maclean fashion, the protagonist has to overcome impossible odds, physical hardships, the forces of nature, and the treachery of people around him to prevail. There are several trademark plot twists that keep the story from becoming predictable, and the shipboard setting is very vividly described by the former navy man.

A series of murders onboard bring out the detective in the Campari's First Officer, Johnny Carter, who soon uncovers a complicated plot involving a stolen nuclear device, a bankrupt Caribbean dictator, and a shipment of gold. As a criminal gang takes over the ship, Carter must somehow uncover the last details of the plot in order to save the crew and passengers. In typical Maclean fashion, the ending includes a series of plot twists and heoric deeds by First Officer Carter.Maclean's experience as a sailor informs his descriptions of life at sea aboard the Campari. Similarly, his sketches of the principal members of the crew ring true. His villians look to this Cold War veteran like nasty Cuban agents of Fidel Castro, but this may be transparent to younger readers. Johnny Carter's heroic feats in rescuing the ship approach the improbable, but the wise reader will let it ride in order to enjoy the story. Maclean's dialogue is typically crisp and sardonic; Carter's relationship with the young, beautiful, and surprising daughter of a multi-millionaire adds some nice depth to the story.This novel is highly recommended to fans of Alistair Maclean, and to readers looking for an entertaining story."},{"Title":"THE GOLDEN RENDEZVOUS.","review":"I thought I had read everything written by A M. when I was much younger. Although somewhat dated by todays standards it was still a good read. I still consider A.M. to be one of the best. Always recommended."},{"Title":"THE GOLDEN RENDEZVOUS.","review":"Warning: SPOILERS!!!!I don't know what it is about The Golden Rendevous that sticks in my head. Like many of MacLean's stories, it's written in the first-person, which lends a sense of urgency to the impossible situations the hero finds himself in. Like many of the stories, there's a beautiful girl who isn't just a damsel in distress but lends crucial help to the hero. He just wouldn't make it without her. And like many of the stories, the bad guy is just that-a bad guy with no redeeming qualities. No confusion with MacLean-you know who you're supposed to root for and who you're supposed to detest not many pages in. I suppose it's the humanity that he manages to infuse into his characters that gets me. The Golden Rendevous has some particularly appealing characters.The plot is not very involved-a seemingly innocent passenger on the Campari is planning to use the cruise ship to pirate a ship carrying gold. He's brought along a kidnapped scientist and a stolen nuclear device to blow up the gold ship after he gets the cargo. And he's planned everything down to the last detail, not realizing that a member of the crew, First Officer John Carter, has figured out his plan and will do everything he can to stop him. It's a tense ride with gunfights, knife fights, and suicidal stunts aboard the most luxurious cruise ship in the world. The Campari is a character in itself-an incredibly opulent boat with prices even the fabulously wealthy can barely afford. How this book failed to make it to the big screen is a mystery to me-the sets alone would have made it a movie worth seeing.MacLean's heros are always likeable and John Carter is no exception. However, he is not just likeable-he has some scenes that have never failed to get me. Like when he tells Miss Susan Beresford, spoiled multi-millionaire, that her kind make him sick when they misuse their power to taunt the crew members who desperately need their jobs. Or when he sees the atomic bomb central to the plot for the first time and backs up to where it's not visible, reasoning that he's safe if he can't see it, poking fun at himself. When Carter helps the bad guy plan how to take the gold ship he's planning to pirate and tells his friends he has no family, only himself, and has to look after all he has in the world (he doesn't dare tell them what's really going on) I always feel for him-they're so mad at him. And at the end, when he pops up and reveals all his clever tricks to save the gold and the scientist and get the bad guy, I always feel like cheering."},{"Title":"THE GOLDEN RENDEZVOUS.","review":"Alistair Macean is my favourite thriller writer.Golden Rendouvous is a bonafide classic.Just reading this book reveals what a great plotter Maclean was and he always knew how to combine action suspense and he didn't need to write 500, or 10000 pages, unlike the new writers of today.He had a sense of humour as well and i always thought his characters were colourful.Also,though Maclean did his research thorougly, his books were never bogged down in details, unlike many authors today.Golden Rendevous is a must read!go and read it and make your day!"},{"Title":"THE GOLDEN RENDEZVOUS.","review":"This book is one of Macleans best.

It's easy to read, inspiring me to go out and buy all the oils to enjoy the many easy recipes for mood enhancement, relaxation etc. For a mature woman, the recipes and advice using all natural therapies, have really helped alleviate many &quot;women's problems&quot; and made my home a place of warmth, love and (when I want to) seclusion.

I made the decision to purchase this book over another I was considering, based on some of the reviews I had read on both. However, it is basically exactly what the title indicates-a recipe book. While it has some interesting recipes I may try, it isn't quite what I was looking for. The book seems okay for what it is, though I have not tried any of the blends. If you are looking for recipes, which are not the same old, everyone uses, then you may like this book."},{"Title":"A Very Long Engagement","review":"The plot is a sort of mystery, decently realized. The fact that it's entwined with WWI makes it somewhat novel (forgive me).But the flatly drawn characters all but kill the story. There's little growth, little development -- for all their experiences, all the characters seem to remain the same as when they were first introduced in the novel. And what's worse, the lead character is almost saccarine sweet -- so much sentimentality!The writing itself is decent, but not good enough to overcome the poor characterization and the sentimentality.Great literature it is not."},{"Title":"A Very Long Engagement","review":"\\"Once upon a time, there were five French Soldiers who had gone off to war, because that's the way of the world.\\" So begins Sebastien Japrisot's haunting novel which chronicles not only the horrors of war and the endurance of love, but the ways in which World War 1 forever changed the lives of those who were caught up in the conflict.I have already read this book several times. For some reason, I seem to find myself returning to it every few years. Japrisot's writing is so beautiful and flows so well in translation (the novel was originally written in French) that it makes me want to take language lessons so that I could enjoy his writing in his native language.The story concerns Mathilde Donnay, an intelligent and strong-willed protagonist who happens to be confined to a wheelchair because of an early childhood injury. Don't let this detail bother you, as it certainly doesn't bother Mathilde. She has far too many fish to fry to let a little thing like partial paralysis get in her way. As a young girl, Mathilde formed a lasting friendship with a boy named Manech, who became her fiancee after their childhood friendship developed into a strong and loving relationship. At the tender age of 19, Manech was sent off to the war, serving as an infantryman on the front of the French lines. Literally driven past the point of endurance by the horrors he has witnessed, Manech arranges for an accommodating soldier in German trench to shoot him in the hand. Manech is sentenced to death for this self-mutilation, along with four other soldiers. Their sentence is to be thrown into no-man's land, the space between the French and German trenches, with no weapons and their hands tied behind their backs. What happened to Manech and his fellow inmates becomes a mystery, one which Mathilde is not willing to let remain unsolved, and spends seven years trying to uncover. In pursuing this mystery she will uncover not only Manech's ultimate fate, but also learn the stories of those who witnessed it.This is such a beautiful novel, and Mathilde is such a likable character. Each time I read it I find myself furiously turning the pages, hoping for a resolution to lives that were so unfairly interrupted."},{"Title":"A Very Long Engagement","review":"I'm one of those people who never watches the movie first. The book is simply the better experience, and it's lessened, typically, by having seen the film first.That truism didn't exactly hold for A Very Long Engagement. I actually saw the movie first (didn't know there was a novel at the time), and I loved it. I watched it twice and immediately recommended it to my friends. About a year later, then, I happened upon the book and picked up a free copy. I doubted that I'd ever read it, but one rainy day, I picked it up. Before that day was over I was finished.The movie does follow the novel very closely, but I was still swept away. The mystery is so complex, and yet tight and logical. Once you're grabbed by it, you must follow it through to the end. The characters, especially Mathilde and Manech (who we've gotten to know through memory), are so engaging.Mainly though, it's just so hopeful. I think that's what got me each time I've experienced the story, the romantic notion that no matter how absurd and confused and sorrowful and illogical this life can seem, perhaps truth and love at least have a fighting chance.I think everyone needs to be told that sort of story every once in a while. This one does it awfully well."},{"Title":"A Very Long Engagement","review":"I read this book in 2 days. I could not put it down. I was thoroughly caught up in the mystery and in the search for the truth. Like other books highlighting consequences of war, I was saddened and revolted by the tragedies. I truly cared what happened to these men. I didn't like all of them - but the author makes you care about them by his description and dialogue. Even some of the extraneous and minor characters had a charm of their own and each brought you closer to the truth. I was maddened at times trying to figure out the ending. That's what makes this book worthwhile."},{"Title":"A Very Long Engagement","review":"Wheelchair-bound Mathilde Donnay sets her sights on the past to unravel the mystery of her fiance's death in Japrisot's complex novel of love and human perception. Set in post World War I France, the story opens with a masterfully sardonic description of five soldiers, condemned to die for shooting themslves in the hand, being tumbled into the no-man's land between the French and German trenches.Their loved ones are informed of their death in combat. One, Mathilde, determines to know more and is assisted by a dying ex-soldier -- the man who led the condemned group to the Front.Mathilde, still unsatisfied, notes oddities and discrepancies in the meagre record she has compiled. She tracks down any possible witness, relentlessly pursues every lead. All evidence, however contradictory in other respects, points to the same end and even Mathilde finally seems resigned to learning no more than just how her lover died.With humor and an anecdotal style, Japrisot maintains a certain distance from his characters that makes the savagery of war all the more visceral. He leads the reader on with human mysteries -- there are as many versions of the soldiers' deaths as there are individual memories -- and with flashes of pathos and kindness. And the story's ending is as touching as it is surprising."},{"Title":"A Very Long Engagement","review":"This is a fantastic story; a mystery, love story, and historical account. I won't recount the plot, since that's provided above. I just finished Corelli's Mandolin, which is similar but not nearly as flawless as this. Although translated from French, the language is beautiful and lyrical. You will be trying to figure out what exactly happened during the entire reading, and then at the end will want to go back to put the pieces together. Truly an aching, touching story."}]`),x={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:B},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:M,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},H={class:"card-container"},W=["disabled"],E={key:0},N={key:1};function C(n,e,s,c,r,i){const m=f("PoemCard");return t(),a("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=o("div",{class:"top-banner"},[o("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[o("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),o("div",H,[(t(!0),a(y,null,w(i.visiblePoems,(h,g)=>(t(),p(m,{key:g,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),i.hasMorePoems?(t(),a("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>i.loadMore&&i.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(t(),a("span",N,"Loading...")):(t(),a("span",E,"See more"))],8,W)):b("",!0)])}const L=u(x,[["render",C],["__scopeId","data-v-bd2d10f2"]]),R=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"glossary/14.md","filePath":"glossary/14.md"}'),P={name:"glossary/14.md"},q=Object.assign(P,{setup(n){return(e,s)=>(t(),a("div",null,[v(L)]))}});export{R as __pageData,q as default};
