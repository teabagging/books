They have remained my absolute favorite books throughout the last ten years, and I can't wait to see the movie in December. :~)"},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"I am a big, long time fan of fantasy literature, particularly that written for young adults. Based on the reviews of this trilogy, I was expecting, and hoping, to find a really enthralling work that would measure up to The Dark is Rising and the Harry Potter books. I was disappointed. Unlike many of the other reviewers, I found Pullman's writing style a bit forced and contrived. It took me quite a while to feel engaged with the characters, and I don't think I ever really felt sympathy with Lyra, the main character.I didn't find the existential premise troubling, in fact, I think it was the most original and best part of the book. The multiple worlds premise was interesting, but I didn't find the alternate worlds all that believable.In the end, I would say that the books were entertaining, but probably would not read them again. To those considering these books, I would recommend books by Susan Cooper or Lloyd Alexander instead."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"I started out really liking the books, and what religious confusion I had, I expected to be resolved at the end as most novels are, and at least impartial, but I found that what pullman says about religion, well, basically christianity, in these books very disturbing. Pullman's \\"God\\", the Authority, is portrayed as a rather tyrranical ruler who has grown old to the point of death, with the protagonistic angels being against God, and the antagonistic angels are power-hungry and rule creation. Also, some elements of this book are not things i would tell a child to read, such as the evil of the protagonist's demented parents. It has children turning away from what is supposed to be good, and one has killed people. I think the only thing a child could derive from these books is that God is bad, many disturbing thoughts, and moral confusion. It also has a disturbing theory of hell, which everyone goes to and lives in fear and misery for all eternity. In all, this prevented me from properly enjoying a series that was otherwise very well written and exciting."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"The Golden Compass was absolutely scintillating. The guy's a great writer. However, in the Amber Spyglass, the truth comes out. Yahweh (Jehovah, God Almighty), is just one of a pantheon of sencient dark materials in a strictly material creation.I love Sci-Fi and Fantasy. But not one that assaults my Christianity. The comparisons to Tolkien and Lewis are not deserved.This is a childrens series?If I were an athiest, I'd undoubtedly love this series. However, I'm not, and the unfinished trilogy went out in today's garbage."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"A quote from the third book: \\"I used to be a nun, you see. I thought physics could be done to the glory of God, till I saw there wasn't any God at all and that physics was more interesting anyway. The Christian religion is a very powerful and convincing mistake, that's all.\\"Please be aware: This trilogy, while exceedingly well-written, blatantly promotes and teaches atheism--particularly in the third installment. It is also anti-Christian. Comparing this author to C.S. Lewis is more than misleading; it is a disservice to well-meaning parents who have no idea what they're actually giving their kids. The top-rated reviews offer no help in this area, and I would encourage the authors to revise and at least add just a sentence. If atheism is such a legitimate concept, why hide it and slip it into kids' minds under the guise of a \\"C.S. Lewis-like\\" author?I gave it one star because of its misleading nature--particularly in the marketing. It's wrong to try to slip this into unsuspecting homes and lie about its themes."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"These books were well written and fascinating, but they push the comfort zones of those with strong spiritual connections. The first one is wonderful, but the second and third delve deeply into atheism and the philosophy of the author. I would highly recommend that you read at least Golden Compass, and beyond if you enjoy an intellectual battle with yourself. (By the way, the four-star rating is an average: GC is 5, SK is 4, and AS is 3)."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"Pullman's trilogy is beautiful, immensely imaginative, and profoundly disappointing. The first two books are wonderful works of fantasy fiction that adults and young people alike can easily enjoy. On that basis alone, I recommend reading it. Unfortunately, the last book winds up being a dogmatic condemnation of religion, the organized church, and the idea of a loving, wise, or powerful God. For someone from a European society, with a closer connection to the history of a single and too-frequently abusive church authority (in Pullman's work, the \\"Authority\\" obviously stands for the Catholic church), this work may be more acceptable and understandable, but for American readers growing up in a more pluralistic society with greater respect for (and less arrogance about) other people's beliefs, Pullman's ultimate thrust is as dogmatic and insulting as the church he fantastically creates and criticizes. The religious figures in this book are mean, distorted characters, fanatics who only want to control or, failing that, exterminate their foes. For people wise enough to recognize they have no singular purchase on the ultimate truth, Pullman's attempted rendering of a more sophisticated, adult truth in which there is no real God comes across as an ugly and uneducated piece of propaganda. It's unfortunate that an otherwise spectacular story could get bogged down in such inappropriate sermonizing. If you like science fiction or fantasy and couldn't care less about religious and spiritual matters, you might love this trilogy. If you have any respect for Christianity or other religious traditions, you may find this work disturbing, despite its beauty and inventiveness."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"I think the title of the review says it all --- I was disappointed to realize while reading this generally well-written books (but they are not written in the accessible writing-styles of Tolkien, Lewis, or Rowling) that Pullman's books are far from children's literature. Unless you're comfortable with your 11-year old being told that God is a doddering idiot, that Christianity is a \\"convincing and powerful mistake,\\" and a number of other subversive and questionable themes running throughout these books. I'll not debate those issues here, but suffice to say, I hope most parents recognize that there are themes and issues that should be confronted by, at the very least, a mature teenager who has been presented with a variety of theological and philosophical concepts, and can recognize these novels for what they are - the thinly veiled exposition of Pullman's attack on religion. The reader needs to be mature enough to digest these ideas, and assess them for themselves."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"I first read the golden compass when i was nine. I recently re-read it and fineshed the series. These books are truely amazing with their dark plots and well developed characters, they are now on the top of my list (i was bawling my eyes out for the last 50 pages in The Amber Spyglass). I think that everyone should read these books and even though they do \\"attack\\" the christian religion, put that out of your mind and enjoy the world that Philip Pullman has created for you.a must read and strongly reccomended"},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"While occasional passages were well-crafted and moving, on the whole the work is chaotic, violent, and confusingly told. Events just happen one after another without reason, and the characters seem to be completely dispensible, dying at every turn. This gives the book a choppy, discontinuous tone, since the high toll requires frequent introduction of new characters as the old ones are killed off.The rapid scene changes are remarkably predictable. The plot will settle down briefly just as the fight is over, the escape is successful, and so forth, at which point it becomes obvious that the characters are going to move to some new venue. And each transition requires some unusual mode of transportation, since after every dramatic rescue poor Lyra is taken off by some new and exotic conveyance. (She's in a houseboat! She's in a sled! She's in a balloon!)The book actually seems more like a made-for-television movie than a novel (and will probably become one before too long). But as literature it is a failure, with a crude, rambling plot and no emotional depth. True fantasy persuades the reader that the world being portrayed is real, that the characters matter. This work strains the reader's willing suspension of disbelief to the breaking point and even the author tosses his characters into the trash one after the other.I made it through the first book, only to find that it was not even really a book but just a very long first chapter. Given that by the time I finished \\"Northern Lights\\" I was already tired of pointless killing and random cruelty, I simply gave it and the rest of the boxed set of volumes away."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"I purchased this trilogy because of George Beahm (\\"Muggles and Magic\\") cited Philip Pullman as a possible \\"next J.K. Rowling.\\" While Pullman is a gifted writer of great imagination, he is NOT Rowling, nor is \\"His Dark Materials\\" at all like the Harry Potter series.Pullman's trilogy is stunning in his fashioning of a universe comprised of many parallel worlds inhabited by armored polar bears, angels, witches, and other fantastic creatures. The love story of Lyra and Will is touching and ultimately heartbreaking. In the end, however, I am put off by Pullman's rabid hatred of Christianity and Christians. Under the guise of being a trilogy about and for pre-teen children, \\"His Dark Materials\\" is really a retelling of John Milton's \\"Paradise Lost,\\" in which God is the imperious tyrant/bad guy, and Satan and the other rebel angels are the good guys.It is true that the Christian church & clerics had committed evil in the past and present (think The Inquisition and today's pedophile priests). However, Christianity has also been the cause of much good in history: Charity for the poor; orphanages and schools, especially in poor countries; great works of art (The Sistine Chapel!); West Europe's (and the world's) first universities; and nothing less than the preservation (by Irish monks) of Western civilization in the Dark Ages. None of this can be found in \\"His Dark Materials.\\" Instead, the Church (and Christianity) is portrayed as all evil, without exception. But the fact of the matter is that no group is entirely good or evil. Instead, good and evil people are found among all groups. There are good and bad Christians, as there are good and bad Muslims, Buddhists, atheists, men, women, children, blacks, whites, gays, or straights. No group has the monopoly on either virtue or vice. It is Pullman's blanket portrayal of Christians as all evil that reveals his hidden agenda in \\"His Dark Materials\\"--an agenda that leaves a decidedly sour taste in my mouth.A self-described atheist, Pullman is a very angry man. As for the reason for his anti-Christian venom, perhaps one must look to his childhood and the dark recesses of his psychology."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"Great price and the books were in excellent condition, new to me. I will definitely order from this person again. Thanks a bunch."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"I have read this trilogy about four times, and still I don't get tired of it. First, it's full of lovely characters - the free and uncaring Lyra, the ambiguous Lord Asriel and his wife Mrs. Coulter, bears, witches, Will, Mary Malone, etc. Second, the world is believable - Lyra and her daemon, for example, or the bears and witches that live in the North, or parallel worlds. Third, the book captures emotion - at the end of the book, you feel sorry for the characters and experience an upheaval at the fall of Metatron.There were some confusing points in The Amber Spyglass, though - the idea that human \\"fall\\" is the salvation of the universe seemed a bit far-fetched to me. All those armies Lord Asriel gathered, all the Republic of Heaven he'd prepared for was utterly lost.But the triumph of Lyra, Will and Mary, regardless of the realistic problems, felt brilliant."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"I got addicted to this book it's as if it has got inchantments on it. It brings fantasy to life"},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"Pullman presents the reader with an alternative view of the metaphysical and physical. God, spirit, soul, matter. He's got some nice ideas and makes a decent effort to explore and develop them, but in the end it's lacking in credibility. I mean, a story's got to posess an inner credibility, an inner logic. Here, Pullman's story has too many flaws. Reading the pages, I give up trying to believe in his universe(s) and the last book became purely a \\"make it through\\"-run. But OK - apart from serious faults in fundamentals, Mr. Pullman has a good command over language and scenery. He writes well, and has a nice imagination. I'll give him that. Some reflecting on the art of storytelling, and Pullman will be a winner."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"I read all three books in this series one right after another and I'm not sure what parts are are for which book, so I'm just going to review them all together here.And there will be ***SPOILERS****To start off, I'm going to say that I'm not even going get involved in the anti-religion debate.I think the series had some really great ideas and concepts that could make a great book, but it just didn't happen here. There were lot's of big and little things wrong with the story, but there were four things that really bothered me the most.1) One of the prophesies about Lyra said that she would betray someone and it would hurt her. Alot of the other reviewers thought that her bringing Roger to his death was the betrayal but I don't think that's possible. Isn't betrayal intentional? Lyra obviously didn't mean to have him killed so it wasn't even betrayal. The other possibility was when ditched her daemon, but that doesn't make much sense either. I mean, if her daemon was like her soul and had the same thoughts ect. wouldn't he have understood why she was going? Neither of them really make sense, so I don't know which one it was supposed to be or if Pullman just forgot about the prophecies all together.2)The whole romance with Will and Lyra was really sweet and believable. That is, until you realize they were both barely 13. I mean, 13 is a little young to be completely in love with someone like that. 13-year-olds do not have such intense romantic feelings and relationships. I know it's supposed to be symbolic and everything, but still, it was a little hard to swallow.3) Um, what is dust? Never at any point does anybody explain what dust is. I know it has to do with conciseness, but it also seemed to be connected to Will and Lyra's love. And after the first book, it seemed completely unrelated to the other part of the story which was the war against the Authority. At the end, I still saw no connection at all, and I still didn't have any idea what it was or how it was important. It really confused me and I think it should have been better explained since it was a really important part of the story.4) Lastly, Lyra was supposed to be Eve. Meaning she would be tempted and decide mankind's fate. That was why the church wanted to kill her. But she was tempted and the whole love thing happened and everything, but *nothing changed*!! All that happened was that all the dust that was leaving in the Mulafa's world started coming back. It didn't affect the war at all. So was she just Eve for that one world? Because it didn't seem to really affect anything in any of the other worlds. And if her being Eve was just going to affect that one world why was the church so worried about her another world. Her being Eve was supposed to be really important, but overall it didn't really change anything in the story. It seemed kind of pointless.Anyway, after all of my complaining, I do recommend you read it. It has really interesting things to think about, so if you can take the ideas out of the story and think about them in your own way, then it is worth reading."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"The books came in good condition, and I was happy with how cheep the entire trilogy was, however you need to work on your shipping options leave a little to be desired. You did not have any of the prices listed on your shipping options and, as a result, I accidentally paid more for the shipping than I did for the books; what's more, they were late by a day despite what your tracking information stated."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"I enjoyed the story, writing and characters very much. Well worth the read. I thought the very ending was a little weaker than I would like to have seen, however.

Books came quickly even though it was Christmas time."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"I won't place any spoilers here but I was greatly disappointed by the trilogy. While I found \\"The Golden Compass\\" endearing and intriguing, I was let down by \\"The Subtle Knife\\" and \\"The Amber Spyglass.\\" Especially \\"The Amber Spyglass.\\" I felt like Pullman was neglecting the story in order to put forth his own religous and political views. Many times the characters and/or story is contrived in order to further Pullman's agenda. I also was disappointed in the many issues left unresolved. It's unfortunate because it's an interesting premise and the characters (especially initially) are well drawn and captivating. I found myself really caring about them."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"I ripped through these books so quickly I hardly knew what day it was when I was done. I loved these stories. Full of vivid, supernatural fun and excitement."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"I was intrigued by His Dark Materials, which I'd heard touted as something of an anti-Narnia. Packed with talking animal companions, witches, armored polar bears, ghosts, shamans, soul-sucking spectres, zeppelins and hot air balloons, angels, cliff-ghasts, harpies, miniature dragonfly-riding warriors, magic spells, weird science, literary references, alternate timelines, malevolent conspiracies, intrigue, ancient emnities, multiverse-spanning wars, and a knife that can cut between worlds, His Dark Materials has all the trappings of an allegorical sci-fi/fantasy epic, with one crucial, conspicuous exception: It is almost utterly devoid of charm. I prefer Narnia."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"This trilogy starts off very well. The problem is the completely unconvincing ending. For one thing, the most interesting character suddenly has a change of heart with little motivation. For another, it turns out the grand prophecy that runs throughout the trilogy has a really lame and uncompelling manifestation. If you feel you must read this to see what the fuss is about, get it from the library because you won't want to read it more than once."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"The story is fun to read, however I would not recommend these books for young children. He has no reguard for Christian values calling God easy to fool and probably isn't even alive. If you are secure in your Christian faith you can see through his facade."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"I believe in Pullman, not his publishers. Good Books. Great ideas. Should have had the courage to publish the British edition, not a dumbed down American edition."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"In our home we read books together out loud as a family activity. We selected Pullman's His Dark Materials as a good set to read because of all the awards it received and because we enjoy fantasy series. Bad choice! The books are poorly written -- the last volume was so boring that my youngest kept dozing off -- and worse than that, the final message is NOT appropriate to children.I'm not a Christian, so I don't have a problem with Pullman's hatred of Catholicism. [Though, I do wonder if he wasn't one of those poor young alter boys who was abused by his priest years ago. That would explain his near hysteric anti-religious tone.] By the time he got around to killing God in the third volume, we were so tired of his bigotry that we all just laughed.What bothers me most about His Dark Materials is that Pullman tells us that in addition to God, Good and Evil are also dead. To prove this he turns his villians from the first volume (both of whom are child abusers and murderers) into semi-heroes by the third volume. And then in a final (totally unexplained) triumph he saves the universe by having two thirteen year-olds have sex!This man has serious problems. He has my symphathy. But, that doesn't mean we should expose children to his sick musings."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"These look like children's books, but I'd burn it before I'd let a child read it. Well told ...but where Harry Potter teachs about loyalty and bravery, here the message is that your mother may be a murderer, and you'd better not trust anyone.... Sad."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"Pullman's thesis, that bad things are done in the name of religion, is harmless enough, but as Jewish person I can't help but feel completely annoyed that apparently some kind of High Anglican/Catholic theology is the only religion that exists for P. Sophomoric logic and an oversimplified approach-- yes the book asks difficult questions, but so does Ayn rand. If you like propaganda disguised as fiction, you'll love these.That said, books 1 & 2 are very exciting stories, with some wonderful characters in them. It's only in Book 3 that the preachiness becomes heavy-handed, boring, and near-sighted. For some of us, the pros/cons of historical Christianity are, believe it or not, irrelevant."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"Though the characters are captivating, and the world Pullman creates is vivid and rich, this series of books is NOT for readers under 15. Parents should be prepared to read the books with their children and engage in fairly complicated discussions about parental violence, the nature of God, and even budding sexual feelings."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"I am an avid reader, and I love fantasy and children's literature, but what is up with everyone loving these books? I was looking forward to reading The Golden Compass, only to be completely disapointed within a few pages of starting it. I found it to be almost disturbing in its weirdness, and I honestly do not know a child, even an older well-read child, that would be able to read these books without confusion and with a genuine interest in finishing the trilogy. I managed to finish the first book, but had no interest in pursuing the trilogy further, and I was honestly left with a bad vibe from having read The Golden Compass. After reading the comments from the author about his purpose for writing the book, I can understand why I do not like it. What happened to writing children's books with the intent to entertain children with harmless, light-heartedness? I will stick with Harry Potter and Chronicles of Narnia thank you!!!"},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"After reading the trilogy His Dark Materials, I concluded that this is not a book for children. The main characters may be children, the Bolvanger chapters may have involved children, but that would not be an endorsement to categorize this series as children's literature, nor should these books be put in the children's sections of the library or a bookstore. Although this is fiction, Pullman's agenda is very clear here and it leaps from the pages with all its vitriolic verbosity -- reduce the Christian God to a fairy tale. To do this, make him powerless, decrepit, insignificant, and destroy him. The stories reek of the author's disdain and hatred for the Catholic Church and Christianity in general. It seemed that all other religions (demonology, witchcraft, eastern mysticism, etc.) have the author's respect and approval. It is only Christianity and the Christian God and more especially the Catholic faith that he abhors.I kept waiting for some redeeming value in the characters and the books, even though it is a mean thesis in disbelief in \\"The Authority\\". However, that never came and the characters who are suppose to buffet this thesis don't seem to do that very well, they all seemed to be following an agenda with very bad information. Going about willy-nilly, and half-cocked depending on every suspicious artifact to guide them along, and they never questioned in any true sense the artifacts they used, (Alethiometer, I Ching sticks, a demonic knife and a possessed computer) not even the scientist used logic or common sense, never sought out good information or the best advice. On a rare occasion when good information just happens their way they summarily dismiss it. Do we want our children to take that example?The world that Pullman paints after the Dust settled (pardon my pun) is a world I find distasteful and one I would not trust. There would be no hope, no moral code or self restraints, nothing but despair. Is this the world he's warning us about or is this the world he wants? Apparently it is the latter and this is very curious."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"As a parent, I was very alarmed at the conclusion of this trilogy. I really enjoyed the first two books. Pullman writes beautifully and elegantly. If you are a parent, and your children wish to read this series, you might want to read these books first and you should be aware: 1. Pullman is clearly very anti-Christian. I am not a Christian myself, but found his dark view of organized religion to be so extreme that it was very disturbing. 2. This series is actually not just anti-Christian, but really attacks religious beliefs. 3. It was bizarre that the series never touched on other religious beliefs besides Christianity. Pullman, ironically, despite his clear anti-Christian beliefs, seems to accept that it is the one and only correct depiction of God, Heaven, Hell, etc. 4. There is definitely a darker sexual undertone to the relationship between Lyra's parents - not explicit, but \\"domination.\\" 5. I am alarmed that these books are targeted at young adults (teens), but the reader and parents are not warned of the nature of the content. The dark nature of these books could be very disturbing to some young people. 6. Personally, I think it's good to expose my child to alternate views that may not agree with those of our family. However, a book that is as diametrically opposed to my family's values as this one warrants discussion with my child. My child read this, and enjoyed the series, overall, and we also had some stimulating conversations as a result. I am very glad that I read this series as well so that we could have those discussions."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"First you have to open your mind, and put your religious beliefs behind you.If you do that, this trilogy will blow you away. It is a fantastic piece of literature."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"I enjoyed the first book in the trilogy and quickly began reading the rest. Sadly, things went from bad to worse. I truly wish Pullman had not allowed his \\"soapbox\\" to cloud his literary creativity."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"The first book in this series was very well written and engaging. However the second book, seemed to muddle the difference between good vs. evil, and left me feeling disappointed and uneasy. I was unable to complete the third book. It became clear that Mr. Pullman was expressing extremely anti-religious beliefs. The book simply contained too much blasphemy for me to continue. This book is definitly not appropriate for children. If you are a Christian parent looking for good science fiction/fantasy books for your child, stick w/ Narnia or Harry Potter. Both of these series draw a definite line btwn good & evil and the hero is on the side of good."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"There's no such thing as a good or bad book folks, just books. You either like it, or you don't. I absolutely loved this collection of these books. They are fun, exciting and overall probably the best adventure story for youngsters or old. If you're \\"offended\\" by subject matter, any subject matter, not just what's in this story ... Do yourself a favor, and don't read it. Don't judge until you read it, and have some knowledge about just what you're talking about. Pullman allows one to suspend him/herself and experience something unique.

My wife started the book while I was in the middle of it and we often fought over it. :) Pullman didn't go for the traditional fictional fare, and instead crafted new elements to dazzle and entertain - and to make you think.The book wasn't perfect (the Amber Spyglass was a weak link), and after I finished it I had a few little questions about things that had happened, but I'm not sure if the book didn't resolve them well or I just missed something - which is entirely possible in a book like this.It was absolutely worth my time to read it."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"This trilogy is insightful, entertaining and a fast paced read.

There were compelling characters and a promising plot with, what's really fun for me, a really promising allegory to follow and try to figure out (and atheists don't bother me if they at least try to make reasoned arguments instead of screeds). By book 2 things started to go downhill, however, and by book 3 I had the impression that the author was just cruising on the strength of his earlier successes.For one thing, I'm all for suspending belief when I read sci-fi, but by book 3 it seemed like Pullman stopped even trying to weave a coherent plot. People, angels and weird mechanical devices appear in the nick of time, and in exactly the right universe out of the infinity of possible universes. Daemons inexplicably switch universes to appear exactly where they're needed. Some ghosts fizzle away immediately upon seeing the light of day, while other ghosts live to fight for hours in the serie's final epic battle. And so on....OK, and I just can't stop myself from griping that the girl & women characters are generally manipulative and devious, whereas the male characters are invariably strong, noble, et cetera. By the third book Will is making all the important decisions and doing all the strategical planning. Lyra, who I liked so much in book one, is reduced in Book 3 to a role where she lies and manipulates constantly to get the pair out of scrapes, nurses Will when he's wounded, tenderly arranges his blankets even when he's well, and all the rest. OK, I get it, Will represents \\"free will\\" and Lyra represents Eve. But the main adults follow these same patterns. While both parents abandoned Lyra as a child, Mrs. Coulter comes in for repeated flagellation (and self-flagellation) for choosing career over parenthood and generally being a bad parent. Asriel does not -- How fair is this?And while I'm open to allegorical tales of any stripe, this one started very promisingly and then just fizzled out (spoiler alert!). It seems to boil down to this: a fictional ex-nun sits in a Spanish restaurant, checks out a good-looking Italian scientist, decides that chastity and convent life don't work for her any more -- and then she somehow immediately \\"knows\\", sitting there in Spain, that God doesn't exist. Seriously, there's not much more to it than that. A fictional character's \\"feelings\\" are supposed to substitute for any type of rational argument, and the fact that she's an ex-nun is apparently supposed to lend this the moral weight that it wouldn't have on its own. Instead, the religious allegory seems to depend mostly on the ham-handed literary convention of having all the religious figures do dastardly deeds, in place of any coherent arguments. Yeah, there's also something about an old guy in a cloud mountain who evaporates, but the timing is all wrong relative to the original sin allegory and the episode in that nice Spanish cafe, and besides I don't know any religious people beyond the age of 6 who still believe in bearded old guys. Indeed most religious people I know (Christians and others too) are more comfortable with the idea of a sort of universal benevolent spirit ....But wait! Isn't that sort of like people rejoining their daemons to live happily ever after in Pullman's afterworld that follows death, and the ghosts of Pullman's alternative cosmos, and whatever \\"concious\\" dust is supposed to be? But somebody stop me now, because I know Pullman definitely, most certainly, doesn't want us to think this way! Since it's clear that Pullman sees no ambiguity on these issues, I'll have to just go with the conclusion that it's bad writing and plotting.So by the end I was just so confused, annoyed, and disappointed .... Pullman is certainly entitled to his beliefs or non-beliefs, but he seems too lazy to try to convey them beyond using cardboard evil church characters. Or to construct a coherent plot."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"Although the first two books were quite good, I had trouble finishing the third, as it just seemed anti climactic and kind of poorly put together. I particularly found Ms. Coulter to be unbelievable (ok, she's a liar, but...) towards the end, and the elephant things were a bit weird, but ok... Also, I'm not a particularly religious person, but the none-too-subtle Christians suck message was starting to wear on me a bit by then. There where a few times where it just seems as if the characters stop to preach about it when it really wasn't relevant to the story. It just got old after a bit and at points it was a distraction from what I thought was a pretty good story up until the end, not the masterpiece I've heard some people call it, but decent fantasy."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"Ignore the ratings, this book's rank has been all too influenced by those who never read it.Pullman's written a trilogy that asks hard questions and doesn't answer all of them. It makes you think, and that's good. I don't think its for young kids, because bad things happen in it and there are mild sexual references. I don't think the Harry Potter books or the Lord of the Rings are for young kids either. But for thinking beings age 10ish and up, sure.So here's my review of the story (not Christianity, or atheism, or the controversy, but the book itself):Enough has be written about the plot that I won't summarize anything here.I found the world fascinating and wish he'd written more about it. I loved the daemons and the way they were done. Mrs. Coulter is a fabulous villain. The story moves well and never ceases to be interesting. And Pullman doesn't shirk from the ending you can sense is coming. He's pitiless and brave in his storytelling, something I admire. He presents ideas he's got to have known would cheese people off without once apologizing. I hope he never does.On the negative side, I did not like the characters. They were shallow. Lyra is the feisty/plucky heroine, Roger is the sidekick/foil, and Will is the intrepid hero (YAWN). I disliked the occasional intrusion of the omniscient narrator. I disliked being told things instead of shown them (eg., Lee Scoresby spends a lot time talking about how he loves Lyra like a daughter yet no time is spent on their relationship). The characters supposedly change over time, but that is done poorly and reads as inconsistency rather than maturation. Switching gears, major plot elements are never resolved, and some questions never answered.This is an idea book rather than a plot and character book. The ideas are fascinating and make the book very worthwhile. The plot and characters...less so.I gave it 4 stars because as an idea book it's very good."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"A nicely wrought story and very likeable characters. Might be a bit dark for young children, but very suitable for teenagers."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"Usually the first book in the series is the best. In this case, I loved all three, and each one was better than the previous one. So much imagination and creativity. Loved them :)"},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"I recommend this series to anyone with any sense of an imagination. They are the type of books that take you right where the characters are. It is as if you are in a completely different world when you open them. It is one of the most suspensful trilogies i've ever read, and i sincerely recommend these books to other teens. These far beat any of the Harry Potter books. A Definate Must-Read!!"},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"This trilogy is one of the most sweeping stories I have ever read. Decidedly anti-establishment when it comes to the church, Mr. Pullman's story traverses our world and several others, and describes the search for identity and self-government.Beautifully crafted, Mr. Pullman's stories lead one into the world of imagination as all good fantasy does, but they go beyond, leading one into the world of identity, establishment and trust.If, as a reader, you are looking for a fantasy where the sun is always shining and unicorns, pixies and gnomes dance on motes of light in eternal happiness, then do NOT read these works. If, however, you would like a read where one is constantly challenged not to skip ahead several pages to find out where the story is going next, are interested in exploring ideas counter to mainstream religious culture and experience and generally like to be thrilled, amazed and flung from one emotional extreme to the other, then Pullman is your man.Just buy the boxed set. Checking them out at the library will slake the immediate thirst, but you'll want to read these way more than once."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"I don't even like to read, but i had to for class and luckily i chose the best trilogy of all time! Phillip Pullman is the greastest author i've read. As far as people putting messages on here about how bad he is for having anti-christian promotion in his books.. it's a book for crying out loud.. it's an amazing book, and without that in it it just wouldn't be what it is. Myself, I am athiest so i can't say it bothers me any. This book is more suited towards readers at the age of 13(if having good comprehension levels)and up. Phillip Pullman is the best fantasy trilogy writer of all time."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"for those of you who think that all seriously religious-minded people are too close-minded for these books and that 6th graders can't handle this stuff... you're way too wrong.i consider myself a committed christian, and i personally didn't take this trilogy as offensive. it's a story. it's not religious or anti-religious.. it's just philosophical and complex. it makes you think, and it fully engages you to the \\"war\\". the ideas in this book are seemingly too far-fetched yet basic to think that Pullman is trying to make a religious statement here.and as for the age thing.. i read the Golden Compass the summer after 6th grade, and the other two books as soon as they came out. i have repeatedly read the books since (it's been 6 years) and i can't get enough of it, like many of my other friends who also started reading this trilogy when i did. So many of you (mainly adults, i should think) are comparing this trilogy to HARRY POTTER... that is a CRIME. the writing style of harry potter itself is childish, and though it MIGHT prove to be just as complex as His Dark Materials, it is not as condensed or mind-challenging. the characters of His Dark Materials also exceed the characters of Harry Potter. (i just read the 5th book, and it obviously lacks the necessary character development that you would think would come with an 800+ page book.)the 3rd book is by far the best since it ties everything in together. the 1st is great for pure adventure thrills. Pullman is one of the few authors that truly know how to write a series. (and yes, Rowling knows how to do it too.. i think.) you plan the entire series out before writing it. authors that try to ADD on will always lack something, either the little foreshadowing hints or a more-than-satisfying storyline.get the full set. you WILL read the entire trilogy and you'd want to read it repeatedly 'till you have to buy another set to replace the faded pages."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"I found the first book in the trilogy very difficult to get into, with it being set in an alternate universe. The reader made to accept a lot of strange ideas and concepts which do not get fully explained until later on in the book. Devotees of the fantasy genre may absorb the narrative a lot easier than I did. The story of Lyra is a dark one and is richly explored as she makes her way through her world to the North Pole and the end of the story.The second book was much more conventional in its story-telling and I found it easier to follow. The character of Will is introduced (who appears to come from our universe) and joins Lyra in her adventure. The appearance of Will allows questions to be asked from our perspective and the two children are given some freedom from adult characters introduced in the first book. By the end of the book, plot lines are being weaved through lots of different universes and Will's character is firmly established as an important part of the story to come.The Amber Spyglass is, again, completely different to the preceeding book. The story matures with the main characters, Lyra & Will, and explores emotional and spritual concepts to dramatic end. Complex issues relating to religion, life and death are examined rationally and not without reason. Ultimately the story is thought-provoking, which is what a good book should do.Overall, I found the trilogy incredibly \\"thoughtful\\". It's remarkably complex, yet very readable at the same time. I would advise parents to read this trilogy before their children, in preparation for the avalanche of questions that will arise from its reading."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"These books were amazing. Phillip Pullman has a great imagination and has written these books wonderfully. They are full of adventure, creatures that are only seen in your imagination, and well written, I would recommend these books. If you love Harry Potter and The Lord of the Rings, try these out. They are super and really good!"},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"Complex ideas; strong, credible, multidimensional (in every sense) characters - this knocks Harry Potter into a cocked hat.The first book (Northern Lights here in Britain, The Golden Compass in the US) is the most perfectly realised. Lyra's world is a place of wonder & grandeur & the balance of plot, action & character had me racing to the end.Book two, The Subtle Knife, suffers slightly from being largely set in our own mundane world, and the writing is comparatively flat & plot-driven. But there's much to treasure & the third book would be incomprehensible without reading this first.The Amber Spyglass, last & longest, introduces great new characters, places & concepts, exceeds the ambition & in places the execution of Northern Lights and if it's flabby here & there, it more often achieves the epic richness the story deserves.Pullman's creations will live in children's & adults' imaginations for a long time: apart from the 12-year-old main protagonists, wily Lyra & fearless Will, there's the exquisitely villainous Marisa Coulter & her malevolent golden monkey, the ambiguous antihero Lord Asriel (think Magneto in the X-Men), the noble bear Iorek Byrnison, gyptian king John Faa, the gay angels Baruch & Balthamos & numerous others.These are supremely moral books; Pullman doesn't flinch from confronting his heroes' failings (as well as society's) but they usually do the right thing. He's unsentimental, yet Iorek's farewell to Lyra had me blubbing. The chapter in The Amber Spyglass where Mary befriends the alien mulefa is beautiful & haunting.Pullman has said that separating his child-heroes from their parents is chiefly a storytelling device to allow them to operate independently, but here the parentage of both Lyra & Will is central to the story. And he effortlessly absolves himself from accusations of \\"too many coincidences\\" by establishing early on a sense that everything is happening because it is ordained to happen.As a sidenote, Pullman is a patron of the National Secular Society in Britain & it's clear he doesn't think much of organised religion. As I said, a sound moral influence for our kids. ;-)"},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"Ok, ok, I know there are like ten zillion reviews of this trilogy, but I have to give my 2 cents. Anyway, these are seriously cool books. The first one is THE GOLDEN COMPASS. It is about this girl, lyra, who lives at this big cool sounding college and spends her days running around and wreaking havoc who learns about this mysterious particle called (mega-imaginatively) \\"Dust\\" from her uncle, Lord Asriel. Then her friend roger gets kidnapped, and she goes on this quest to save him from a grisly fate and to learn more about Dust.(I am describing the barest essentials here) Along the way, she gets mixed up with withches, armored bears, soul eating specters, angels, God, mulefa, and more. (Well, most of the things I just mentioned are in the next two books). THE SUBTLE KNIFE and THE AMBER SPYGLASS are the next two books, but it is very very difficult to talk about the plots of them without giving too much away. plus, there are so many original and compelling elements about HDM that no-one could even begin to fully describe it in a review. Everything fits together in the end in the most ingenious way imaginable. Also, I love Philip Pullman's writing style. It is very rich and detailed, and you never get bored of it.The Golden Compass had a few inconsistencies in the setting, though. Like why are there zeppelins in a place with no cars?These books are compared frequently to the Narnia books, and all I will say is that fantasy-adventure wise, HDM makes Narnia look like the Teletubbies.However, I expected God to be a more complex character (not just blatantly evil). I think it would have added lots of philosophical stuff to the plot.Also: if you like your books to be phisically beautiful and elegant, buy the Knopf editions w/ the covers by Eric Rohmann. They are much prettier."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"My daughter and I read these together this summer and we both loved them. Adventure, excitement, beauty, philosophy, and just the right amount of fear/danger for a middle schooler."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"These books are everything that fantasy should be. I read these when I was younger and enjoyed them then, but re-reading them now as an adult is a completely new experience. These are fun, exciting and entertaining books that any fantasy fan should enjoy. Many older children would enjoy these because of the adventure and ages of the main characters. But more importantly, these are books that can be enjoyed multiple times all throughout one's life. The themes are timeless and the writing is superb. Though thought of to be children's books by many, they are really wonderful for all ages and times. This is what makes them so good. Now a word on this particular product. The boxed set is well designed and visually appealing, it will look nice on anyone's bookshelf. The coverart is lovely and they are sized well for taking on trips. Also, these books really should be enjoyed as a trilogy. I promise once the last page of the first book is finished, the second installment will be the only thing on your mind."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"This series is great for adults and young readers alike. I can't get enough of this captivating tale. I recommend reading it aloud with your family..it's great fun!"},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"I am an adult who loves fantasy novels. His Dark Materials are definitely dark, absorbing, incredibly creative, exciting, very well-written, refreshingly unsentimental... I can go on and on. I would recommend these books to mature kids 13 and up. Not for little ones... and not because of the religious context (most of which they wouldn't understand anyway), but because of the extreme amount of violence. And I have to say that it is a shame that there are narrow-minded people in this world who refuse to like these books based on the fact that the author is an atheist and dares put his beliefs in his own books. Never mind the fact that fantasy favorites C.S. Lewis and Madeleine L'Engle (my personal favorite) imbued their christian beliefs into their writing. I don't judge them for that. I am not a christian, but I love their books because they're excellent. There is no danger of me being converted to christianity from reading their books than a christian becoming an atheist from reading His Dark Materials. They're FANTASY books, not non-fiction."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"Just read it.Beautifully written, beautifully imagined, fiercely intelligent but lacking nothing of the kind of emotion that can move an adult to tears.

It just sucks you in and is filled with imagery and imagination. The movie The Golden Compass probably left you confused, but that's because the movie had to leave out a lot.

A MUST READ!"},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"These story emcompass and interesting take on the imagination, and should be share with friends and family.

It is destined to be a classic"},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"This series is original and thought provoking. I personally love these books, I'm just sorry I waited so long to finally read them! True emotion, creative ideas, and great characters make this an excellent trilogy. Most of the negative reviews here have less to do with the writing and story and more to do with intolerant Christians that can't handle people having beliefs contrary to their own. As long as you are openminded and enjoy fantasy you will love this story.Now about the actual books themselves, I probably would not choose this box set if I had it to do over, because the books are quite small and as a result the font size is tiny and it is harder to open the books fully. I would choose some of the larger sized paperbacks, which are more comfortable to read."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"Curiosity is what got me to pick up this set from the local Library. Having seen the movie I was surprised at finding there was a Golden Compass novel. I had not known about it before that time and decided to see if it was the same story as the movie. I was pleasantly surprised to see the characters I had become familiar with in the movie, in the novel, I also grabbed the other two Subtle Knife, and Amber Spyglass. I was not disappointed. Philip Pullman created a beautiful world, and beautiful characters in this trilogy, Lyra's character is very like-able through out the series even when she's bratty, I couldn't help seeing her as a sort of little sister. Her quest to save her friend Roger from the Gobblers, meeting an interest cast of characters, the Witch Serefina Pekkala, Lee Scoresby, and Iorek Byrnison. And many more as the trilogy went on.I especially enjoyed the growing love Lyra and Will had for each other. And was saddened when they had to split up again to go to their own worlds. It is such a think that many of us can understand, having found the one we loved only to be unable to be with that person. I give His Dark Materials, five stars, for being one of the best Fantasy series I have read."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"Plenty of reviews showing their praise so I won't bother retelling what they've said. The series is great, and I can't wait to read the additional pieces Pullman has written.My only negative comment was that I'm unhappy that the US version was censored in book three over something so absolutely small that I'm surprised anyone actually bothered. (Check Wikipedia, it's a small paragraph in the Marzipan chapter).It really doesn't affect the read, but I'm adamant that censorship is not for some outside entity to decide and impose. Especially in a country so proud of their \\"freedom\\"."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"I've been a junior high English teacher for several years, and I am disturbed by the dark messages that this book teaches. Pullman's trilogy is twisted and disturbing in its message--twisting the concept of evil vs. good, with the evil depicted as the good. The author, Phillip Pullman, said in a 2003 interview that \\"My books are about killing God.\\"I'm sickened that they are making a \\"mild version\\" of his book into a movie to ignite interest in his books.We have enough violent and dark messages being taught to young minds, and this author is teaching them in a sick and subtle way. I hate this book, I despise this author's intentions, and I hope that no matter what religion you believe in, you will not condone a book that ever teaches that EVIL is good. EVIL is never good. The Holocaust was simply evil. Loving people is simply good. How can you twist and complicate those universal messages around to young, developing minds!A huge thumbs down. Tell everyone you know to not buy into this sick author's messages."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"Had the author not stupidly used the term DEMON for the people's animals, he would not have lost the massive audience his books otherwise might have gotten him.

The worst mistake a fantasy author can make is to insult millions of people by using terms from real-world faiths."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"Phillip Pullman has unfortunately expressed a bias against the Christianity of Lewis' Narnia works, believing the Christian message is somehow inferior and bigoted, compared presumably with his works. Pullman's efforts lack the depth of meaning found within the Narnia works deprived of such resplendent base, leading to unfortunate ramblings without similar quality of meaning. Less inspired than Narnia, that lack in the Pullman works leaves them unfortunately wanting."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"When my children were younger, I would pre-read books before giving them. I was entranced by the golden compass - and then I read the next book and was horrified. These books are not for children! I don't mind if people want to air their anti-Christian, anti-any religion views in adult books but THEY SHOULD NOT BE TRYING TO SELL THEIR VIEWS TO CHILDREN. That is just sick. Besides, the second book stunk. Hopefully, the movie sanitized the anti-Christian views."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"This book is a travesty. I had to throw it in the trash it was so offensive. It is about two children who are to begin the world and the Garden of Eden all over again, led by fallen angels and intent on killing \\"god\\" as he is depicted as a tyrant in the book. The Golden Compass, which is now a movie, is about the church being an evil bureaucracy and tearing the souls away from children.

Actually, it should not be read by anyone."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"Phillip Pullman is a proud athiest who hates C. S.

Is that faith so worn that all contrary to it is damaging? It seems that way...with all of the unwarranted uproar.This book is great. There are times that you will read a book and realize the magnificence of it, and the unimaginable talent of the author as you do, to the extent that you become awestruck.

Overall, simply enthralling and wonderful."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"Philip Pullman has written a number of accesible and satisfying books for pre-teens and other young people. As a writer he is a skilled craftsman.This series, however, is something else. It is not targeted for young audiences nor, I suspect, for older ones. Age is not determinent. These are novels for those who are eager to think, to stretch their imagination in ways that makes the world which is present before us more real. Pullman has written an integrated series which, when taken as a whole, is a remarkable evocation of a universe which seems wildly strange, but just beyond our sight.The series achieves a fresh conception of the deity, a conception which is wholly intriguing. We all are creations of this god, but through a series of circumstances and incidents, our relationship with the deity, and its relationship with its creation, is dramatically changed.This is a complex and richly realized story of humanity's struggle to rise above its own limitations, and the importance of each individual's struggle to achieve responsibility for her or his own life.As an adventure story this series is gripping, well-paced and multi-faceted. But it is in the higher level of meaning that Pullman has achieved a transcendent work.I highly recommend this series for those of all ages who seek intriguing, thought-provoking reading in an exciting format."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"Taken as a whole, HIS DARK MATERIALS (THE GOLDEN COMPASS / THE SUBTLE KNIFE / THE AMBER SPYGLASS)is a original, inventive, entertaining and uneven work - while the first two books steadily build plot, suspense and personalities, it is let down by the end with plot twists from out of nowhere, a complete redirection of the purpose and goals established in the very first pages of THE GOLDEN COMPASS (known as THE NORTHERN LIGHT in the U.K.) and personality shifts that go against the grain established so carefully from the start - but don't let this put you off the series - there is much here to enjoy and ponder. While often listed and marketed towards the YA crowd, the themes presented here are far reaching and very deep. The nature of God is brought into question, as is the need for the Church, the role parents play in their childrens lives, power, responsibility, friendship and muder. There seems to be little that Pullman will not thrown in and play off of - and at times it works very well (as is the case in the introduction of Will in the opening pages of THE SUBTLE KNIFE - heartbreaking), and sometimes not (THE AMBER SPYGLASS has several asides and issues that if more time could have been spent would have filled three more books, easily - but as is stands, they fall short). Although while adult in nature, these books are still easy reading for kids - those who enjoyed HARRY POTTER (or the REDWALL series) will have no trouble here understanding what's going on, in fact there are times in the book where they can't help but understand, as Pullman will spend several pages laying out a textured map of the plot and personalities so clearly that sometimes there is very little surprise later on in the following books. In the end, HIS DARK MATERIALS is a stunning set of books - flawed, true, but still light years beyond most books on the market today."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"I did not expect to enjoy these books, but they were great - not hard to read, but with some more \\"grown up\\" subject matter - scientific theories, ties to religion, etc. I found them to be a great mix of fantasy and actual interesting content and have since recommended them to many people."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"I had read this trilogy over Christmas last year and really liked it.

All in all very satisfied with the purchase."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"This trilogy is one of the best i've read since Lord of the rings, althought it has nothing to do with it. It stands in a whole different universe which paradoxically seems more real than a fantastic one. Exceedingly good reading. The plot is something else!!! Not only for children like intended in the movie The golden compass (which by the was has nothing to do with the book itself). This is the second time i read this trilogy the first one was in spanish and the transaltion is a ton different!!! Lost in translation he he."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"I have to say I was a little embarrassed when the bookstore associate led me to the kids section to find these books. However, don't let the trilogy's classification deter you from reading this series. There is a lot of mature content in the story. The book \\"The Golden Compass\\" is much better than the movie. In the feature film there are a lot of inaccuracies that take away from the piece. If you have an imagination and you love to escape to made up worlds, then you will love His Dark Materials. It won't take much reading before you find yourself wanting a demon of your own. In the second book I was captivated by the complicated storyline. There are many narratives going on at once, but it is easy to keep up. The third book fascinated me. If you are a devout anything then you should only read this book to cite its blasphemy. This series received a lot flak from whatever religions (I can't keep track of them all) but I loved the new concepts and creativity this author used. He paints a whole different picture of God and Heaven. He has a wonderful perspective. There are creative creatures throughout the books, some of which are completely new to the world of fiction. With all the big trilogies that have been written, it is hard to find new books that don't seem like a spin off, but I guarantee you haven't read anything like this before. When I finished the books I was sad there wasn't any more to read. Enjoy this emotional tale of the bravest young girl to ever be created. She will convince you that being a liar is a good thing."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"This trilogy is fabulous! I would recommend it to anyone who wants a fantasy (timely messages) with which to spend some time. It would be ideal summer reading for the strong-reader ten to twelve year-olds, and great for adults, but even a ten-year old would have to have a pretty sophisticated mentality. I loved it."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"I read the books when I was about 12 and I still love them at 19. As far as religion goes I didn't think anything of it when I was younger. I strongly recommend this trilogy to any child going into middle school because I doubt that they put as much thought into any secret meanings that may be in the book."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"I received this product very quickly and it was brand new as stated. I am enjoying these books very much and am glad I have ordered them! : ) : ) : ) : )"},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"My friend let me borrow The Golden Compass but didn't have the other two in the trilogy when I was dying to read it. I finally caved and bought the trilogy because I couldn't wait any longer! Unlike some authors who write sequels and 3rd, 4th, or 5th books just because they're trying to ride out their fame with their first novel, Pullman definitely delivers with all three of the books. They are all beautifully written and incredibly engaging, for both children and adults. At first I felt embarrassed to read a children's novel, but after a chapter or so, I quickly discovered that the book had universal appeal. Pullman has such a wonderful imagination and manages to surprise you all the time throughout the three novels. The characters were infuriating at times, but I quickly reminded myself that he was writing about pre-teens so that explained the juvenile personalities who sometimes acted like mature adults. The trilogy was about loss, friendship, respect, love, betrayal, faith, etc.Many critics of this book argue that it's deeply anti-Christian. I disagree. I think the book was simply extolling the importance of independent thinking. It was a story plot that taught that we are capable of good even without being religious, and that destinies don't exist because we can make our own futures. It was an uplifting, imaginative story. For children, the story on the surface will be fun enough. For adults, it's definitely interesting to be able to read between the lines and see a deeper meaning to the story than what one might read into it at first."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"I was kept constantly interested just to see how the author's mind worked as he moved from enigma to conundrum! The idea of a continuous cycle of universes is not a new one, but his approach to it -- and how one would move from one to the other -- is totally unique. If the move-makers go on to complete the trilogy I can see a real heyday for the special effects people!"},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"I heard that this series was better than Harry Potter, so of course I had to read them. For me, the first book, The Golden Compass, was quite ordinary. I did not engage emotionally with Lyra - somehow, Pullman's writing did not connect. It was an okay fantasy, and I almost didn't care about reading more. Later, I picked up the second book, the Subtle Knife, and became a little more engaged, at least enough to decide to finish the series. Wow, I am glad I did. The third book, The Amber Spyglass, is full of intriguing ideas. The characters go from static to dynamic, and you finally, finally, get emotionally involved with them. The clear-cut good-and-evil that is so easy to follow in Harry Potter is absent from Pullman's stories, which might be why some people like them better. Pullman has his characters say that people are not good or evil, only their actions are good (if they help someone) or evil (if they hurt someone). So for older kids, this is an important idea to introduce. I would not read this to young kids; it would be confusing and scary."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"This is a great series and I loved the whole thing. I wish I had a daemon...or maybe I already do and don't know it yet. All people will enjoy this book. Heck, I don't even like reading and I couldn't put it down. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"It's very difficult to write a review of a trilogy like this; however, I've put together some initial thoughts, ideas and questions both in response to the books and some other postings on this site.I do find it offensive when people are so breathtakingly critical of other people with different beliefs. Religion, no religion, apples, oranges, coffee, tea. Who cares? Much of the point of life, I find, is to find people with whom we interact, and whether that interaction is difficult or easy leads us to making 'friends'. It's such a shame that people \\"don't let\\" their children read books because of the writing; it's a shame that people say that Philip Pullman can't write. Many things are a shame.For one, I believe that Philip Pullman CAN write. I was finally persuaded to read this trilogy after my mother and sister badgered my into doing so. I'm glad I did. But still, at times, I found myself skim reading. Parts of the books are too long, the descriptions are wearisome, the sub-plots lengthy. That said, the 'story' makes up for it all. I was fascinated by Lyra and Will; their quest, their adventure, their relationship.I won't bother with a plot summary. I didn't come to read reviews to find out what happens - I wanted to know what other people thought. And it seems that we're divided - not into two (Church and anti-Church), but into 3 (Church, anti-Church, anti-Philip Pullman).Myself, I finished the book two days ago and I've honestly found it difficult to think about anything else. The themes are simple yet complex, and at the end of The Amber Spyglass, we are still not entirely sure of Pullman's views or what he wanted his readers to feel.The trilogy is fascinating and definitely worth a read. But leave some time and read it properly; don't rush it. There are too many ideas and plots and characters that it is very easy to get lost in it all.One more thing: we need to get over this constant need for comparison. The only resemblance to Harry Potter is the battle between Good and Evil, and maybe sacrifice. But these books are in a different world (a world like ours, but different, perhaps) to HP.Let's try and read books for themselves and not constantly find the need to criticize everyone with whom we don't agree."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"I just want to say that I think this is a very good trilogy, it deals with religion and what ifs, and makes you think. I'm a Christian and believe in God, but I think those of you who won't read Harry Potter, or these books because they have something even remotely against God are narrow-minded, I respect your strong faith, but I think you should at least look at it as a chance to think about or discuss religion.Also, if you don't think your child should read these books, I think you're missing out, these books could provoke good discussions about God. You might learn that your child is even more fiercly religious than you after they read this so-called \\"blasphemy,\\" then again, maybe Christianity in't the right road for them, God gave all of us free will, for good or bad, you need to allow your child(ren) to excercise that free will, and chose God or another path.I hope I won't be hunted down for writing this, but this is what I believe, and will continue to believe until someone shows me why I should believe otherwise.And, once again, please keep an open about books, and give these a try, you might just surprise yourself with questions you never thought about before."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"Never has their been such a series-spell-binding and magnificiant. A dark and thought-provoking tale that will have you begging for more. Some may argue that Pullman is an Athiest, but I feel that he is exposing teens to the harshness of the world. Rediculing the Church and suggesting that God is not the Creator can only broaden one's mind; in this way Pullman proposes thoughts and questions that very few dare to speak. People of all ages can enjoy these books, but since it is partly a coming of age series I would highly recommend these novels to pre-teens and teens.After I finished the last book, I felt so profoundly effected by Pullman's words I just couldn't stop thinking about them, and I still haven't. Do yourself a favor, and buy this amazing series, which rivals that of Harry Potter!"},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"This is a book that works on so many levels. Though some here have said that it is a book for eleven years and older, I'd say to boost that up to thirteen or so. My reason? His Dark Materials questions the world, the existence of god, the character of good and evil, the meaning of love, the essence of childhood and growing up...deep issues that can only be appreciated by those older than elementary age. I first read this book when I was eleven myself and, though I enjoyed it, I did not fully comprehend it. I am fourteen now and, through re-reading, I have garnered the full beauty of it. All prospective readers should clear a few hours from their schedule for each book, find a comfortable chair, and read with an open mind. After reading, I recommend contemplating the questions posed instead of giving in and diving into the next book. This series deserves it. They are not fantasy books, they are philosophical works! Well, that is to say they are entertaining philosophical works."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"Pullman's fantasy trilogy \\"His Dark Materials\\" is an entertaining, original work which is worth reading. However, it appears that all the marketing stops have pulled out in order to make this work a manufactured classic. Comparisons to \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" etc. have been trotted out, and a fancy trade three-volume set is available for the Christmas market.Enough already! These books are well-written and fun; worth the price of admission. Classics, however, they are not. Time may prove me wrong, but I don't think publishers can manufacture greatness (pace boy bands). To readers: buy them and enjoy them. To the publishers: settle down!Casey Coleman, Ed.D."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"I love to read more than anyone I know and I have read probably thousands of good books. These are the best. They have enough action to keep you on edge throughout the whole series, but they are not utterly devoid of reasoning. While most popular science fiction and fantasy is just chock full of epic battles, space travel, fireworks, and quests, these books give you somthing more to think about for a long time afterward- the nature of war, religion, humor, love and humanity. Phillip Pullman manages to weave together the lives of his characters in skilled and often unexpected ways. Definately a 5 star series. A word of caution- you MUST read them in order to understand the complicated plot."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"My Grandson started reading Golden Compass, and I started looking around on the web for the others in the trilogy and came across the dispute as to whether the series was indeed fit for children to read. Both sides of the dispute appeared to me to lack credibility and seemed to be way over sensitive, so I decided to read the series and decide for myself.My conclusion? Both sides are correct to some extent. Yes, the series is something of a propaganda fusillade against the Roman Catholic Church, but the attacks are actually mostly weak and shallow. The Church's tolerance of religious torture and the story's depiction of that is probably fair, although I am no expert by any means on that. The anti-religion bias in the series is there too, but it is so shallow that it is meaningless to any person knowledgeable of any of the good things religion has brought to civilization.The entire story is clean, although sometimes quite violent. But, in my estimation it is free of the gratuitous violence present in so many of our movies that the kids like and survive from so easily. Probably no bad dreams.The story is a basic struggle of good versus evil, and good wins in spades. The setting is so fantastic that it is hard for someone to really imagine that it connects to our world or our current civilization, even though there are a lot of similarities. For example, the supernatural beings in it are essentially nuts, although within the world view. So, it is very easy, if one feels the need to counteract any part of a perceived negative message, that is very easy to do.The flow of the story is somewhat jerky, but I think that all of the loose ends eventually get cleaned up so that it makes sense. Although, there is something of a change of heart of one character that is really kind of shallow and not well developed.All in all, it was a fine read, and when over it left me with a feeling of wanting to know more about the future of the main characters. That, to me, is a good thing."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"SPOILERS FOLLOW. I've only read the Golden Compass; and liked it, mostly. It is well-written, the world that Mr. Pullman creates and populates is imaginative, and the story is complex and layered enough to be engrossing. But it's only 3 quarters of a good book, and I dropped my rating from 4 to 3 stars. It's to be expected that, as the heroine and focus of the story, Lyra has the knack for devising appropriate and effective responses to the desperate situations into which she is thrust. But her trickery of the bear king was extrordinarily contrived. Enough so that I almost stopped reading the book. Yes, I know that Mr. Pullman explains why she was able to pull it off, but I just didn't buy it. The story just got weaker from that point. I did like the complexity surrounding her relationship with her father, but the race to save Roger at the end was strangely devoid of emotion. I mean, Lyra is certainly described as distraught, but it just didn't come across effectively. Nor did the bizarre episode between her father and her mother at the end (another good idea wasted). To top it all off, the opening of the bridge seemed almost like an afterthought.I'm certainly going to move on to the next book. It took the second Harry Potter book to really get me hooked, and the same thing may happen here.UPDATE:Ok, I'm done with the Amber Spyglass. Sadly, my earlier impressions have been confirmed. Mr. Pullman is, technically, a good writer and has some very interesting ideas, but his story-telling is inconsistent. As a result, I was engaged by some passages (sometimes very engaged), but frequently found my mind wandering; and when your mind is wandering in the middle of the pivotal battle scene in the final book, then something's wrong. For me, part of the problem was his use of multiple worlds. What starts out as a mysterious and heretical concept in Book 1, ends up rapidly becoming a crutch. So many locales get introduced that none of them are effectively developed and all seem 2-dimensional (with the possible exception of Lyra's world in Book 1, and that's pretty much left behind). Worse, character development ended in Book 1, with the exception of Ms. Calder; and while Mr. Pullman took her character in an unexpected and interesting direction, it wasn't convincing (when the angel Regent -- what'shisname -- delves into the depths of her soul, she's somehow able to keep him from seeing her love for her daughter? Once again, I didn't buy it). The only two characters in the series that I developed some affection for are Lyra's daemon and Mr. Scoresby (and his daemon, so make it three).As for the big attack on religion, all I can say is *yawn*. Mr. Pullman manages to take an interesting idea (in this case, borrowed from some early Christian sects) and drain the excitement and mystery out of it. Turns out that living for thousands of years, having a hyperdimensional existence, and being able to delve into peoples souls doesn't really convey any tactical or strategic advantage. Angels are just another bunch of guys from down the street. The death of \\"God\\" was extraordinarily anti-climactic, and the subsequent death of the angel Regent (and putative chief architect of human misery) wasn't much more compelling. And don't get me started on the world of the dead thing, or on the \\"sacrifice\\" Lyra and Will are asked to make. The fate of all intelligent life across all worlds depended on that?OK, so now I sound like I disliked it more than I did. Sorry about that. Sometimes you get started on these things and then only remember the parts that disappointed you. This is a decent, 3-star story, but the best part of the series, by a substantial margin, is the first 3/4s of The Golden Compass."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"There definitely are some more sophisticated themes and adventures to be experienced in these books. I'd say it's probably best for 5th graders and higher, not so much for the lower elementary crowd. I will say though that I don't think it would necessarily be traumatic for a younger child to read this series, I have heard of a number of children in the 8 yr old age group that love having this trilogy read to them.For my husband and I, as we are avid fantasy/sci readers, it was a fantastic read that we both enjoyed enormously. Children and adults alike would love these books. Very well written, exciting, original, and - as if the first three weren't enough - it manages to effortlessly, in the most non-contrived, non preachy way, offer up a world of philosophical ideas to grapple with.A truly wonderful read, definitely part of our relatively recent \\"Golden Age\\" of fantasy/sci fi literature."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"It is not often that we get to witness real magic. The opportunity comes only occasionally and when it does it is rarely of the genus that we have witnessed in Phillip Pullman's trilogy, His Dark Materials. The three books take the reader through such a fantastical journey that one ends up praying that the world of the books should somehow become true.The story deals with the adventures of a care-free and naughty Lyra Belecqua, who lives in another universe that is parallel to our own. It deals with her adventures and travels through various parallel universes in realization of a cosmic destiny which she must fulfill. As is the nature of all great destinies in literature, there are people (and armoured polar bears, and flying witches, and other fantastical beings!) from various universes helping her in fulfilling it. There is the boy, Will Parry, from our own universe who becomes her companion in the epic events, and who is linked to her destiny. Lyra, along with Will, has to fight various forces that try to keep her from fulfilling what she must. What follows is an epic adventure and a coming-of-age story of the two children, ripe with its share of heroes, villains, and others whose loyalties we don't quite know.The series has been intended not only for young adults but also for grown-ups. There are various themes in the novels, the orthodoxy and dogmatism of organized religion, speculations on the nature of God, the after-life, the universe, etc. that will definitely appeal to a mature mind. The work deals with a broad range of ideas, relating to science, religion, and philosophies of right and wrong.One of the challenges in writing a trilogy is to maintain the standard of quality and the pace and intrigue in the action. The writer has managed this with immense skill. Not only does the interest of the reader never wane, but one is more deeply entangled in the plot as the story progresses. Also the development of the characters is worth mentioning. The development of Lyra into a young lady and of Will into a mature young man has received skillful treatment. Also the development of other characters like Pantlaimon and Mrs. Coulter deserve mention. The author's style of writing is simple, yet powerful and convincing.His Dark Materials, I dare say considering Mr. Harry Potter's immense following, the best work in the genre of children's fantasy that we have witnessed in recent times.His Dark Materials Trilogy (The Golden Compass; The Subtle Knife; The Amber Spyglass) (His Dark Materials)"},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"I love the fantasy genre; the problem is, the majority of books found under this genre lack depth. After reading several reviews of the Golden Compass, I decided to take a chance. Not only did I find that the storyline moves in a straightforward manner, it also contains depth - issues related to religion, social hierarchies, prejudice, stereotypes, social mores, the quest for power - and the ways to maintain it, and coming of age - to name just a few. These nuances are beautifully woven into the storyline; they don't browbeat. Consequently, if you only read the \\"surface\\" of the story, this is for you; yet, if you're a reader who looks at the underlying pinnings of a story - this story is also for you."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"This trilogy is a fabulous work of fiction with incredibly complex themes about the universe, sin, and love. For all of those who disagree with the theology behind the book, you can nevertheless enjoy delving into creative descriptions of the inter workings of angels, souls, sin, and consciousness. I doubt that young readers could fully appreciate the theological allegories; in which case the book would appear to simply be about talking polar bears, witches, and faraway worlds."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"Excellent trilogy; even the middle book, traditionally the weakest link of any three-book chain, is solid. Finely drawn characters, fascinating \\"what if\\" parallel worlds, and a lot of depth and research implied (but not paraded in front of the reader in a \\"look at all the homework I did\\" manner, as is the case with some authors). This is a Young Adult series in the finest tradition, addressing adolescent coming-of-age issues in such a way that an adult would find interesting. And Pullman never writes down to his audience, either. As to the highly hyped \\"controversy,\\" the aspects regarding the role of organized religion are handled intelligently and are not always what they seem by the conclusion. It's a novel -- fiction -- and the best fiction both entertains and makes you think. His Dark Materials succeeds on both levels."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"After seeing the movie for 'The Golden Compass' I was expecting that the book would be better and that the whole series would play as just another alternative to 'Lord of the Rings' (as the movie did). I was absolutely shocked by how MUCH better the book was than the movie, and was completely riveted through books two and three.What I find most amazing is that the author reveals everything in such a slow and meticulous way that you are still learning new elements of the world and of the story right up to the end - every page you read could contain an amazing shift of direction. I *never* expected this story to take me where it did, and my only regret is that it all had to end.This is not just a book for young adults, either. In my mid thirties, I found pleanty in this book worth being excited about."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"I am already on the third book. Great read for young and old alike I think. As far as any contraversy, I don't think these books are harmful to anyone. The story is a great adventure and for those looking for something deeper it can give them a lot to think about. I am enjoying them very much and would recommend it to anyone!"},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"One thing that I will note is that if you're very religious (in particular Christian), then you may not enjoy this series as it gets to be very critical of any organized religion (and in particular, Christianity).But if you can get past that, then I highly recommend this trilogy."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"I burned through the entire trilogy in about a week, and if nothing else, I was glued to my seat for the entire ride. The first two books are great. The third one suffers a little, as the scene becomes a bit too complicated with too many competing factions, and the author stumbles during the major battle scene at the end of the book. However, discounting that battle seen, the third book is an exciting ending to a great series."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"I really could not put these books down once I started reading. Mr Pullman writes a wonderfully exciting story, with many plot twists and turns and complex ideas.I have started to re-read all 3 books, and even the second time around they are very enjoyable, in fact I am getting even more understanding of the characters and plot lines.Good value - buy it and read with an open mind :)"},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"I just like this series.The books are far more interesting than the movie."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"** Parents beware!**This trio of books is beautiful, magical, mind expanding. Pullman's creation of multiple fully-faceted worlds is spellbinding. Just beautiful writing, I'd recommend it for any adult/young adult.That said: the central premise behind this fantastic chronicle is not something I would want my pre-teen child or younger teenager to be exposed to. It's nihilistic and heavily into materialist philosophy: exactly what kids today DON'T need.For older teens and adults, highly recommended. For anyone younger (even tho the cover says this is recommended for anyone 8 to 80), definitely NOT recommended.If you're thinking about giving this to a child (-14 or so), please read it first. Consider keeping your young ones' innocence for a few years. Teach them values, hope, and faith in something. Then the imaginative springboard that is Pullman's saga will be a good thing."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"I've always loved the classic fantasy works of Tolkien, C.S. Lewis, LeGuin and most recently, J.K. Rowling's Harry Potter series. However, my absolute favorite is His Dark Materials. Not only is it a bold interpretation of Paradise Lost, another one of my favorite reads, but it's full of completely new ideas, characters, and theories; not to mention it's coming from a completely different philosophical perspective. The idea of parallel universes was enough for me to get hooked. The Golden Compass is probably the slowest reads of the series, but it serves the purpose as being an introduction. Once you read the the Subtle Knife, you will be completely mesmerized; not to mention this series has one of the greatest and most heartbreaking endings ever in the Amber Spyglass. Pullman is a master story-teller and I will never get over the fact that he chose to use a young girl as the main hero - and is able to write her perspective brilliantly."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"Pullman's fantasy trilogy glows with brilliance and majesty. Centered around Lyra, a young girl in a complex universe, 'Materials' rings with the tone of fantasy greats like Tolkein and Rowling. A wonderful set for young readers and old hands! READ TODAY!!!"},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"In a visual world it is all too easy to let others take over your imagination. You accept other peoples' visions as your own. It is convenient, easy, saves your effort but in effect makes your creative abilities go first numb and then dead. This is a book which may help re-awaken what you might have forgotten ever having. Or what you never had, brought up in front of a TV screen.It would be a spoiler to give out any hints about the content - anyway, it is too complex to be summed up in a review in any but a ridiculous way. The important part is that Pullman creates a whole new world in his book, a world at an angle to ours and he gives you a chance to join him in the trip this book is, imagining the world he describes. If the book had nothing more to offer (and it is hardly the case) this alone would make it a perfect choice.I could never understand why Harry Potter became a world bestseller and Pullman lagged behind. Let's hope that the movie and general interest that follows will give Pullman the place he has always deserved."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"I have read a lot of books, and many of them have been amazing, but this trilogy is one of the best I have EVER read."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"This is a great series if you like magic, parallel worlds, talking animals, and lots of action. The first book The Godlen Compass is coming out in movie form in December, so it helps to be prepared by knowing the plot and characters. I am not sure if this movie is only the first book or the entire trilogy.I abhor people who tell too much of the plot in reviews, so I have not given anything away in this review.Basically, a young girl unaware of her special abilities and true parentage is involved in myriad escapades with and without human / animal companions. Of course, evil exists and tries to thwart her at every turn as she tries to make the right choices. The secret is that she must find her own way without anyone telling her what to do, or she will not be able to save the world. Apparently, everyone magical and non-magical knows that she is a special person. Magical DUST (which represents the life force for GOOD) is almost another character in this series. It known only by \\"special\\" people who have plans to use it for pleasant and unpleasant ends.The Golden Compass is a compass that only tells the truth through hands that move through a variety of symbols, each of which have many layers of meaning. It is the last remaining compass like this in the world and the main character not only has it, but is able to read it without the normal years of training and the \\"how to\\" book.The Subtle Knife is a knife that can cut windows from one world into the next and can only be wielded by someone that the knife chooses. A male child companion of the main character is eventually the possessor of this powerful knife which is also deadly against all types of magical villans. Of course, everyone wants to possess this knife!!The Amber Spyglass is a scientific invention built to identify and determine \\"up close\\" what DUST actually is and why the world is coming to a bad end without it. This magic DUST of good life feelings and actions is pouring out of all the worlds, leaving only BAD people to be in charge...unless someone can change this scenerio.This is an enjoyable series with very creative situations and characters. The action is non-stop and harrowing most of the time. However, if you have any strong Christian religious beliefs, you might be upset at how creation, life, death, and religion are portrayed throughout this series."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"I just finished re-reading Phillip Pullman's astonishing trilogy for the third time. No, I'm not an eager 11-year-old desperate for a Potter substitute. I'm a thirty-two year old English teacher happily immersed in the modern day renaissance that is children's fantasy. Of course, like any renaissance, there are the founding fathers, such as C.S. Lewis. There are the, at times, appallingly bad writers like Stephenie Meyer and there are the highly capable, thrilling storytellers like Madeleine L'engle, Lois Lowry, and J.K. Rowling.And then there is Phillip Pullman outstripping them all with his spiritually complex, daringly original trilogy, \\"His Dark Materials.\\"The great thing about Pullman's series is that it works on two levels. Adult readers (and even academics) will note his ingenious use of literary allusions, scientific theories, history, and various myths and religious beliefs to bring to life not just multiple worlds, but multiple universes. Young readers will appreciate his carefully crafted, highly suspenseful plot, his exciting descriptions of exotic worlds, and his heroic, compelling characters, all of whom must suffer and make difficult choices in a time of great upheaval.I dare not give any plot details away--the twists and turns are too clever to ruin--but I do want to say a word about Pullman's contribution in terms of fantasy literature for young girls. This series is certainly one that boys will enjoy, chalk full as it is with giant armored bears, action-packed battle sequences, texas ballooners, gyspies, and a young boy, Will, who becomes the second protagonist when he shows up in book two and learns to wield a knife that cuts through the very fabric of the universe.However, unlike, say, \\"The Chronicles of Narnia,\\" which demonizes female power, or \\"The Lord of the Rings,\\" which pushes women to the side, or even \\"Harry Potter,\\" which, let's face it, is mostly about a young boy's quest, \\"His Dark Materials\\" centers on Lyra, a feisty, smooth-talking, brave, highly independent, young, intelligent female protagonist. She absolutely explodes gender expectations and her adventurous, hilariously gutsy spirit leaves you realizing just how few strong female characters we have in fantasy children's (or young adult's) literature. Pullman reverses expectations again with his sympathetic depiction of female witches and with his complex portrayal of Mrs. Coulter, who is neither entirely good nor entirely evil.[...]Come with an open mind and you will not be disappointed."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"Book 1 and 2 are very good read but the writer loses focus and his confidence by the time he reaches the 3rd. A timid end and a climax that takes place long before you reach the last page. Most seriously he is not able to maintain his reader's suspension of disbelief - which I think is a major infraction on the writer's ability particularly those who're treading on this genre. The only character(s) that stands out and in fact leaps from the pages of the book is Mrs. Coulter and her daemon the Golden Monkey. The heroine Lyra pales in comparison to her Mommy and her daemon.But overall, this series cannot be missed; you can't do without it if you are a fan of this genre."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"The finest piece of work I've read in 40 years. I, at first, had no idea what the author was talking about. Then the lightbulb turned on. It totally captivated me and had me in its thrall. I cannot compare it to Tolkein or LeGuin as it came from a totally unique perspective. Comparisons fail as to works of art. We only add our own perspectives and prejudices. As said in interviews with the author, this is a story of children moving from innocence to experience."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"It's been awhile since I've been captured by an author's writings. I will be honest ~~ if it weren't for the movie and the fervor that accompanied the movie, I would not have been bothered to pick up these books. My husband and I took advantage of a rare evening out and saw \\"The Golden Compass\\" at the movie theater. It was done well enough that I just knew that the book would be better. So for Christmas, my husband presented these books to me. I read them all in a week and just finished the last three chapters this morning before getting the kids up for school.This is an incredible series. I personally don't care what the author believes because he's free to believe in what he believes in; last I checked, he is free to write whatever. As long as the stories are compelling, I am happy. If he opens my mind up to new thoughts, then he has done his job as a good writer. The writing itself is wonderful even if it is dark, especially the last book in the series, \\"The Amber Spyglass.\\" Since I am very much aware of the dissatisfication of the Christian right regarding this series (believe me, I've been personally attacked by three people that are very much against this book), I kept reading it to see what was so offensive about it. Not a whole lot. I definitely did not feel like I was being preached against by the author against the totalitarian church or the Christian beliefs. The stories flowed so naturally and wonderfully, yes, I did see where he mentioned that the Christian church is like the big brother and is a mistake; but he described the church in his books the way history has proven it to be. But like I've mentioned in other reviews, I am confident enough in my personal beliefs not to be threatened by a writer's point of views.I enjoyed this very much,there were a lot of different themes tied into it, such as alternating worlds, different types of people, good vs. evil (which is always my favorite theme), love and sacrifice, personal redemption, global warming, end times and so on. It was fantasy tied in with the supernatural. The story line, of Lyra and her daemon, Pan, flowed naturally and wonderfully. I could see everything that was happening to her in my own mind. However, I will say this, if my boys were to want to read these books, I would strongly recommend them starting it after the age of 11. It is not a series that you can just give to your kids and expect them not to have any questions. It will challenge their way of thinking and open their minds to different ideas, (which, in my opinion, is the whole reason for reading!) and this series is perfect for those times of discussion. The last book itself is very dark and more complex than the first two books. And yes, I was reminded throughout the entire book of C.S. Lewis' \\"Chronicles of Narnia\\" as well as Tolkien's \\"Lord of the Ring\\" series. However, the one author I kept thinking of the most while reading this series is Madeline L'Engle's \\"A Wrinkle in Time\\" series. I love that author and her ideas, and was constantly reminded of them while reading this series.Now that I've read it and plan to give it to my dad next to read ~~ I will be scrounging around for something else to read that will capture my attention like this series did. That will be a challenge in itself, that's for sure.1-3-08"},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"What a tremendous trilogy! Quite original--daemons, beautiful witches, bears in armor...At the end, I cried worse than I ever had for any other book (I'm over 20 yrs old now and have read quite a lot of books). Was the ending the perfect outcome for our two heros...I'm still conteplating whether it is. But it succeeded in one thing--making me think about it nonstop for days.Another problem I have with this trilogy is the lack of breathers for our characters. Everything happened so fast and there was so little or no comic relief to offset the urgency and darkness of the story that it all became too overwhelming at times.But at the same time, the reason why I love this trilogy so much is because of the characters. I simply fell in love with Lyra and Will and it was wonderful to see them develop into the mature people they became.There is only one trilogy I know of that I love better--one that I've grown up with and reread over and over again and has stayed in my heart since I was twelve years old--and that's--no, not the Lord of the Rings--but Patricia A. Mckillip's The Riddle Master trilogy. And that alone says a lot about what I think of Pullman's trilogy."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"I very much enjoyed these books. They are filled with creativity, deep characters, intriguing ideas and an excellent story. To me they are best books to come out since The Lord of the Rings. I love the Harry Potter books as well, but His Dark Materials is much deeper. It touches on some subjects that even some adults might not understand, but that doesn't mean children should not read these books. In fact I would encourage parents and children to read them. The higher level of thinking these books will undoubtedly produce, will help raise awareness and ability to not take everything for granted.Many people have accused these books of not being appropriate for children. Mostly they say this for the fact that these books do not look well upon Christianity. So of course any parent that is unwilling to let their child think for themselves or is afraid that it may cause them to question their faith in religion, would not want anyone, especially children, to read these books.But why should anyone, especially children, follow religion blindly? There is more to faith than blind acceptance. Many of those that grow up with that kind of faith come to question it later in life.I challenge any parent that is of the Christian doctrines or any other belief system, to take a leap of faith and let their child read these books. Let them make their own decisions as to their own beliefs and where their faith lies.All around these books are excellent. They have magic and adventure. They empower the mind to think outside the box. Heart and soul are not left out. One begins very shortly to think about what one's Daemon might be. The reader also finds that they cannot help but love Lyra, as you cheer for her on her quest. I believe this story is wonderful for both adults and children."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"His Dark Materials is without a doubt the most intelligent children's fantasy I have ever read. Pullman is a literary genius and master of sophisticated prose. His world is so original and imaginative that nothing else compares. It is refreshing to read something written for a young audience that does not automatically assume that kids are not smart enough to read something so complex.Lyra is a fascinating protagonist. She is incredibly multi-dimensional, strong-minded, and her flaws are endearing.There are so many brilliant themes running amok in His Dark Materials that would help shape the moral fiber of any young mind. Of course this series has not been without controversy, but accusations from religious communities are very much empty. This series has a strong theme of being anti-religious corruption, not exactly anti-religion, as many would lead you to believe--which is ironic in so many ways. As such, it will be controversial to anyone who doesn't want to think for himself but prefers for a religious institution to tell him how to think and feel. This series is about the importance of freewill and the need to retain it against all costs, so the uproar from the religious community only makes Pullman's case all the more stronger.His Dark Materials is thought provoking. I found myself contemplating its themes and having deep sociological and universal conversations with people even after finishing the series. It is definitely a must-read."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"You know how there are those people who say that children's literature is meaningless? Personally, I think they all need to be forced down in a chair (perhaps as in \\"A Clockwork Orange\\") to read \\"His Dark Materials.\\"Like other reviewers, when I finished reading \\"Harry Potter\\" I was still on a fantasy kick, but I was rather jaded by the titles I saw out there. They seemed boring, predictable, and fluffy. I found Pullman long after he had written \\"The Golden Compass\\" (I first read the UK edition, which is called \\"Northern Lights\\") so all three books were out and ready for me to read. This was very lucky, as I raced through them in about two weeks between classes.Honestly, Pullman deserves every comparison to Tolkien he's gotten, and then some. For me (and I LOVE J.K. Rowling), \\"His Dark Materials\\" was more engaging than \\"Harry Potter.\\" Don't get me wrong, \\"Harry Potter\\" will always, always be one of my favorite series. I just like Pullman better in different ways. For one, I found myself more able to relate to Lyra than to Harry. And the symbolism. Oh, the symbolism. Not heavy, not snobby- just amazing. The last installment, \\"The Amber Spyglass,\\" absolutely left me sobbing. I was upset, I was happy, I was in awe, then I was more upset. I've had few books do that to me. They make me emotional, but they certainly don't make me sob for half an hour over the fate of the characters.[...]\\"His Dark Materials\\" also read very similarly to Tolkien- it really reminded me of \\"The Hobbit,\\" although a bit more complex. So somewhere between \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" and \\"The Hobbit\\" in terms of style. If you're a Tolkien fan, I'd give Pullman a try. It isn't an exact match, but then, where would the fun be? Pullman is more wry, a little more humorous, and extremely ironic.The plots of all three books, both continuing and sub, were fast paced and creative. I know the book isn't marketed as science fiction, but it's almost more of that than a fantasy. Maybe some of you are familiar with the term steam-punk, referring to books/games where elements of the modern world, science fiction, and the Victorian (sometimes Medieval, but in Pullman's case, Victorian) age are thrown together to create a new world. This is the best example of steam-punk I've ever read. Not that, of course, you have to be familiar with the genre to enjoy \\"His Dark Materials\\" at all.I guess it could be worth mentioning that the whole trilogy loosely parallels \\"Paradise Lost\\" and if you're a literature nerd, you might find that to be a bonus. But it's definitely not necessary to know beforehand or even afterwards.It is, after all, mere \\"children's\\" literature."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"His Dark Materials trilogy was a fun series of books to read. Unfortunately the movie didnt do as well when it released in the US since the producers decided to dance around the Church references and trying to create a movie for all to see. Personally if they stayed true to the book I would have liked it better. I guess if Star Wars were to come out today they would have to rethink the use of the Force and what the Force was. The books themselves I liked because they were a compromise between paperback and hardcovers... A softcover with larger text than in paperbacks. The story is a fast read and I would imagine that all the people who liked the Harry Potter series would also enjoy this one."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"This series of books I have found to be very engaging and well written. I am halfway into the final book and I am very glad I purchased the collection."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"I just finished The Golden Compass, which is book 1 of the trilogy His Dark Materials,by Philip Pullman. It is very intriguing, quick reading.If you liked the format of Harry Potter and Lord of the Rings, you will probably enjoy this one, in search of Dust, although it is not as deep or long.Great reading for a rainy evening."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"A rare gem in the science fiction/fantasy genre, this series has a female heroine, Lyra. We follow Lyra throughout the series as she encounters intense mysteries and drama. Although this is a fantasy book series, it is superbly written and is excellent in making the reader become so engrossed that they nearly forget where they are.I would use these books with high school, reluctant reader girls, since it's an excellent story about a girl who saves the world. They would learn from this book that girls are also craft, witty, and brilliant. Another group that I would recommend this series to are advanced high school readers as I believe these books have direct references to Paradise Lost and also make general remarks on religion. In fact by the final book, your idea of religion is completely obscured. I think it would be interesting for them to do a compare/contrast with Paradise lost of perhaps how the series develops a theme of religion."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"I was given Northern Lights when I was eleven or so, during a half term, to keep me entertained. And I was instantly enchanted! The writing was of the highest quality, the plot was captivating and neatly done, and the characters were real, three-dimensional, and believable.Five years later, having read all the books, all I can say is that the following two are equal to, if not surpassing, the first. The development of the plot is carefully done, elegant, compulsive, and a sheer good read. My mother preordered The Amber Spyglass for me (she adores the books as well) and I devoured it in a day or so. The ending was so sad, but so right! it couldn't have been been other way without losing some of the excellence of the trilogy. I actually cried - I'll admit it!Philip Pullman is an astounding writer, and I make him my compliments. Every aspect of the book is perfect, fascinating, and all the way it is eminently readable and pleasing: so many good books lose themselves in detail, or plot twists. Philip Pullman does not: he does everything with clarity and emotion.Curiously enough, I'm not particularly fond of his other books: for me, His Dark Materials stand out as a supreme masterpiece. I love them, I admire them, I learn from them, and they inspire me, quite frankly. I reread them often, and they never lose their charm, their wisdom, and their ability to delight.If anyone is thinking about buying these books, my advice is quite simply: do so. You will not regret the purchase. His Dark Materials, while containing content a maturer mind will appreciate, is also a cracking good read for any age.Bravo, Philip Pullman!"},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"I absolutely love this book and I would recommend it to everyone and anyone. I partially write this review in order to vent because this trilogy offers such fantastic plot, character, and imagery that I am stunned. I read these three books a couple of years ago and I have held them in highest honor on my bookshelf. I've reread all three many times. However, after reading Stephen King's review of JK Rowling's \\"The Order of the Pheonix\\", in which he states that he believes Harry Potter to be better than His Dark Materials, I am offended. The books are different and I love both of them. I am enthralled with Will and Lyra (though Will is closest to my heart). Their journey through the worlds, their peril, their love and what they show about all the universal things (religion, love, good and evil...)brought tears to my eyes. Some people will differ in their opinion about His Dark Materials as litterature, but I know that Philip Pullman weaves a great story."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"I reserve a special place on my bookshelf for this trilogy; Pullman knows how to write good characters, and by the end of the book you'll feel like you just spent time with good friends. If you're reading this book for the religious aspect, please don't. Read this book for the story, the characters, and the morals. Pullman's epic story is an amazing way to spend a week."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"I recall clearly the day I began reading this trilogy.My feeling on the first few pages was 'oh dear, this isn't going to be my kind of book'. The next few pages found my intrigue growing, by the time I finished I was totally immersed in his world of demons and battling polar bears and hoped it would never end.Superb story telling craftmanship and a totally rivetting, mind stretching plot with unique devices throughout that work beautifully.You must read this trilogy!But what do you read after it?I would move back to an earlier classic with a different but equally compelling tale and readThe Day of the Triffids (20th Century Rediscoveries)."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"The seller was very accurate and considerate about their product and shipping.I purchased these for my wife (I will be reading them soon), and she thoroughly enjoyed them. She did comment that she'd be surprised if the other movies ever get made simply because there are a lot of sensitive topics."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"My thoughts on this trilogy, correct me if I'm wrong. as said on other posts, the writing is well done. However I have some issues with the plot.To me there isn't much closure in the end. During the whole series it is told that Lyra had some important decision to make as Eve, and would be tempted by Mary Malone. This was going to effect the worlds enough that the Magesterium was sending out people to kill the both of them. I thought she would be some major factor in the war in the end or something, find some way to save all the worlds. However, I never saw that happen. DR. Malone didn't tempt Lyra with anything, and Lyra didn't make some huge decision to save the worlds. Unless I'm missing something. Lyra and Bill did fall in love in the end, but that is normal.it's not a conscious decision. And how that changed the flow of the dust, I don't know. Was going into the world of the dead that decision? If so, it had nothing to do with Malone, it was Lyra wanting to keep a promise to a friend. So if I am missing something explained in the book, please tell me."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"Like many other people, I went to see The Golden Compass in the theater. At the end of the movie, it just sort of abruptly ended, and I remember being a little disoriented by the lack of closure. Now I understand that it was being faithful to the book. Since this is one story split among three physical books, the only real way to read this story is to read all three books in sequence.As for the story, it's an excellent read (easily one of the best I've read this year). It's rather dark in spots, but the character development (for the main characters) is quite good. The heros are not all good, and the baddies are not all bad, which is quite true in real life too."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"His Dark Materials Trilogy: \\"Northern Lights\\", \\"Subtle Knife\\", \\"Amber Spyglass\\" (ISBN: 978 1407 10942 8) is the volume you're looking for. It is the most recent UK edition bound together in paperback with a beautiful cover of a leopard as shown on Scholastic's UK site & now in the customer images of Amazon's site listing. It can take time to get, as many places have it backordered, but it is well worth the wait.If you even slightly enjoyed the movie, you'll love reading the series!"},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"This boxed trilogy is amazing! The books come in sort of a hard box, and they're shiny and beautiful. I do recommend getting this box set for the quality of the product as well as the low price."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"A marvelous, captivating read. Pullman is an artful storyteller, and this series is more than sufficient evidence. The plot is epic, enthralling, and will keep you glued to your seat for hours. And its themes are though provoking and challenging.That said, I cannot recommend this series for everyone. Some will find its take on the secular-religious struggle unsettling or outrageous (read any one-star review from your neighborhood conservative Christian). And I do find the subtle thematic progression to be a distasteful choice: the fantastic plot in the first book lures young readers not yet able to analyze the the series' themes in terms of symbols, metaphor, or abstaction as they become more overt later on in the series.While it has been called the antithesis to C.S. Lewis' Narnia series (which, by the way, also ought not be read by children until they reach an age where they're ready to interpret the symbolism and hold a few abstract discussions on religion), Pullman comes off not so much as atheist as humanist, condemning organized religion not spiritually, but on a utilitarian scale that weighs heavily against its potential for corruption, social ill, and ability to inflict guilt disproportionate to the fault, and lightly on its potential to work moral good.If you can handle a mature discussion of the aforementioned topics, I highly recommend this series, and might even suggest a comparative reading of Pullman against Lewis. Worth a read for the narrative alone if you don't find the themes distasteful, and definitely a strong pick to read for discussion."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"The story is brilliant whether one is Christian or not. Enjoy it for it's entertainment value. Friendship, loyalty, and self sacrifice for the greater good of humanity. That a young girl could have such a profound understanding of her own purpose, a greater responsibility than any being other than God Himself. Some people found the books more difficult to read as they progressed, but I feel the story became more rich as you read. A little difficult for a child to read, but a worthy title for even the pickiest reader's bookcase."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"His Dark Materials, By Philip Pullman is a rich network of complex, exciting story lines.It was also enjoyable because the characters were three dimensional and realistic.The book is a little darker than some of your average fantasy books. It's dramatic descriptions of violence set it apart from many other similar novels. There are some frighteningly vivid descriptions of terrifying mechanical killing machines, like the silver guillotine that cuts people away from their demons and kills them by the shock of it.Pullman also uses a non-Christian description of the after world. Instead of a heaven or a hell there is a world of the dead where every one sits in a never-ending world of oblivion or limbo where monstrous harpies whisper to you everything you have ever done wrong up in the world of the living.I found it to be one of the most enjoyable and exciting books I have ever read. The author holds a very precise and fine fantasy paintbrush. His pallet is full of amazing, dazzling colors that he puts to good use in these books. His characters are very real and unpredictable.The book has an original story line filled with suspense that will make you wish that the book never ended. I enjoyed every single minute of it. I suggest this book to anybody that liked The Belgariad, the Hobbit, the Spider Wick Chronicles, The Inheritance Trilogy, or Harry Potter.Enjoy!"},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"Pullman's books are fantastic, and while they may take Milton's Paradise Lost and choose a different side to win, I think they make a good point.The story is beautifully written, with a instant immersion into a world so interesting you are immediately caught up into the story. The plot itself is a parody of Milton's, but this time instead of emphasizing goodness as suffering, pain and misery it emphasizes goodness as tolerance, joy and love. It is not surprising that religious fanatics have panned this book, because Pullman dissects the message of Christ away from the institutions that have brutalized it to their own advantage. If they looked beyond his anti-clerical viewpoint they would see his message is more spiritual, and closer to pure Christianity than the chronicles of Narnia or the writings of any other author who has attempted to capture the essential Christian myths in the fantasy genre.In other words, Christians who understand the message of Christ will get it and love it (many I know have). Those who worship the walls and stones of the church will not."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"Sorry people, I don't buy it. Pullman has written an engaging series, full of intrigue, sci-fi, fantasy, suspense heroics, love and anger. Hate? Nope... it's just a good read, pure and simple. Why do we always have to dig down into a book for its hidden meaning, or a hidden agenda? Isn't it possible... just possible?... that an author simply wrote down a good story and made it into a book? Just my humble opinion, having been an avid reader of fantasy and sci-fi for almost 40 years. This is a simple story about good vs evil, like most other books it has its hero's, heroine's and evil mongers. I believe this is a bit complicated for a juvenile, but certainly nothing offensive. It's in the Harry Potter mode, but darker (as suggested by another reviewer), and perhaps more somber. Still, I would recommend it as a good read."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"I've never before read a book quite as good as this one.I bought a three book in one type and just could't stop reading it.Amazing storyline and has left a strong lasting impression on me 3 weeks on after finishing it.I recommened it to eeryone young or old, anyone and everyone will enjoy this book"},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"This trilogy ranks right up there with Dune and Lord of the Rings. I did not know that the written word could still affect me as much as these &quot;children's books&quot; did."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"If you enjoy Harry Potter or Lord of the Rings you will love this.Very complex story with a lot of characters with their own agendas.It takes place in many worlds with intertwined sub-plots. Stay with the first book for at least one hundred pages. It's a strange world at firstbut around ninety pages it starts to come together.There's a movie coming out in the winter of 2007. Looking forward toseeing it. It's gonna be big and no doubt there will be controversysurrounding it because of the religious themes within the plot."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"The typical stereotype of a work of fantasy is a good guy pitted against a bad guy in a magical battle to save the world.This is certainly NOT that.These were truly some of the best books I have read. These aren't just simple fantasy books for children or teens; these will be enjoyable and thought-provoking even to parents. It is true to realistic events and real characteristics. No character is purely good or evil. The books seem so real you forget that it's fiction after a few pages. It all seems possible. Subtle debates about issues applicable to real life carry through the trilogy.It starts with us meeting Lyra, the female character that we soon grow to care about greatly. She lives in a world that is very similar to ours, but also different. There are daemons, physical embodiments of our souls. Witches, some for Lyra and some against, intelligent animals like armored bears, and more are abound. And then, there's this all-important particle nicknamed as Dust...what exactly is it? And all this is only in the first volume. As Pullman tells us before the start of TGC, \\"The second begins in the universe we know, and then it and the third volume will move between the universes.\\"Read it!"},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"I had just recently finished this brilliant trilogy and was more than eager to come and share my thoughts of praise, but when I did I was unpleasantly unsurprised to find a large number of contradictory christian readers who have forsaken this book due to its \\"BLASPHEMOUS\\" message. A few such readers proclaim \\"PARENTS BEWARE,\\" and one who, probably in an effort to save his soul from eternal damnation, did not finish the book and made up a story about how Jesus is mentioned by name and is satanized. WOW, I must say that a lie like this must come from a person almost as imaginative as Philip Pullman himself.Indeed, this book does contain a much welcome anti-christian message, but as this is a non-fiction story it is beside the point. These pious readers who are quick to point out blasphemy admitted themselves that these books are masterfully written, and that they were sucked into an intriguing story of intriguing characters, but they still went on to give a one-star rating. Can anyone say CONTRADICTORY?Pullman's daemons and the subtle knife are some of the most masterful concepts I have ever encountered in a fantasy epic, and he presents them in an equally masterful prose style, surrounded by equally masterful character development. A great read for those \\"evil\\" enough among us to appreciate respectable literature."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"If you only like books when you agree with the author's point of view, and you're conservative (especially religiously conservative) don't read this trilogy; you will hate it.I am infatuated with (adore/love) this trilogy. I loved it immediately, as soon as I figured out what a daemon was, and the more I read, the more I loved. The story is utterly complex and very intelligent. The themes tend to be dark, or at best realistic. The characters are well-developed, there's plenty of action, and everything is vividly described, especially Lyra's world. (Granted descriptions may not be complete, but I'd say they're complete enough that you can fill in the missing details with no problems, although they might not correspond with someone else's ideas.)Being an adult (with no children), I can't say what it's like to read it as a child, nor how appropriate it is for a child. The basic theme of the series is to illustrate the growing up process, so I don't think the series can be fully appreciated until you are an adult."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"This is a great book, for the most part impossible to put down, and an even greater disappointment. It starts with an enormous promise: one feels like having discovered a fantasy of the order of the Lord of the Rings or Harry Potter. Unfortunately, Pullman doesn't know what kind of book he wants to write, and the result is the more frustrating for his being such a brilliant narrator and inventor.It all starts as a children's fantasy set in a wonderful alternative world. The daemons, the Gyptians, the evil Magisterium, the anbaric current, the experimental theology, the Zeppelins... it takes your breath away. However, half the way through the first volume it becomes clear Pullman also wants to write a world(s)-mythological saga, turning his naughty-girl heroine into a Christ figure. He even quotes the Gospel to make the point!Unfortunately, what really drives Pullman's writing is his unrelenting and unsophisticated hatred of (Christian) religion, so there're three different threads in the book, and they just don't hold together. The story keeps getting off all kinds of handles--people doing things for no particular reason, achieving them in no time, knowing what they can't possibly know--and culminates, lamely, with a wrestling fight with an angel and a pre-pubertal love affair of supposedly immeasurable consequences.And throughout all of that, the narrative is absolutely gripping, poignant, absorbing... on the second reading, I loved it even more than the first time, and afterwards shook my head even more. What a book this might have been! I don't think I've ever read a better bad book."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"These books are very well written and have so much more in depth story line.

There really wasn't a good job in explaining what was going on. Wasn't really that impressed."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"These books are about the destruction of God. If that's what you want your children reading, borrow them from the library. Do NOT waste your money on these.

Anything for a dollar."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"I did NOT like this book at all!! There was nothing lower than a \\"1\\", so that's what I gave it. If I wanted to be preached at for most of the series, I would have read the Bible. Although it did have some SciFi elements, it was overall a religious book. It was also confusing. I STILL don't know what the heck is Dust. Seriously, this book is B.O.R.I.N.G.!! Well, that's my opion anyway.... >_>"},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"I bought this before I realized that the author had publicly stated that the goal of his books is to teach children that there is no God. I think it is awful to bury a message like that in a children's book. Parents should be aware that he describes these books as being about \\"killing God.\\" If you don't believe me, Google it. I didn't believe it at first either."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"First and foremost I wish I could give this trilogy ZERO stars. It was THAT bad.I read the first one, the Golden Compass, when it was reccomended to me. I have no idea why it was reccomended, these books are terrible. The Golden Compass was okay. I was a little intrigued, so I read the second one, the Subtle Knife. (How can a knife be subtle?)The Subtle Knife was not very good. It was one giant snorefest. Pullman's writing is slow, dull, and boring. I only read the third one, the Amber Spyglass, to find out the ending. If I could have found what the ending was without reading the Amber Spyglass, believe me, I would have.The Amber Spyglass was actually getting a bit good in the middle, the plot was getting better, which surprised me. The problem with this entire trilogy was the ENDING. Yes there were flaws all throughout these books, but the Amber Spyglass's ending was what really made me dislike this trilogy.It seemed very improbable, the ending. I, did not, and still do not, believe that EVER, EVER would have happened.I do not reccomend this book to anyone-except to maybe my worst enemy. It might torture him/her to death."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"Pro:Philip Pullman shows glimmers of brilliance as a writer. His characters are engaging, his worlds are vivid, his prose is delightful at times, and he occasionally produces lush and beautifully drawn descriptive paragraphs. His \\"science\\" is goofy but inventive, and without it his story couldn't work. He also demonstrates a good understanding of what appeals to an adolescent reader. I enjoyed the first volume, though my interest plateaued in the second volume and dropped like a stone in the third.Con:Philip Pullman is one of a growing group of authors who market their own controversial adult ideas and themes as juvenile fiction/fantasy. While I affirm his right to have, and to express his view of the world, Mr. Pullman's method of garnering an uncritical and captive audience for his message is despicable. Pullman is a skillful and sometimes powerful writer who understands his audience well; sadly he uses that skill and knowledge to entice, seduce, and manipulate the immature reader.Here is a summary of how the Pullman method works:The Golden Compass is a compelling action adventure of a young, smart, defiant, and spirited pre-adolescent (12-year old) girl. There are dark characters, ugly episodes and wicked happenings in this volume, but spunky Lyra is up to the challenge. And, she has cool friends (noble gypsies and armored bears, among others) to help her.In The Subtle Knife we meet Lyra's male counterpart Will. By the end of this also dark and rather convoluted part of the story we like Will a lot, too. And we hate the bad guys, although sometimes it's hard to tell just who the bad guys are. Will finds himself possessing a knife that only he can use; a knife that allows him to open windows into other, sometimes parallel, worlds.Now that Mr. Pullman has set his stage (and the child has a significant investment in the story), he force-feeds the unsuspecting reader his world view in The Amber Spyglass. Yes, there is some foreshadowing of what's coming in the first volumes, but until we get to the third volume we keep hoping that these are literary red herrings thrown in just to keep us off balance. Alas, no such luck.In short order Mr. Pullman informs us that:- The God of Judaism and Christianity is a fake, a liar, a dictatorial despot, a draconian authoritarian intent on making everybody miserable. Mr. Pullman's definition of \\"god, the Creator, the Lord, Yahweh, El, Adonai, the King, the Father the Almighty\\" is that he is the source of everything that's wrong with the world.- The church is run by self-serving, power-hungry dupes and mercenaries who ensure God's tyranny is carried out. Everyone else of faith is a discounted as a closed-minded simpleton who wouldn't know what to do without being told.- The health of this world and all of Pullman's \\"billions and billions\\" of other worlds is dependent on invisible, sentient dust, reminiscent of the Mitichlorians behind The Force of Star Wars lore. This dust is the product of man's gaining wisdom, a \\"natural\\" process that Pullman places in direct opposition to man's knowledge of God.- The \\"good guys\\" in this world are the secular naturalists, the amoral, the animals, the witches, and the rebellious angels who have set out to help overthrow and destroy God, and- Elite, self-actualized young men and women of character (like the reader, of course) possess the power to destroy God, and should destroy God because, after all, it's the right thing to do. With the assurance of Lyra's and Will's feelings that if we do destroy God then all will be well with the world and we will be happy.Harry Potter, meet Bertrand Russell and Ayn Rand. And don't forget Jean Genet, for flavor.Along the way Pullman gives lectures on:- The moral relativism of infanticide (it's bad to kill children if you are aligned with God, but its O.K. to kill children when necessary to further a \\"good\\" cause (i.e. deposing God, or whatever)),- The nature of homosexuality (though angels are nonphysical spirit beings that doesn't prevent them from being, and stereotypically behaving like, homosexuals), and- The pervasiveness of the supernatural (pretty much all of us have some kind of \\"spirit being/guide\\" counterpart that can help us do magical things, assuming we are just \\"special\\" enough, by virtue of birth and fate, to tap into this other self)In other words, Pullman uses the first two books to build a platform from which to deliver his elitist-humanist/post-modern/New Age message.There are several passages in the volumes when Lyra or Will actually ask a tough question (What happens when we die? Where do we go? Why are we here?). To these questions a more mature, more worldly adult character always sagely answers: \\"it's not time for you to know that now.\\" Pullman glosses over his answers to these questions as he finishes his story. As it turns out, Mr. Pullman subscribes to the philosophy of despair: we have no purpose other than to do what we think best, and when we die we're just dead. End of story. Which is fine from Pullman's perspective because with God in power Mr. Pullman's future is likely to be, well . . . . . Hell.Spoiler Warning (though if you are a parent you will definitely want to know this): The long-anticipated climax of this 1,200-page book never materializes. In the end, it turns out that destroying God isn't such a big thing after all, and certainly doesn't solve all of the worlds' problems. Only when God is gone does Pullman come clean that the real reason the worlds are dying is because of what men have done to the universe, and now the children will have to devote their lives to fixing the mess. In this unexpected extension of the story, Pullman now has our two (now newly adolescent) heroes take a big step in repairing the world by falling in love, immediately followed by a carefree afternoon of sensual intimacy. Pullman omits a clinical account of what happens that afternoon, but whatever it is, it is magic: suddenly the relentless decay in the worlds is halted. Does this make any sense? No. But it helps to tie off a major loose end in the story, and provides Pullman a way to repeat an earlier theme to his young readers: that without God we are free to engage in sex without any restraint or guilt. Because with the death of God we are now free to be our own God. We can define our own morality, or lack of it, constrained only by what an open-minded society sets as limits in the new Republic of Heaven.Once finished with the books I went online; perhaps I was reading too much into this children's book. I wasn't surprised by what I learned.Mr. Pullman:- Is a self-described atheist.- Is listed as a member of the British Humanist Association (the goal of which is \\"an end to the privileged position of religion in law, education, broadcasting and wherever else it occurs\\")- Is an Honorary Associate of the National Secular Society (The society campaigns for: 1) the disestablishment of the Church of England, 2) the withdrawal of state subsidies to religious schools, 3) the end of tax exemptions for churches, 4) the abolition of the blasphemy law, 5) an end to the public funding of chaplains in prisons, hospitals and the armed services)Is His Dark Materials simply the anti-Narnia tome that Pullman says he set out to write? Perhaps. C. S. Lewis' Narnia stories are allegories of good and evil, principles and the lack of them, the nature of man and the nature of God, love, forgiveness, sacrifice, pride and humility. Pullman offers nothing more than shades of evil, ego, and seduction; God is dead, and man has no need for forgiveness, for Pullman's superman is intrinsically good and there is nothing to forgive. On the other hand, one could argue Pullman simply has a vendetta against God in general and against the Church of England in particular, and uses a book marketed at children to further his goal of revenge.In interviews, Mr. Pullman has claimed neither he nor his book is anti-religious. This is as an odd and dishonest position to take; akin to as if Lewis had said his Chronicles of Narnia has nothing to do with Christianity. True, Pullman is careful not to say anything about Allah in his primer on atheism, but one suspects that this Englishman's reason for the omission has somewhat more to do with cowardice and less to do with tolerance. Pullman assumes that in a politically correct publishing world he can get away with being anti-Semitic and anti-Christian. Leaving one to wonder: if a public speaker boldly and loudly teaches that the Judeo-Christian faith is responsible for all that is wrong and hurtful and evil in the world, and that the only way to solve the problem is to destroy what it stands for (and destroy most of the believers in the process), what more is necessary to classify the ranting as hate speech? If the speaker substituted any other group (Muslims, homosexuals, persons of color) in the sentence above, would society be so tolerant?His Dark Materials is unabashed humanist propaganda written to delight a child's mind. But just as devious is the way the author chooses to misrepresent faith. Mr. Pullman uses the traditional images, phrases, words, and symbols of the Jewish and Christian faiths in his book, but infuses his own meanings into them to twist them into serving his purpose. He trusts that his target audience doesn't know enough to spot his deceptions, or is insecure enough to accept his definitions as plausible. Further, he makes several outrageous and false claims in the process; at one point Pullman casually purports Calvin to be an advocate for child killing, as if there were some documented and widely recognized historical basis for his comment. Just speculation on my part, but perhaps Mr. Pullman does these things and says these things because he assumes few will ever call him on them. And that if he tells his lies enough times in enough ways, the populace he so despises will eventually repeat his mantra as truth.While I cannot respect Mr. Pullman's condemnation of those who are aware of an authority higher than themselves, I could advocate a discussion of his thoughts on the subject if I believed he actually understood what he was talking about. Unfortunately, his own stunted and malignant grasp of the world view he opposes appears to have atrophied at about the age of his target audience. An audience better served listening to another voice."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"You may be interested in getting this books with the upcoming Golden Compass movei coming ou in theatres.

While the story is fine for the first 2 books when you get to the 3'rd it turns out the plot is about \\"God\\" being a fake and satin being the only one smart enough to recognize it...this part of the story is narrated by 2 homosexual angles. It just went too far for me and I wish I'd know that this is what the trilogy was about before I started it.

Not man. Not Satan. God's the bad guy. He needs to be overthrown so mankind can experience \\"pleasure\\" and \\"freedom\\" (without guilt I guess). And our buddies, The Fallen Angels, are really the good guys. See, they've been looking out for us all these millenia. Every bit of pleasure and self-will has had to be wrestled away from God by the denizens of hell. Because they care so much about us. Whew...I wish I was joking. So let's see...God CREATED the universe but if we disgruntled ingrates collect a few magic goodies we can overthrow Him and do things the way we like? In what universe does that even sound like a plausible storyline???At first I tried to ignore the ridiculous premise behind these books because Pullman weaves an intriguing tale. But after 2 books I just couldn't stand how absurd and offensive this premise is. Maybe Pullman \\"pulls\\" something out of the air at the end to try to staunch the bleeding, but I wasn't about to hang around to find out.And the thought of children reading this anti-religious propaganda made me cringe. These books are not for children. I could not believe I found them in the Juvenile section of the library. Not even young adult...juvenile. Much of the subject matter is definitely not appropriate for children. I guess the publishers knew this would never fly as an adult fantasy.

This author is certainly deserving of a lot more press and attention than he is getting!!"},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"Philip Pullman once again had done an outstanding job in writing a series. I just could not let the book down a second! It was so exciting and you don't know what will happen next. It goes from this world to that, while it may be confusing sometimes, overall you will know the story quite well in the end. When you finish the series, you will probably imagine what it would be if you had a daemon. The plot is amazing, and the words are very emotional at the end. The story once again is just, a got to read book and if you don't, you're missing out on a great adventure that will be remembered forever."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"One has to admire the wonderous way Pullman winds this tale. One of the things I enjoyed most about H.D.M. is the way he constructs the rules of his multiverse. The way everything fits together is very believable(so much so, that at times you wonder if HDM is really a SciFi story pretending to be fantasy). The way each book succesivly expands both the world and the story in flawless smoothness, makes these books very hard to put down.Pullman's overall themes were well thought out, and I particularly enjoyed his innuendos about the nature of religion, and christianity in particular. Its disheartening to see so many people use this detail as an excuse to bash the trilogy. Its one of the trilogy's best points.If I aspired to emmulate any author, it would be Philip Pullman. I can only hope that HDM will be followed by even better works of literary art."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"I loved the world and the daemons and the visuals and the magic items. I was annoyed with the author's heavy-handed antireligiosity and preachiness thereof. I guess this is meant to counter pro-religious juvenile fantasies, like the works of C. S. Lewis? Well, consider this the opposite end of the philosophical teeter-totter, then: similarly magical and interesting, similarly whack-ya-over-the-head-with-message.Characters were vapid, for the most part, and not entirely likable, except for their fascinating interactions with the daemons. Despite being able to imagine Lord Asriel's lines delivered by a scowling Daniel Craig (who will play Asriel in the movies), I never believed the character and he never developed. I think he was just a plot device.Having said that, however, I have to mention how compelling the human/daemon interactions were overall. The Alamo scene with Lee and Hester was, I think, my favorite scene in the whole series, and Lyra's dramatic scenes with Pan were very moving.The items were interesting enough that I didn't mind reading yet another go-find-the-magical-doodad fantasy. Details like cold-weather (and warm weather) preparation, finding food in strange worlds, and the subtle discussion of free will throughout were handled well, I thought.Overall, I wouldn't necessarily recommend the series. The only fresh ground it breaks in the genre is its aforementioned antireligiosity, and even that isn't exactly fresh. I guess if you're looking for a run-of-the-mill fanatsy popcorn read, this is good fun."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"I odered this set after I heard of the movie coming and had heard some bad things about this movie.

It is a great read!"},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"As a Harry Potter fan awaiting the next book, someone recommended this series to me and was pleasantly surprised. These books are certainly NOT for religious people, espescially the third book. They're also not for young children but should be read by teens and adults instead. It's too hard for many kids to fully understand the deep plot, and there are some adult situations. The reason the books are so controversial is because, in the books, their God is an evil being that they are in a war against. This doesn't become clear until the third, possibly the second book. I just take it that it's a different God than our own, in an alternate reality and it in no way makes me a God-hater or a religion-hater. It's simply an alternate reality \\"what-if\\" tale-don't let it change your own beliefs. The writer is also very liberal and anti-religion, which may offend people. If you are religious and you prefer to stay away from them, that's fine. I respect your beliefs. Open-minded teens and adults without strong religious leanings will enjoy it the most."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"Definately a group of books for people to read (if they haven't already) as they await the fifth Harry Potter book. Philip Pullman's series is beautiful. It takes place both in our world and in a world like ours, but not. The first book, The Golden Compass, takes place in this alternate world. The second book, The Subtle Knife takes place in both, but connects these two worlds. The final book, The Amber Spyglass, takes place in both, plus others. It sounds confusing, but it is great. Beware, though, that the end of the series is not like any other book that you'll ever read..."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"First off, if you are going to criticize this book based solely on the fact that it is atheist and expresses atheist ideas, then stop reading my review and stop reading the book. I know your church's opinion and do not need you to re-state it.These books are an imaginative tale that dares to express ideas that are considered \\"evil\\" by a good portion of the non-thinking illogical world. Are these the best books ever? No. The narrative is not the most clear, and some plot aspects are lacking. But, the merits of the book are still there. The book entertains, and still elicits an emotional response to the woes of its heroes.I'm just sick of reading reviews titled \\"DO NOT READ THIS! DON'T LET YOUR CHILDREN READ THIS!! DANGER: ATHIEST CONTENT!\\" Save it for herd on Sunday."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"I am an adult Harry Potter fan. I originally bought this series because it was suggested as a \\"If you liked Harry Potter ...\\" recommendation. After a few chapters I was hooked. It has absolutely nothing to do with Harry Potter, however. It is a scientific mystery book.A small warning: This series presents an alternate viewpoint of how religons and the World(s) were formed and operate. If you were offended by topics in The DaVinci Code, you will probably be offended by this book."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"With the movie in the cinemas I think that interest in this trilogy will be renewed...The first book is inspired and a very good read. I could hardly lay it aside before I was through. The world which Pullman conjures up is exciting strange and believable in a mix of familiar and fantastic aspects of his creation. The adventure which follows a thrilling and mysterious start in Pullman's Oxford is colorful, daring and full of surprises.Then I read the second book or rather fought my way through it. To me Pullman went overboard with badly formulated concepts which cross over into blasphemy. A friend of mine who loved the first novel never got through the second. The narrative looses in intensity and the seemingly blasphemous aspects of the expanded multiverse The Subtle Knife opens up to the reader can further discourage.The Amber Spyglass does realign with the captivating style of The Golden Compass while not fully coming up to the same quality. The plot regains pace and the reader can be drawn into Pullman's world again if he did not leave it during the second novel. What reeked of blasphemy in the second novel is slowly explained away and the story arc left unfinished in the second novel comes to an end.I greatly enjoyed The Golden Compass, fought through the confusion of The (all too) Subtle Knife and gained a new perspective of the whole trilogy by looking through The Amber Spyglass.If one is willing to go through a hard time with the second novel, the whole trilogy comes still out all right but expectations should not be set too high. Do not judge the whole trilogy against the charm of The Golden Compass and you will be able to enjoy it."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"I recently finished reading these three books at the suggestion of a good friend; and I must say that I was utterly captivated by the world(s) Pullman painted so eloquently. From the moment I opened the first book, to the moment I closed the last; I was completely ensconced. Prior to reading these books I read a few reviews, and a good number of them seemed to be laden with allusions to the Harry Potter series (which I also enjoy). I was half expecting this series to be somewhat of a Harry Potter clone. I soon found out that these three books were much more astute in their complexity. Right away you realize that these three books were written with much more depth and intellect (from the ideas it expresses, to the many characters involved). You'll kick yourself for having pegged it as a Harry Potter clone, such as I did.If you're contemplating picking these books up, do yourself a favor and rid you mind of all the Harry Potter comparisons before you do. Because in my opinion, there is no comparison. These THREE books smite the FIVE Harry Potter books down, with all the strength and ferocity of an Armored Bear."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"I found the first of Pullman's book, accidentally in Science Fiction, and got hooked. Since then I've read the trilogy 4 times and bought it three times. My first set I lent a friend; it disappeared; a second copy was not only read but read with curry sauce; and a third I bought just two weeks ago and gifted my daughter. She read it, non-stop in three days and loved it.Few books intrigued me or delighted me as much as Materials. Pullman is a wonderful inventor of magical characters and creatures that become as human as the lead protaganist of the trilogy, Lyra, is mischieveous and endearing. Science, nature, religion, culture and fiction are all drawn together in a web that makes each of the three books an unstoppable read.If I had to buy only one book, or in this case, trilogy, for an adolescent or adult, it would be \\"His Dark Materials.\\"This is an enduring story, one that not only makes one think, but makes one wonder about this world, and world's beyond. It is also a story that makes you laugh, cry and rejoice.It deserved as many stars as I can see on a bright clear night sky!"},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"Where to begin about these books is almost beyond me, as was everything else about them. But like my journey through the His Dark Materials trilogy, this review has to start somewhere.I was introduced to these by my mom. I was thirteen at the time, and, having recently devoured the Harry Potter series, my literary life was feeling a bit empty. Starting out the Golden Compass, I must admit I thought my mom had gone senile. The first few chapters of The Golden Compass were AWEFUL. I'm not sure what kept me going, but whatever it is, I believe I'm a better person for it.The plot picked up eventually, leading to an enthralling narrative that captured my mind and forcibly hald my eyes to the text on the pages. The stary was perpetuated in The Subtle Knife, introducing new characters, a darker feel, and the elements that would later provide the platform for what has become my favorite book of all time--The Amber Spyglass.Philip Pullman not only reveals his prowess as an author in this last installment of the trilogy; but also stunning themes and ideas about politics, religion, science, philosophy, and God knows how many others. It's all here.What's so great about the trilogy as a whole is its ability to be read on so many different levels. The story is fantastic on its own, but the thematic materials in this series is so profound and heavy that any english teacher (or intellectual) can squeal with delight.But the thing that I remember most about these books was the power that everything conveyed, climaxing with an ending to them that positively rips your heart out. Imagine me, a boy, sitting in class with a book in his hand, crying for what must have seemed like no apparent reason to everyone else. These books touched me deeply. I began to look at things my own way, not in the one \\"they told me to.\\" I began to feel a need to figure things out for myself. It changed me in the way that I want to grow up as just that--me. To be my own person.I avidly reccomend these book s to anyone I can get to listen, and am usually thanked enthusistically when they give me back my copy of the last book. Don't be put off by this \\"Pullman is spoonfeeding our kids heresy\\" crap. I am a kid, fourteen now, and I can hinestly say that I disagree with his almost cynical view of religion and so forth, but that's part of what these books are about--forming your own opinion.So pick up and do it for these books.

Something called \\"Experimental Theology\\" is being addressed in this alternative universe - one where natural science is frowned upon and the evil of the world has a definite shape - in fact, the people in this tale have visible \\"daemons,\\" animal-shapes that reflect their inner nature. Even as we start to get used to this alternative Calvinist-driven world, Book Two introduces us to Will Parry, a young boy from our own world, who passes into Lyra's world where the two of them become unwiling pawns in an epic battle that comes from the same rich literary base of Tolkein, CS Lewis, and John Milton."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"This book begins as interesting adventure in otherworld, like ours but not quite like it. It continues as pleasant read with allusions that are a bit subversive, and main idea, which religious people won't like, is discovered somewhere along the way.This looks like children's book but it isn't really.I would not recommend this to kids, especially if their parents want to educate them in Christian spirit.Okay, I made a lame joke, but point is, I would recommend book to adult people whose attitude is formed and who are not afraid to hear other people's opinion.All in all, a good read whose strong point is not in shocking religious people but combining several fresh ideas on theology, philosophy and some other fields.A book for forming young atheists OR interesting opinion? You decide.Oh, and there is a passage at the end of third book I overlooked which is cleverly put there. Main idea is well hidden.

I picked the trilogy, since it had won several awards and the story looked interesting. I am an avid reader and normally plough through books, but I really had a hard time getting engrossed in this one. I'm not sure whether it's the writing or the character - the main character didn't do too much for me. I felt a little bit disappointed by not feeling completely wrapped up by the story, but I think teen readers would enjoy it nonetheless. I ended up giving my boxed set to my friend's son, who is 11, and he really enjoyed it."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"What started out as an excellent fantasy yarn became more and more darker as it progressed. Although Pullman's narrative style is good and he paints a realistic fantasy world, what should be worrying for all parents (never mind of what relegious leanings) is his indirect attack on relegion.This becomes more apparent only in the last book of the trilogy when a \\" senile god \\" is revealed whose dominion is being run by the villainous Archangel.Thus the stage is set for the final fight with the Arhangel, with the senile deity being a bystander.Notwithstanding the brilliance of the narrative and the various plots and sub plots, I wouldn't recommend these books for any children until they are adult and have formed their own opinions about relegion and the role of the Almighty.One wonders whether the author is insinuating what seem to be his own personal antireligous convictions into the minds of innocent children or else this was just an undesired ending for a complicated struggle between good and evil. Unfortunately the evil here represents relegion."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"Pullman has talent as a writer - there's no doubt about that. And his trilogy about Lyra Silvertongue (nee Bevaqua) starts off strongly - with wonderful characters, a delightful eye for detail, and a series of deliciously drawn worlds for the children characters to explore.But as this series progresses, it becomes increasingly difficult to avoid the author's antipathy toward religion (something he is very open about in interviews and his adult titles). When every single believer is evil, and every antagonist is a believer (and all these bad guys are Catholic) - well, our family used this as a starting point for a conversation on prejudice and intolerance, much as we would have if all the bad guys were black or Jewish or Latino and we didn't find out until we were into the second book.It's disappointing on many levels that the politically active Pullman would use a kids' book marketed as an alternative to something as positive and wholesome as Harry Potter as a vehicle for pushing anti-religious intolerance onto his readers. Were he simply interested in explaining atheism in a positive light, that would be one thing - and it's something writers like Robert Heinlein and Arthur C. Clarke managed to pull off quite well in titles aimed at young people. But to do so through the tactic of using dehumanizing cliches against people of faith is underhanded.Parents of faith may want to read these books before letting their younger children read them to decide if they're appropriate. Older children (12 and up) should be able to decipher Pullman's motivations on their own, and, as mentioned, these books can serve as a useful vehicle in having a discussion with your kids on prejudice and faith."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"I don't really know why I'm wasting the time it takes to write a review. I've already wasted enough time READING this drivel. The books, (far too densely written for the target audience), actually begin with much promise and a host of very original fantasy ideas and settings. Unfortunately, Mr. Pullman than quickly decends into an over-populated, over-complicated, over-preachy philosophical rant that continues through most of the second and ALL of the third book and which utterly consumes what little remains of a coherent plot. I have nothing against the author's personal opinions, but they get in the way of what really could have been a great series. His characters change personalities on a whim, act with no clear motivation, pursue nonsensical goals, and die meaningless deaths, only to arrive at a disappointing and anti-climatic ending that left me wishing I'd never picked up the first book."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"I read through the first book without a worry! It was a great book! And I was soo obssessed with it! I thought it was even better then Harry Potter. But then I started on the second book...And it began to talk about plots to kill God. In the end...Well...Lets say it didn't end preety.I say this is not a good book for christains,Jews, or anybody who follows a religon dealing with God. I also don't recomend this for people who are lost without a religon or un sure about it...This may just waver you in the wrong direction."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"The first bookfails to grab the reader, the author jumps all over the place. A pathetic, pathetic, start for a great autor. A great follow-up to HarryPotter? Not in my lifetime. I'd rather read something else better.Don't waste your time. The books are pathetic."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"I'll make a very short review about my experience with this series. I must have been 14 when I read the first book, and I was really impressed. This is a really good book for young adults, and so the older folks' negative reviews are simply written by people who are too old and who think too critically and realistically to enjoy the book. Sadly, however, at one point in time I also got \\"too old\\" to enjoy the rest of the series, because the installments took forever to arrive. I was 16 when the second book came out and for a long while after the 3rd book wasn't published. So, you can imagine that once I was 18, children's fantasy wasn't really my genre anymore."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"Philip Pullman's series is being marketed for the same young adult market as say, Rowling's Potter booksHarry Potter Boxset Books 1-7, Tolkien's Lord of the RingsJ.R.R. Tolkien Boxed Set (The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings), Lewis' NarniaThe Chronicles of Narnia Boxed Set, or even Cooper's Dark is Rising storiesThe Dark Is Rising (Boxed Set): The Dark Is Rising, Greenwitch, Over Sea, Under Stone, Silver on the Tree, The Grey King. Why does this distress me?The wonderful authors listed above have at least in some degree tried to offer us heroic models, and worlds with both good and evil. But Pullman's parent figures are traitorous and evil, his lead characters are liars and thieves, and his goal seems to be to rid the world of authority figures in lieu of some paradise provided by the young, or some such 60's weed-vision of paradise.Frankly, the entire series is about anti-heroes in an evil and anti-heroic universe. But worse, Pullman is pushing his atheistic tripe in a candy form to those who have not yet learnt to read pragmatic sense into dark imaginations.If Pullman wants the young to understand heros and how to be one, he should paint a real picture of the world, not one that verges from black to dark grey. His dreary imaginings were distressing to my adult mind, and I fear for the youths who read these without the developed judgement to put them back where they belong.If you must read this, DON'T buy it - take a page from Abby Hoffman, or check it out from your library instead."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"Parents, before you offer these \\"fantasy\\" reads for your kids be aware that this author is promoting atheism and these books are anti-christian, anti-church and anti-God. Be Careful, and be sure that this is what you intend to teach and encourage in your children. I have to give all of these books a thumbs down based on my personal values and beliefs."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"As the trilogy progresses, the profoundly anti-christian message becomes more and more pronounced. Pullman himself states that his intention in writing the trilogy was to turn young people away from christianity. On his own website, Pullman states \\"\\"I don't know whether there's a God or not. Nobody does, no matter what they say. I think it's perfectly possible to explain how the universe came about without bringing God into it, but I don't know everything, and there may well be a God somewhere, hiding away.\\" In addition, he goes on to say \\"\\"Actually, if he is keeping out of sight, it's because he's ashamed of his followers and all the cruelty and ignorance they're responsible for promoting in his name. If I were him, I'd want nothing to do with them.\\"The sympathetic characters in the books repeatedly voice anti-religious sentiments. For example, in THE SUBTLE KNIFE, the hero John Parry, states:\\"We've had nothing but lies and propaganda and cruelty and deceit for all the thousands of years of human history. It's time we started again...\\" as he encourages Will to take the knife to Lord Asriel in his fight to destroy The Authority and build the Republic of Heaven here on Earth. Will is the keeper of the subtle knife, \\"the one weapon in the all the universes that could defeat the tyrant. The Authority. God.\\"The bottom line is that Pullman, and the Hollywood filmmakers who have chosen to enrich his bottom line, has the right to his views and beliefs. But let's put all the cards on the table, and not disguise a profoundly anti-religious body of literary work as being either a story appropriate for children, or harmless fantasy."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"I picked up these books based on the recommendation of quite a few people on the net. These books are quite well written and plotted. That said I would like to place a warning with these books. If it is your intention to teach your children Christian values and doctrine then you should ask them not to read these books until they are well grounded in the faith and truth, if at all. Phillip Pullman has very intentionally crafted the books so that they are a direct attack at Christian faith and doctrine. He has created a philosophy of naturalism mixed with a form of reincarnation and humanism.I anticipate that many may read this review and claim I am trying to stifle free speech or to keep children from hearing all sides of a matter. That would be a shifting of the argument. Pullman's world and philosophy is no more solid than the Spectre's he writes about. He attempts to muddle truth with emotional arguments while ignoring the reality of the inspired Word of God, historical evidence of the persona and work of the sacrificial Jesus, and the possibility of the Creation.Over they three books, good and evil are quite muddled. By the end of the series, the church is very definitely evil, God has never existed, and the Authority who claims to be God is a sadistic dictator. While employing no truth and evidence, he attempts to discredit the Church (not necessarily hard since humans are fallen beings and susceptible to sin) and the existence of God (more difficult because God demands faith based on the evidence in the Word and in Creation)."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"I first bought these books maybe 10 years ago.I was fascinated.

A modern fantasy in the best of those words, not with the almost childish fantasies of the normal Disney-esque children fantasies, nor with the spank-you-over-the-head moral teachings of dogmatic institutions, this is humanity at its best.

But they were still a fun read. But as an older reader I love the ideas of man, heaven, and god. When people say that this book is trying to insult religion and/or christianity don't take their word for it. I do not beileve that is what Pullman was trying to do, he wanted to make you think, and give us a new idea of what life and heaven might be, or mean to us. And he never quite says which side is right or wrong. I strongly suggest these books to anyone who likes to think or just a fun and interesting read!"},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"I ordered this under the impression that these were trade paperbacks, not mass market paperbacks. (In the list of similar items, this set is listed separately from the specific \\"mass market paperback boxset\\".)I guess I didn't pay close enough attention, because indeed these are mass market paperbacks. (If you take the time to look over the full listings for His Dark Materials, you can see that the covers are the same as the individual mass market volumes.)It's a fairly nice set, for mass market, and a good value -- just not what I was expecting.

I can't comment on the story itself because I haven't finished reading it, but what I have read, I love it. The story is interesting and when I have to put it down, I'm always trying to figure out the mystery. I highly recommend this trilogy but choose the set that works best for you.

Losing that much sleep is not good for someone my age, but I couldn't bring myself to sleep till I finished, and I wanted the story to continue even after that."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"These books are definitely the most wonderful that I've ever read. Some reviewers have compared them to J.K. Rowling's Harry Potter, but I say that the two series are incomparable. If Rowling goes an inch deep into making us think, pullman goes 20 feet. His Dark Materials are wonderful for their fantasy (for those who like other-worldly and thrilling reads) but do not read these books if fantasy is all you're looking for. These books delve deep into religion and philosophy, and sometimes force us to question beliefs that we've had all our lives. In other words, don't read these books if you're looking for a light read.For those who say that the trilogy is \\"evil\\" for the way it probes our thoughts about religion and introduces some new ones in our mind, I would say, bluntly, \\"too bad\\". The books are not denouncing religion, but rather showing us some of the horrible deeds people can do in the name of it. No religion accepts murder or evil deeds, but power-hungry people can use religion as a shield or weapon to excuse or promote what they do.I would reccomend these books to anybody mature enough to read them sensibly, and with an open mind about religion.With strange, imaginative creatures,strong, very human characters, and deep philosophy, these books are quite unlike any others. The only feature the books lack is humour - but, then again, these are not exactly your light \\"Harry Potter\\" type books.These books are WONDERFUL - for their fantasy as well as philosophy.Brief summary: Lyra Beviaqua, a precocious 12-year-old girl living in the Oxford of another world, discovers Dust, the existence of billions of universes, and the alethiometer, an instrument that can tell you anything - if you know how to use it. When her best friend, Roger, is kidnapped, she embarks on a journey to save him. In the process, she discovers the subtle knife (which can cut through to other worlds), Will, a boy from another world who becomes her best friend, and many other strange creatures, instruments, and friends. Soon, she discovers that she is the major part of the largest rebellion in history, and must do unimaginable things to save Dust and all the good in the world, and keep her promises, no matter how hard it is.ABSOLUTELY MUST READ - an experience not to be missed."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"Although I am not a big fan of scifi/fantasy stories, I found these books to be so well-written and enjoyable! The stories are packed full of action, adventure, ethics, personal growth, and wonderfully creative visualization. As a homeschooling family, I am always on the lookout for good reading material for my kids. These books are a bit beyond my 8 year old's reading ability, but will be our read-aloud books for now. I personally think they are a bit more complex than the Redwall series and Harry Potter (both of which we love.) I think any kid who likes Harry would like these books. Unlike Redwall stories, tho, these need to be read in order."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"These books were great for someone like me.

It is hard to put these books down, and once you finish them, its hard not to pick them back up and read them again! (Believe me, I had to go through a 12 step program. No, I'm joking!) I usually read a lot heavier material, but this is great stuff if you want material just to keep you enthralled, asking \\"What will happen next?!\\" You definatly have to read all three, or you will not get the full experience. If you like mystery, action, adventure, questions, answers, supernatural events, and intricate, well woven plots, then you will not regret buying these three books!"},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"This trilogy is a masterful retelling of Paradise Lost, intended as much for the actively engaged, open-minded adult as for the precocious middle reader. Intense and vivid, these three novels challenge preconceived notions of religion, faith, truth, and institution. They embrace a world wrought with ambiguity and allegory, with the living and the dead. Woven with destiny and ardor, Pullman re-imagines the sanctity of youth through parallel universes, the inexorable bind between love and loss, and the inevitable weight of imperfect action."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"I read the entire trilogy and was entranced. To all who share my enthusiasm for this series and it's philosophy, let me recommend to you another book you will find as rewarding, if not more so. It is Glenn Kleier's THE LAST DAY, and it is a triumph of entertainment and insight into the same themes. I'm not sure which author, Pullman or Kleier is more controversial. Both are powerful voices unafraid to confront the hypocrisy and arrogance of those who consider themselves our spiritual superiors.

In my opinion, these are not for kids, but still a good read. Leaves you thinking."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"After having heard about a movie is coming up about \\"The Golden Compass\\" I'd liked to read the book(s) first. Not having seen the picture yet, I prefer the first part of the trilogy. Pullman wrote a fascinating and enthralling progression so I was quite excited to get to the second part of the story. It started exactly as I mentioned but after the first half the novel got long drawn out. Even so starts the third part \\"The Amber Spyglass\\" where in my opinion the story is overthrown in the respect of too much sense of wonder describing for example the diamond-legged \\"people\\". All'n'all I would recommend this trilogy for readers who like fantasy, thrill and unobvious solutions until the end of the story. Therefore I would recommend \\"His Dark Materials\\" for long winter-eves."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"The first two books are great. I could not wait to finish the whole set. The author kept opening new story \\"avenues\\" and new possibilities which added to the suspense of the story, but when it came to the last book where all these avenues needed explanation the author fell short. A number of the stories were left unexplained and unfinished, which was quite disappointing.His Dark Materials Trilogy (The Golden Compass; The Subtle Knife; The Amber Spyglass)"},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"You will find that these books provide a fast paced journey with fantastic creatures, characters and plot development. There is a good flow to the writing and it will keep you turning pages whether you're 15 or 25. The polarization of reviews to be found are religious in backing. You won't find a one star rating from someone based on the story or the prose, but on their distaste for any themes they find against their own dogma. The story does attack tyranny and religious domination. A snippet from the book: \\"I met an angel: a female angel.. She said that all the history of human life has been a struggle between wisdom and stupidity. She and the rebel angels, the followers of wisdom, have always tried to open minds; the Authority and his churches have always tried to keep them closed.\\" Its really a sum of that; independence and critical thought over suppression, dogma and dominion.Lyra and Will are the two heroes of the series. Each has an instrument that provides them some fantastic power. The books are filled with parallel worlds and various other entities borrowed from theoretical physics. If you are looking for science fiction and fantasy mixed stories in marvelous settings with plots to keep you jumping, this is a good bet."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"Many of you may have seen or at least heard of the film \\"The Golden Compass\\" and the controversy surrounding it. The film is an adaptation of the first book of the trilogy \\"His Dark Materials\\" which also includes \\"The Subtle Knife\\" and \\"The Amber Spyglass\\". The British author , Philip Pullman, is an outspoken atheist and has been accused of trying to turn children against God in this trilogy. Is there merit to this accusation? I leave that to the reader. I can tell you that the theme of the story is certainly anti abuse of power. The criticism of the books are very simplistic and in my opinion unfair. The books do challenge interpretations of the Hebrew creation myth at the center of Jewish and Christian doctrine. The premise is that all sentient life has been deceived for thousands of years by a being who calls himself \\"God\\" but in fact is a ruthless tyrant who subjugates everyone and demands unquestioned obedience. It is a struggle between His forces and those who would encourage Wisdom and Curiosity in Mankind! Included is the concept that this battle had been fought before but the wrong side won thousands of years ago! Now both sides are getting prepared for a decisive war and the outcome will have profound implications for all the universes. At the center of this story is a young girl named Lyra and a boy named Will whom we meet for the first time in the second novel. Their decisions will determine the final outcome of the conflict. Another central theme is the concept of \\"Dust\\". This is what the Church (summed up as \\"The Magisterium\\") fears most and wants to destroy at any cost. \\"Dust\\" represents a challenge to the doctrines of the Authority and is considered heresy.This is a compelling story and hard to put down! The characters are complex and the themes are thought provoking and bold! There are unquestionable parallels to how real life organized religion reacts to anything which challenges it's authority. The cliffhangers in the first two books will leave the reader breathless! This is the boldest and most interesting fantasy adventure I've ever read. I think it's treatment of Biblical themes make it better than \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" because it has something much more profound to say! An open mind being a prerequisite, I highly recommend this trilogy to anyone who wants a fresh fantasy approach to an age old concept."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"This book is every thing a book should be!

Beatiful, simply beatiful!"},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"This trilogy of books is by far one of the most emotionally riveting that I have ever read. The character development in the first book, and throughout the series, captivates the reader, and the books become for than just a story. Pullman creates an array of fantastic worlds dabbing the extraordinary in a rather realistic world. His settings and descriptions make these places easier to picture, with an added awe. The suspense that the author employs through the use of foreshadowing and a general foreboding tone makes it impossible for the reader to push out of their head the inevitable unhappy ending. However, after getting well into the third book, one seems to forget about Lyra's ultimate decision. But after reading the last few pages, a sense of such wrongdoing, injustice, and anger is the only way to describe the emotional reaction. The fact that even the toughest shelled readers are brought into such an emotional outrage and eventual sorrow, is proof of how good the books are."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"Didn't even enjoy the first one. If you can get past all the religious weirdness (which is easily done because it's so far-fetched - it really doesn't deserve the fuss everyone is making about it), the stories are just confusing, boring, and depressing. I am offended that people put these books in the same category as Chronicles of Narnia, LOTR, Harry Potter, and Madeleine L'Engle's Time books. Those are wonderful works of literary genius that make you laugh and make you cry. Good overcomes evil and you are left feeling better than you did before you began reading. In other words, those books are everything that Pullman's stories are not. In Pullman's stories, the lines between good and evil are so blurred that you have no idea what's going on and you don't care enough about the characters to get emotionally involved. In addition, there's no innocence, there's no humour, and the descriptions are really hard to picture in your mind. I am appalled they are labeled as children's literature, because no child needs to experience this hopeless and sad excuse for a fantasy story. I plan on burning my copy."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"Pullman spoiled a good fantasy story by incorporating his well documented hatred of Jesus & Christianity."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"Mr. Pullman, while gifted as a writer, seems to see himself as a prophet of atheism. Do I have a problem with this? No! Mr. Pullman can preach whatever he believes. Do I have a problem with this trilogy? Yes, and emphatically so. These books are NOT PRO-athiest. They are ANTI-Christian/Judaism/Muslim. They don't attack the idea of God, they attack these faiths specific views of God; a very important distinction.These books were written for children--and written in such a way as to try to guide children into agreeing with Pullmans beliefs. He does not come out and say what he thinks until the end of the trilogy, by which point the children have come to identify with his characters. Mr. Pullman is taking the only audience he can find that are impressionable enough to do damage to, and trying to influence their thinking. He compares himself to CS Lewis--an anti-CS lewis if you will--this is fine (if incorrect, as Lewis is promoting a belief, not attacking one). However, the subtle nature of his work and the fact that his books are not advertised as anti-Judeo/Christian is where the problem comes in. If he wants to write to influence people, he is welcome to do so (and even should do so if he has strong beliefs), however, he shouldn't try to sneak his ideas past the guiding influence of parents. Mr. Pullman is an ethical coward--one who will not try to sell his ideals to completely rational beings, for fear of rejection and low sales.To conclude, Mr. Pullman should either write books without his moral slant, or declare their moral slant early (on the cover!)so that parents can more easily understand what the book is about and what the author is trying to convince their children of."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"If the Harry Potter series can be described as \\"Lord of the Rings\\" light, this series would have to be described as \\"Fractured Fairy Tales\\" light.

Don't waste your time."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"I looked up \\"His Dark Materials\\" on wikipedia because looking up \\"Philip Pullman\\" didn't give me much information. To my surprise I found a valid claim by Pullman himself that he does speak of a parallel to atheism and the killing of God. Also, that in his books, \\"the devil\\" is portrait as the hero. A copy of the controversy:\\"His Dark Materials has been a subject of some controversy, especially with Christian groups.[13][14] \\"I've been surprised by how little criticism I've got. Harry Potter's been taking all the flak...Meanwhile, I've been flying under the radar, saying things that are far more subversive than anything poor old Harry has said. My books are about killing God.\\"[15]Institutional religion is criticized by some of the characters. For example, Ruta Skadi, a witch and friend of Lyra's calling for war against the Magisterium in Lyra's world, says that \\"For all of [the Church's] history...it's tried to suppress and control every natural impulse. And when it can't control them, it cuts them out.\\" (see intercision). Skadi later extends her criticism to all organized religion: \\"That's what the Church does, and every church is the same: control, destroy, obliterate every good feeling.\\" (By this part of the book, the witches have made reference to how they are treated criminally by the church in their worlds.) Mary Malone, one of Pullman's main characters, states that \\"the Christian religion...is a very powerful and convincing mistake, that's all.\\" She was formerly a Catholic nun, but gave up her vows when the experience of being in love caused her to doubt her faith.Pullman portrays the Christian heaven to be a lie. In the third book, the real afterlife is depicted as a bleak place where people are tormented by harpies until Lyra and Will descend into the land of the dead. Through their intercession, the harpies agree to stop tormenting the dead souls, and instead receive the true stories of the dead in exchange for leading them again to the upper world. When the dead souls emerge, they dissolve as they become one with the universe.Pullman's \\"Authority\\" is worshipped on Lyra's earth as God, but he turns out to be the first creature to evolve, instead. It is explicitly stated that the Authority was in fact not the creator of worlds. Pullman's trilogy does not speculate on who or what might have created worlds. Members of the Church are typically displayed as zealots. Two characters who once belonged to the Church, Mary Malone and Marisa Coulter, are both displayed in a positive light only insofar as they have rebelled against the Church.[16][17]Cynthia Grenier, in the Catholic Culture, has said: \\"In the world of Pullman, God Himself (the Authority) is a merciless tyrant, His Church is an instrument of oppression, and true heroism consists of overthrowing both.\\"[18] William Donahue of the Catholic League has described Pullman's trilogy as \\"atheism for kids.\\" Pullman has said of Donohue's call for a boycott, \\"Why don't we trust readers? ... Oh, it causes me to shake my head with sorrow that such nitwits could be loose in the world.\\"[19]Pullman has, however, found support from other Christians, most notably Rowan Williams, the Archbishop of Canterbury, who argues that Pullman's attacks are focused on the constraints and dangers of dogmatism and the use of religion to oppress, not on Christianity itself.[20] Pullman himself has said in interviews and appearances[21][22] that his argument can be extended to all religions. Nevertheless, Pullman's antagonism toward religion appears to be focused upon Christianity in particular. \\"I suppose technically, you'd have to put me down as an agnostic. But if there is a God, and he is as the Christians describe him, then he deserves to be put down and rebelled against.\\"The choice is yours. You decide who's side you'll be on or if there even are sides. Who really knows. This is something that you have to come to an agreement with yourself. We live in an age of corruption and false prophets. Trust others, but still keep your eyes open. I would suggest to check out \\"Zeitgeist: World Trade Center\\". [...]. Good luck!"},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"If you're a Christian, then it is quite likely that this book will offend you. I myself am a Christian and bought the omnibus of this series not knowing what it was about. *SPOILER ALERT* it's about trying to kill GOD, get this, GOD with a knife. Not only is this blasphemous and offensive but it's the entire premise is ludicrous. I do not throw away literature by virtue for the most part, and I mean hardly ever, but I threw this book away. This is not the sort of thing a child should be reading. Now if you're a die hard atheist/agnostic on the other hand, you'll likely think it's the best book ever published."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"Pro:Philip Pullman shows glimmers of brilliance as a writer. His characters are engaging, his worlds are vivid, his prose is delightful at times, and he occasionally produces lush and beautifully drawn descriptive paragraphs. His \\"science\\" is goofy but inventive, and without it his story couldn't work. He also demonstrates a good understanding of what appeals to an adolescent reader. I enjoyed the first volume, though my interest plateaued in the second volume and dropped like a stone in the third.Con:Philip Pullman is one of a growing group of authors who market their own controversial adult ideas and themes as juvenile fiction/fantasy. While I affirm his right to have, and to express his view of the world, Mr. Pullman's method of garnering an uncritical and captive audience for his message is despicable. Pullman is a skillful and sometimes powerful writer who understands his audience well; sadly he uses that skill and knowledge to entice, seduce, and manipulate the immature reader.Here is a summary of how the Pullman method works:The Golden Compass is a compelling action adventure of a young, smart, defiant, and spirited pre-adolescent (12-year old) girl. There are dark characters, ugly episodes and wicked happenings in this volume, but spunky Lyra is up to the challenge. And, she has cool friends (noble gypsies and armored bears, among others) to help her.In The Subtle Knife we meet Lyra's male counterpart Will. By the end of this also dark and rather convoluted part of the story we like Will a lot, too. And we hate the bad guys, although sometimes it's hard to tell just who the bad guys are. Will finds himself possessing a knife that only he can use; a knife that allows him to open windows into other, sometimes parallel, worlds.Now that Mr. Pullman has set his stage (and the child has a significant investment in the story), he force-feeds the unsuspecting reader his world view in The Amber Spyglass. Yes, there is some foreshadowing of what's coming in the first volumes, but until we get to the third volume we keep hoping that these are literary red herrings thrown in just to keep us off balance. Alas, no such luck.In short order Mr. Pullman informs us that:- The God of Judaism and Christianity is a fake, a liar, a dictatorial despot, a draconian authoritarian intent on making everybody miserable. Mr. Pullman's definition of \\"god, the Creator, the Lord, Yahweh, El, Adonai, the King, the Father the Almighty\\" is that he is the source of everything that's wrong with the world.- The church is run by self-serving, power-hungry dupes and mercenaries who ensure God's tyranny is carried out. Everyone else of faith is a discounted as a closed-minded simpleton who wouldn't know what to do without being told.- The health of this world and all of Pullman's \\"billions and billions\\" of other worlds is dependent on invisible, sentient dust, reminiscent of the Mitichlorians behind The Force of Star Wars lore. This dust is the product of man's gaining wisdom, a \\"natural\\" process that Pullman places in direct opposition to man's knowledge of God.- The \\"good guys\\" in this world are the secular naturalists, the amoral, the animals, the witches, and the rebellious angels who have set out to help overthrow and destroy God, and- Elite, self-actualized young men and women of character (like the reader, of course) possess the power to destroy God, and should destroy God because, after all, it's the right thing to do. With the assurance of Lyra's and Will's feelings that if we do destroy God then all will be well with the world and we will be happy.Harry Potter, meet Bertrand Russell and Ayn Rand. And don't forget Jean Genet, for flavor.Along the way Pullman gives lectures on:- The moral relativism of infanticide (it's bad to kill children if you are aligned with God, but its O.K. to kill children when necessary to further a \\"good\\" cause (i.e. deposing God, or whatever)),- The nature of homosexuality (though angels are nonphysical spirit beings that doesn't prevent them from being, and stereotypically behaving like, homosexuals), and- The pervasiveness of the supernatural (pretty much all of us have some kind of \\"spirit being/guide\\" counterpart that can help us do magical things, assuming we are just \\"special\\" enough, by virtue of birth and fate, to tap into this other self)In other words, Pullman uses the first two books to build a platform from which to deliver his elitist-humanist/post-modern/New Age message.There are several passages in the volumes when Lyra or Will actually ask a tough question (What happens when we die? Where do we go? Why are we here?). To these questions a more mature, more worldly adult character always sagely answers: \\"it's not time for you to know that now.\\" Pullman glosses over his answers to these questions as he finishes his story. As it turns out, Mr. Pullman subscribes to the philosophy of despair: we have no purpose other than to do what we think best, and when we die we're just dead. End of story. Which is fine from Pullman's perspective because with God in power Mr. Pullman's future is likely to be, well . . . . . Hell.Spoiler Warning (though if you are a parent you will definitely want to know this): The long-anticipated climax of this 1,200-page book never materializes. In the end, it turns out that destroying God isn't such a big thing after all, and certainly doesn't solve all of the worlds' problems. Only when God is gone does Pullman come clean that the real reason the worlds are dying is because of what men have done to the universe, and now the children will have to devote their lives to fixing the mess. In this unexpected extension of the story, Pullman now has our two (now newly adolescent) heroes take a big step in repairing the world by falling in love, immediately followed by a carefree afternoon of sensual intimacy. Pullman omits a clinical account of what happens that afternoon, but whatever it is, it is magic: suddenly the relentless decay in the worlds is halted. Does this make any sense? No. But it helps to tie off a major loose end in the story, and provides Pullman a way to repeat an earlier theme to his young readers: that without God we are free to engage in sex without any restraint or guilt. Because with the death of God we are now free to be our own God. We can define our own morality, or lack of it, constrained only by what an open-minded society sets as limits in the new Republic of Heaven.Once finished with the books I went online; perhaps I was reading too much into this children's book. I wasn't surprised by what I learned.Mr. Pullman:- Is a self-described atheist.- Is listed as a member of the British Humanist Association (the goal of which is \\"an end to the privileged position of religion in law, education, broadcasting and wherever else it occurs\\")- Is an Honorary Associate of the National Secular Society (The society campaigns for: 1) the disestablishment of the Church of England, 2) the withdrawal of state subsidies to religious schools, 3) the end of tax exemptions for churches, 4) the abolition of the blasphemy law, 5) an end to the public funding of chaplains in prisons, hospitals and the armed services)Is His Dark Materials simply the anti-Narnia tome that Pullman says he set out to write? Perhaps. C. S. Lewis' Narnia stories are allegories of good and evil, principles and the lack of them, the nature of man and the nature of God, love, forgiveness, sacrifice, pride and humility. Pullman offers nothing more than shades of evil, ego, and seduction; God is dead, and man has no need for forgiveness, for Pullman's superman is intrinsically good and there is nothing to forgive. On the other hand, one could argue Pullman simply has a vendetta against God in general and against the Church of England in particular, and uses a book marketed at children to further his goal of revenge.In interviews, Mr. Pullman has claimed neither he nor his book is anti-religious. This is as an odd and dishonest position to take; akin to as if Lewis had said his Chronicles of Narnia has nothing to do with Christianity. True, Pullman is careful not to say anything about Allah in his primer on atheism, but one suspects that this Englishman's reason for the omission has somewhat more to do with cowardice and less to do with tolerance. Pullman assumes that in a politically correct publishing world he can get away with being anti-Semitic and anti-Christian. Leaving one to wonder: if a public speaker boldly and loudly teaches that the Judeo-Christian faith is responsible for all that is wrong and hurtful and evil in the world, and that the only way to solve the problem is to destroy what it stands for (and destroy most of the believers in the process), what more is necessary to classify the ranting as hate speech? If the speaker substituted any other group (Muslims, homosexuals, persons of color) in the sentence above, would society be so tolerant?His Dark Materials is unabashed humanist propaganda written to delight a child's mind. But just as devious is the way the author chooses to misrepresent faith. Mr. Pullman uses the traditional images, phrases, words, and symbols of the Jewish and Christian faiths in his book, but infuses his own meanings into them to twist them into serving his purpose. He trusts that his target audience doesn't know enough to spot his deceptions, or is insecure enough to accept his definitions as plausible. Further, he makes several outrageous and false claims in the process; at one point Pullman casually purports Calvin to be an advocate for child killing, as if there were some documented and widely recognized historical basis for his comment. Just speculation on my part, but perhaps Mr. Pullman does these things and says these things because he assumes few will ever call him on them. And that if he tells his lies enough times in enough ways, the populace he so despises will eventually repeat his mantra as truth.While I cannot respect Mr. Pullman's condemnation of those who are aware of an authority higher than themselves, I could advocate a discussion of his thoughts on the subject if I believed he actually understood what he was talking about. Unfortunately, his own stunted and malignant grasp of the world view he opposes appears to have atrophied at about the age of his target audience. An audience better served listening to another voice."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"Not worth the time and there are abundant classics at the library your child could read (swiss family robinson etc)."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"The plot was extremely slow to develop. The author seemed particularly reticent to explain dramatic events in the narrative. I was bored even before the adventure began."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"This book is too dark for small children. I would suggest that parents read a head of time, to know when to stop reading it to your children. I found the material disturbing. Nothing like what I would expect from a fantasy book geared towards children. This author has a long way to go, to be in the company of other great fantasy authors- C.S. Lewis, etc. Save your money and skip these books!"},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"With all the hype over Philip Pullman's \\"atheism,\\" I think it is important to note that his beef seems less with (the possibility) of a Supreme Being, than with organized religions themselves--all of which are very human, run by humans, and thus flawed. People turn to religion to help them organize their view of the world and their place in it. Any student of history can point to many examples of human beings doing evil in the name of their religion. Unfortunately, it often seems that organized religion is more concerned with weeding out those who question their view of the world, and little to do with any worship of a Supreme Being--and this dichotomy seems to be what disturbs Pullman. No faith should be shaken by questions and doubts, but should be strengthened and stretched by the constant curious questioning of the evolving human race."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"As many reviewers have already stated, this trilogy is amazingly written. It is an intense experience mentally, emotionally, and spiritually, challenging the reader to consider his or her views about the world we live in by introducing a very different world. Also, as several reviewers have stated, it presents a strong critique of organized religion. As with all material, parents should become aware of the issues presented in the book and discuss them with their children. For those who believe in God (that includes me), let me say this: although the storyline does not directly reflect my beliefs about God, it says this to me: any \\"church\\" that brings about ignorance, corruption, bondage, deception, and death (rather than freedom, life and truth) is no church that I want to support or follow. It is a wonderful story about life and growing up, as long as you are willing to confront the reasons you believe as you do."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"ok, i MAY have bead on why a lot of so-called 'christians' are up in arms about these books. never made much sense to me, especially since a lot of christian religious leaders worldwide have given good reviews of these books, especially a few years ago when they were originally published, and the stupid movie wasn't being talked about.from reading a few of the christian reviewers here that seemed fairly articulate, i was struck by the furor over the word 'daemon'. all of you guys are mistranslating the word. here's the dictionary definition from dictionary.com -daemon /'dim'n/ Pronunciation Key - Show Spelled Pronunciation[dee-muhn] Pronunciation Key - Show IPA Pronunciation-noun1.

I went into this book knowing about it's anti-religious reputation and wanting to see what all the fuss was about. In the end I couldn't really answer that question. While the world that Pullman creates is very original and many of his concepts seem interesting his character development and plot are horrible. I found myself sympathizing with only a few of the main characters and disliking almost everyone else in the books.The storyline jumps around and has a very hard time staying coherent especially through the 2nd and 3rd book. Although I was slightly interested in the story of the first book about midway through the second book reading the trilogy turned into work. Although I normally go through most novels in a couple days the last book took me almost 2 weeks. Everytine I picked it up the feeling was almost like waking up on a cold morning and having to get out of a nice, warm bed. Something you feel like you have to do but you really, really don't want to.As for the anti-religious bent it is obvoius and although it didn't bother me directly the author's single minded determination to influence the reader did.As many other's have stated... if you are a parent please read this book before letting your young children read it. At the very least it will get you ready to answer questions your kids may bring you about castration, female genital mutilation, pedophilia, and other topics that come up that seem fairly odd for a children's book. Granted most are mentioned in passing but that doesn't mean the kids are just going to ignore them.I can't recommend this book at all. There are way too many good things to read out there and belive me this isn't one of them."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"Contrary to some arguments, I believe these books are wonderful for a Christian parent to give to her or his child. Rather than being atheist propaganda, they are kind and creative reminders that all institutions, even those we hold most dear, are subject to corruption and hypocrisy. So many churches today are corrupt with hatred and fear and this book reminds kids and adults that there is hope in the world. As a person dedicated to religious studies, I strongly recommend these books for parents and their children to read and talk about together to foster intelligent dialog."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"I was somewhat reluctant to embark on the adventure of His Dark Materials, as I am not always sure about \\"fantasy\\" and my enjoyment of it, but I really got a lot out of this reading experience. The plot follows Lyra, who is a messiah figure, from \\"local\\" adventures in her own world, through increasingly meaningful experiences that transcend the confines of one (or any) physical world to make a lasting impact on the state of the universe both physically and metaphyically. For those readers who enjoyed and respected both The Lord of the Rings and the Narnia series of books, this is a highly recommended work!The story telling is quite rich, and the features of Lyra's world become very real to the reader. For example, the \\"daemons\\" -- the animals that represent a part of each human's psyche -- became so real to me, that the cultural responses and customs surrounding them became second nature to me. When one of the witches, Serafina Pekala, sends her daemon far away from her, I shuddered with sincere discomfort because everyone knows that daemons and their humans cannot be separated by much space! (Witches, however, I learned later, have this ability...) There are other aspects of Lyra's universe like this that pull in the reader and engage him or her. The story is enriched by the creation of such a set of rules -- it creates realism for the fantasy adventures that the characters have.In the first book, Lyra must confront a horrific experiment launched by the powerful church to fight human consciousness, and she does so with the help of \\"The Golden Compass\\" -- an instrument that answers her questions through intricate ordering of symbols and signs. In the middle volume, Lyra meets Will, a boy struggling with his own domestic issues in our universe, who has his own destiny involving \\"The Subtle Knife\\" -- an instrument that can cut through anything, even the divisions between universes. In the final volume, the scientist Mary Malone, who has been studying the particles that signify human self-awareness in our universe, plays a key role in the resolution of the plot with \\"The Amber Spyglass\\" in yet another universe.One aspect of the writing that I found really rewarding as a reader is that it is difficult to tell who is good in terms of what their objectives were. The ambiguity of who represents the god/good is unsettling, and there is a strong deist point of view in THE AMBER SPYGLASS. The characters who react to the dogma and power of the church illustrate the great personal will and sacrifice it can take to do so in any culture where one religious organization holds power is arresting, but it isn't always clear who is trying to do what and whose actions will bring the most good to the most people.The characters are well developed, the plot, though comprehensive, is interesting and provokes a great deal of thought regarding one's own religious beliefs, what one has faith in and what the results of that faith are in the world in which we live. I find the designation of these books as \\"children's literature\\" inconsistent with their content, but I strongly recommend them to adults!!"},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"I agree with several of the kids' reviews that say it began great but then kind of fizzled. I first listened to \\"The Golden Compass\\" as an audio book, and was intrigued enough to buy the boxed set. The second book introduced a whole new cast of characters, essentially doubling the number to keep track of. The story was seen from several different points of view, set in several locations, which did not always tie together clearly. Throughout the second and third book, I felt as though more and more plot lines were being opened, with few being wrapped up. In the third book in particular, the motives of antagonists seem to get all mixed up, and when the book was over, I still wasn't sure how I was supposed to feel about them. I finished the series; I wasn't bored, but I was ready for it to be over.Now for those into Christian censorship:I am a faith-filled Christian who is not into censorship except in extreme cases. This series is openly anti-Christian. Essentially, the final books says that Christian beliefs are a mistake that worked. I don't think the books need to be censored because of that, and my 3-star rating is not due to that (maybe 1/3 of a star was deducted because this detracted from the story for me just a little.) But for parents who are worried about the strength of their children's faith, maybe hold off on this series for a while. Give them Harry Potter (although some folks who haven't read them will try to say otherwise, these are moral tales about good versus evil; the characters are realistic kids who have faults and struggle to make the right decisions.) Save these books until the kids are older."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"These three books are amoung the best pieces of literature on the face of this planet.The first book, The Golden Compass, takes place in a uninverse that is somewhat like ours was in the late 1800s, with a few deliberate changes. The Chuch has absolute power over everyone, dealing with anyone who dares to oppose their views violently. People's souls take the form of shapeshifting creatures known as \\"daemons\\". In this world, a girl named Lyra and her daemon, Pantiliamon, get involved in a strange series of events involving torturous experiments on children, gypsies, witches, talking bears, and gateways to other dimensions. At the end of the book, she sets off for another dimension...The second book, The Subtle Knife, starts off by introducing a new character, Will. This teenage boy comes from a world that is apparently the literary equivalent of OUR world. He finds a portal to the world Lyra left for at the end of the first book. They meet, and explore the haunted city Cittagazze, a strange place plagued by soul-sucking demons. In order to help them in their quest, they seek the Subtle Knife, a device of awesome power.The third book, The Amber Spyglass, the longest of the three, and perhaps the richest, begins right where the second left off. Will , having just learned the truth of his father, teams up with a pair of angels to get Lyra back from her mother. The Church wants Lyra dead, so this complicates things. Meanwhile, Lord Asriel is planning the ultimate war...and Mary Malone, in a strange world inhabited by the mulefa, constructs a device that allows one to see Dust. Lyra and Will's destiny is key to the fate of all universes.These summaries don't BEGIN to do the book justice.These are amoung the most supremely excellent novels.

There is a certain amount of Physics in it, telling you about the windows to other worlds and how they are formed also there is a lot of looks into religion and the heart of Christianity itself. The last book in the trilogy is based on 'Paradise Lost' and it re-tells the stories of angels. The two main characters are strong and different and are independent-not relying on their parents or anyone else but themselves.They have their daemons makes another story of friendship come up. The story is breathtaking and exciting all the way through, with interesting friendships and a tale of love that is so pure and white that even the snow in the north is darker than it.

I hope they live up to this masterpiece."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"My three girls and I all love to read, I mean LOVE it! We also like to discuss books we read together. As such, it is always a joy to come across a book or series that engages all of us and ends with long conversations we all learn from. While I do not feel these books are age appropriate for my 8 year old, even with an advanced reading level, it IS for my 13 and 17 year olds. After The Golden Compass, they both fought over who would get to read The Subtle Knife first.Based on some of the reviews here, much of this series seems to personally offend anyone that is christian. It seems like anything that is threatening to their beliefs is deemed dangerous and negative. However, I think it is a good thing to have your beliefs challenged; it makes you use your mind, question things, and creates thought!I would much rather have my girls read something they didn't agree with and found distasteful than have their right to read what they want denied. I am grateful for the freedom they experience in our country and the opportunities they are afforded because of it--opportunities to read something like these books that will make them use their minds, for example!It comes down to this: If you are someone who likes to read, likes to be entertained, likes to use your imagination, and likes to think for yourself rather than allowing someone else to think for you, you will find value in this series!"},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"Philip Pullman's dark fantasy trilogy, His Dark Materials, ostensibly written for children, is actually literature of a much higher order. The title of the trilogy comes from a particularly powerful passage of Milton's Paradise Lost, the great religious epic poem whose central story is the thematic basis for this trilogy. Another important influence on these three novels is the Christian Parsifal or Sir Percival story, which dates back to the early middle-ages as part of both the King Arthur and the Holy Grail cycle of tales. From its very first page, Pullman's crisp, evocative writing creates a world not quite like ours but just similar enough to be uncomfortable and strangely familiar. As readers of the trilogy know, most of the events in these books do not occur on our world or even in our universe. Of course, because this is post Tolkien fantasy, Mr. Pullman has absorbed all of the usual fantasy tropes and has no desire to repeat them. So what he writes is new, deeper, with fully rounded characters that come alive on the page. His courageous young heroine, Lyra Belacqua with her daemon familiar, Pantalaimon, always by her side, is one of the great creations in \\"children's literature\\". Lyra and Pan make an especially entertaining, often very amusing, pair. Her fearsome Uncle, Lord Asriel, is one of those rich, ambiguous creations that keep you guessing as to their motives, reminiscent of Professor Snape in J. K. Rowling's Potter novels. Pullman's writing is lean and well crafted and exciting to read. Once started, it is very difficult to set aside.This three volume boxed set contains the books in hardcover with their original dustcovers. Their artwork is lovely. It also contains a map: a necessity in today's complex world of fantasy. The first volume, The Golden Compass, has been filmed and was recently released on DVD. The two succeeding books, The Subtle Knife and The Amber Spyglass, will presumably follow thereafter. This set makes a lovely gift for an older and mature reading child or an adult who still retains memories of childhood and all of its dark mysteries. Strongly recommended.Mike Birman"},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"There are enough (I dare say much more than enough) reviews out there that pertain to the actual contents of the book, whether it be good or bad, so I shall not express how awesome I think the trilogy is. I, instead, want to comment on the various editions of the book/trilogy available out there. I personally bought the Dark Materials Omnibus, which is absolutely gorgeous, and has very sturdy binding. The cover has a nice texture to it, and is much lighter than one would expect for its size (it is quite large). However, I have seen other versions of the trilogy, and I found that the paperback versions, printed by Knopf, are also wonderful and pleasing to the eye, which are printed with heftier paper than the Omnibus. The \\"standard\\" versions (the ones that cost 7.50 or so) are also great, though not as pretty as the other ones; they are, however, lightweight and tightly bound (I got those for my brother, who enjoyed the series). However, if you are in search of a copy to give as a gift, then I suggest the Omnibus or paperback versions, simply because of its aesthetic value."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"This is by far the most engaging, intelligently-wrtten works of children's literature I have ever read. (And for anyone getting hyped up about the religious factor, please read this before you judge!) The prose is sophisticated (I would say this is for kids with a very good vocabulary, maybe a 9+), and the characters are engaging. And talk about action packed! Pullman always keeps the reader guessing, and the action always is intriguing. The books do have violence in them (nothing too gory, but there are some battle scenes with blood, and some characters die), so keep that in mind if you want to read it to kids younger than 9.A lot of people say this book is anti-religious, anti-God, atheistic, etc. Most of these reviews have obviously not read the series. I actually found The Golden Compass in the book closet of the Catholic school where I taught English Lit! This book for certain is NOT anti-Christian. It does not preach evil values, & it does not encourage children to kill God. The book has a lot of religious aspects: souls, angels, and spirits. This book IS anti-religious corruption, and it IS against using religion to justify evil. One review mentioned the book encourages female circumcision: so wrong!...what the book said was that religions have used faith in God to cause harm to many, including the cutting of genitalia! And if Pullman is an atheist, so what? C.S. Lewis was a Christian. Does that mean Jews, Muslims and Buddhists can't enjoy the Narnia series, even though its messages aren't parallell to their own religious values?One thing that I do like is that Pullman creates very strong-minded children for his main characters, especially Lyra. Despite having horrible parents, Lyra finds strength within to overcome seemingly impossible tasks with the aid of her daemon Pan. I like that Pullman talks a lot about how fear can destroy people and societies, and also on a subtle level, how technology gone too far can wreak havoc on the world. I also like that Lyra both respects and questions authority. She has a mind and a sense of adventure, and I love that she breaks so many female sterotypes.I'm re-reading the series now and am giving it to my 10 year-old cousin for Christmas. I know he'll love it as much as I do!"},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"This trilogy is what reading is all about. It creates a world where you can lose yourself and reflect upon the \\"real world\\" that we live in. I found it moving and important.I picked up a copy of \\"The Golden Compass\\" as a houseguest at a friend's house. I confess I wasn't much company, as I could not put the book down for my visit. Before I left my host's house, I went online to buy the entire Trilogy which was waiting for me when I got home. I unpacked, and started reading again.It truly is thought-provoking and brilliant. Unfortunately, it is also dangerous to those beliefs which we simply assume to be true. Questioning and analyzing are basic intellectual activities, and these books are marvelous opportunities to use fiction to really make you think. Perhaps that's why we are seeing so many negative ratings from those who are very \\"faith-based\\". They seem to assume if Faith is questioned (which this series does), then it is anti-Christian. I don't quite get that, as I think Faith without questioning is dangerous itself.I would agree that the youngest readers may not be equipped for the explorations these books present, but after reading them themselves, perhaps parents will be able to make an informed decision.Read for yourself, think for yourself, allow the mysteries to absorb you. But don't expect to get a lot done outside of your reading time!!"},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"After finishing the 4th Harry Potter book I moped around for a few days lamenting the fact that the next installment isn't due for publication for quite some time. Luckily, a friend of mine suggested the Dark Materials series by Phillip Pullman. Five pages in to The Golden Compass I was hooked. With a &quot;Potter like&quot; fervor I ripped through the first book in two very long nights. After which I was useless at work, but just as satisfied as when I first discovered the work of J.K. Rowlings. A great read!A note to parents: The world that Pullman conjurs is a bit darker than Harry Potter's. There is more violence and some very frightening situations. I'd say 11 and up would be a good age for these books."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"Pullman has a very fertile imagination, which has allowed him to populate these books with many unforgettable characters and ideas. Unfortunately, the pacing of the books is very uneven. There are some points (e.g. the ends of both the first and second books) that are just too frenetic, where what should have been a whole chapter gets condensed down to a single page in what seems like a rush to finish the volume. There are other points (most of the third book) where the plot drags intolerably. A little editing could have helped a lot in producing a more readable series.The other problem I have with the series is its increasingly allegorical storyline. It's not really noticeable in the first book, then starts to appear in the second and dominates the third. Quite honestly, I found the increasingly anti-religious tone pretty tiresome. Brust and Zelazny did a much better job in _To Reign in Hell_, which should also appeal to younger readers, and there are other examples of the same theme being handled better as well.In a similar vein, I was personally rather pleased to see same-sex relationships (among angels, no less) treated as something normal and unremarkable, but others might find that same treatment offensive. I have to wonder who these books are written for. The apparent young-reader audience is probably not ready for the religious and other themes, while their treatment is too sophomoric for adult readers. I think Pullman would have done well to eschew some of the polemics and concentrate on telling a good story - which he's very capable of doing.I'd like to recommend these books because of their sheer imaginative creativity, but due to these other failings I find it impossible to do so. There are worse books out there, to be sure, but there are just as certainly better ones."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"I was utterly enchanted by this series. I picked up The Golden Compass in a free books pile at the Catholic school where I worked as an English teacher; once I started it, I could not put it down. When I finished, I immediately purchased the next final parts of the series! Many readers have said that The Subtle Knife is the weakest link, and I certianly agree, but I find that's the same for most trilogies.I was surprised to see so many negative reviews of this book, most of them saying that the books are anti-God. I found the series to more to be anti-religious corruption than anti-God. or anti-spiritual. (The deamons in Lyra's world are like souls in our world). Many people lovingly praise the Narnia series; I find this is just one more perspective in religious fantasy. Many reviews quote a nun character as saying Christianity was a big mistake. I think this book can be an excellent way to open up conversations about how people all too often use faith to serve their own needs (as the history of Catholicism and Christianity has shown, in addition to all other religions). If you are concerned about these aspects regarding your children, read the book first and then decide it you think it's appropriate.I think this book teaches some great values, such as questioning corrupt authority and pursuing the truth. I also love seeing a strong female character in the main role. Also, I like how Pullman highlighs the importance of animals by making daemons take on animals forms. In all, I found this series incredibly imaginative and thought-provoking. I was blown away at the end, and highly recommend this series to fantasy fans of all ages."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"This trilogy is well-written (slow going at times) with content that some may find disturbing (especially in Books II and III). Despite the ads for the movie (The Golden Compass), this series isn't suitable for younger readers. The lines between good and evil are muddled at times, and the terminology may be disturbing to some (daemons are good, angels can be evil, battling the Authority, etc...). These books are on the \\"hit list\\" of many religious groups; the author is apparently an atheist, and some feel that these books are encouraging children to turn against God. As with many books, you can see whatever you want to see in these stories. Personally, I find the underlying themes as dealing with free will, innocence, and the struggle to pursue good when evil takes many forms. I encourage parents to read these books along with their (older) children and discuss them openly. NOTE: The movie (The Golden Compass) glosses over some of the more disturbing elements and events that are in the first book. If you or your children have seen the movie before reading the book, be prepared for some key differences (and some that may be truly upsetting for young children)."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"Pullman's moving His Dark Materials series is based on Milton's epic poem \\"Paradise Lost\\" and deals heavily with religion and metaphysics. It's not for the very young, the easily offended, the narrow minded, the faint of heart or those looking for a light,easy, preachy or moralistic children's book. These three books make you think and feel. I reccomend buying all three books at the same time, setting aside a large chunk of time, reading a summary of \\"Paradise Lost\\" and stocking up on food and facial tisse because this powerful, but heart- breakingly melancholy series offers no closure until the third book. I think it's about 1000 pages or more in total.That said, you'll notice that while many praise this book, it's dificult to say what's it's about (notice lack of plot summary in reviews and even on back of books). Let's just say that it is set in many different worlds, some like ours, some different, and the main characters are 11 year old Lyra, 12 year old Will and 3000 year old Dust. The three books really focus on what happens to and how people deal with Dust (a sort of conscious matter) in different worlds and planes of existence.The books are definetly fantasy, not sci-fi, and those who enjoy the richness and detail of Harry Potter's world , or Tolkien's work will enjoy this one. The His Dark Materials series is much more challenging, and frankly unsettling, because it is so imbued with moral ambiguity, and moral slippages- what's right in one situation isn't right in others, etc. It may leave you questioning what and why you believe.The Dark Materials series stands out because of the mixture of romance, action, mystery, technology,legend, and lore. More than being about religion, or other worlds or rites of passage the His Dark Materials series is about Truth. Live truthfully, question the truth, and never, ever prevent others from living truthfully. The worse thing you can ever do, the series implies, is to keep the truth from people. Keeping people in the \\"Dark\\" prevents them from enjoying life and living in the moment.I don't feel that I can adequately describe how powerful, moving or important this series is. It's absolutely consuming; it'll take you away. Read this one- you won't regret it. I'd give it an infinite number of stars if I could."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"No point in reviewing the individual books because they don't make sense alone - they are three episodes of a single story. Read \\"Northern Lights\\" (or, as I did first, see the approximately corresponding film \\"The Golden Compass\\") alone, and one is confronted with an odd children's adventure yarn, admittedly rather darker and more sinister in the book than in the watered-down film. However, one (this one anyway) was still tempted to paraphrase Randy Newman:O, who would think a girl and bearCould be well accepted everywhere?It's just amazing how fairPeople can be!\\"Northern Lights\\" is actually a bit of a bore, and one is tempted to scream \\"GET ON WITH IT!\\" every few pages. However, it is an essential set-up for what follows. \\"The Subtle Knife\\" is a marvellous bit of compulsive page-turning writing as three parallel worlds come into collision and the anti-religious overtones of the trilogy, at which \\"Northern Lights\\" only vaguely hints, come more sharply into focus. The character of Will, the boy from our world, with destiny thrust upon him, is especially appealing.\\"The Amber Spyglass\\", fattest of the three, starts off slowly, but stick with it, because it becomes ever more interesting and fascinating. One (this one anyway) is lost in admiration of Mr. Pullman's prodigious imagination in weaving together all the various and varied elements of this amazing tale. In some cases, the imagination is, to me, just too prodigious, with the creation of wheeled creatures, appealing though they are. However, you will enjoy the ride. The bittersweet ending is especially effective.And the anti-religious message that seems to have upset some people? \\"The Christian religion is a very powerful and convincing mistake, that's all,\\" states one of Mr. Pullman's heroines. And devout Christians will undoubtedly bridle at his picture of \\"The Authority\\" and indeed his whole take on theology, on which he has partially based his fantasy, with many Biblical ideas (the Garden of Eden) and figures (Enoch) playing a part. However, as I understand it, this God bears little or no resemblance to the God of the Bible, whom Christians worship, and if He does, they should be very worried indeed. And, hey, Christianity has been around for 2000 years now. It should be grown up and able to stand up for itself - and be both ready and able to take a bit of honest examination. Has the faith for which many were prepared to perish in the arenas of Rome with such courage come to the point where a kids' book is a threat? If it has, it's not much of a faith. As for its potential for subverting children, it seems to me to be about as subversive as Harry Potter - and does it not represent a golden opportunity for Christian parents to expound the difference?"},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"Phillip Pullman's magnificent trilogy started with The Golden Compass and continued with The Subtle Knife before reaching its conclusion with The Amber Spyglass, and there is much to be said for his achievement. He has told a story of sweeping grandeur that succeeds on a number of levels, with believable and affecting characters, amazing incidents of great beauty and terror, and layers of meaning which make you think as well as feel.It all starts with Lyra, the heroine - an urchin in an Oxford University which exists in a parallel universe, where all humans carry with them an external \\"daemon\\" or animal spirit which corresponds to the soul of man. Lyra's daemon, Pantaleimon or Pan, has not stabilized his form, (which takes place after puberty) and takes the shape of a number of different animals, from mouse to moth to leopard.This parallel Oxford appears mired in a Victorian-like era marked by a very powerful and reactionary Church. There are five known planets in the sky, the wealthy travel by Zeppelin, and though the glare of \\"anbaric\\" light is common, so also is the warm glow of naphtha lamps. Their physicists (called \\"experimental theologians\\") have discovered a class of elementary particles called Rusakov Particles or \\"Dust\\" which have an affinity for human life, and may in fact be alive themselves. This Dust is attracted to adults, not children, and the Church is disturbed by this, equating Dust with original sin.We are quickly swept into an adventure with Lyra, whose absentee parents prove to be the mysterious Lord Asriel and the beautiful, ambitious and amoral Mrs. Coulter. It is Lord Asriel who has set his sights no lower than to topple The Authority himself, the corrupt ancient of days, oldest of divine beings who lives in a fortress in the clouds and cynically claims to be the creator of all. In this effort he has the assistance of angels, divine beings from the fall so long ago. Lord Asriel is opposed in this by his former lover, who has gained considerable power in the Magisterium by heading the General Oblation Board, the fearsome child-stealing \\"Gobblers,\\" who have been spiriting kidnapped children away to the far north.Action in The Golden Compass moves north, toward the frozen lands of the aurora, because that is where Dust is most detectable, and where the towers and buildings of another world are visible in the sky beyond the northern lights. When we finally arrive at the terrifying research facility called Bolvangar, where the Gobblers do their Dust-related experiments on children, we have come to a very powerful additional level of narrative, for though this place is run by seemingly familiar, genteel Victorian Englishpeople, it reminds one of the laboratories of Dr. Mengele, a frightening parallel for parents reading the book.When Lyra walks into that other world at the end of The Golden Compass, she has already had an incredible adventure, with her friends the Gyptians, Iorek Byrnison and the armored bears, the proud and beautiful witches and the rumor of angels. She has learned to read the Alethiometer or truth teller, the golden compass of the title, which has sent her to the ultimate north. And she has betrayed her best friend unknowingly, and been betrayed herself.In The Subtle Knife we meet Will Parry, whose arctic explorer father has been missing since before he was born. Now 12 years old, Will has grown up fast, protecting his ailing mother from her inner demons, and from the mysterious men who have come (from where? Lyra's world?) looking for John Parry's papers. Will accidentally kills one of these men, and from then on he is on the run with no looking back.Will escapes through a portal into another world, the same world that Lyra has walked to. They meet in Cittagazze by the sea, a city deserted by adults fearful of the vampiric Specters who drift almost invisibly on the air and suck the life from these people. Will takes Lyra back to his Oxford, where she meets a physicist named Mary Malone who is studying Dark Matter, and has reason to believe that it is intelligent. But Lyra and Will are hunted and wanted for questioning in our Oxford, and Lyra has her Alethiometer stolen by an aristocrat from her world, who sets for them a task if they want it back.It seems that several hundred years before, a guild of scientist/philosophers in the crossroads world of Cittagazze had forged a knife sharp enough to split atoms - or cut doorways into other worlds. The bearers of the knife became adept at stealing from these other worlds, but tragically the doors they opened allowed the Specters to come in, bringing horror and sorrow. This is the task Lyra's aristocrat sets for the children (for he cannot enter Cittagazze because of the Specters): if they bring him the subtle knife, he will trade it for Lyra's golden compass.Will and Lyra enter the haunted Torre degli Angeli and Will fights for the knife, becoming maimed as a result, with a wound that stubbornly refuses to heal (shades of Parsifal). As the new Bearer he is instructed in its use, and becomes as adept with the knife as Lyra is with her truth teller.With the help of witches who have followed them to this world, they escape a mob of evil children, and the witches try to heal Will's wound without success. The witch queen Ruta Skadi follows a flight of angels to the distant world where Lord Asriel prepares his armies to fight the Authority, and returns to tell about it. And Dr. Malone has an instant message discussion with her shadow particles, which identify themselves as angels, and send her (protected from Specters) to follow the children into the world of C'gazze. The book ends in confusion and alarum -- a cliffhanger readers had to wait several years to resolve.Before we get to The Amber Spyglass, a few comments. These books were inspired by Paradise Lost, and are full of allusions to the Hebrew Bible. The Authority, who Asriel is rebelling against, was the One who called himself Yahweh and claimed to be the Creator, when he was really just another angel. In other words, in the world(s) of His Dark Materials, the God of the Bible is a liar and a fraud, and His Church (read: all organized religions) is a Blakeian thief of innocence and inhibitor of joy throughout the ages. This helps explain Pullman's well-known antipathy to C.S. Lewis' (delightful) Narnia books, which Pullman detests for glorifying an afterlife (in The Last Battle) at the expense of the living world. I acknowledge this without further comment, except to say that The Last Battle is probably most readers' least favorite Narnia book.There are also many allusions to the story of Adam and Eve, particularly in reference to Dust as Original Sin, which send the Church into paroxysms of agitation. We come to see as the story unfolds that Lyra is tremendously important, with a destiny that affects all the worlds. How could this be otherwise, with Lord Asriel for a father (who can bend time itself to serve his rebellion) and the exquisite Mrs.Coulter for a mother, she of the most indomitable spirit and force of will anyone has ever seen, whom even the Specters obey? Of course, Will himself is an embodiment of this spirit - even the witches are afraid to look him in the eye. If Lyra and Will are to become Adam and Eve, with Dr. Malone playing the part of the serpent, well, this is just another layer to the story.I believe The Amber Spyglass will be long remembered for its bravura centerpiece: Lyra and Will's frightening, depressing and ultimately inspiring journey down into the land of the dead, but that's not the only arrow in Pullman's quiver. This big book is full of wonders, including angels, tiny aristocratic Gallivespian spies, Harpies, the wheel-riding Mulefa, and War in Heaven. Nor is it short on human emotion.I feel a strong reluctance to give away any details of The Amber Spyglass. It begins by resolving the cliffhanger of The Subtle Knife: we know where Lyra is, and crosscut to all the parties trying to reach her. And we are privy to her feverish dreams of the land of the dead, where her friend Roger languishes on a vast darkling plain of ghosts.Readers of Dante and Homer will not be disappointed - the land of the dead that Pullman has created is very real and frightening. It is all part of the age-old deception of the Authority: that believers will go to Heaven when they die, because instead all who die in all the worlds go down into the land of the dead. We feel uneasy when Lyra and Will and the lilliputian Gallivespians cut through to a world in search of food for their journey and find a stable full of dead horses covered with millions of buzzing flies, the corpse of a farmer with his throat slashed, and soldiers with guns coming up the road.They cut again, but with difficulty, into an identical world where the farmer stands wide-eyed in his kitchen, clutching at his throat, knowing he is dead. \\"I can't stay here,\\" he says, and indeed the road is now filled with people from the town, dead people, walking towards the land of the dead. I shouldn't say more.These books are among the best young/adult books I have read, and I hope you will enjoy them."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"I initially learned of this series after hearing it compared to the Harry Potter books. I adored Harry's adventures with his friends and wanted more of the same British magic. After reading both I realized that Phillip Pullman's work can in no way be compared to J.K. Rowling. Both authors are spectacular in their storytelling, but are so different in their styles and objectives for their works that comparing and contrasting them would do neither justice.Philllip Pullman's His Dark Materials Trilogy is a complex work of courage, love and betrayal, and conveys to the readers a wide diapason of human emotions and personalities. My initial impression of The Golden Compass (book 1 in the series) was that it was an anti-religious book and the propaganda behind it almost turned me off the entire series. I have to admit that I was utterly wrong in making such a conclusion so soon and am glad that I made myself suspend my skepticism and read to the end. True believers in a cause, be it eternal salvation or something entirely different, are sometimes blind to reason since they see nothing but the burning beacon of their faith directing their paths of righteousness. Their deeds might appear wicked in the eyes of the atheists among us, but are they truly so? Can you compare the actions of Father Gomez in his mission to kill Lyra and spare Will, who is in his eyes an innocent, to a common murderer? Does his unwavering belief absolve him of sin or condemn him even more? What about Ms. Coulter, who did unspeakable things in her life until she finally found the bliss that is maternal love? Does her final sacrifice make all the other deeds accidental?There are so many questions of human nature that this series raises and manages to avoid giving free answers that don't encourage thought and reflection. It shows that not everything in life is black and white and there are as many shades of gray as there are misconceptions, deceptions and misunderstandings within human character. And with all that, the purity of spirit and love shine through in both Will and Lyra as they undertake the most perilous tasks and continuously find themselves battling for the greater good that children should never have to do. Then again, may be it can only take the innocence and ingenuity of a child to accomplish what they managed without loosing themselves in the process.I will not spoil the ending of the series, but will say that it was as powerfully and beautifully written as the rest of the tale. All three books were fast paced and captivated my interest completely. I would personally not recommend this trilogy to children and in my opinion they were quite a bit darker then the Harry Potter books. On the other hand, the original Brothers Grimm stories are a lot more gruesome and I've read them as a child myself. Whatever you do, don't miss this phenomenal read."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"I read Pullman's work before any controversy had emerged in the public sphere and I was left breathless.What I read in his writing was some of the most spiritual fictional writing I have ever encountered. The adventures of Lyra paralleled my own explorations of the fundamental truth of reality on the spiritual and scientific frontier where the power of the individual lies not in the worship of another but in the empowerment within the unified whole. While we might not have a physical Dust, we do have a metaphysical Dust - a Force that moves amongst all of life and, when consciously discovered, awakens the individual to his or her full powers as the part of God we all are.Then my Mom, a devout Catholic and teacher, asked me if I'd heard of these books that her priest had written about in the weekly church bulletin, warning parents to keep from their children while at the same time admitting he had not read them himself. Soon after, the warnings had gone global and I was being told that I read evil works determined to destroy God within children.That idea simply comes from people still rooted in dogma and unable to yet see the full human potential. Certainly these books seek to move beyond the notion of a hierarchical, worship-demanding God. They also seek to move beyond the limitations of one believing his dogma is the one and only true path. But, in so doing, they move to a deeper understanding of \\"God\\" or \\"Allah\\" or \\"The Spirit of the East\\" or \\"The Force\\"... just as a child moves beyond dependence on a parent. These books internalize God in the journey of a single child, and thus use fiction to make the argument of whether or not there even is a God pretty much irrelevant since all that can be accomplished through worship of an external entity becomes possible within a single child.Wonderful series that will help your children find the God that is each of them."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"I cannot review the actual story because I haven't finished reading it yet but from what I have read, I love it.

My wife and I have always been fans of fantastical worlds and have travelled them widely as often as our day could spare us...while I am more into epics like The Lord of The Rings, Beowulf, Kalevala etc. my wife is an ardent fan of Harry Potter, Chronicles of Narnia et al. Last year, with Harry Potter coming to an end (hopefully), she had been filling the void with Bartimaeus Trilogy when His Dark Materials came along. The story involves fantasy elements but alludes to a broad range of ideas from fields such as physics, philosophy, and theology. We found something for both of us...For my part, I liked the epicish approach (evident from grandeur of scale and title of the series which is suggestively derived from, again, an epic), dealing with much broader subjects through a gripping storyline. Rest is not to be told, only to be read and experienced.As for Amazon's service in delivering the order, it was again, I must say, most impressive.

Having just finished the last HP book, I was desperate for some reading material. Since the trailer was intriguing and appeared geared for kids, I thought what the heck...let's give it a try.First let me say, the entire trilogy of His Dark Materials, including The Golden Compass, was amazing. The details, the plot lines, the imagination - wow! After finishing the Golden Compass, I was left wanting more and had to finish the entire trilogy. HOWEVER,...This is not, and I repeat, not a book for children. As the mom of three daughters, 6th grade, 3rd grade and 1st grade, I was amazed that the movie, based on this book, was marketed to kids via Harry Potter. The ideas presented in the book and the plot lines were confusing to me, let alone a child to understand. Even after finishing the entire trilogy I was still left at the end with a bit of \\"Huh??\\". There were so many intertwining plot lines and complex/mature material presented, there is no way a young child could understand any of it. Furthermore, the author is VERY good at providing the detail you need to get an image in your minds eye of what's going on. This is great. The problem is, these images would be downright disturbing to a kid.My hat is off to the author - the trilogy was very entertaining and worth a second read to pick up what I missed the first time. But for shame movie producers!!! Hopefully your intent was to market this to the older HP audience. If not, what were you thinking?"},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"such great books. puts harry potter to shame. very dark and brooding books, totally great!"},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"John Forstbauer10/25/01English 9Ms. FeildTitle: The Golden CompassAuthor: By Philip PullmamThe Golden Compass is a page turning science fiction book. It just kept me on the edge of my seat the whole time. I personally don't enjoy reading a lot but this book actually made me want to read longer and longer.The book is about a little girl called Lyra who is about twelve years old. She lives at a collage called Jorden Collage with a lot of scholes. Then one night at the collage Lyra overheard a statement that would change her life forever. The talk was about an extradinary element, microscopic in size. Lyra heard that this partical called dust could unite whole universes, but it was only found in the vast parts of the northern artic. But some people were scared of dust and wanted to detroy it.Lyra realised her destiny was to find the dust. When the Lord of the collage was arrested, he gave a golden compass to Lyra that was called a antiemeter. This compass possessed the power to answer any question that you asked it. It does this by pointing to three different pictures or symbols with three different hands. Only a few people knew how to read the compass so Lyra struggled to teach herself how to understand it. When Lyra set off for the north she was helped by Gyptions, which were people, Withes and giant armored bears, which were polar bears with special armor and great strength. Lyra was forced to fight many battles against an evil person called Ms. Coutler, who wants to take all of the dust for herself and use it to create a new universe.The author also used some literary terms such as foreshadowing. He used this element when he said,&quot;Isoric will become king of the bears again.&quot; That was foreshadowing because Isoric did become king of the armored bears later on when he killed the new king to gain the thrown.The whole time Lyra hadn't the faintest clue that she alone was destined to win or lose a battle that would change the universe forever.My personal opinion of this book is that it was an excellent book and that it was very exiting. I gave it two thumbs up. If you are looking for a great science fiction book, this is the one to read. I would have to say it is one of my favorite books ever."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"These books absolutely changed my life. They're like Harry Potter, but much better.

The series is set in a parallel universe in which everybody has an external manifestation of some facet of their personality, called daemons. In The Golden Compass, children are being captured by people called \\"Gobblers,\\" and Lyra must go on a journey to find these children, rescue them, and meet some interesting characters along the way. Along the way, she learns more about herself, the motives of the Church (the primary authority in the land), and Dust, subatomic particles linked with human development. In The Subtle Knife, Lyra must help her newfound friend Will find his long-lost father. They soon learn about an epic battle that they too must be involved in, and this unfolds in the third book, The Amber Spyglass.Although fantastical and mystical, drawing on many Biblical and mythical allusions, Pullman's plot is coherent and logical. There is no \\"chosen one\\" or anything like that; it seems more like Pullman could have used any particularly clever child instead of simply Lyra, but evens just drew her towards her role in the battle. Indeed, typical fantasy fare isn't overplayed in this series, and it's a great fantasy series for anyone tired of same-old.Pullman also has an interesting take on the battle of good versus evil, with the side of good opposing those in power and standing in the name of progress, knowledge, and free will. Likewise, characters are often faced with moral ambiguities and frequently deliberate an issue, instead of jumping to the choice that is an Inherently Right And Just Choice. He develops many of his characters very deeply, and their personalities don't seem forced, but flow with their situations and develop likewise. The themes of the novels ring true especially with the more humanist ears.Pullman's language and imagery are very rich, and would probably be worthy of some literary analysis. Ostensibly the books are for children; however, there is so much depth to it that it seems they would appeal more to older readers, and most of the richness would zip over young minds. Indeed, I anticipate rereading the series at some point."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"This series is a cross between Paradise Lost and Chronicles of Narnia, and I think it is a wonderful read for adults as well as teens. His Dark Materials pulls you into another world entirely, and I was captivated from the beginning of the first book to the end of the third. The Golden Compass takes place in a world different from ours, The Subtle Knife shows us how many different worlds including ours are intertwined, and then The Amber Spyglass introduces the spiritual/ immortal worlds. The colorful worlds achieve an amazing dimension unlike most books- you feel as if you are reading something that creates a 4 or 5 dimensional feel and not just 3-D.This series is much darker than many fantasy books, and I would not recommend it for children under the age of 12. I do, however, recommend it to all teens and adults alike."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"These books are the best books I have ever read in my entire life. If you are a spiritual person, you'll especially love these books. It's not only for kids, although I do highly reccamend it for 12-16 year old boys and girls. It's a fantasy trilogy about a girl named Lyra Silvertongue and a boy named Will Parry. They each are on are there own inspiring quest full of adventure as they travel between many different worlds. Each book represents one of the awesomly powerful items that Will and Lyra get: The Golden Compass (Alethiometer), The Subtle Knife (Aesahaetr), and the Amber Spyglass (no name). VERY INTELLIGENTLY/CUNNINGLY WRITTEN. It has amazing detail, the best I've seen. I've read many books and these are probably the best I've ever read. Just make sure you read them in order, or else you will lose the complicated plot. I do not recomend His Dark Materials to young readers because of violence and completed reading."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"About some of these ignorant reviews. Its obvious you haven't read the book or the series, though it is not tolkien quality, it is not too bad in my opinion.I know certain of you religious groups like to reserve the right to demonize other philosophies, and you start feeling threatened when groups (that your own religious texts shamelessly slander without basis or reason other than the fact that the authors didn't approve of gays and un-convertables *Pagans and atheists who wouldn't join the movement) this group in particular starts appearing to polish their image that--lets face it--has mostly been tarnished through the centuries by you types and not the individuals themselves, instead of them just knuckling under and pretending to be what you've been taught to knee-jerk believe them to be. Lets keep the paranoia and hypocrisy to a minimum shall we?Read the book, then write a review. Its very simple.Don't just slap someone in the face with the \\"we know you're evil because that's what we've been taught, so stop pretending that you're good\\" crap.People who have decided not to embrace the mysticism side of philosophy believe their philosophy is the best just like you do yours. So they write books, just like your members do, showing how X beliefs preferred by them are better than Y. Ironically you're acting much like the people in the dark materials books with the \\"how dare someone have and opposing view point they must be evil\\" act.You think Christians don't write books that are unflattering to other groups? Oh really? Try the left behind series for starters. In fact lets go to the left behind reviews and see how many negative and incredibly paranoid reviews from opposing view points there are posted. I'll bet you its not a lot. Somebody has more respect than somebody else don't they...And P.S. If you don't like media with religious personages as the bad guy don't ever read The Three Musketeers either. Though I have to tell you it was a very good book. ^_^"},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"The first two books are excellent - the third quite frankly was horrible and a major let down. My objection is not because of its anti-Christian or anti-God view, personally I couldn't care less about that aspect of the books. Though I must say I do enjoy books better if their propaganda is a bit less in your face.The third book has a number of plot holes, a host of deus ex machinas and extremely contrived tear-jerker ending. The climatic battles we had been expecting just fizzled out, the prophesies that were made from book one were either unfulfilled or seemed to little impact within the story internal world. And it doesnt help that finally the main protagonist Lyra turn out to be little more than friend and guide to the real doer of the series, Will.Regarding the suitability of these books for children; I cannot help but think of Pullman as one of those people who lure children with candies and when the kids are reeled in spring something unpleasant on them. Here he uses the first two (quite excellent I might say) books to seduce the kids and then ambushes them with his acerbic world views in the third.I think Mister Pullmans views and opinions are be worthy of a moments attention by adults; but not by impressionable eleven or twelve year olds. I would have understood if Mister Pullman was saying that there is a God or that there is no God. I fail to see the value to telling kids that what passes for God in our world is merely an impotent evil.On the whole I wouldn't recommend it to kids. Adults (not of the religious fundamentalist variety) will enjoy the start of the series but will probably be sorely disappointed by the inadequate third book."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"I finished the trilogy recently and found it quite thought provoking but not necessarily in a complimentary way. I found it quite intriguing that every good aspect of human behavior was attributed to those that fought against religion and every bad aspect of human behavior was ascribed to those that supported the church. In particular, the church is portrayed as domineering, narrow minded, dictatorial, supportive of ignorance and violently supportive of itself. He uses the Roman Catholic Church as the victim of his attacks but they could easily stand for all organized religion. However, in Mr. Pullman's defense, he does start the trilogy with the statement that the church has fallen, the papacy is gone and the church is being run by a number of committees, boards and other governing bodies. They are interested in maintaining their power and influence more than teaching righteousness and love for our neighbors. Thus, from the beginning, Mr. Pullman has life turned upside down with the good people of the earth fighting against the tyranny of the religious organizations.If that was what I saw in religion as a whole, I might be willing to join his rebellion but the fact of the matter is that religion is not all bad like he makes it out to be. My faith embrasses every good gift and virtuous trait that he escribes to the rebels. Thus, the trilogy's heroes utilize godly attributes and the trilogy's villains embody satanic attributes which is what every good story should do, but it unfortunately places those rolls on the social groups that they would not normally be ascribed to. From a fantasy point of view, this is okay because we can enter the trilogy with the notion that society is upside down and antireligious rebellion is justified.I could compose a much more lengthy comparison of the trilogy to my own beliefs but this is not the place for that. Suffice it to say that Dust is nothing more than spirit matter that emanates from the presence of God and permeates all space, it is in and through all things. The daemons represent our conscience or that part of us that helps us to know the difference between good and evil. The alethiometer would be similar to the Liahona and represents revelation from God.Of course Mr. Pullman has it all wrong when he attempts to talk about Adam, the Ancient of Days, and Enoch. They were not egomaniacs but were humble followers of God. God encourages education and knowledge. No man can be saved in ignorance. The glory of God is intelligence. The Gospel encompasses all truth whereever it is found. We are to learn wisdom out of the best books, learn by study, by faith and by prayer. He who gains more knowledge and wisdom in this life shall have so much the advantage in the life to come.If there is a fault in the churches of today, it is not God's fault, but the error of the people that claim to administer that Gospel. Don't blame God for man's faults. That is what Mr. Pullman does, and that is his first fatal flaw of logic."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"Golden Compass is a page turner, I saw the movie after I read it and the movie is good but the book is better, I would suggest people read the book before going to the movie. I am now reading the 2nd book in his trilogy, The Subtle Knife it is good also. It follows along with some of the same characters. Pullman is an excellent writer. Zelma Fobben"},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"I just got finished reading this series and I have to say that at some points it was really enjoyable, but at others I think the writer stretched himself a bit too thin in regards to plot and detail. The first book is great - the best of the series in my opinion. I really enjoyed the entire storyline throughout the first part of the series. Also Lyra and her adventures are very interesting. Then you get to the second and third books and Will - who I happen not to be too crazy about. It's not that I don't like Will, but it almost seemed like the writer changed what the first book seemed to be about and added in so many crazy details to accommodate Will's storyline, which I didn't really see what point he actually served. Yes, he served a point of course, but I would have been fine without him even entering the series - and for the books to continue focusing on Lyra and her family. Also all the information about Molly was not really needed in the third book, and I was a bit disappointed with how the Lord Asriel and Mrs. Coulter aspect of the story was resolved. Still, this series is highly enjoyable. It's dark, intelligent, and there are so many wacky things the author comes up with. And I don't mean wacky in a negative way."},{"Title":"Air America: The Story of the CIA'S Secret Airlines","review":"Found this book in a Bangkok airport taxfree shop , bought it , started reading it and finished it within 2 days.A great view inside the secret air operations in SE Asia during the 60's / 70's.

Ever since Mel Gibson hit the big screen with the movie I've heard comments such as a fictional movie , yeah a great piece of fiction. Sure the movie was fiction to a great extent but that's Hollywood. I think Christopher did a pretty fair job of getting the reality of this group of people out there to the public with this book. The history of the airline before, during & after their Laos, Vietnam operations. A lot of us in certain age groups can well remember the President stating to the public that Laos was out of bounds, etc, etc. Really ? A lot of really talented airman or pilots were lost & a lot pulled off some pretty mean feats flying into jungle air strips while being shot at etc. Unfortunately the public is probably never going to hear or read of a lot of the heroics these pilots initiated all in a day's work. A fine read, interviewing a lot of the boys giving the reader a sense of reality of just what these men faced. Sure the money was a big part of it but it really it took a special sort of person craving adventure , challenges , in some cases lunacy ! Lunacy ? What would you call flying in bad weather while being shot at , feeling the strikes on the A/C while trying to find a way out? Just a small sample of what these guys experienced. THANKS to CHRISTOPHER for getting a little of the history of AIR AMERICA out there. If you can find this book it's well worth the read. I feel it's really a shame that the exploits of Air America & their crews have been swept under the carpet but at least Christopher has given the public a dose of history on a very big operation!DEFINITELY FIVE STARS."},{"Title":"The Analects of Confucius","review":"I can't read Confucius in the original so I really can't speak to the accuracy of Simon Leys' translation (or should we use his actual name - Pierre Ryckmans?). But without a doubt he feels it is the standard against which all others should be measured, as he constantly passes judgment in his Notes section on all who have gone before and finds each generally lacking in some way.

But, despite Simon Leys' beautifully written short introduction and his section of explanatory notes which is longer than the actual work, it escapes me why the Master should have gathered around himself such a band of devoted followers or why this book should have had such an enormous influence. Simon Leys and others claim how modern it is, i.e. how timeless. Much of what he says - that one should be righteous, just and courteous, should not show off, should practice what one preaches, should show self-control, should be aware of one's limitations - is indeed timeless - but that is because it is obvious.Those of his sayings which are not timeless - for example the huge importance he attributes to ritual (even given the glosses which Leys gives to the word), or the obedience due to the old - do not inspire much respect these days.Anyone who practices all these things is a gentleman, irrespective of birth. Anyone who does not is vulgar. Being a gentleman also involves a love of learning for its own sake, but Confucius shares the view of the philosophers of Ancient Greece that a gentleman should leave technical knowledge to others.He had a lot of fairly general things to say about politics (Aristotle is much more specific and analytical). Leys says that politics was \`his first and foremost concern' and that he hoped in vain to be called upon to be called upon by a ruler to reform a state, particularly the morality of politics. He had the naive view that if the ruler is virtuous, his people will be virtuous also.I apologize to the devotees of Confucius for my undoubted presumption in giving this classic only two stars."},{"Title":"The Analects of Confucius","review":"well i bought this book back in college I was getting around to see what i have not review and i can tell you this book was horrible (i got an A in my class) but the book is very crude and I stop reading it past page 15.

The Analects have always been a difficult and opaque work for me. I have read it several times over many years and have always found at least half the sayings completely incomprehensible. The Waley and Legge translations are dry and dated. Lau and Dawson are easier to read but still leave me puzzled about the meaning of most of the sayings. Some of their notes are useless and distracting, while others merely fail to inform. I was always left thinking of the Analects as a few clever and witty proverbs scattered throughout a strange and impentrable work.The Huang translation, on the other hand, is clear and easy to read. It is easy to follow the structure of the book. It has just the right amount of notes and they are located just underneath the analect itself--not at the bottom of the page or end of the book where you have to interupt your reading and look for them. The sayings that are easy to understand have no notes. The other sayings have notes that clarify the context and meaning. They are brief and to the point so that they don't get in the way of the text. Things that were impossible to understand are now clear. I find that I am no longer burdened by trying to decipher the meaning. As a result I am now getting to know the character and personality of each of the students, and enjoying their interaction with the Master. This is something I was never able to do before with other translations. Reading the Analects is no longer a chore but an enjoyable journey to a distant, but accessible, culture."},{"Title":"The Analects of Confucius","review":"I enjoyed this book quite a bit. Granted, I haven't read other translations of the Analects, so my rating is for the book itself more than as a comparison to other translations.The fact that Confucius lived thousands of years ago is amazing to me ... the things he says apply to people throughout the ages, and they're full of wisdom. Having read the book, I find myself trying to be a bit more of a Confucian gentleman than I did before reading it. Confucius' teachings about humanity and being a gentleman span across the ages.I'm very glad I read this book. The only reason I didn't give the book 5 stars is because I can't compare it to other translations, and it seems a little improper to rate a translated book without comparing it to other translations. But I personally found Leys' lines to be easily understandable and interesting, even if I have no way of ascertaining their accuracy with the original text.**7/31/09 UPDATE** I was looking to buy a copy of the Analects for a friend when I came across my own review when trying to decide between versions ... which is a somewhat strange feeling! I'm still not an \\"expert\\", but having read several more Chinese classics in the meantime, including a few versions of the Analects, I thought I would update this review. I think the Leys translation is a very good introduction to the Analects for someone who is looking for a starting point in Confucian thought. The translation is a little bit loose but flows well in English, the introduction gives a good amount of context without going overboard, and the notes are nicely situated at the end to prevent clutter. This makes it a good version for the Confucius novice, a comment I mean in earnest and not a backhanded compliment. That said, I have yet to find a translation that surpasses Waley's in its rigor and thoroughness; the copious notes and detailed introduction are excellent as well. However, Waley is likely to be a little more difficult for the newcomer to Confucius and Confucianism ... so he might not be the best starting point. As always, different translations work best for different people. Read the first couple of pages of a few versions and you'll quickly have an idea of what suits you. No matter which version you end up with, the Analects is a wonderful work, worthy of the praise it receives!"},{"Title":"The Analects of Confucius","review":"The review above is uninformed. Even if he knows that the main Chinese phonetic system is called pinyin. If one reads the copious notes that back up the research in this translation, one would realize that every character is philologically proven. Whether by the lexicon Shuo Wen, the sea of words or other. This translation is the epitome of scholarly work. There is an unpresedented wealth of information in this book. There has been no one near the ability of Chichung Huang in understanding the ancient cannotations of Chinese characters. He has achieved a far more scholarly level in classical Chinese than any other Chinese scholar and translator that I have ever read. The amount of clear concise research proves it. His work is fluid, concise and true to the original exactly because the translator has the ability to be literal. His contemporaries are lacking in this regard. Ren does translate to mean humanity, as in the founding principles of humanity and rightiousness. Read the introduction please."},{"Title":"The Analects of Confucius","review":"As I bought this book as a gift for my daughter who cannot read Chinese, I compared this translation with the Chinese versions that I have. To understand the original analects fully, most Chinese books provides explanations and definitions. The author has done an excellent job in providing translations and explanations of the analects at the same time."},{"Title":"The Analects of Confucius","review":"This book is delightful, irritating, and utterly sui generis; the personality of its author is on every page. As a translation it is sometimes inspired--Leys has a knack for avoiding the very un-Chinese verbiage with which Lau and, sometimes, the generally superior Dawson clutter their lines. But it cannot be relied upon as a translation. In the first book the words \\"Rich but loving ritual\\" become \\"Rich but considerate.\\" Ritual (li) is one of the great themes of the Analects and it is either dishonest or shockingly clumsy to conceal its key presence in this important passage. At other times we descend from translation to mere paraphrase: \\"a state of a thousand chariots\\" becomes \\"a medium-sized state\\". I often found myself wishing that Leys had taken to heart Dawson's words: \\"I do feel that one should get as close to the original as possible....I do not think that it is entirely virtuous to produce a version which reads as if it were written at the end of the twentieth century.\\"The notes, to the degree that they comment on the text itself or on the translation choices, are illuminating only for someone who has read other translations and has something to compare them to. But what quickly becomes apparent is that, under the guise of a translation with notes, what we have here is something like an anthology. Borges, Pascal, Stendhal, C. S. Lewis, Marcus Aurelius, Nietzsche, even Pancho Villa and many others are given long and full quotes. Sometimes they shed light on the original. Sometimes there is only a tangential relationship; one gets the impression that Leys was simply reminded of something and decided to share it, as in a conversation. They are always very interesting: this is the delight of the book. It is as if a select dinner-party full of eccentrics and geniuses were having the Analects read aloud to them and invited to comment freely. Clearly we cannot recommend this version for someone new to Confucius! If you've never read Confucius before, you want to get into the China of the fifth century B.C. and stay there for a while, not constantly get pulled back into modern Europe. There is some danger that these quotes will shed too much of their own kind of \\"light\\" back onto the Analects--which is a very elliptical, minimal, suggestive text--and that the new reader's mind will come permanently to associate some of the ideas of, say, Pascal with those of Confucius. But if you are already familiar with Confucius (preferably through at least two or three other translations) and if you have a healthy interest in and knowledge of Western civilization, this book, taken for what it is, will be a delight.A couple of reviewers have commented on the anti-gay prejudice which comes up, I believe, twice in the notes. These passages really do vitiate the work. It is not only the prejudice itself; after all a good dish needs some spice and Leys is entitled to his opinion. But the whole issue is so obviously foreign to the Analects, the passages in which it comes up strike so discordant a note, that one wonders what they were doing here. And they are not, even in themselves, good or interesting: the ideas are banal and the tone verges on the mean-spirited. Leys constantly writes as if he were taking a friend into his confidence, and assumes that the intelligent friend will feel the same way he does. He gets away with this because his views are generally intelligent and because usually there is some fig-leaf of connection to the Analects to support it. But in these and a few other passages we are suddenly pulled up short by the realization that it is not wisdom but mere cantankerousness that we have on display. It is bad style, bad taste.I am giving this three stars because it is being sold as a translation of the Analects and that is what, as a translation, it deserves. As an anthology of quotes suggested by the Analects it might get five stars, with perhaps one taken out for the fault mentioned above.If you have never read Confucius and are looking for a good introductory translation, I recommend Raymond Dawson's."},{"Title":"The Analects of Confucius","review":"The importance of the historical use and misuse of the teaching of Confucius throughout the centuries in China can hardly be understated. While Confucian thought was on the outs with Communist intellectuals, others such as Lee Kwan Yew of Singapore point to Confucius' principles as the secret to the Asian economic tigers' success. Leys, the translator of this volume, notes that Chinese familiarity and historical misuse of Confucius prejudices many, but taken without these prejudices, Confucius is thoroughly modern in his application today.Confucius is known for being a great teacher, but it was politics and government that was his passion. Today, Confucius is a good source for leadership philosophy. Far from promoting authoritarian despotism, the teachings of Confucius point to a higher calling of leadership through service, character development, and self-abandonment - all sorely lacking in Chinese leadership today.To learn was Confucius' calling. He said he did not have much innate knowledge and studied literature and history to learn (6.27). The responsibility of learning was on the learner not the teacher: \\"I enlighten only the enthusiastic; I guide only the fervent. After I have lifted up one corner of a question, if the student cannot discover the other three, I do not repeat\\" (7.8). While that may sound harsh, Confucius practiced what he preached. \\"Put me in the company of any two people at random-they will invariably have something to teach me. I can take their qualities as a model and their defects as a warning\\" (7.22).Learning was to be put into practice; this showed integrity. The first verse of the Analects says, \\"To learn something new and then to put it into practice at the right time: is this not a joy?\\" (1.1). Again, \\"Learning is like a chase in which, as you fail to catch up, you fear to lose what you have already gained\\" (8.17). Here we see the high value of action resulting from learning and not only study. He valued doing what you say. \\"There was a time when I used to listen to what people said and trusted that they would act accordingly, but now I listen to what they say and watch what they do\\" (5.10). Doing what you say is the heart of personal integrity. \\"A gentleman would be ashamed should his deeds not match his words\\" (14.27).Learning was his way of improving himself in order to govern well. Three major themes surface in Confucius' teaching regarding those who govern: be a gentleman, keep the rites and maintain your humanity. A gentleman was a moral superior, someone worthy of leading. A person becomes a gentleman not through birthright but through learning and right actions. These actions are called ritual, which is similar to courteous behavior, and maintaining humanity which is treating people with respect, dignity, fairness, justice and generosity to name a few of the qualities that Confucius praises. Ritual and humanity develop character in a person, and a person with character is the one whom Confucius calls a gentleman.Confucius and his contemporary political and intellectual leaders wanted to make a name for themselves. In a way, they could live on through that reputation. \\"The Master said: \`A gentleman worries lest he might disappear from this world without having made a name for himself'\\" (15.20). However, in making a name a leader must not do evil or act without virtue.Official position was an obvious choice for ruling and making a name. Today, position is the most highly regarded form of authority all over Asia. Hear Confucius: \\"Do not worry if you are without a position; worry lest you do not deserve a position\\" (4.14). Again, \\"It is not your obscurity that should distress you, but your incompetence\\" (14.30). This is a powerful lesson for Chinese leaders to hear. Today too much emphasis is placed on leadership position, and not enough placed on competence and character. The results are personal empires, corruption, and incompetence that oppress those without power (position). \\"Before he gets his position, his only fear is that he might not get it, and once he gets it, his only fear is that he might lose it. And when he fears to lose it, he becomes capable of anything\\" (17.15).The wisdom available to contemporary readers goes on and on. I found this book extremely helpful for finding ancient Chinese cultural leadership principles that back up the principles of transformational leadership theory and servant leadership theory. I would like to read and reflect deeper to find Confucian principles that are not yet apart of contemporary models of leadership, but are consistent with it. This is a deeper task.Recently I have begun quoting Confucius during my leadership seminars. Although, a feel a bit dubious doing so - proof texting largely Western leadership principles with Confucius - the reaction from the participants has been enthusiastic. While many leaders are attracted to Western leadership theories, many also feel these theories are foreign. Many theories based on egalitarian social structure are foreign and are not appropriate for most cultures in Asia. However, some theories, working inside hierarchical social structures, are helpful but still smack of American \\"one, two, three\\" optimism. We are sometimes too brash and not mysterious enough, too left brained, in our presentations. Confucius has helped my audiences to embrace the principles I try to get across.I was surprised how readable, useful and contemporary the writing of Confucius is to me as a leadership consultant. He had a good grasp of humankind, and set the bar very high regarding how leaders should govern from character and justice. He encouraged people to higher traits of humanity, that if followed would make the world a much better place. We would do well to study and apply the teachings of Confucius."},{"Title":"The Analects of Confucius","review":"Confucius was born in approximately 551 B.C. Considered by many as a master; he was a teacher and political advisor in pre-imperial China. He lived in a time of transition. He saw his world sinking into violent behavior and barbarity. Confucius believed that he was chosen by Heaven to become the spiritual heir to the Duke of Zhou who had established a universal feudal order five hundred years before him, unifying the civilized world. In addition to his interest in politics, Confucius was also skilled at outdoor activities, such as handling horses and archery and was fond of hunting and fishing. While he is best known as a teacher, Confucius' true occupation was politics. He advised government officials on foreign affairs, diplomacy, finances, administration, and defense.In his introduction to the book, Simon Leys writes, \\"The Analects is the only place where we can actually encounter the real, living Confucius. In this sense, the Analects is to Confucius what the Gospels are to Jesus.\\" Confucius promoted humanist ethics and the universal brotherhood of man, inspiring many nations. Chinese emperors have promoted the official cult of Confucius for more than two thousand years. It became a sort of state religion. The Analects became the spiritual foundation of the Chinese world. This classic book gives the reader an understanding and appreciation of a philosophy that has survived throughout the ages and is just as pertinent today as it was when it was written.The word analects is defined as a collection of excerpts from a literary work. The Analects of Confucius are a collage of short dialogues, anecdotes and brief statements, mostly attributed to Confucius. Some of the statements are attributed to his disciples or rulers of the time. They were compiled around 400 B.C., about seventy years after Confucius' death, by two consecutive generations of his disciples and became what is considered the teachings of Confucius. The general intent of the text is to aid the reader in self-improvement so that the one might become a moral example for others. One might find the proper way to live and behave by practicing various virtues, thereby becoming a humane person or a gentleman. Confucius says that humanity is an accomplishment; one is not born humane, but one must learn to become so. Another definition of humanity is to love others. The practice of ritual action is the best way to express one's human kindness. Ritual action is not limited to state and religious functions, but covers the spectrum of human behavior. The book is organized into two parts. The first part contains the quotes of Confucius and others. The second part contains notes written by Simon Leys that explain words and concepts presented.Perhaps the true strengths of The Analects of Confucius are evident in the examination of the Confucian themes. The ideas of ethical behavior, moral conviction, self-improvement through education have stood the test of time and are evident in many other religions. As one reads the dialogues and anecdotes of this master, one gets the impression that he is speaking about the very problems of our day. The Analects are intended for an audience seeking, what Confucius called, \\"the supreme virtue of humanity.\\" In that sense, the book is intended for all of us.Walter S. Zapotoczny Jr.Freelance WriterAuthor ofFor the Fatherland"},{"Title":"The Analects of Confucius","review":"Compared with other translations of Confucius this one suffers from a singular handicap. The syntax of the English translation is simply not English. I assume that it attempts to mimic the Chinese syntax, but the effect is to render most of the passages nearly unreadable for an English speaking reader. Unless you need to have the original Chinese on hand, this book is inferior to most of the others I have read."},{"Title":"The Analects of Confucius","review":"Those who complain about this translation being \\"uninspired\\" are missing the forest for the trees. Ley's rendition of the Analects is a modern, useful, and enjoyable read. The translation flows well and makes sense, and the authors comments are interesting and avoid being scholarly tripe.Confucius himself would agree that the purpose of his teaching was not to inspire linguistic debate, but to lead the recipient to right action. This book does the latter and avoids the former, and thereby gets my unqualified recommendation. No matter your religious leanings, if you read this book and put it into practice, you'll grow into a more *human* person. As this was the Masters entire point, I'd say this translation is a success."},{"Title":"The Analects of Confucius","review":"For reasons that are hard to fathom, this translation of the Analects of Confucius has gotten a lot of good press. In actuality, it is uninspired and derivative. Furthermore, the translator's notes show a cursory knowledge of the secondary literature, and a fairly banal understanding of the text itself.And isn't it a little precious to be writing a translation under a pseudonym?Other (equally good or better) translations of this work include those by D.C. Lau (Penguin Books), Arthur Waley (Vintage Books), and James Legge (Dover Books)."},{"Title":"Berlitz Basic German: The Unique, Simple, and Successful Approach to Language Learning/Book and 3 Cassettes (Berlitz Basic Language Course)","review":"I really liked how fast it shipped. I would def. buy from this user again."},{"Title":"Mary and O'Neil","review":"This is the Cronin's debut, but it feels like a classic from the first page. Readers meet the title couple, Mary and O'Neil, in a series of stories which chronicle episodes from their lives, and can be read as a novel or as a collection of short pieces. The real satisfaction is Cronin's exquisite prose: his stories find their power in the subtle revelations of the characters' emotional lives. There are passages on almost every page that had me in awe of this man's talent, and I was most pleasantly surprised by the overwhelming sense of discovery I felt with this book--remember the first time you found an author who immediately became a favorite, whose writing you savored, and whom you couldn't wait to share with all your friends? As I read Mary and O'Neil, I was reminded of the feeling I had when I first found the works of J.D. Salinger, and later, Anne Tyler and John Updike...think back to discovering your own favorites and that excitement that you felt as you turned every page, knowing that you'd found something important, not just to you, but in the larger scheme of things. If Mary and O'Neil is any indication, Justin Cronin is destined for greatness. This first collection/novel is among the most promising debuts I've seen in years."},{"Title":"Mary and O'Neil","review":"Ordinarily, I hate books of the &quot;Novel in Stories&quot; variety. I usually find them to be a confused jumble of pieces without any elastic to hold them together. I admit that I had low expectations of this work when I started it due to this prejudice. What a pleasant surprise!Other reviewers have mentioned the beauty of the prose, so I will skip a description of it. Suffice to say that it is not only beautiful, but clever. If you happen to be a writer, you will find yourself WISHING that you could condense the essence of being into phrases like Cronin's. The weaving of the stories is extraordinary: how many times have you read about a character and wondered what his/her parents were like, or what his wife was like before she entered the plot at their first meeting? Here you get that depth of information, not only through the strength of the writing but also through the structure and selection of the moments Cronin chooses to reveal. I'm not sure when the last time a book moved me to tears was, but this was one that did."},{"Title":"Mary and O'Neil","review":"Mary and O'Neil was certainly a surprise for me. I thought it would be a nice collection of connected short stories, but it is so much more than that. The stories work more like a novel than a collection and Cronin has done marvelous things with these stories. They follow two people, O'Neil, who is nineteen when we first meet him, and Mary, the woman he eventually marries. Each story us about an emotionally pivotal experience that has ramifications for the rest of their lives, ramifications which surface in each of the following stories. The stories are wonderfully written and affecting. Each story could have been the springboard for a fully developed novel. Cronin fits so much in these stories in a terrifically effortless and smooth manner. I highly recommend this one."},{"Title":"Mary and O'Neil","review":"Cronin, on the LaSalle faculty page, describes himself as an \\"unrepentant Realist with a sentimental streak.\\" I think Cronin knows himself very well, because that's Mary and O'Neil in a nutshell, and the book's high points and low points corollate highly with these two rather divergent characteristics.There was much I admired and loved about this book. Cronin's language is exquisite, his descriptive powers incredible, and the strongest part of this book may be his intelligent choice of scenes. For example, there's the story about Mary's pregnancy, and it ends right before she tells her husband, and it couldn't have been more perfect. This was the exact place where the scene (and the story) should have ended, and Cronin nailed it. He does this again and again, and for this alone this book is worth a second reading.What weakens M&O; is Cronin's sentimental streak. When I read the end of \\"Orphans,\\" the second story, I asked myself how I'd suddenly stepped into a Julia Roberts movie. This unfortunately happens on more than one occasion, but hey, I knew this going in, so you might brace yourself for some unmitigated sappiness if that isn't your cup of tea.Although this book is labeled a \\"Novel in Stories,\\" it reads more like a novel than an \\"arc\\" of short stories, like Denis Johnson's \\"Jesus's Son\\" or Tim O'Brien's \\"The Things They Carried.\\" The plotting and the relationship between stories is way tighter than those two works.I enjoyed the first one the most, \\"The Last of the Leaves.\\" It is perfection."},{"Title":"Mary and O'Neil","review":"I bought this book based Washington Post book review (something I've never done before) and it was worth every penny--even in hardback!You will recognize the characters in this book--they are Every-people. The first three stories are especially good, especially if you like a writer who shows rather than tells. He has captured the fine details of living with such precision; I admire his skill. As a critique, the middle story and the last story seemed like a bit of missed opportunity but don't let that scare you away. If nothing else buy it to see how this man captures the essence of childbirth--WOW!

Even when I sensed that things wouldn't happen as I had hoped, I couldn't stop, even briefly. These are people you will come to care for and wish you knew.

I think you could go around and around again in this book."},{"Title":"Mary and O'Neil","review":"I heard J. Cronin speak at Univ of Iowa in the summer of 2001, when this book had just come out. How I wish I'd bought this book then to add to my signed first edition collection. I only recently purchased it and just finished it last night. It's a book to read in a quiet spot, to savor, to melt into as Cronin carries you very gently through three generations of O'Neil's family.The book is written as a series of short stories; each can be read without benefit of the others, but together, they prove the statement that, sometimes, the whole is greater than the sum of its parts.Very beautifully constructed. Not a book I'm likely to forget anytime soon. Thanks to Justin Cronin for writing about the simple, everyday lives of rather ordinary people with such finely-crafted elegance."},{"Title":"Mary and O'Neil","review":"I bought this books months ago and it sat on a shelf for far too long. How could I have let a gem like this remain unread for such a long time?The first story, \\"Last of the Leaves\\" grabbed my heart and did not let go. It was so exquisitely rendered -- powerful yet tender at the same time...a wonderful story of love.The rest of the book follows Mary and O'Neil through the their separate and together lives and those of some family members. Each story/chapter both illuminates, and revolves around, a defining moment of their lives. Death, illness, birth are all explored and written of with such lovely prose, each word seemingly polished to perfection.Without using a lot of description, Cronin somehow manages to thoroughly familiarize the reader with his characters and their lives.A book to remember."},{"Title":"Mary and O'Neil","review":"After reading \\"The Summer Guest\\" by Justin Cronin I couldn't wait to read something else by this wonderful author. That's when I bought \\"Mary and O'Neill\\". His first novel, \\"Mary and O'Neill\\" is just as enjoyable as \\"The Summer Guest\\", if in a somewhat different way. Don't let the fact that this is a novel in short store put you off. Even if you don't usually enjoy this type of book (and I don't) you will be glad you read \\"Mary and O'Neill\\". I cannot wait to see what else Mr. Cronin has in store for us. Believe the excellent reader reviews and buy this book!"},{"Title":"Mary and O'Neil","review":"While I have known Justin personally for several years [disclaimer], this is actually the first time I have experienced his writing in depth. I also tend to gravitate more toward escapist writing and don't seek out &quot;realistic&quot; fiction dealing with contemporary characters and situations, so I wasn't sure how I'd react to this book. I have to say that I found myself thoroughly immersed in the book. The characters are drawn in such a way that they seem vivid and familiar throughout the stories. The stories are told with a graceful and casual ease--as though they were being related to us through conversations with the characters (though the book is all in third person). As important as the characters themselves are the webs of relationships--primarily familial--in which they are enmeshed. I think this aspect of the book is its greatest success, revealing that the title characters, while seeming adrift, are held up (and sometimes back) by these webs of relationships. This book is an excellent collection of stories about loss, love and family. The prose sparkles throughout. Read and enjoy!"},{"Title":"Mary and O'Neil","review":"Having just discover Cronin through The Passage and Mary & O'Neil, I feel like I have discovered a treasure.

I read this after reading Justin Cronin's bestseller \\" The Passage.\\" The two books could not be more different, yet they share Cronin's really wonderful writing. I'd highly recommend both books."},{"Title":"Mary and O'Neil","review":"Justin's Cronin's first novel is broken up into a collection of eight short stories about the love between parents, siblings, children and lovers.The book doesn't begin with the title characters, but rather with O'Neil's parents, Arthur and Miriam. The entirety of the book is balanced on the early revelation of the sweet complexity of their love in life and death. Their death in the first story sets the tone for the rest of the stories, providing their children with both answers and more questions about love and loss.Mary and O'Neil's love affair is one brought about by just these questions. Mary lives with the ghost of a child she aborted early on in the book, while O'Neil's parents live in his memory with such vitality that he actually tries to call them after the birth of his first child--only to unexpectedly have a sad and beautiful conversation with a lonely stranger. Cronin creates Mary and O'Neil as the answers to each other's questions. Even the names that Cronin picks for them overflow with a sense of completeness: \\"Mary\\" and \\"O'Neil,\\" sound more like a first name and surname than two separate characters.The surname as name only makes more sense when one considers O'Neil's presence in the book as father figure. It is O'Neil who develops as a source of strength for several characters in the book, anointing him the ultimate patriarch of this novel. Cronin is poetic and beautifully subtle when he baptizes O'Neil's relationship with the woman who completes him and gives him a first name. The baptism is complete when Mary is ready to walk down the aisle and it begins to rain. O'Neil looks at her and all the guests at their wedding and, Cronin writes, \\"in his heart he marries each one of them.\\"Cronin's style is delicate and full of purpose, just like all of the relationships between his characters. It is hard not to relate to this book in some way if you've ever loved someone, harder still to not find Cronin's prose captivating in its wisdom and sincerity."},{"Title":"Mary and O'Neil","review":"Mary and O'neil was so poignant with paragraphs I read and re-read numerous times because they struck a chord of something lost yet familiar to me.

I would put it down and not read it for days on end because I didn't want it to end."},{"Title":"Mary and O'Neil","review":"I'm normally not a fan of short-stories turned to novels, but this book works surprisingly well. It's really more of an episodic novel, because in reality, most of these taleswould not be as meaningful if not strung together. Interesting, fate-infused stories about very average happenings...birth, death, illness, family life, weddings...told with subtly and a complete lack of preciousness. I can't wait to read his next work!"},{"Title":"Mary and O'Neil","review":"I usually read non-fiction, but I was taken by this small, but mighty novel.

The writing was a pure joy and I look forward to future work by this younger author."},{"Title":"Mary and O'Neil","review":"I think this book should have been named Kay and O'neil.

I did not regret reading it, and I did not have to force myself to finish it. It was a good easy read, not too complex."},{"Title":"Mary and O'Neil","review":"A story about ordinary people and their lives, loves and losses.

Despite the title, the relationship between the title characters is not fleshed out very well. We don't see them meet, nor spend much time together. But there are two sections about their getting pregnant, and going into labor. Most of the time, there's an emotional distancing between the narrator and the story, I felt. The relationship between O'Neil and his parents was handled very well, and was the strongest part of the book, for me. Cronin has an impressive understanding of what it's like to be a parent facing the empty nest stage (which I am just beginning to experience). There is emotional truth here without sentimentality. I hope he comes back to writing serious fiction once he's made a bunch of money selling Stephen King knock-offs. He's a great writer.

The first book of his I read, \\"The Summer Guest,\\" moved me deeply. He writes in prose that dances across the page, offering luminous and often breathtaking sentences. His understanding of the human heart seems well beyond his years. Now I've read this work and know he's a writer who seems to write for me. His epiphanies come in surprisingly subtle ways, like jewels just discovered. I am not going to summarize any of the book because others have done it better than I can. All I can say is get any of his books and settle in for a journey that's full of life as we live it, and full of what makes life meaningful. He stands beside some of the wonderful discoveries I've made in my reading life, the ones who still awe me with their writing and understanding: Herman Hesse, J.D. Salinger, Kurt Vonnegut, Saul Bellow, Tolkien, and John Updike's short stories. Yes, I think he's that good."},{"Title":"Mary and O'Neil","review":"Justin Cronin understands human emotion about as well as it can be understood, and he has an uncanny way of reducing it to its essence.

There are few authors writing today who so honestly handle their characters. The prose is, to use that overused term, illuminating. But it is a prose that serves only to lead the characters' direction, never to blind the reader with its wattage.This book is so phenomenal that I bought a copy for all of my upper-division English students at the college where I teach. Since then, students have come to me of both sexes, shy and proud, to tell me how they raced through this book, ravished.

Just a lovely little book, highly recommended."},{"Title":"Mary and O'Neil","review":"When I spied this book on the library shelf of new fiction I was amazed at the title as my given name is Mary O'Neil! The cover promised a good read and it certainly did not disapppoint. Sometimes when into a book one says that true life is never like that - however, the deaths of the parents in the first chapter and the subsequent death of O'Neil's sister are entirely plausible having known of a family that has endured such tragedy. Cronin writes so realistically that one wanted the book to never end. Hope others enjoy it as much as I did!"},{"Title":"Mary and O'Neil","review":"\\"Mary and O'Neil\\" was the debut book for Justin Cronin in 2001. It subsequently won him the PEN/Hemmingway Award and also the Stephen Crane Prize in literature. The book is 243 pages in length.I purchased this book because I'd just finished Cronin's latest effort, \\"The Passage\\", and was so impressed by its quality I want to try other books he'd written.\\"Mary and O'Neil\\" is basically a book containing 8 short stories mainly about the people mentioned in title, plus, and to a somewhat lesser degree, their surrounding families and friends . Chronologically, the book covers 8 distinct periods between the year 1976 and 2000. And although there are gaps (in years) between each chapter, they are all connected in important ways. We first meet O'Neil at age nineteen (as well as his family) in the first segment and finish with him as a 40 year old husband (to Mary), teacher and father in the last chapter.What is it about this book that is so wonderful? First, Cronin displays a magical touch for his descriptive passages of nature. One can almost see the beautiful snowy nights or the autumn leaves and yet this is the least of his writing attributes...where he really shines is in his ability to describe and give the reader a real feeling of human emotion when it is under duress and is extremely vulnerable.As well as happy moments, there were moments in this book of subtle sadness and other areas of poignant clarity...things that it made me reminisce to some of my adolescent and early adulthood days. For all that this book has going for it, I believe its greatest asset is its ability to make the reader reflect back to their own era when they were growing up and maturing, often giving them some new insight into things and events in earlier times that they may have been forgotten...tucked away in some recess of their mind. I was surprise how often that some of the things that occurred in this story, made me think of my own days gone by. Frequently with a very eye opening and sobering effect.Conclusion:A beautiful love story, but more than that...a glimpse into lives that very well may allow you the privilege of reflecting on your own. Easily 5 Stars.Ray Nicholson"},{"Title":"Mary and O'Neil","review":"This is one of the best books I've read in years.

Thank you for this very special gift."},{"Title":"Mary and O'Neil","review":"This novel uses eight linked stories of different length and from different perspectives to bring to life the characters of Mary and O'Neil. The stories, focussed on particular events in their lives, are dated so that we can follow the chronology of the events that have shaped the characters of Mary and O'Neil.Most powerful of the stories, for me, was the opening story entitled \`Last of the Leaves'. The central characters in this story are O'Neil's parents, Arthur and Miriam. The story opens in November 1979, with Arthur's premonition of death, on a day in which he and Miriam are travelling to visit O'Neil at college. While they are preparing for this trip we learn that each has secrets, and what these secrets are. We learn too that individual secrets can be put aside or forgotten in the shared joy of seeing O'Neil happy. This visit has a tragic aftermath which influences the balance of the novel without overshadowing the events yet to unfold.I enjoyed this novel with its bittersweet observations of different life events, both joyous and tragic. In fewer than 300 pages, Mr Cronin creates likeable and human characters whose experiences both as individuals and as members of family units will be recognisable to so many readers.With fewer than 300 pages, this is a comparatively quick read. Quick, but not necessarily easy. This is the first of Mr Cronin's novels I have read, and I am looking forward to reading the others.Jennifer Cameron-Smith"},{"Title":"Mary and O'Neil","review":"I read this book after finishing (right after!) The Summer Guest, also by Cronin. I loved both books. THe story line in each is poignant and moving and the characterizations are fleshed out brilliantly - with depth, eloquence and humor. The beauty of Cronin's writing is in his seemingly effortless ability to turn a phrase that just sings with its purity. He is able to capture, and describe emotions and events like no other author I've encountered in recent years. This is a lovely if odd story that jumps through the decades with poignant prose, the building of relationships, and the pain of loss. In reading Cronin's work you are left with a mystical and magical feeling. I did not want this book to be over as the emotions it evoked were much more powerful than those we typically feel in everyday life (unless you are 13).

Cronin reveals each dilemma with such subtlety and depth, each conversation, each interior thought, that you know these people are your own brother, mother, girlfriend or son.On a par with Marilynne Robinson and Wallace Stegner. Worth reading more than once."},{"Title":"Mary and O'Neil","review":"I was fortunate enough to have Justin Cronin as a professor during my tenure at LaSalle University, and so when I heard that this text was going to be published, I jumped at the chance to read it. Needless to say, from the moment I started, I couldn't put the book down for so much as even a second. The character development is simply enchanting, and the plot kept my attention from its onset. The text truly illustrated the power that love has in that it can truly transcend all things both good and bad. It's a story full of warmth, love, suspense, and even tragedy. I have already recommended the text to some of my own students, and I definitely feel that this is worth the read. I'm grateful that I had the chance to examine the work, and it makes it all the more meaningful since he is one of the many reasons that I decided to become a teacher."},{"Title":"Mary and O'Neil","review":"Justin Cronin's book is nothing short of breathtaking. All of the characters are deeply imagined; they are loveable and flawed people -- real people -- and Cronin portrays their moments of quiet heroism with great compassion. The letter Arthur must write to his almost-mistress Dora, Kay's decision to accept her husband's philandering, O'Neil's unwavering loyalty to his dying sister: each story illuminates an important choice in a character's life. And the prose is just beautiful. The book is filled with great lines you'll want to underline. I loved this book, plain and simple. This is a writer to watch."},{"Title":"Mary and O'Neil","review":"While waiting for the release of \\"The Passage\\" I decided to download Justin Cronin's \\"Mary and O'Neil\\" and \\"The Summer Guest.\\" I have just finished the former and consider it one of the finest novels of loss and longing ever written.Perhaps we are meant to read certain novels at certain periods in our lives and for anyone who has suffered the loss of a loved one this novel will resonate to the very core of their being. I read the book in two days and was transported to another world. I know Mr. Cronin's next two novels will not disappoint.I finished this book while waiting for a doctor's appointment and people in the waiting room began to glance at me while tears were falling on my Kindle - No tear-soaked pages anymore, I'm afraid. Being a Houstonian with ties to Rice University but never having heard of Mr. Cronin before all the hype on \\"The Passage\\" began, I am so happy that he is receiving so many well-deserved accolades."},{"Title":"Mary and O'Neil","review":"Just finished reading Mary and O'Neil, and I know that it will stay with me for a long time. I laughed and cried, sighed and nodded my head as I read. This a very well crafted novel comprised of short stories, reminding me of the chapters of our lives. The relationships between parents and children, siblings, spouses and friends are realistically portrayed. Thanks to the author for a special experience. I look forward to reading his novel, The Summer Guest soon."},{"Title":"Mary and O'Neil","review":"This guy is amazing.

It is so inspirational! If you just want to enjoy a book with a cup of tea, I recommend the Business of Bliss. If you are serious about starting up a small business, I recommend the Business of Bliss. Hearst Publishing truly is the number one source for empowing the smallest of business women and bringing them to the reader. If they can do it, so can I.

While I agree with the reviewer who said that it is &quot;all style-no substance&quot;, I didn't have the impression that it was going to be a substantive guide to starting and running a business, so I didn't consider this a fault.

Buttons, pastries, and country inns are all shared with the same enthusiasm. This book is absolutely full of good ideas if you would like to start a business but need some creative suggestions. The business owners share their experiences honestly and tell both the good and the bad. Mixed in with the feel-good stories are bits and pieces of business advice. Although the advice is valid, it's not extensive, and is generally over-simplified. The authors attempt to cover the area of promotion in 24 sentences. The book's primary thrust is the stories of those who have succeeded making a business from their creative talents. They share a number of wonderful stories that do a find job of making the reader feel good as well as providing motivation. If you need inspiration or ideas on what sort of creative business to start, this book is a very good resource. It's a fast read in an easy-to-follow format mixed with many beautiful photographs.

It's gorgeous, and a pleasure to hold. It's thick, glossy pages are filled with beautiful and insipirational photographs of women, their products and businesses.The tales of real life women entrepreneurs who have founded their businesses out of their passions, from antique shops to restaurants and many others, were refreshing and insiprational. The book is also lightly peppered with helpful information on starting your own 'business of bliss'. But turn to this book for stories that will inspire you - not a 'how-to' manual. A delightful read!"},{"Title":"The Business of Bliss: How To Profit From Doing What You Love","review":"It's true there isn't a lot of info in this book on the nuts and bolts of running a business; however, that's not what this book is about. Filled with many photos of beautiful craft-y shops and products, it instead helps provide real-life stories from people who were successful in making money doing what they love even though most of them knew little about running a business when they started. After buying this book a year or more ago, I started my own craft business and it was profitable the very first month! Now I can work with no bosses telling me what to do and even have my husband at home working with me now (which I love). I was just rereading the book tonight and still love it just as much as I did the first time I read it. It's a keeper."},{"Title":"The Business of Bliss: How To Profit From Doing What You Love","review":"Full of beautiful photos and examples of female entrepreneurs who followed their dreams; this book could be just the catalyst for someone in a rut to change their life.Particularly refreshing is that this is not by any means a &quot;how to get rich book&quot;, but it is full of success stories, some greater than others. Just look at the juxtaposition of Rachel Ashwell of Shabby Chic alongside Beth Siqueland-Gresch owner of a floral design shop. Ashwell started her business by repainting garage sale finds and is now a millionairess, and Gresch does a modest business and her words are, &quot;This kind of business will never make me wealthy. It's more about finding a way to do what you love, and making a sustainable income doing it.&quot;Not a business plan, not a how-to book, but full of ispiration from women who listened to their hearts, and made it work."},{"Title":"The Business of Bliss: How To Profit From Doing What You Love","review":"A pretty picture book, with very little in the way of actual business advice.

The old saying is definitely true -- you'll never succeed if you never try! These women tried -- and, with hard work, some set-backs, and plenty of determination -- they each turned their dreams into realities. I would classify this as a \\"feel-good\\" book ... although specific 'how-to' details aren't necessarily included (there are some hints/ideas), your imagination and own creativity are sparked as you read through the pages -- sparked in such a way that you can see yourself starting down the path of following your own dreams."},{"Title":"The Business of Bliss: How To Profit From Doing What You Love","review":"I bought this book about a year ago and just thought I would flip through it for inspiration . . .boy, was I wrong.

Great for any Broadway fan."},{"Title":"Singing: The Mechanism and the Technic","review":"Mr. Vennard was the head of the voice department at USC. His book is fascinating reading for singers interested in understanding their vocal instruments, but it is essential study for voice teachers.Voice teachers necessarily employ metaphor in teaching because so much of the human voice is controlled unconsciously. But such metaphors should be grounded in the facts of reality - in the known sciences that apply to vocal production. For instance, when a teacher tells a student, \`don't swallow your tone', and is met only with a look of blank stupor, that teacher needs to be able to start talking facts instead of fantasy.Mr. Vennard demystifies the metaphors. He systematically anchors the art of the teacher to the known sciences of tone, timbre and resonance, and especially to the physiognomy of the larynx, the breathing muscles, and the upper respiratory tract. After covering the basics, he includes extensive discussions of vowel and consonant production, as well as a number of important vocal exercises. He closes with a brief discussion of the technique of messa di voce. I say it is brief, but it is really the ultimate subject of the entire book.Messa di voce is an ancient vocal exercise done on one note and on one breath: a long crescendo followed by a long diminuendo. But this simple exercise involves a fantastically complex coordination of muscles, and, while the student need not understand more than a tenth of the science behind it, his teacher should understand as much as possible.Many teachers of singing, and perhaps most of them, do not feel the need for such tools as are available in Mr. Vennard's book, but I believe the best teachers do."},{"Title":"Singing: The Mechanism and the Technic","review":"This book demystifies the art of singing. You'll understand how centuries of well-meaning but unscientific voice teachers have confused students to this day. Get the facts now. All your questions answered. This book helped me smooth out four octaves with no break! Diagrams and throat photos are great. This book is indespensible for any voice coach or instructor or student."},{"Title":"Singing: The Mechanism and the Technic","review":"The title is misspelled here, it is Technic - not Technical.Despite all the voice-teaching publications since 1967, this remains the clearest, the most common-sense, and the best learning-to-teach-voice toolbesides the actual experience of teaching. No other publication on the voice even comes close."},{"Title":"Singing: The Mechanism and the Technic","review":"This book remains one of THE fundamental must-reads for all serious vocalists. Read it slowly and fully absorb it-even if you have to read it again and again."},{"Title":"Singing: The Mechanism and the Technic","review":"Since I have been doing extensive research on the voice lately, I have found that most authorities often mention this book. Vennard's widely-respected compendium will prove to be useful for every singer, beginner or full-fledged."},{"Title":"Singing: The Mechanism and the Technic","review":"Somehow in all my studies I had missed this textbook from the 1940's, revised in the 1960's. But some things never change. I learned new and exciting techniques I could really use from the very first chapter. In fact, I have quoted this book often (too often, according to some of the members of the choral group I direct).This past Sunday, my group gave the performance of a lifetime, due in no small part to applying only one of the techniques I gleaned from this book.It is a long and technical read (well, it IS a textbook), and I'm still only halfway through it after about two months of study, but my group's sound (resonance, timbre, clarity) has exploded exponentially!Buy this book. Read it, absorb it, share it with your singers. You'll be glad you did (and so will they)."},{"Title":"Singing: The Mechanism and the Technic","review":"A little too much mechanism and not enough technic. Very informative, if you're a biology major, but doesn't really tell you enought about how to sing. He gets into every conceiveable muscle and ligament in the mechanism - after awhile you can't keep track of it all. Having said all that, I do recommend it, because it does give you a great foundation in how the voice works; you just have to wade through it. It just wasn't what I was looking for, but I found it useful and sometimes fascinating. I just don't think a singer or teacher needs to know quite this much bio, but it's good to know some of it."},{"Title":"Singing: The Mechanism and the Technic","review":"This is an amazing resource on the science of singing. I've read many books on singing and they all seem to draw on this book for a lot of their information. It is a little wordy, however, and outdated as it refers to the reader, the student, the teacher, and any human as \\"he.\\" I feel that the publisher should make another additon to remove this language and update the photos and it would be much better. This book reads a bit like a text book but it will teach you most of what you need to know to sing properly - I defnitely recommend it!"},{"Title":"Sister Clare","review":"Although \\"SISTER CLARE\\" by Loretta Burrough is a novel, it tells a wonderful story about life as a Carmelite nun in the years before Vatican II. The author of this 176-page hard bound book (still in its original dust jacket) states \\"....... for every nun (who) leaps over the wall, there are others who find fulfillment and happiness within the cloister. To some sunny and tranquil natures, fulfillment comes quite easily; others must fight for it ....... And, it is among these others ~~ eager, loving and always prone to rebellion ~~ that leaders are usually found ....\\" \\"SISTER CLARE\\" is the story of such a nun. The reader meets her first as Jean ~~ a 16 year old postulant who has fought her way into the Carmelite Monastery over her parents' objections and in spite of serious doubts on the part of the Superiors. Humility does not come easily to Jean, nor will it ever. Pride is almost her undoing. As Sister Clare, she discovers that holy nuns and even holy Prioresses are only human. In \\"SISTER CLARE\\", the author takes us inside the cloister and shows the reader the mystery of life as a contemplative, cloistered nun. We learn about many Carmelite customs (such as, referring to each other as \\"Your Charity\\" and of some of the traditions surrounding Christmas celebrations in Carmel). We learn many things about the beauty of ritual amid poverty and material harshness. Among the nuns who walk in these pages, we meet kindhearted Malachy, who could never learn rubrics; Mary Agnes, whose only flaw was her pounderous fruitcake; Joachim, who was afraid of thunder; and, Rosaria, who was afraid of nothing. \\"SISTER CLARE\\" is a wonderful read ~~ through it the reader discovers that, although a Carmelite's purpose is earnest and deep, she does not leave either her wit or her joy in life at the convent door."},{"Title":"Basic Self-Knowledge","review":"This book is a good introduction to the basic terminology of the Fourth Way tradition. What is most essential to understand is the irreplacable and unavoidable necessity of objective self-observation; the ability to see ourselves as we really are, not as we THINK we are. Unfortunately, self-observation and self-remembering are grossly misunderstood these days and the Fourth Way is rapidly degenerating; but this text can be helpful for the serious student who is willing to genuinely seek self-knowledge, not mere book knowledge. We must be on guard moment to moment, in clear observation of the mind, the false sense of self, and be remembering ourselves, our consciousness, by being fully present, rather than being identified with thoughts, feelings and sensations. This text can help the reader understand what this means. For more information on how this is done, feel free to contact christianart@hotmail.com."},{"Title":"Basic Self-Knowledge","review":"That title sounds like some hippy, new-age mumbo jumbo in some ways. It's not. I'm a pragmatic guy, but this book is great. Reducing \\"self-talk\\", the static that keeps our minds in turmoil all day, every day, is a great way to reduce suffering that is associated with painful mind-states. Read this book. It's profound."},{"Title":"Basic Self-Knowledge","review":"For those on the path of Self discovery, this book will take you on a trip that will change your life even with a small degree of insight and understanding. We will see that we are not our Personality. It is only a character role we have taken on, a false identity for our ego and not who or what we think we are. To even consider that concept might take courage but it will be the first step toward liberation.There are 21 short chapters but very long on content and, while esoteric (i.e. belonging to the select few who have knowledge or interest), is written in a very clear, straightforward manner. The mirror is held up for a full, complete viewing. It is all visible if you choose to look with the open eyes. Enjoy the journey."},{"Title":"Basic Self-Knowledge","review":"This text is straight forward and easy to understand. It synthesises the work of Krishnamurti and Gurdjieff, towards the goal of consciousness and Presence in daily life. (Gurdjieff is considered to be an important contributor to core concepts of the Enneagram). The personality is seen to be the false self, a series of unconscious, automatic responses to the environment, and we are seen to identify with these responses, mistakenly considering them to be who we are, or as our \\"identity\\". The Work described in this book is directed towards providing conscious \\"shocks\\" to facilitate self-remembering and the conscious experience of Essence.I find this book to be useful in both my personal growth and also as a professional resource in my counselling practice."},{"Title":"Basic Self-Knowledge","review":"I found this book, along with others who have read and used it, to be a practical study manual that precipitated excercises that were remarkably revalatory. Truly, we are very much underutilizing our ability to view ourselves as a phenomenon and to reason and intuit from data thus discovered. The appendix on Eternality is the best treatment of the subject I've ever read, as it puts considerations about it on an actual cognizable footing."},{"Title":"Basic Self-Knowledge","review":"The reviews which I have read of this book on the internet so far are sadly missing the main point which Dorothy Phillpotts makes. Though speaking about self remembering and self observation as very important, when she relates how J. G. Bennett, her teacher at the time, came back from Paris after meeting Gurdjieff there, whom they had thought was dead, but was not, Bennett explained that what he had learned from Gurdjieff was a new way of working on oneself involving having a different relationship with one's body.This is not explained in detail in the book, but followers of Gurdjieff know what it is, and how important it is. This new approach made it possible to remember oneself and observe much longer than any of them had been able to do under Ouspensky or Bennett. Unfortunately for him, Ouspemsky had parted company with Gurdjieff before he understood this different approach."},{"Title":"Women in Russia, 1700-2000","review":"Engel tackles a vast subject. It sprawls across three centuries of turmoil and revolution. Plus it spans a vast geographic area and a multitude of ethnicities and religions.The care she has taken with this book starts in the very title, &quot;Women in Russia&quot;. It does not say &quot;Russian Women&quot;, for that can be taken to connote ethnic (Christian) Russian. Whereas she includes in her study Muslim women, Jewish women, the women of the Volga Germans, and Finnish women. Probably out of praticality, she omits discussion of the Russian Far East (Siberia), which has enclaves of Korean, Mongolian, Japanese and Chinese.The later chapters that deal with Communist rule may owe much of their detail to the fall of Communism, and the subsequent accessibility of many documents. This may have been further eased by these documents undoubtedly being seen as having no military value. Unlike say a history of Soviet rocketry or microbiology.I found the most interesting sections to be on the Communist period. They did put the first female astronaut (V. Tereshkova) into orbit, and proudly trumpeted this. But, as Engels makes clear, inside the Soviet Union, women were commonly relegated to traditional family rearing roles, not so different from the US at the time.A very commendable survey by Engel. One that an interested reader might then wish for her to write more detailed analyses of the various aspects she discusses here."},{"Title":"Women in Russia, 1700-2000","review":"Engel&iexcl;s history of women in Russia is a fascinating glimpse at an otherwise overlooked part of Russian history.

But if you are looking for specific in-depth how-to, this book isn't the answer. Each segment-work, dreams, travel-is short and doesn't address many relevant issues.For example, regarding the work chapter, the author postulates that there will be a work shortage and companies will hire baby boomers to fill the gap. Well, that is speculative with globalism. Those jobs may be outsourced. Most are low paying. Many of my highly qualified friends are unable to find jobs despite retraining. Yes, there may be Wal-Mart jobs but is this your retirement dream? The work chapter sounds a lot like most \\"Do what you love\\" books. But doing what you love is often best as a hobby not to furnish needed income. These and other issues facing boomers who want meaningful work into their 70s are not addressed.

The book focuses on the issues facing baby boomers in all facets of their lives, and particularly stresses educational and volunteering opportunities, employment after retirement, and longer life expectancy issues, which of course in turn leads to a discussion of financial planning.The book is generally good, although a lot of the subject matter is common knowledge (people are living longer, Social Security is in a financial pit, etc.), it does seamlessly blend the social and societal impacts of longer life with the financial issues involved. Although I don't agree with the authors on everything, their points are well taken and worth listening to.The book is very good at citing websites that contain much valuable information for people interested in business and retirement related lifestyle changes, and is especially strong with the theme of education. Chapter seven concerns financial planning and is a good, but very general overview. If you really want to understand this subject, you will need to buy a separate book. I also urge readers to be very cautious about the recommendations the authors make regarding annuities.I was born in late 1964, so demographically I get lumped in with the baby boom generation. The friend that gave me this book was also born in 1964, and while we both are technically baby boomers, we both identify far more with the succeeding generation. One of the detractors of this book (and indeed some other books that I have read by boomers) is an occasional smugness about being a boomer. I noted that tendency a couple of times early in the book, but I was pleased when near the end of the book the authors made the following statement during a discussion of volunteerism and legacy: \\"Unless you find ways to give something back and keep contributing in your later years, you will help cement our generation's reputation as a bunch of narcissists.\\" I was glad that the authors frankly acknowledged this perception, which while it is not applicable to all boomers of course, is widely held, especially by younger generations.This book is a good summary of some demographic trends in American (and world) population, notably the trend toward working in retirement. The book does offer some insight into the future, but offers no specific planning advice for an individual. The strength of this book is in the resources it points out, most of which are available on the Internet, and in getting the reader to think in unconventional ways about retirement. This book is an interesting place to start, but it must be viewed as just that: a starting point on the map to retirement."},{"Title":"The Power Years: A User's Guide to the Rest of Your Life (Thorndike Health, Home & Learning)","review":"All too often the thought of \\"retirement\\" brings to mind growing old, playing cards, and sitting around waiting to die. But it doesn't have to be that way, nor should it. In The Power Years: A User's Guide to the Rest of Your Life by Ken Dychtwald, Ph. D. and Daniel J. Kadlec, you'll see how you can actually look forward to this time of less responsibility and more time to enjoy life.Contents: Welcome to the Power Years; New Ways to Have Fun; Rediscovering and Forging Vital Relationships; Creating Your New Dream Job; Lifelong Learning Adventures; Where and How to Live; Achieving Financial Freedom; Leaving a Legacy; Author's Note; Notes; IndexDychtwald and Kadlec explore the time of your life between 55-ish and beyond, referred to as the \\"Power Years\\". The kids are out of the house, retirement is looming, and you no longer have the daily demands on your time and attention that you had in your 30s and 40s. Instead of looking at this time period as one of \\"checking out\\" and rocking on the porch, they advocate a complete mental shift. You can now explore parts of your personality and interests that were logistically difficult before. Maybe it's going back to school or taking a few classes in an area that interests you. It could be travel or house-swapping with someone else in order to see other parts of the country or world. It may even involve the continuation of your working efforts. But the thought is that you can either work at something else without the demands of advancement, or you can continue what you currently do because you have a passion for it. The key is being able to do something that you *want* to do, not that you *have* to do.Most of the approaches in the book work much better if you've been planning financially for your power years. If you get to 65 with nothing but Social Security, your options are limited to a degree. But that doesn't mean that you can't volunteer your time to a cause that sparks your interest, nor does it mean you can't start exploring relationships that you've not had time for in the past. In some cases it might be easier said than done, but it's still a choice. The best time to get ahold of this book would be when you're in your late 30s or early 40s, and you have time to plan for the future you want (instead of the future that just happens).I'll admit there were a few times I sorta wished I could fast-forward my life and get to the power years a bit sooner. But I'm much more encouraged now that my power years will be valuable and full, and not just marking time until the obituary gets written up..."},{"Title":"The Power Years: A User's Guide to the Rest of Your Life (Thorndike Health, Home & Learning)","review":"Yes, I'm one of those baby-boomers contemplating moving into the \\"third-age\\" - when the kids have left the nest, the mortgage is paid off, the college accounts have been funded, the husband is semi-retired, but I'm still working, contributing the max to the 401K, and starting to wonder \\"what next\\"? No more ladders to climb career-wise, finally the time to think about pursuing hobbies, traveling and the freedom to \\"re-invent\\" myself. But, as what? I still haven't figured that out, but I'm sure it will evolve over time. The answers weren't laid out in the book, however, it definitely gave food for thought, and it is a good starting place for those contemplating such a life passage.Much of the content of Dychtwald's book validated what I already knew about the \\"third-age\\" - we'll be living longer and healthier, we'll have new freedoms, we'll have clout in the marketplace (as members of the largest population bubble - the boomers), we'll be open to change, we can't depend on Social Security, etc. Some of the chapters gave me something to look forward to \\"See, Feel, Taste and Touch the World\\", \\"Lifelong Learning Adventures\\". The chapter on \\"Achieving Financial Freedom\\" wasn't particularly helpful, but maybe that's because I've already spent a considerable amount of time researching and considering that topic already.If you're entering your \\"Power Years\\", hoping to rediscover life's purposes, find a balance between work and leisure, find new interests, leave a legacy or any of the latent desires and wishes we hold for our later years, the book is a good primer, will provide plenty of food for thought and ideas, and will kick-start your journey into the \\"power years\\"."},{"Title":"The Power Years: A User's Guide to the Rest of Your Life (Thorndike Health, Home & Learning)","review":"\\"The Power Years\\" is an incredible book that really opened my eyes to the myriadof possibilities available in later life.

It soon became the centerpiece of our morning coffee talk (between strapping up our youngest daughters diaper and doing 3 rounds of pony tails for the 4 year old.) So much of what the book discusses is what I believe Gen Xers (perhaps even more than Boomers) want and seek from life, the power to have flexibilty. Spending time with family while also having a successful career; refining our talents while exploring new skills; forging new relationships while remaining committed to the ones we have; making the most of the precious things we own and keeping our desires (and debt) real not material. Most importantly, Dychtwald and Kadlec offer REAL insights and strategies on how to achieve your dreams in a funny, personal and VERY readable context.

First, it is a great source of ideas for planning or exploring the next phase of life if you happen to be a boomer. There are numerous thoughts, suggestions, and trends identified that can be a terrific way for the reader to uncover or rekindle lifelong ambitions. Perhaps this book will encourage folks to act upon their dreams. I hope so. It is interesting to see what so many others are doing with their power years.The second reason I love this book is that it offers new and exciting ways to market to boomers. Sure, folks have made careers chasing this demographic, but there are even more ideas in this book to pursue such as philanthropic travel, grandparents camp, and helping boomers continue their education in a myriad of ways.The book is easy to read and has a nice flow to it.

Communists had staged a number of unsuccessful coups in Germany in the years following World War One and Hitler was against Bolshevism.Ironically, Zahn repeatedly refers to these men as heroes while portraying them as leaders gone astray.Some had been active in the inter-war peace movement but Zahn quotes sermon after sermon in which they urge their congregations to serve loyally and lavish praise upon soldiers &quot;defending&quot; their country.In a number of asides Zahn also calls into question the role of the bishops' opposite numbers in the Allied camp whom, he feels, betrayed their callings as well when they did not oppose the bombing of cities and demand for an unconditional surrender."},{"Title":"German Catholics and Hitler's wars;: A study in social control","review":"Classic sociological study about the actions of the German Catholics who generally supported the war effort of Nazi Germany despite the obvious injustice of the cause and the brutal means used to advance it. Zahn's findings are not so much inherent flaws with the German people, which is a notion with some popularity currently, but rather misguided or wrongheaded notions of Catholics generally to 'render unto Caeser what is Caeser's,' even to the point of supporting nationalistic wars that directly contradict the basic precepts of the Catholic Church. He further concludes that Catholics in other nations, from Britain to the United States would have, and continue to act, in similar manner. Even if the bishops in any given nation condemn a war as unjust the Catholic masses tend to continue to support the state. This continues to be a spiritual and moral problem for the Catholic Church today as millions of Catholic continue to support their national war machines, even to the use of weapons of mass destruction against rival populations. On the other hand, to expect any different would be naive, to say the least."},{"Title":"German Catholics and Hitler's wars;: A study in social control","review":"It's a shame that only one reviewer has preceded me. If Catholics were reading this book, there would probably be many trying to undermine it, as there are the excellent book by another Roman Catholic scholar, John Cornwell.Cornwell's book may be making a bigger splash because of his controversial title, \\"Hitler's Pope, the secret history of Pius XII\\". Both authors are obviously pained, as Catholics themselves, by the facts which they uncovered, and are not happy to be exposing the shameful record of their church regarding the Holocaust. But loyalty to God does not allow them to hide or misrepresent the truth about their church. And for that they are to be praised - by God, if not by all of their fellow Catholics! -The prior reviewer does a great job of summarizing Gordon Zahn's book.

Everyone loves to eat and, whether we'll admit it or not, we all enjoy hearing the lascivious latest. Liz Smith, who well knows her way around a table and a tantalizing tale, has combined dish with recipes in her latest book. The title is \\"Dishing,\\" and it's all gravy.You gotta' love a gal who schmoozes with the rich and fabulous admitting that she once took a children's course in table manners after being flummoxed by a finger bowl during lunch with Mrs. Vincent Astor. It was during this class at the Plaza that she learned the appropriate way to leave a table: \\"......\\"we must never explain why we are leaving the table if we do. Simply get up and say \`Excuse me,\\" and fold the napkin across the back of the chair so the waiter will know you plan to return.\\"This came as news to the former resident of Fort Worth, Texas, whose constant childhood dish was milk toast, and where her mother insisted that she and her siblings eat watermelon in the bathtub because it was easier to hose them off afterwards. However, Texas is, as we know, where the stars are big and bright - there must have also been a lucky one for Miz Liz to be born under because one of the first to become her friend in New York City was Sirio, a waiter. Later, Sirio Maccioni would own a famous restaurant, Le Cirque.Another famous restauranteur, Henri Soule, taught her the proper way to eat caviar, and she hilariously recalls the time he gifted her with an expensive case of wine. Having no idea of the value of this rare Chateau Petrus, she served it to her friends along with chili.There's very little, whether it's food or the famous, that this author has missed.

Compared with others I've ready, this title has less political commentary and more historical observation.The style of writing is easy enough; the accounts of hunger, torture, grief, and death -- prisoners murdering each other without consequence, men being treated worse than animals, a system that rewards corruption and disparages honesty and wisdom -- all were described with a matter-of-fact perspective of a prisoner who had to deal with these realities on a daily basis.Included in the book are first-person observations about the administration of Soviet prisons and gulags, the physical torture and mistreatment endured by prisoners, the community dynamics and conduct of different sub-groups within the prison system, the Vorkuta Slave Rebellion of 1953.At the end he comments, \\"I was returning to the west, to a world of busy people developing their lives according to their abilities...From the Soviet Union, truly the richest country in respect to natural resources, but the poorest nation, I had come to a world of plenty which too often was not appreciated, for which too often gratitude was not expressed to God.\\"Excellent book.

This engaging and highly approachable text (which is a tip of the hat to Edgar Zurif, one of the field's most productive and insightful ground-breakers) is an outstanding resource for the academic, the student, or the learned reader interested in the interface between language and the brain. The chapters span widely ranging topics, from complex syntactic processing (such as WH-Movement and co-referencing of VP-Ellipsis) to discourse processing. With contributions from the field's leading researchers, this tome is a must-have for everyone interested in how the brain processes language, in a normally functioning system as well as in a damaged system (aphasia, amnesia)."},{"Title":"Who is for peace?","review":"What do a Reformed evangelical, a Russian dissident held for over a decade in Soviet prisons and psychiatric hospitals, and a conservative Catholic have in common? A concern for peace. But is not a peace that is simply a ceasefire. It is a peace with justice and love for the downtrodden.These authors have put together a work that forcefully asks the question, \\"Who is for peace?\\" Their main thesis is that those who cry out for peace are actually the ones who, intentionally or not, seek tyranny and slavery. Those isolationists or pacifists who espouse \\"peace at any price\\" are often \\"the ones who, in the end, open the way for national, and even global, tragedy through war\\" (p. 8). They support their thesis with \\"a basic realism and common sense\\" (p. 7), rather than the Scriptures.Francis Schaeffer opens the book with his essay, \\"The Secular Humanist World View Versus the Christian World View and Biblical Perspectives on Military Preparedness.\\" The essay is severely disjointed, appearing to be two essays pieced together into one. The theses of the two halves appear not to relate directly to each other. Either his first topic of secular humanism need to be directly related to military preparedness or the first half of his essay should have been left out altogether.He first cries out against the inhumanity of secular humanism: in the name of humanity they have adopted a materialism that destroys the basis for values, the basis for law, and the basis for the dignity and worth of human life. Consequently, the State has been assigned with ultimate value. Schaeffer begins his argument for nuclear defense by linking his statements about secular humanism to the materialist philosophy of the Soviet Union. He justifies the U.S.'s nuclear arsenals by saying that it must stand firm against the U.S.S.R.'s external program of expansion and oppression; to not do so is both not realistic and not acting in Christian love toward the oppressed and downtrodden. To act like the pacifists in between the first and second world wars ignoring the reality and tyranny of Hitler is to encourage the same behavior in the U.S.S.R.There are many limitations with Schaeffer's arguments. First, he begins by criticizing the secular humanism within the U.S. which has resulted in materialism, moral and legal relativism, the devaluation of human life, and religious statism, and then goes on to say that the U.S. needs to stand firm against the U.S.S.R. who holds these very same values. Christians should defend the nonchristian U.S. against the nonchristian U.S.S.R. When Schaeffer does this, he not only is self-contradictory but appears to argue on behalf of pacifism, making no distinction between the value system of the U.S.S.R. and the U.S. If there is no distinction, then what are the moral grounds for war? Whose side should Christians take? Maybe it is just a matter of degree of adopted secular humanist philosophy that makes one government just and the other unjust. It becomes a matter of standing against the worst of two evils. Schaeffer addresses none of these issues.Second, Schaeffer's argument is not biblical based. He argues from \\"realism\\" or \\"Christian love,\\" vaguely defined terms. He does not deal with the biblical grounds for justice, civil government, civil disobedience, personal vengeance, and revolution. He has left all these concepts vague and to the readers' interpretation.In short, Schaeffer's arguments for military defense have fatal flaws. These flaws will be easily exploited by the pacifists and isolationists with whom he hopes to persuade.Nevertheless, Schaeffer's argumentation does have value. It concurs with the thesis of Solzhenitsyn that the West has not stood firm against the tyranny of the U.S.S.R. because it has sold out to the materialist doctrines of peace and prosperity - at any price. It has lost its moral fortitude. There is no will to fight for justice and love when these concepts are no longer cultural values. Essentially the West's values are now the same as those of the U.S.S.R.: the materialist desire for wealth. The U.S.S.R. wants to take it, the U.S. wants to keep it.What Schaeffer's essay lacks in biblical and rational argument, Bukovsky's essay, \\"The Peace Movement and the Soviet Union,\\" attempts to make up for by historical evidence. Of course, the study of history does not give us values or rationale, but it can make us aware both of the consequences of our choices and the real intentions behind a history of a nation's words and deeds.Bukovsky argues with the force of facts. The U.S.S.R. hath forked tongue. It supports peace movements for its own warring, expansionist ends. When it allied with Hitler, it actively supported the English and French peace movement so that Hitler would have limited resistance. This support was immediately withdrawn when Hitler attacked the U.S.S.R. When the war was over, the U.S.S.R. against supported peace as it gobbled up country after country in Central Europe.The doctrine of d&eacute;tente was resurrected by the Soviets only to gain badly needed technology, goods, and credit. That there never was any intention for real d&eacute;tente is clear: during that time the Soviets boosted their nuclear arsenals to be equal or greater than those of the U.S. As Solzhenitsyn long ago stated, \\"D&eacute;tente is no d&eacute;tente.\\" Through their doctrine of d&eacute;tente, the West is not dependent upon the trade and especially the credits of the U.S.S.R.The U.S.S.R., however, ended any talks of d&eacute;tente with its invasion of Afghanistan and military threats against Poland. Now the Soviets seek to again wipe their slate clean in our minds by renewing their support for the peace movement. Bukovsky links both the planning and financial support to the U.S.S.R. Nuclear weapons are presently labeled immoral even when used against the tyrannies of the Soviets. The peace movement's argument for peace at any price because of the fear of Soviet aggression, says Bukovsky, is as deranging \\"as to lead some people to advocate the abolition of the police because the criminals are becoming too aggressive\\" (p. 50).Bukovsky directly attacks the propositions of the peace movement. Those who say that the Soviets will lay down their arms when the West lays down her arms are simply nave when faced with historical evidence. Those who argue against nuclear deployment near their own villages or towns (or even countries), saying let a nuclear war be fought between the Soviets and Americans, are nave to think that nuclear war would leave portions of Western Europe neutral and unaffected. The peace movement wants peace at any price - on Soviet terms. When Bukovsky wrote this essay, the peace movement supported both the invasion of Afghanistan and the imposition of marital law in Poland. (It has since divided over these issues.)Why is the Soviet Union so eager to expand its borders? Why is the Soviet threat a real one? The Soviet Union is internally degenerating. The ruling class is only interested in self-preservation. Bukovsky turns the Marxist argument against capitalists upon itself in stating that the Soviets need to create an external threat in order to take the eyes of the Russians off the real issues. The Soviets are afraid of world democracy and freedom because they know that if their people get too close they will desire that same freedom at home in the Soviet Union.Bukovsky concludes his historical argument with a moral one. If the Soviet system is internally crumbling, why has not it long ago fallen apart? He blames the West for their support of a regime of tyranny. He echoes Solzhenitsyn in stating that Western trade, credits, and technology keep this reign of death in power. Rather than supporting movements and armies who rebel against the Soviets, the West prefers not to get their hands dirty. Bankers and businessmen, who worship profit rather than love and justice, keep the Soviet regime stable so as to use them for their own ends.Bukovsky's arguments form the center of this book. His essay makes both Schaeffer and Hitchcock stand on the sidelines. His historical evidence has already provoked change within the peace movement itself. His moral argument, however, seems to fall on deaf ears, ones that do prefer peace at any price. Why? Solzhenitsyn, Schaeffer, and hundreds of others, both on the left and right, bemoan our Western materialist secular humanist post-Christian culture that has no interest for justice or love of fellow man. As Jesus said, one only finds his life by losing it for others. This is true of nations as well. We will lose our life and freedom if we are not willing to lay it down for others in bondage and oppression.In the last essay of this collection, \\"The Catholic Bishop's Search for Peace,\\" James Hitchcock critiques the Catholic bishops of the U.S.'s pastoral letter on war and peace. Although Hitchcock agrees with some of its underlying themes, especially its anti-abortion stance, he argues that the document ignores the basic Catholic theological tradition. Rather than acting as a prophet, these bishops have attempted to arrive at truth through public debate and democratic consensus. They even leave the Catholic just war tradition, which Hitchcock himself seems to question (\\"consequentialism\\" and \\"proportionalism\\" are not biblical concepts) and instead seek to balance it with Christian pacifism. They do not, and indeed cannot, cite any mainstream Catholics to support their position. The document has redefined peace in a secular way as the absence of war, rather than maintaining the true Catholic concept of peace as complete moral conversion. In short, Hitchcock says that the bishops have sold their birth right for the pottage of American pacifist liberalism. The letter \\"marks the culmination of a kind of revolution in American Catholicism\\" (p. 102). This letter marks a turn in the Catholic tradition towards a secular humanist philosophy that does not point to Jesus for salvation nor apply the values of justice and love to society.In sum, although this book does not make a sound biblical argument for national nuclear defense or deterrence, this books in an important document in support of these concepts. The historical and moral argument of Bukovsky, the key essay in the collection, is well worth the price of the book. Nevertheless, I am anxiously awaiting for an evangelical to present an in-depth biblical and historical defense of nuclear deterrence. This book is a beginning of that defense."},{"Title":"O Pioneers! (Lrs Large Print Heritage Series)","review":"Another great blunt tale of immigrants from Cather.

I am far past high school, but I could not get through it, either. Cather seems to write chapters for the sake of cranking out pages, but many chapters go nowhere and lead to nothing. Like one chapter where she goes with her brothers to visit a strange Russian named Ivar who has peculiar ideas on how to raise pigs. Does she go into the hog butchering business? Or big time hog farming? Does she even follow his advice? No. Nothing happens and the hogs don't come up again. And her endless descriptions of the scenery are enough to make me wish she got stranded in the Gobi Desert. She just can't stop with the scenery, which makes up a good half of the book. Maybe she should have been a painter."},{"Title":"O Pioneers! (Lrs Large Print Heritage Series)","review":"Good points:1. The prose in this book was very nice. It is easy to forget that the book is only just 100 years old-- but it seems even older than that. For example: The use of the word \\"country\\" to describe \\"countryside\\" instead of \\"nation\\" was something that took a few references for me to catch.Bad points:1. The book was overwrought with detail/ drama. It was just under 200 pages, but it read more like 300.2. I can see that the point of the author's jumps in time was to show a characters development over some number of decades. But what I thought the book would show was the logistics of building a farm from the ground up. Instead, we went something like .....Intro........Three years later........Sixteen years later.3. The environment seems a bit.......tribal. Was America ever this way?4. The development of the characters was a bit lacking. Some characters were there (Old Ivar) and they seemed to act as just filler. There seems to have been a lot of foreshadowing about how something *might* happen to Ivar at the hands of the two slimy brothers, but nothing did happen. So, that brought up the question of why was he there. As far as character development, I always learned that, at a minimum, one should discuss the Speech, Actions, Appearance, Thoughts, Opinions of Others as a way of developing that character. Either that method had not been invented or if it had Cather just never got around to studying it.In summary, this book is highly overrated (1) and I'm glad that I got it for free (2), because if I had to come off of my own money for it, it might have been worth about $2 plus the cost of shipping."},{"Title":"O Pioneers! (Lrs Large Print Heritage Series)","review":"Willa Cather's second novel draws on Cather's own experiences on the Nebraska plains, where she knew, first-hand, the harsh beauty of the land, the resilience of the farmers who tried to tame it, and the accidents of nature that could, overnight, destroy years of dreams. Here Alexandra Bergson, the bright and hard-working daughter of a farmer, inherits the responsibilities of running the family farm upon the death of her father. With two older, less business-like brothers to work the land, she turns what had been a marginally successful farm into a business profitable enough that she is able to buy land other farmers have abandoned.Beginning in the late 1800s, when Alexandra is a teenager, and continuing until Alexandra is in her forties, the novel celebrates Alexandra's strength and dedication to her land, at the same time that it emphasizes how isolating farm life can be. Though Alexandra's farm becomes the most successful farm in the area, she has few friends and no lovers, and there is little opportunity for social life. When her earliest friend, Carl Linstrum, whose family long ago gave up their farm, suddenly returns for a visit, Alexandra and Carl find themselves \\"keeping company,\\" despite the opposition of her brothers. The love of her youngest brother Emil for Marie Shabata, an unhappily married woman, is a parallel love story with additional complications. In both love stories, the accidents of fate, so common in farm life, play a key role in characters' personal lives.Filled with gorgeous descriptions of the changing seasons, from the brutal harshness of winter to the rebirth in spring and the flourishing of summer, the novel also shows how fickle nature can be. Those who survive, physically and emotionally, are those like Alexandra who can accept and adapt to whatever life offers, instead of fighting against unpredictable disasters. To be successful, one must sublimate the desire for adventure, the urge to explore, and the human tendency to ask oneself, \\"What if...?\\" Day-to-day activities, minutely explored here, keep farmers like Alexandra rooted in the real world--imagination is a \\"luxury\\" few can afford.One of the first realistic novels about the pioneer experience, O Pioneers conveys the values and the personal qualities needed for success on the plains, at the same time that it also reveals how quickly and unpredictably nature can change outcomes. Even love is not a haven here--sudden, unpredictable changes occur in love, too. Dramatic and powerful in its depiction of pioneer life, the novel is a paean to the resilient spirit of the early pioneers and the enduring power of nature. n Mary Whipple"},{"Title":"O Pioneers!

(Lrs Large Print Heritage Series)","review":"O Pioneers!By Willa Cather was written in 1913 and is considered the first novel of the Great Plains trilogy. The novel has many themes including isolation, love and feminism.The Bergsons immigrated from Switzerland to Hanover, Nebraska at the turn of the 20th Century. When the patriarch of the family dies, his daughter Alexandra, inherits the farm and devotes her life to making it a viable enterprise at a time when others give up and leave.I've only been recently introduced to the writing of Willa Cather. I believe it was on some \\"top 100\\" list (who said they're lame?) and figured I'll give it a try.O Pioneers! by Willa Cather is considered a classic and I can certainly understand why. The writing is outstanding and it has all the makings of the great American novel. The story tells of hard work, wide eyed innocence towards the future and opportunities abound as seen through the eyes of the immigrant class.The scenery plays a major part in the novel, the lyrical episodes about the pastoral land are sprawling and majestic. As is with many other novels, the setting of the harsh and beautiful land is playing out as another character in the book. The Midwestern prairie which the pioneers labor over is an essential part of character development and profound understanding of themselves, the land and life.On the contrary, the parts which deal with people are concise and sparring much like the personalities of those that worked the acrid land. Cather manages to convey the sense of community despite the vastness of the land, a testament to her writing skills and ability to personalize a storyline.While I loved the descriptions and prose, the dialog seemed a bit stilted, it just didn't seem as if that's how the characters wouldspeak, especially when among friends and relatives. However the storyline is exemplary and the characterization - amazing; I found myself caring about the people in the story and breathlessly waiting to find out what will happen to them."},{"Title":"O Pioneers!

(Lrs Large Print Heritage Series)","review":"A captivating tale of frontier life, Willa Cather's novel provides an intriguing look into the American spirit on the vast prairies of the late 19th century through the eyes of recent immigrants. \\"O Pioneers!\\" tells the tale of one such family, the Bergsoms, and their struggles as they attempt to conquer the vast Nebraska prairie. The toils and struggles of the Bergsoms, along with their neighbors, is chronicled as they attempt to turn the unforgiving prairie into a prosperous breadbasket.Alexandra Bergsom, the female protagonist, is portrayed as a stoic, intelligent, and independent woman, who is a testament to the American spirit. It is she, and not her brothers, that her dying father trusts to run their farm and realize his dream. The land, itself, is an important protagonist, as Cather gives it human qualities and depicts it as the ultimate factor in determining a farmer's success, for the land will not be cultivated if it does not desire to be. Even Alexandra, after establishing a successful farm and growing modestly wealthy, gives the credit to the land.The conflict between the individual and community recurs throughout this novel. Alexandra, as an independent thinker, is continually criticized by her brothers and her farming brethren when she partakes of new farming methods and crops. Her brothers, which epitomize the other farmers, want no part of these \\"radical\\" ideas and try to conform with each other. However, Alexandra's non-conventional methods eventually become mainstream, as she proves again and again that a pioneer must also have new ideas and a free-thinking mind to enable success.Romance and romantic relationships are viewed as an undesirable complication. Indeed, the marriages in their community are generally unhappy, as the energy and vigor of farming and frontier life will sap all the energy out of a relationship. In fact, some of the marriages are doomed from the onset. Even the jovial and energetic Marie cannot avoid the pitfalls of marriage, even though she entered her union with the utmost love and energy. Indeed, it is Marie's energy and friendliness that is eventually her downfall, as she looks for love elsewhere. In Cather's frontier world, it appears that the only marriage that will succeed would be one for convenience and companionship, instead of romantic love.On the negative side, there is a textual error, an inconsistency in the timeline, that prevented me from giving \\"O Pioneers!\\" five stars. At the start of the novel, just before the death of John Bergsom, Emil is 5 years old and Carl 15. Then, \\"sixteen years\\" after John's death, Emil is 21 (16 years older), but Carl is 35 (19-20 years older)? Also, Lou was married after the Linstrums left, 3 years after John's death. This would mean that Lou would have been married for 13 years, yet he has a daughter who is 15? It seems as if an editor, not to mention Cather herself, should have picked up on this.The nitpicking aside, though, this is a superb novel. Cather's real-life experience as a girl in Nebraska surely helped the realism. This is an easy read, but is both entertaining and thought-provoking and a good depiction of the embodiment of the pioneer spirit."},{"Title":"O Pioneers!

I definitely reccomend this."},{"Title":"O Pioneers! (Lrs Large Print Heritage Series)","review":"I vaguely remembered the name Willa Cather from my high school days, but I don't think I ever read anything by her. Maybe a poem. However, I decided to get one of her books after reading a recommendation in a recent National Geographic Magazine article on the Great Plains. It stated that she was known for writing books on the Plains and of the hardships the farmers faced there especially during the dust storms. But not in this book. Cather stresses that hardwork and scientific farming will lead to prosperity, and in fact most of the farmers we meet are prosperous. The book begins as we meet Alexandra, the next to youngest and only daughter of four offspring of an immigrant Swedish farming couple in Nebraska. Alexandra is in town to bring back the doctor to treat her ailing father. He refuses to come, because her father is hopelessly dying. Her father, knowing his fate is sealed, calls the family together and beliving that his daughter is the only one with intelligence and grit, installs her as the head of the family and orders his three sons to follow her advice on all matters. This is a unique situation, especially since the boys readily agree. Beyond the situation, the subject of the book is totally different from what is expected from a female author at the turn of the 20th Century. At that time, women wrote of well-to-do ladies whose lives revolved around parlors and social teas, not a common farmer. The father's wisdom proves sound as the family amasses the largest acreage in the area and the respect of their Swede and Bohemian neighbors. There is enough local color and description of daily activites included in the book to give a good flavor of the time and place. The story continues as Alexandra's best friend and neighbor, Carl, finds farming unsatisfactory and leaves to earn his fortune elsewhere. This leaves Alexandra facing spinsterhood. She sells Carl's farm to a young hard-working couple. The farmer's wife and Emil, Alexandra's youngest brother, form a fast friendship whose passion is headed out of bounds. Realizing this, Emil plans to move away for good. But, before he can leave, a shocking incident disrupts all of their lives. The event is made even more astounding because of the simple telling of the story to that point. The incident comes out of nowhere and, to me, was totally unexpected although believable. It's even more astounding when you realize it was created by a woman more than 90 years ago. Although the book didn't deliver what I expected, it did deliver the goods, and I will seek out more books by this ground-breaker author."},{"Title":"O Pioneers! (Lrs Large Print Heritage Series)","review":"In her second novel, published at age forty, Cather deals with themes and settings which would preoccupy her for the rest of her career. Foremost in the book stands The Land, the Nebraska prairie, as palpable a character as the indomintable Alexander Bergson, determined not only to live on The Land but to conquer it and make something of it and leave it as a legacy for those to follow her. She resists the blandishments of big city, industrialized life (to which her more materialistic brothers are anxious to submit)to remain in the place she knows best.O PIONEERS is not a farming manual, however, or pictuaresque portrait of happy Swedish farmers. It is a tragedy of the sacrfices Alexander must make to remain true to her (and her father's) dream. She gives up (until the happy ending) marriage, love, and family of her own. It is the tragedy of giving up dreams and of thwarted young love whose passion can be extinguished only by violent death.Cather handles it all in a style best described as poetic realism. This book nearly matches (though not quite) MY ANTONIA in impact and resonance."},{"Title":"O Pioneers! (Lrs Large Print Heritage Series)","review":"Willa Cather certainly celebrates the country/simple life. This is a slow and sweet novel with lots of discription. It really paints a vivid scene for readers. Plus, it celebrates what it is to be American, farm, and commune with nature. It is a story about Swedish, German, etc, immigrants who work the land and farm, but I was quite taken by her imagery and insites. The one that I found particularly profound was a comparison of people to corn seeds (how some thrive and some rot). Great novel."},{"Title":"O Pioneers! (Lrs Large Print Heritage Series)","review":"Though this is not a book for people who favor mystery, science fiction or action, it is ideal for people like me, who appreciate a book with real characters. Alexandra is a very sympathetic character: very practical and hard-working, dealing with the prejudices of her brothers and community in an admirable, graceful way. If you like reading about real people, I recommend this book. Willa Cather, as usual, does an amazing job of getting into people's minds and lives, while keeping her language simple and understandable. As other reviewers have indicated, this is a far more accurate, understandable way to learn about the history of the American pioneers."},{"Title":"O Pioneers!

(Lrs Large Print Heritage Series)","review":"It started out wonderfully, with the vividness and wonder that Cather usually presents, it just went downhill from there. The sixteen year jump in the middle of the book lost me. I lost all view of the characters and the situations in which they were involved. I was surprised to see Cather stoop to such a level. I highly recommend her other works, but O Pioneers, one of her first novels, didn't inspire as did the others. Some will find this story very enjoyable with a great descriptions of the Nebraskan plains, but for me, the vivid descriptions didn't overcome the lack of plot and storyline. Please forgive my frankness, but O Pioneers wasn't as great as I thought I would be. Sorry Willa. 8("},{"Title":"O Pioneers! (Lrs Large Print Heritage Series)","review":"The most outstanding part of this book is its description of the land in rural south central Nebraska. This book is very handy in that regard. Cather makes the land and its harsh realities a vital part of the novel. The characters of Alexandra and Frank Shabata are really the only others to impress.Carl Lindstrom is a moocher who only wants something for nothing.Lou and Oscar are basically backwards thinking stubborn farmers.Emil is a moocher and a lecher and wants his sister to always pay his way.Marie is a sex-kitten who ends up getting killed.Essentially, Alexandra is the only real complex character in the book, with the land.

I definitely recommend it to the many strong-minded women, who will easily relate to Alexandra Bergson."},{"Title":"O Pioneers! (Lrs Large Print Heritage Series)","review":"As an avid reader of Victorian novels, from time to time I will explore more modern writers such as Cather. I have read many of her books, including my all-time favorite, Death Comes for the Archbishop. What really struck me about Oh Pioneers was its dark depiction of realism. I fell in love with the love story and imagined in vain a happy ending. The fact that the lovers died together, reminscent of Romeo and Juliet, was tragedy in itself. But Cather removes any hope a united after-life for these two young people (as we find for Heathcliff and Catherine in E. Bonte's WH). &quot;They were not in heaven,&quot; Cather writes. Life and death for these pioneers, like the land, is unforgiving and harsh.Willa Cather is wonderful author to read if one wants to get a history of European immigrants in the West at the turn of the century.

(Lrs Large Print Heritage Series)","review":"In this, the author's second published work, the author writes about that which she knew best, early pioneer life in Nebraska, the place to which she and her family moved in 1883 when she was a mere slip of a girl. She eventually attended the University of Nebraska, graduating in 1995, at a time when most girls did no such thing.In this work, the author was on very sure footing. Her clear, straightforward prose lends itself capably to the story of early pioneers who went to Nebraska and set down roots, weathering the exigencies that often plagued a newcomer to a particular region. It is a surprisingly unsentimental look at pioneer life.This thematically complex, but simply written story focuses primarily on Alexandra Bergson, the intelligent, independent, resourceful, and strong-willed daughter of pioneer John Bergson. Upon his death he did what was then the nearly unthinkable. He left his land in the hands of his oldest child, his daughter, Alexandra, rather than in those of his sons, recognizing in his daughter those qualities that would ensure that his land would prosper under her stewardship.This then is the story of not only Alexandra but of that land and those whose sustenance depended upon its fruitfulness. The reader follows the Bergson clan as they live their lives and interact with their neighbors. Under Alexandra's skillful management, the Bergson farm prospers. As the farm prospers, so does its environs, as the area becomes a bustling center of activity with more and more settlers developing the land around that of the Bergsons.Thematically, the book explores the vicissitudes of life, as well as its life-affirming moments. As in all lives, the characters in this book experience moments of high drama and great tragedy, as well as memorable moments of love and hate. All this is grounded within the context of pioneer life, with all its hardships and privations, as well as its occasional abundance. The author skillfully re-creates a melting pot of the many nationalities that cultivated the land known as Nebraska.This is a book that those who like reading about pioneer life will certainly enjoy, as will those who simply like a well-written book with a tale to tell. This classic novel was also adapted for a Hallmark Hall of Fame film, starring Jessica Lange in the role of Alexandra Bergson."},{"Title":"O Pioneers!

The heroine of the book is Alexandra Bergson who inherits her father's farm as a young woman, raises his three sons and stays with the farm through the harsh times to become a successful landowner and farmer.The books speaks of being wedded to the land and to place. In this sense it is an instance of the American dream of a home.

An immigrant father bequeaths his land to the care of his daughter on his deathbed, rather than to his sons, because he sees that her love of the land and her family runs deep and that she has the heart and spirit necessary to survive the harsh reality of the plains. So begins one of the greatest love stories of all time. I don't use the term love story loosely; this book contains love in its many intricate, shifting, and enduring forms: the love of the land, the love of a dream, love within families, love of the past, love of tradition, love of new opportunities, love between friends, the love between men and women, and the love of living.

(Lrs Large Print Heritage Series)","review":"In &quot;O Pioneers!&quot;, her classic novel first published in 1913, Willa Cather wrote, &quot;The history of every country begins in the heart of a man or a woman.&quot; By revealing to us the hearts of those pioneer immigrants in this book, Cather offers a moving meditation on United States culture and history.&quot;O Pioneers!&quot; tells the story of a community in Nebraska farm country. Her main character, Alexandra Bergson, is a Swedish immigrant. Cather creates a marvelous portrait of the community and its rich mix of European ethnic groups: Norwegian, Swedish, French, etc. It is especially fascinating to see the multicultural, multiethnic world they created in the United States. Cather also depicts the cultural and linguistic &quot;shift&quot; that takes place along generational lines.Cather's story deals with issues of economics, gender roles, and sexuality. In addition to the formidable Alexandra, she creates a cast of compelling characters. And her luminous prose style evokes all of the sensations of Alexandra's world: the smell of ripe wheat, the chirping of insects in the long grass, the golden play of light in an apple orchard.But this is Alexandra's book. She is a great American heroine who reminds me of such beloved characters as Zora Neale Hurston's Janie (from &quot;Their Eyes Were Watching God&quot;) or Alice Walker's Celie (from &quot;The Color Purple&quot;). Like those great characters, Alexandra will break your heart, deeply touch your soul, and ultimately leave you feeling richer for having known her.Finally, as an interesting companion text to &quot;O Pioneers!&quot; try &quot;Anna Christie,&quot; the 1922 play by U.S. writer Eugene O'Neill. O'Neill's life and career were contemporary with Cather's, and &quot;Anna Christie,&quot; like &quot;O Pioneers!&quot;, deals with a Swedish immigrant woman in the United States."},{"Title":"O Pioneers! (Lrs Large Print Heritage Series)","review":"Some writers are identified with a particular country or region, others with a specific period in history. Willa Cather is known for both. When I think of her, I think of the prairie states, especially Nebraska, and I think of the days of the intrepid pioneers of the prairies, struggling to make a life for themselves that was tenuous, at best.Although Cather spent only a few years of her childhood on the vast prairie lands of Nebraska, she returned to those memories again and again in her most powerful and famous fiction, such as My Antonia and The Song of the Lark.The title of one of her celebrated novels, O Pioneers! is rather unique in that it has an exclamation point at the end of it. Think about it: how many other book titles do you know that have exclamation points? That sense of breathlessness, excitement, and fierce determination which is conveyed in the very look of the title O Pioneers! comes across from the very first pages of this novel.This is the story of Alexandra Bergson and her family who risk everything they have to carve out a home in the unforgiving Nebraska landscape. Alexandra is forced at a very young age to take on the responsibility for her mother and brothers after her father dies. Before he dies, her father makes Alexandra, his most trusted child, promise to keep the farm and to make it thrive. This she does, although at a high personal cost.The novel is a short one and moves quickly from decade to decade. It begins with a touching scene involving Alexandra's youngest brother Emil, whose stray kitten is rescued by Alexandra's best friend, Carl. The moment is a sweet one, and all ends well; but this is perhaps the only time in the book that we see problems so easily and satisfactorily resolved.The land is harsh and brings out both the best and the worst in people. Those with weak wills and weak values often stumble and are sometimes destroyed. The Nebraska prairie is not a place where love and gentle dreams can flourish without interference; young people particularly often find their fondest dreams tossed aside the way the blade of a plow uproots the tender prairie grasses.There is heartbreak and loneliness in O Pioneers!,but there are also moments of pure exhilaration and veneration for the savage beauty of the land. Alexandra suffers as she tries to keep her vision of what the land can mean for her and her family. Like many of the women in the novels of Willa Cather, Alexandra rises above the ordinary, and continues with dogged determination along the path she has set for herself. The price she pays is high, but we know it is not too high, despite what has been lost. And, appropriately, the last sentence in O Pioneers! ends with this exclamatory sentence:\\"Fortunate country, that is one day to receive hearts like Alexandra's into its bosom, to give them out again the yellow wheat, in the rustling corn, in the shining eyes of youth!\\"Fortunate, indeed!"},{"Title":"O Pioneers! (Lrs Large Print Heritage Series)","review":"What if Cather wrote the great American Novel and no one noticed? Upon repeated reading of O Pioneers, I sometimes wonder if that isn't just what happened.In the character of Alexandra, Cather has created, not a stereotype or carbon copy of heroines in earlier novels, but something entirely new to American Literature. Alexandra is no wispy, fainting Victorian heroine but instead strong, capable and (obviously) heroic. I don't know how other reviewers missed this obvious point. Perhaps strong female characters are common in todays writing, but not in 1913. Only Chopin's Awakening (1899) even comes close. And Alexandra seems transcendent compared to such earlier characters. Cather changed American Literature with this unconventional construct.And then there is the prose: \\"When the road began to climb the first long swells of the Divide, Alexandra hummed an old Swedish hymn, and Emil wondered why his sister looked so happy. Her face was so radiant that he felt shy about asking her. For the first time, perhaps, since that land emerged from the waters of geologic ages, a human face was set toward it with love and yearning. It seemed beautiful to her, rich and strong and glorious. Her eyes drank in the breadth of it, until her tears blinded her. Then the Genius of the Divide, the great, free spirit which breathes across it, must have bent lower than it ever bent to a human will before. The history of every country begins in the heart of a man or a woman.\\"This well known quote from the book is perhaps the best example of Cather's lyric and thoughtful prose.Finally, Cather engages the reader with the significant themes of struggle and truimph, and people v the land. Again, these may seem commonplace today but Cather is the author that brought them to our attention and branded them into our national identity nearly a century ago.While I reccommend this book, you might also try My Antonia, The Song of the Lark, or One of Ours (for which Cather won the Pulitzer)."},{"Title":"O Pioneers!

Don't be discouraged by the title, as I once was. Basically, the story talks about Alexandra, a Swedish woman who has to take care of the family once her father dies at the beginning of the book. I didn't really admire her character or was interested too much in it, but that's okay because a lot of the plot involves her brother Emil and her neighbor Marie and their clandestine type of love...it's a heartwarming novel and a very entertaining read. I read the book in one night. The setting was very well depicted and had a sense of magic, evethough there's nothing of a supernatural nature in the book. The characters were very lively and realistic. I wasn't really too satisfied with the ending, but I enjoyed it greatly nonetheless. It is an excellent work ; I recommend it."},{"Title":"O Pioneers!

(Lrs Large Print Heritage Series)","review":"As the story opens, we meet 16-year-old Alexandra Bergson. She and her family had immigrated from Sweden years before, and are now settlers on the wind-swept Nebraska prairie. As her father was dying, he told the children that Alexandra, as the oldest, was to be in charge of the land. A land he wanted to keep in the family, no matter what the cost. He didn't trust the boys to do what was right, and he knew that Alexandra would.Many people at that time were cutting and running, selling the land for so much less than it was really worth. And the boys wanted to do this as well. But Alexandra knew better. She knew that the land would be worth a lot some day, and talked the boys into mortgaging the land to buy more. She traveled to different counties and universities to find the newest farming techniques and crops -- much to the dismay of her brothers, who were always so worried their neighbors would be \\"laughing\\" at them. And yet, as time went on, the Bergson farm flourished and grew. Lou and Oscar, the two older boys, each found a wife and moved out on their own. But Emil, the youngest, was Alexandra's heart. He was sent to the university to become more than just a farmer. She wanted him to have a life beyond just the land.And just as Alexandra is starting to really feel the lonliness of her life, an old family friend, Carl, reappears to visit. She has some decisions to make about her life, her family and her land.This tale spans a space of 25-years in the life of Alexandra. She is an incredibly smart business woman and a wonderful strong character. She is not given to do things based on appearnces, which is an attribute that I love about her character. But she is lacking a lot of the social awareness that most women have. Especially since the character was written by a woman! But through all the hard times and the good times, Alexandra is there to hold this family of pioneers together. This is truly a fantastic book, well deserved of the title \\"Classic\\"! If you haven't read anything by Cather, I strongly urge you to read this one!!"},{"Title":"O Pioneers!

If you're new to this author, this book is the place to start."},{"Title":"O Pioneers! (Lrs Large Print Heritage Series)","review":"The first half of this novel is curiously disjointed. Months, sometimes years elapse between each chapter, making it rather like reading fragments of a long family saga. The effect is to distance the reader from the characters. The second half is a more continuous and involving narrative, developing into a conventional social drama with a surprisingly melodramatic climax.The writing is fine, with an especially strong visual sense, sometimes reading almost like a treatment for a screenplay. The author manages a simple and elegant style that suits her theme perfectly.Cather's sympathies are firmly with the strong central female character Alexandra. The male characters are mostly insipid and unstable, and an affection, tinged with contempt, is shown toward the more submissive female characters. Apart from Alexandra, the author's deepest affection is reserved for the country itself. Cather writes of the Nebraska that she knew in her youth and of the immigrant men and women who tamed a hostile landscape.The title is taken from a very poor and overblown poem by Walt Whitman, appropriate only in that the poem is as hard going for the reader as the land was for the pioneer. But, title apart, the novel remains a solid rendition of Western pioneer life, a vital strand of American cultural history."},{"Title":"O Pioneers! (Lrs Large Print Heritage Series)","review":"It's difficult for me to give this book four stars, as opposed to three. I've just finished it, and thinking back on how deeply moving it was, especially in the scenes between the two sets of lovers (the point when Carl leaves Alexandra for Alaska, the moment in the fortune telling tent between Marie and Emil, and others). I won't give away the ending of the novel, or at least I'll do my best not to, but I was struck more swiftly than I've ever been in a novel, at the end by the mixture of sorrow and blame in Alexandra. How in hell could this character, though perhaps not quite as in tune with her emotional center as others in the book - how could she place the blame where she does? Her blaming of the two came closer to breaking my heart than the event itself. Carl does what he can to bring her around, letting her know what he had seen and that what was between the two was as pure as can be, and as beautiful as love should be. One even gets the sense that Carl believes the two young lovers would have been wrong to not love each other. But, by the final line of the book, I, as a reader, was not convinced that Alexandra was swayed by Carl's words as she should have been. I kept wondering whether or not Cather had read Hardy's 'Jude the Obscure' before writing this. Though love may end in tragedy, that love cannot be blamed for the tragedy. In the Hardy novel, it was not the love between Jude and Sue that brought them to ruination, but rather societal mores and Sue's lack of resiliency. She didn't realize that it was only her love for Jude that could save her. Love doesn't lead to tragedy - it is the responses to love that oftentimes lead to tragedy. A simple idea. I think Cather would have been well to illustrate this more completely in the end. Up through the last thirty or so pages, I would've given this book five stars without a second thought. I've maybe never read of love more tender than the love between Marie and Emil. And to know that the protagonist might blame such horror on such tenderness - it seems almost unbelievable that Cather would have written such reaction."},{"Title":"O Pioneers!

I am surprised that I have enjoyed reading Cather as much as I have considering that the novels of hers that I have read (O Pioneers, My Antonia, Death Comes for the Archbishop) do not contain much action or deep plots. They are simply stories of people's ordinary day to day lives and their interactions with their family members and neighbors while living and growing up in rural Nebraska (O Pioneers), a harsh and rather boring country to live in at the time, particularly for young kids and teenagers growing up and looking for excitement. Yet, Cather has a way of making you feel like you know these people and that they might knock on your door at any time. I was never bored and I look forward to reading more of her works. I urge others to do the same."},{"Title":"O Pioneers!

Now, many years down the path towards maturity, I have rediscovered the brilliance of Cather's writing. In the heroine, Alexandra Bergson, Cather offered up a woman who conquered not only the untamed hardscrabble Nebraska landscape but also the rock-strewn acreage of her family and her own long-deferred longings. The tale of one of heart-breaking inspiration - stubbornness bumping up against a more enlightened determination. Alexandra proved to be more solid and capable than any of her male relatives.Cather draws from the deep well of her own experience growing up on the Nebraska prairie, painting a nuanced portrait of the interplay among the ethnic groups that came seeking their fortunes- the Swedes, Norwegians, Bohemians and French. The interplay of triumph and tragedy makes for a powerful dramatic arc, and kept me reading far into the night to find out the fate of characters I had come to care about.

(Lrs Large Print Heritage Series)","review":"According to the USDA, fewer than 2% of Americans are now farmers. Only 17% of Americans now live in rural areas, and some urban kids don't even know that produce comes from somewhere before the grocery store. So what does a Nebraska-set farm novel have to say to the internet generation? Plenty.Has your family ever struggled with poverty? Had a parent die and shouldered their responsibilities? Siblings who doubted your plans and ideas? Been unhappy in a marriage--or fallen in love with someone already married? Pondered the benefits of putting down roots versus the freedom of travel? These are some of the major themes of the novel, and they will be just as relevant in 2013 as they were in 1913 when the book was written.And in addition to the timelessness of the key topics, Cather covers a wide range of human emotion, which she captures in numerous memorable phrases. About the protagonist, Alexandra, she writes \\"There is often a good deal of the child left in people who have had to grow up too soon.\\" About a second marriage late in life, she observes \\"this marriage was an infatuation, the despairing folly of a powerful man who cannot bear to grow old.\\" And finally, about life, she says \\"People have to snatch at happiness when they can in this world. It is always easier to lose than to find.\\" And a final sample, an observation that will be familiar to anyone who has moved to California or overseas to start something new: \\"There are always dreamers on the frontier.\\"So in summary, a powerful story of work, family, love, and hate--and unlike the last novel I read with substantial farm setting (Anna Karenina), tightly edited and quick reading.

(Lrs Large Print Heritage Series)","review":"I have read many things about Willa Cather and I saw the PBS documentary about her a couple of years back. But this is the first novel I've read by her and I wasn't disappointed. I read it in a day and was only sorry it wasn't longer.Willa Cather is one of those authors I'd always intended to read but somehow never quite got around to it. I'm sorry I waited so long.I think her chief ability as a novelist is to develop realistic, well-rounded characters. I felt as if I'd known these people and shared hardship and triumph with them. The list of 19th and 20th century authors who thought she was the best is very long. Now I see why her contemporaries thought so highly of her. She is awesome.I noticed some young readers' reviews had a hard time \\"getting her\\". I'm not too surprised. This story follows its characters from youth to in their mature years. A teenager may have trouble identifying with a 40+ spinster reluctant to follow her heart. And apparently when the story leaps forward 16 years many seem angered. One of the purposes of fiction is to explore human emotion and experience impossible to craft in a work of non-fiction. An essential element in the contract between author and reader is a willing suspension of disbelief by the writer's audience. Without this empathy prose is merely a collection of words on paper whose usefulness is limited.In O Pioneers! Willa Cather achieved remarkable resonance in character building in terms of people we can identify with. We want this girl to find happiness, though decades intervene.Can more be asked from a novel?"},{"Title":"O Pioneers!

They roll along ever changing with time, gently upturning the elements from beneth the surface until they are staring you right in the face. You never can know exactly what you have without giving it time. This book is full of deeper meaning and personalized messeges. You are the one that makes the book what it is. You are the one that draws a meaning closely tied to your own life from the book. I feel books are supposed to enlighten oneself.

(Lrs Large Print Heritage Series)","review":"What is seldom mentioned in the retelling of Washington Irving's classic tale of Rip Van Winkle, is that Rip was reading a copy of O Pioneers! when he \\"fell asleep.\\" (It was an advance copy). But Rip didn't really fall asleep, you see, because this book has the ability to actually stop time with respect to its reader. A sort of creeping death steals over the reader and every molecule in his body becomes frozen in time. I started reading this book one night before bed, and awoke covered in cobwebs next to [my wife]in a room so dim and dusty it was unrecognizable.If, however, you are fortunate enough to avoid the creeping death through the first three-quarters of the book, it picks up at the end. I would not mind that this book is the dullest and most uninteresting piece of fiction since Madame Bovary if I had gained an important message or insight from the read. Unfortunately, Cather seems to misunderstand love and liveliness, and although her presentation of man's connectedness to the land is fairly good, it has been better expressed elsewhere.It is probably worth the read because it is not too long, but be wary of the creeping death."},{"Title":"O Pioneers!

It may be contaminated by a rare soul-sucking virus that causes students who are forced to read it to loose all willpower to go on caring about 10th grade english class."},{"Title":"O Pioneers! (Lrs Large Print Heritage Series)","review":"O Pioneers!, by Willa Cather, is set in Hanover, Nebraska, where:\\"The rich soil yields heavy harvests; the dry, bracing climate and the smoothness of the land make labor easy for men and beasts. There are few scenes more gratifying than a spring plowing in that country, where the furrows of a single field often lie a mile in length, and the brown earth, with such a strong, clean smell, and such a power of growth and fertility in it, yields itself eagerly to the plow; rolls away from the shear, not even dimming the brightness of the metal, with a soft, deep sigh of happiness.\\"But it was not always this way: a generation earlier, a few pioneers had to struggle mightily to establish their farms, and some perished.The protagonist of O Pioneers! is Alexandra, a woman who possesses some common virtues, like industry and kindness, and some less common ones, like foresight. In this novel, virtues have predictable results: Alexandra has the best farm in Hanover and can count on the friendship of many neighbors. Most importantly, with Carl, a friend from her childhood, she maintains a lifelong friendship that develops into a romance when Carl returns after a long absence. If virtues have predictable results in this novel, so do character flaws: those who yield to temptation suffer the consequences quickly and surely.Some readers may find that the themes in this novel are a bit too simple for their tastes, but I found it to be beautifully written and uplifting. Those who are new to Cather's work might better start with My Antonia or Death Comes to the Archbishop, but her established fans will certainly want to read O Pioneers! as well."},{"Title":"O Pioneers! (Lrs Large Print Heritage Series)","review":"Cather published her second novel, O Pioneers, in 1913 at the age of 40. Together with My Antonia it is the novel for which she is best known. Years after writing the book, Cather wrote of it \\" Since I wrote this book for myself, I ignored all the situations and accents that were then thought to be necessary.\\"The book takes place on the plains of Nebraska in the late 19th Century as the Prairie is settled be Swedish, Bohemian, and French immigrants trying to eke out a living from what appears to be a harsh, inhospitable land. The heroine of the book is Alexandra Bergson who inherits her father's farm as a young woman, raises his three sons and stays with the farm through the harsh times to become a successful landowner and farmer.The books speaks of being wedded to the land and to place. In this sense it is an instance of the American dream of a home. It also speaks of a strong woman, not in cliched, late 20th Century terms but with a sense of ambiguity, difficulty and loss.This is a story as well of thwarted love, of the difficult nature of sexualtiy, and of human passion. There is also the beginning of what in Cather's works will become an increased sense of religion, Catholicism in particular, as a haven and a solace for the sorrow she finds at the heart of human endeavor. Above all it is a picuure of stark life in the midwest.There is almost as much blood-letting in this short book as in an Elizabethan tragedy. Cather's picture of American life on the plains, even in her earliest books, is not an easy or simple one. Some readers may quarrel with the seemingly happy ending of the book. I don't think any will deny that Alexandra's happiness is dearly bought or that it is bittersweet.I tendend to shy away from this book in favor of Cather's later novels. I feared that it would be conventional and trite. The stereotyping was mine,however. This is a thoughtful, well written story of immigrant life on the plains and of the sorrow pain, and strength of the American experience.Robin Friedman"},{"Title":"O Pioneers! (Lrs Large Print Heritage Series)","review":"This novel revolves around Alexandra Bergson, a Swedish immigrant tilling land in Nebraska. Few female characters in American literature have her feminine strength. Maybe Dagny Taggart of Ayn Rand's \\"Atlas Shrugged?\\" Or Margaret Mitchell's Scarlett O'Hara of \\"Gone With the Wind.\\" Scarlett and Alexandra are the adhesive, business-minded, matronly women who run things in an otherwise man's world.Having lived in the midwest for numerous years, albeit in the 1970's, I met people who mirrored the mannerisms and had the backgrounds of Alexandra. Like Alexandra, their parents left continental or scandinavian Europe for Nebraska's farmland. These people are as pure as the black loess within which the corn and wheat survive.Like many novels of this generation, this tale involves tragedy. A great tragedy. And, like Rand, many conversations about the seemingly obvious include contrarian statements which loudly ring otherwise unobserved truths. For instance, Alexandra seeks to pardon the murderer of those closest to her - she seeks to pardon someone whose single act clouded and depressed her soul forever. But, when you read this novel, you will agree with her decision. One hundred percent.Agrarian life, sometimes subjected to nature's entropy, is more than a seemingly simple venture. The character of Alexandra also is more complex than her appearance. She was a genius at farming. Today's farmers rotate to keep the land's fertility alive - grow alfalfa (to put nitrogen in the soil) to replenish what corn depletes. Alexandra speaks about rotating her soil because she heard about the concept from a \\"college boy.\\" They laughed at her. She grew wheat as the revenue stream from the land would increase. They laughed at her. Like Taggart and O'Hara, she was right while the dumb men around her were not. Unlike Taggart or O'Hara, Alexandra moves without confrontation, without eddy, without notice.She writes without wasting words, many details are delivered with few words. Her style reminds me of J.M. Coetzee or V.S. Naipaul. She is in very good company. She is a novelist I will read again."},{"Title":"O Pioneers! (Lrs Large Print Heritage Series)","review":"O Pioneers! does not equal My Antonia, but even getting halfway there means you're writing at Pulitzer Prize level. Cather takes a lot of liberty here, skipping ahead by sixteen years at one point and waffling on the main character--is it the land itself or Alexandra Bergson, so passionately and excellently taming it? To use an extremely lowbrow comparison, one wonders every Thursday why Meredith Grey, one of the least likable characters on ABC's wonder child Grey's Anatomy, both titles the show and gets to narrate the beginning and end. The show doesn't always center around her, just as this novel doesn't always center around Alexandra. It elicits an uneven and shortchanged feeling, a desire to see the author shift focus to the peripheral characters. But Cather ultimately catches up with us and makes all of her characters in to full and breathing people."},{"Title":"O Pioneers! (Lrs Large Print Heritage Series)","review":"i personally think that willa cather wrote rings around both hemmingway and f scott fitzgerald. her books are more about the art of fiction than about the ego of the author, as in the case of the two fellas i just mentioned. o pioneers! is the first of cather's masterpieces. a simple tale of a woman (alexandra bergson) coming of age on the nebraska prairie in the 19th century, confronting the hardships and realities of the harsh and impersonal landscape, and learning to navigate her way to success in a world socially and politically controlled by men. the land itself stands out like a character here, as cather sculpts a poetic vision of all the openess and sheer size of a place capable of swallowing the individual whole. simply the work of a great novelist. an american masterpiece, for sure."},{"Title":"O Pioneers! (Lrs Large Print Heritage Series)","review":"In this, the author's second published work, the author writes about that which she knew best, early pioneer life in Nebraska, the place to which she and her family moved in 1883 when she was a mere slip of a girl. She eventually attended the University of Nebraska, graduating in 1895, at a time when most girls did no such thing.In this work, the author was on very sure footing. Her clear, straightforward prose lends itself capably to the story of early pioneers who went to Nebraska and set down roots, weathering the exigencies that often plagued a newcomer to a particular region. It is a surprisingly unsentimental look at pioneer life.This thematically complex, but simply written story focuses primarily on Alexandra Bergson, the intelligent, independent, resourceful, and strong-willed daughter of pioneer, John Bergson. Upon his death he did what was then the nearly unthinkable. He left his land in the hands of his oldest child, his daughter, Alexandra, rather than in those of his sons, recognizing in his daughter those qualities that would ensure that his land would prosper under her stewardship.This then is the story of not only Alexandra but of that land and those whose sustenance depended upon its fruitfulness. The reader follows the Bergson clan as they live their lives and interact with their neighbors. Under Alexandra's skillful management, the Bergson farm prospers. As the farm prospers, so does its environs. The area becomes a bustling center of activity with more and more settlers developing the land around that of the Bergsons.Thematically, the book explores the vicissitudes of life, as well as its life-affirming moments. As in all lives, the characters in this book experience moments of high drama and great tragedy, as well as memorable moments of love and hate. All this is grounded within the context of pioneer life, with all its hardships and privations, as well as its occasional abundance. The author skillfully re-creates a melting pot of the many nationalities that cultivated the land known as Nebraska.This is a book that those who like reading about pioneer life will certainly enjoy, as will those who simply like a well-written book with a tale to tell. This classic novel was also adapted for a Hallmark Hall of Fame film, starring Jessica Lange in the role of Alexandra Bergson."},{"Title":"O Pioneers! (Lrs Large Print Heritage Series)","review":"This early Cather novel introduces readers to the majesty and the fury of the untamed prairie, when the mid west was yet Americca's frontier. It obliquely asks the question: How did the Land shape its people--mainly immigrants from Scandinavia, Bohemia and France--and how did the hopeful settlers, true Pioneers, shape and share the land? Who ultimately can ever own the prairie; can mere mortals seriously hold the undulating waves of grain in trust for future generations?Spanning some 17 years this gripping novel depicts the struggle to tame the midwest by a Swedish family, whose lives intertwine with those of their neighbors. Against hostile and unforgiving naturethe simple tale is spun out: a wise teenage girl inherits control of the family farm from her dying fathr, since she alone of his offspring understands the importance of retaining the land at all costs. Despite interferance by her resentful, short-sighted brothers, Alexandra does just that, revealing vison anddetermination beyond her years. For it is thus that she honors the memory of their father, keeping his faith in the ultimateproductivity o the savage land, when many neighbors sell out.Creating strong female characters--of which the land itself or Mother Nature may be considered a shadowy one--Cather glowingly describes the rugged beauty of the mid west: rolling grasses,powerful sunsets, intoxicating spring blossoms, with fluctuating, unpredictable weather. A farmer's life is an annual gamble, but then so is any pilgrimmage of the heart. Totally absorbed in running her successful farm, Alexandra does not look beneath the surface; she does not Notice things. Like the illicit love which blooms unbidden between her young brother, Emil, and Marie, the restless married woman next door. Add a wild, jealous husband into the equation and a volatile situation is inevitable.Cather's style draws the reader directly into the mindset of her main characters. Recognizing the danger signs before Alexandra does, we tremble with the realization of future emotional turbulence.The author' use of color to help us visualize her beloved landscape is remarkable, but most of all we marvel that she depicts the countryside itself as a non-verbal player in the repetitive tale of human stories. In the end readers must decide for themselves who is most to blame for the tragedy--if guilt must be parceled out. Her grim theme, that Happiness is easier to lose than to find, taints the backdrop of timid hope. The furrows of her novel are plowed and scored with attempts of her characters to &quot;possess a personality apart from the soil. &quot; This seemingly agrarian novel is less about the effect so grains of seed in the ground, than about the grains of love sown in a desperate search for joy in the hearts of the pioneers. How can Love survive in a barren wilderness? A true classic of human striving and passion."},{"Title":"O Pioneers!

It reaches into your heart and urges you to become part of the story when she says \\" a pioneer should be able to enjoy the idea of things more than the things themselves\\" you feel like your right there with Alexandra dreaming and willing the land to yield it's bountiful harvest. In O Pioneers, the land plays a cruel but enticing seductress, teasing with warm breezes and the next minuet lashing out with unremitting blizzards and droughts. Alexandra by patient coaxing and uncompromising determination manages to turn her dreams into reality but not before paying a high price.The book is primarily a love story with the Divide playing the willful lover everyone is trying to tame. Sparing no one, it leaves its mark shaping and molding the characters of its inhabitants for better or worse. The immigrant settlers who call the Divide home are as intriguing as the land they dwell on, being capable of despair, loneliness, happiness and yielding the fruits of their love as the land gives up it's corn and wheat. Cather ties this all together in the phrase\\"...and in the long grass, by the fence the last wild roses of the year opened their pink hearts to die\\" speaking at the same time of young lovers and the inevitable cycle of the land."},{"Title":"O Pioneers!

I try to save as much as possible, College is getting to be so much money Thanks"},{"Title":"O Pioneers! (Lrs Large Print Heritage Series)","review":"I came to this book expecting to hear a sermon about the value and merit of forging a hard-working life as a pioneer. While the difficulties of taming the wild land are always present in any book about pioneers, much of this story takes place after Alexandra has already achieved success, so the homage to work ethic that I expected was quite subdued.But the tale does some heavy moralizing nonetheless. Extramarital affairs are obviously condemned--even if the marriage in peril is very unhealthy for all involved. Emil and Marie understand that their love is sinful and forbidden, and Alexandra does not condemn Frank for his crime because, in a way, the lovers deserved retribution and Frank vengeance.Marie, as some have pointed out, is a symbol of the wild land around her. She encompasses all of the temperamental beauty, the exigent passion, the far-off and forbidden dreams of success in face of the hardship pioneers face. Emil's attraction to her parallels other stories of immigrants wanting to make their mark (and livelihoods) on an impossibly wild and beautiful land.Alexandra's love life is confusing at best. Though she never shows much interest in members of the opposite sex--to the point that I assumed she was gay or asexual--by the end she marries a childhood friend who has been far less successful in life, simply because life seems too hard alone. The point seems clear: no matter how intelligent a woman is or how hard she works, she needs a man in order to be complete.I can see why this little book is not as widely read as \\"My &Aacute;ntonia.\\" But I'm a sucker for a halfway decent pioneer story, so I enjoyed it.For a complete review, visit my site, Melody & Words!"},{"Title":"O Pioneers!

I have fallen in love with Willa Cather and recently purchased My Antonia to read as well -- this time, for pleasure.The book is very well-written and Cather knows how to make a story come alive on the pages of her books. The way in which Cather takes this story about a young woman and her life on the prairie is exceptional and provides the reader with an accurate, imaginative, telling look at life as it was at that time. The characters jump off the page and are built in such a way as to make them seem real-life, and their interactions with each other are incredibly realistic. It is also lovely to find a tale that does not have a perfect fairy-tale ending but yet looks at life as it truly happens -- and still ends up turning out in a beautiful way.I sat down to read this book with little enthusiasm... and less than two hours later, I found myself turning the last page with a sense of disappointment that it was over. It truly drew me in and captured my imagination in a way that only happens when the tale is exceptionally well-written. Could not be more pleased with the book.Additionally, the book came in pristine shape and was delivered in a timely, secure manner. Paper was of nice quality, and the cover is relatively thick cardboard that holds up to transportation well. Excellent purchase, and a full five stars."},{"Title":"O Pioneers! (Lrs Large Print Heritage Series)","review":"I remember reading My &Aacute;ntonia by Willa Cather years ago, for a high school English class. I can't really remember the book or what I thought about it, but for some reason I always think of it with distaste. Consequently, I wasn't particularly looking forward to reading O Pioneers!, but because it was short and available online, I decided to give it a try. And now I really need to reread My &Aacute;ntonia because I think that for years I may have been dismissing a gem.O Pioneers! is an enchanting account of a Swedish immigrant pioneer family struggling to make a living on the Nebraska plains. Recognizing good sense and business talent in his oldest child, a daughter named Alexandra, a father instructs his sons to follow Alexandra's counsel in running the land and, above all, to keep the land. Alexandra is an intelligent, independent woman whose risk-taking and innovation causes the family to prosper. However, her willingness to break with convention is not favored in the rigid Swedish immigrant community, and her two oldest brothers grow resentful of her independence and her desire to give their younger brother opportunities, like college, that the three older children never had.Willa Cather manages to bring the prairie alive, and, briefly, conveys their beauty and a love of the land. Even though the novel is only around 130 pages (depending on the version), it is long enough to make a reader sympathize with the struggles of the characters and sense their lost loves and dreams before they fully realize the losses themselves. Some themes could be explored in more detail, but the novel is a joy to read and its brevity may be, in part, what makes it so sweet.For more reviews, visit my blog, Life Off the Shelf."},{"Title":"O Pioneers!

(Lrs Large Print Heritage Series)","review":"Willa Cather offers many insights as she informs us of the lives of the Swedish immigrant family the Bergsons in rural Nebraska in the early 20th century. Central to this story is the strength and resourcefulness of Alexandra Bergson, who we first meet in her teens, the de facto leader of her family--much to the consternation of her less able brothers Lou and Oscar. The ever observant author enriches her novel with insightful details that makes her imagined world startlingly real--as the reader thinks to himself \\"yeah, come to think of it--things are like that!\\" I think of the ironic observation that the wives of Alexandra's brother loved their husbands with a love tinged with fear. Her description of the dangerous cold of the Midwestern winter at the opining of the novel reminds me of the first Midwestern winters that I endured--and the realization that one could die of exposure much more easily than in Eastern winters. Alexandra's success in business--going way beyond her brothers--reminds me of my own realization that a business once owned by my family would have fared much better if it had been run by my own very clever grandmother instead of her less able brother who had inherited the business."},{"Title":"O Pioneers! (Lrs Large Print Heritage Series)","review":"Clarity, economy of words which are filled with emotion. The classics remain so for a reason. Loved this book!!!"},{"Title":"O Pioneers! (Lrs Large Print Heritage Series)","review":"Her home is just a few parcels of land situated on the quaint Nebraskan plains. And Alexandra Bergman would die for it. Her father actually did--and it's up to her to pick up the pieces and maintain this homestead through all seasons: the most buoyant of summers, the most desolate of winters. Some friends and family members walk with her as others dash off into the horizon to try their luck elsewhere. If this were just a dissertation on how to grow a literal harvest or a simple atmospheric sketch with little plot or relevance, Cather might have floundered. But it's much more than that. This is a rich tapestry filled with how people can rediscover who they are and where they belong in the world, finding their identities not just in the soil but in those who help till it. The tragic climax is breathtaking as Alexandra learns that even some things can't be replanted--only the seeds of heartache, grief, forgiveness, and rebirth can be scattered in their place.Cather was surprised when this book became popular because she claimed that she wrote it mostly for herself. But her enthusiasm for the places so dear to her is infectious in this novel. We have the privilege of experiencing joy and sorrow alongside Alexandra, fierce and resolute even when she's teetering over from exhaustion, waiting for something in her sacred fields to breathe life into her again. This is an undeniably moving tribute to the heartland of America and to one woman who isn't afraid to firmly cultivate her own sense of purpose, even if all the crops around her would wither away, never to bear fruit again."},{"Title":"O Pioneers!

What a surprise - the library book was rather worn, old, and not the least bit inviting. However when I met Alexandra Bergstrom and her family, I kept reaching for the book at every opportunity. In a culture where it's all about immediate gratification and \\"me, me, me\\" it was refreshing to read about a woman who had a much bigger picture and found joy in things so foreign to many of us living today. You will want to be the kind of person you meet in Alexandra ... with a passion for her land, a love for her family and tremendous dedication to her friends and community.I will find more of Cather to read for sure!

She goes through so much to keep and preserve the land. she makes it dependable, workable, and profitable, while keeping in the family, like her father had wished. Along the path of childhood to adulthood, with this goal in mind, Alexandra faces many challanges. She almost gets married twice. Two of her brothers refuse to speak to her. The third brother has an affair with a married woman. But this whole journey will only make her stronger.The book was generally well written overall. At the beginning, it was a little slow. The 1st chapter is about a girl going to the doctor and then a little boy getting his kitten down from a pole before they go home. It picks up after that though. Overall, it was a really good read.Willa Cather wrote this book in 1913. Cather is a Pulitzer Prize winning author, for her book &quot;My Antonia&quot;, and has written more than 15 books. Cather was one of the most distinguished American writers of the late Ninetieth and early Twentieth century."},{"Title":"O Pioneers! (Lrs Large Print Heritage Series)","review":"O Pioneers by Willa Cather is a descent read. It is an interesting story about how a women survives because of her love of the land. I liked the characters pretty well, and I really do enjoy Willa Cather's style of writing. I just do not think that this was her best novel or that it reached its potential. This novel was supposed to be about how the land held Alexandra and how she survived for and with it. Cather seemed to get off of her thesis, though. She tells page after page of the love affair between Marie and Emil and gets of topic. She could have developed Alexandra's relationships more thoroughly. Some technical aspects or the novel become bothersome, also. Some of the dialogue seems false and the verb tense Cather writes in switches at places in the novel. Overall, the novel is worth reading, but it would be better to read her other works like My Antonia and Death Comes for the Archbishop.p.s. I did like that Cather acknowledged Sarah Orne Jewett with the dedication."},{"Title":"O Pioneers! (Lrs Large Print Heritage Series)","review":"\\"O Pioneers!\\" has a very angelic and unceremonious feel to it when read. The matters were of dire importance, but the tone in which Willa Cather wrote was very effortless and straightforward. Alexandra Bergson is a somewhat stereotypical character, when speaking in terms of feminine headstrong roles, and her brothers are the stereotypical side characters who do not agree with their older sister and her role in making \\"manly\\" decisions. I admired Alexandra for her capabilities and proficiency, but after the climax, I lost respect for her as a female protagonist. Her complete forgiveness of Frank Shabata, and her blaming of Marie and Emil were irrational, atypical, and inconceivable. Her friendly relationship with Carl was underdeveloped and undistinguished. My last complaint concerning Cather's writing style is her disorganization of chapters and time frames. I had no idea what time and place the next chapter would bring, and I felt very disoriented because of it. Cather wrote the era wonderfully, and the splendor of the land came through well enough. The era is what kept my attention, after my disgust with Alexandra. I \\"sorta\\" recommend."},{"Title":"O Pioneers!

Some may think that Cather's style is pleasantly simple and moving, but it only moves me to read another book by another author."},{"Title":"O Pioneers! (Lrs Large Print Heritage Series)","review":"O Pioneers! is talky, talky, talky and boring, boring, boring. No wonder high school students hate it. I am far past high school, but I could not get through it, either. Cather seems to write chapters for the sake of cranking out pages, but many chapters go nowhere and lead to nothing. Like one chapter where she goes with her brothers to visit a strange Russian named Ivar who has peculiar ideas on how to raise pigs. Does she go into the hog butchering business? Or big time hog farming? Does she even follow his advice? No. Nothing happens and the hogs don't come up again. And her endless descriptions of the scenery are enough to make me wish she got stranded in the Gobi Desert. She just can't stop with the scenery, which makes up a good half of the book. Maybe she should have been a painter."},{"Title":"O Pioneers! (Lrs Large Print Heritage Series)","review":"The book starts off great, with a warmth and vividness that makes one care about the characters. Unfortunately, that brief spark of brilliance fades all too quickly. We soon find ourselves mired in a muck of endless drivel. Early on, a time leap propels us 16 years forward where we lose a sense for who the characters are. From that point on, the author gives us no more than a two-dimensional portrait of our heroine and her family. In depth descriptions are reserved for the landscapes and boring events, instead of for the emotions that motive the main characters. Inexplicably, some of the characters turn into brooding morons with (seemingly) no redeeming qualities. This work left much to be desired. Read &quot;O Pioneers&quot; only if you want to see how a great start means...absolutely nothing! For more enjoyable reading try authors like Lucy Maud Montgomery, Henry James, or Jane Austen...you'll be glad you did!"},{"Title":"O Pioneers! (Lrs Large Print Heritage Series)","review":"The year after the Whartonesque (and unexceptional) \\"Alexander's Bridge,\\" Cather published \\"O Pioneers!\\"--the book the she was in later years to call her second first novel. Although relatively brief, it unfolds like a frontier epic, and reading it now, it's hard to believe that Cather, living in Greenwich Village at the time, doubted whether anyone would be interested in the story of struggling Nebraskan farmers. As she wrote to a friend, with \\"this one I hit the home pasture and found that I was Yance Sorgeson [a rich farmer] and not Henry James.\\"\\"O Pioneers,\\" for all its understated countrified charm, is not without the ingredients of a torrid drama: familial dispute, an adulterous affair, a double murder. The novel began its life as two stories, which Cather brilliantly melded into an ambitious whole. The first features Alexandra Bergson, who assumes proprietorship of her family's farm when her father dies, leaving her with three brothers. After several lean years, she nurtures the family estate, holding on to the land when many of her neighbors give up and return East. To insure the prosperity of her three siblings, Alexandra sacrifices her own comforts and passions--but never her independence. Yet the two older brothers first respect and then resent Alexandra's astute management--and they especially begrudge the favoritism she shows to their college-educated younger brother, Emil, whom she indulges with the goal of advancing him in the world beyond.The second narrative concerns Emil and Marie Tovesky, who are childhood friends whose companionship flowers into romance after Marie marries the ornery, bitter, and somewhat mad Frank Shabata. If Alexandra's story provides the novel with its atmosphere and theme, the Emil-Marie story supplies the action and tension. Intermingled with these two storylines are depictions of rustic events and folksy characters (especially memorable is Ivar, a shaggy-haired, barefooted, back-to-nature eccentric).Even a century later, \\"O Pioneers!\\" packs a wallop. But, more powerfully, it's an ode to the early settlers and to their struggle to survive. \\"The land belongs to the future,\\" Alexandra remarks at the end. \\"We come and go, but the land is always there.\\""},{"Title":"O Pioneers! (Lrs Large Print Heritage Series)","review":"In the hulking box of textbooks that I hauled to my dorm on the day before classes began last semester, there was a small, out-of-place, [...] copy of O Pioneers by Willa Cather. Apparently, my English Composition instructor thought it best our class read \\"a good piece of English writing\\" before we embarked on our journal entries and research papers. I was not overly eager to read O Pioneers. It appeared to be one of those literary standards I saw while perusing Barnes and Noble, unattractive, unoriginally decorated little books with a quaint painting of older time on the cover and obligatory stamping of the publishers name followed by the word, \\"classic;\\" as if the publishers themselves were too unenthusiastic about them for any serious sales pitch. I always headed for the William S. Burroughs or Robert A. Heinlein sections, rarely paying attention to the drab dinosaurs.Well, as the old clich&eacute; goes, don't judge a book by its cover. O Pioneers is an excellent tale of the trials and hardships of the gritty immigrants and pheasants who staked a claim and worked under a dream in the unsettled regions of this country so long ago. The realistic, headstrong, engaging characters live lives of poignant dedication, labor and loneliness as they swim around in the authoress' exquisite imagery (\\"The pasture was flooded with light; every clump of ironweed or snow-on-the mountain threw a long shadow and the golden light seemed to be rippling through the curly grass like the tide racing in\\"). Ms. Cather obviously tested every sentence for its weight, impact and flavor. The cold, dusty fields of Nebraska are vibrantly brought to life by this blatant perfectionist.I was extremely impressed with this novel. Not impressed enough to change my usual literary diet from cult classics and science fiction masterpieces, but I certainly enjoyed it enough to save my unpretentious edition of O Pioneers from being carted back to the bookstore when they began buying books to sell used for the next semester."},{"Title":"O Pioneers! (Lrs Large Print Heritage Series)","review":"Although not stated in the description, this is a rewritten version of the original classic. Save your time and money, and go with the original version."},{"Title":"O Pioneers! (Lrs Large Print Heritage Series)","review":"This novel revolves around Alexandra Bergson, a Swedish immigrant tilling land in Nebraska. Few female characters in American literature have her feminine strength. Maybe Dagny Taggart of Ayn Rand's \\"Atlas Shrugged?\\" Or Margaret Mitchell's Scarlett O'Hara of \\"Gone With the Wind.\\" Scarlett and Alexandra are the adhesive, business-minded, matronly women who run things in an otherwise man's world.Having lived in the midwest for numerous years, albeit in the 1970's, I met people who mirrored the mannerisms and had the backgrounds of Alexandra. Like Alexandra, their parents left continental or scandinavian Europe for Nebraska's farmland. These people are as pure as the black loess within which the corn and wheat survive.Like many novels of this generation, this tale involves tragedy. A great tragedy. And, like Rand, many conversations about the seemingly obvious include contrarian statements which loudly ring otherwise unobserved truths. For instance, Alexandra seeks to pardon the murderer of those closest to her - she seeks to pardon someone whose single act clouded and depressed her soul forever. But, when you read this novel, you will agree with her decision. One hundred percent.Agrarian life, sometimes subjected to nature's entropy, is more than a seemingly simple venture. The character of Alexandra also is more complex than her appearance. She was a genius at farming. Today's farmers rotate to keep the land's fertility alive - grow alfalfa (to put nitrogen in the soil) to replenish what corn depletes. Alexandra speaks about rotating her soil because she heard about the concept from a \\"college boy.\\" They laughed at her. She grew wheat as the revenue stream from the land would increase. They laughed at her. Like Taggart and O'Hara, she was right while the dumb men around her were not. Unlike Taggart or O'Hara, Alexandra moves without confrontation, without eddy, without notice.She writes without wasting words, many details are delivered with few words. Her style reminds me of J.M. Coetzee or V.S. Naipaul. She is in very good company. She is a novelist I will read again."},{"Title":"O Pioneers! (Lrs Large Print Heritage Series)","review":"Growing up in Red Cloud, Nebraska, Willa Cather's individuality and great intellect flourised rapidly. Her childhood experiences and surroundings aided her transformation into an independent and determined woman who was both willing and capable of meeting a challenge. Many of these characteristics are prevalent in her novel, O Pioneers!. Cather explores both the intimidating and rewarding aspects of the wild land as her main heroine, Alexandra Bergson, battles difficulty after difficulty, eventually triumphing over her struggles. Through the utilization of powerful, intense diction, personification, and references to the heroic woman theme, Willa Cather is clearly trying to move the reader toward her belief that human beings are closely connected to the land, and must come to the realization that nothing valuable in life comes easy. From the very beginning of her story, to the very end, Cather delivers a message that captures the true essence of the pioneer experience, and depicts the myriad of moods and emotions that accompany struggle and success. The color gray is woven throughout chapter one of section one. This technique creates a feeling of gloom and associates the land with depression and despair. Carl, a close friend of Alexandra's, is a &quot;thin, frail boy,&quot; which hints at the scarcity of food and the presence of hard times. Feelings of isolation and loneliness fill the pages as Alexandra claims &quot;Carl is the only friend I have ever had.&quot; However, the &quot;three years of drought and failure&quot; cannot keep the heroine from eventually overcoming her struggles, and finally reaching the point where she is able to enjoy the reward of &quot;rich soil&quot; and &quot;heavy harvests&quot; bestowed upon her by the land. Through Alexandra's determination and willingness to toil in concert with the land instead of in opposition to it, prosperity now surrounds her. The land, through personification, becomes a significant character as the story progresses. Nature comes to life as the &quot;sun leaped over the prairie, and all the small creatures...began to tune their tiny instruments.&quot; The land &quot;had its little joke. It pretended to be poor because nobody knew how to work it right.&quot; When Alexandra learns to work with the land and not against it, the land &quot;worked itself.&quot; This illustrates the trust and faith that Alexandra has in the fields. She seems to feel the connection that exists between her and the ground into which she has poured her heart and soul, and she prospers from that relatioship. Throughout the novel, Cather coninues to personify the land, closely associating it with human failure and human success. Lastly, the heroic woman theme creates an environment where strength and courage come together to overcome criticism and prejudice. The fact that Alexadra's father leaves her with the land, instead of her two brothers, relates to this particular theme. Her &quot;glance of Amazonian fierceness&quot; reveals a strong, bold side of Alexandra that becomes essential in overcoming the everyday prejudice that haunts her. As on witnesses the hardships encountered by Alexandra, feelings of doubt can surface. However, Alexandra proves that &quot;it is in the soil that she expresses herself best.&quot; Throughout her novel, Willa Cather seems to be telling the reader that the true essence of the pioneer experience involves an acceptance of the absence of prosperity, and knowing that through faith and hard work, &quot;Oh, it would come again!&quot;"},{"Title":"O Pioneers!

(Lrs Large Print Heritage Series)","review":"The Great Plains may be the most overlooked of American landscapes, with the result that we have very few first hand accounts of what it was like to live in a sea of grass. Lacking the &quot;in your face&quot; drama of the mountains or the seashore, it takes a writer of Cather's ability to capture the subtle drama of the prairie. Both O Pioneers! and My Antonia, capture that drama.I think that an argument can be made that Cather was one of our first environmental writers since her prairie is, in a sense, Thoreau's forest. That is, she raised people's consciousness to its importance even as it was disappearing. The fact that she did it in the context of first rate novels, undoubtably makes her one of our most readable enviromental writers.It's Cather's love of the Great Plains and the way they shaped the people who tried to tame them, that gets her my vote for patron saint of the American prairie. And nowhere is that love more evident than O Pioneers! and My Antonia."},{"Title":"O Pioneers! (Lrs Large Print Heritage Series)","review":"Swedes homesteading on the short grass prairie! How come I'd never read this book?Actually, this comes close to being the true story of my mother's immigrant farmer family, who were Germans of a sort. Alexandra, the powerful woman at the heart of Cather's story, the one pictured on the cover of this edition, reminds me powerfully of my great-grandmother, who was just a generation younger than Willa Cather. Alexandra's two selfish and small-minded brothers, Lou and Oscar, are spitting-images of my grandfather and his brother. Frank Shabata, the sorry husband, is 'awful close' to a portrayal of my father. The verisimilitude of Cather's characters, so fair and square in depicting both their strength and their frailty, is her best accomplishment as a writer. You won't need family photos of these characters to recognize them as real people.The part that's not true to the history of my family as pioneers and sod-busters is also what's not true about the novel. The real people were more ordinary, lived more one-day-at-a-time, didn't have the luxury to leaping across a flat and commonplace decade from one chapter to the next. They had to get up in the morning, drudge through the day, cut their toe nails and scrape their corns, go to bed too worried about chores and bills to dream big dreams. But who would want to read about them?\\"O Pioneers!\\" is a triple love story, starring three handsome men and two beautiful women. One couple ends up happy... as happy as they're able to be, anyway. There's plenty of passion, frustration, jealousy, misunderstanding to make a Hollywood blockbuster on the scale of \\"Giant\\". For all I know, there have been ten films of this novel already. That's weakness of the book, one way it falls short of really deserving to be called a \\"world's classic\\", that it was ripe for Hollywood when it was published in 1913, even before Hollywood was ripe for it.\\"O Pioneers!\\" is also a love song to the Land, to the beauty and bounty of the short grass prairie. It begins with a description of the hard-scrabble homestead and it ends with a paean to the \\"...fortunate country, that is one day to receive hearts like Alexandra's into its bosom, to give them out again in the yellow wheat, in the rustling corn, in the shining eyes of youth!\\" Now that's a 'right pretty' sentiment, but it's not terribly accurate. Teachers, don't assign this book as a depiction of the history of the Midwest. Some few sodbusters may have felt ennobled by their land, but a lot more of them were plenty ready to sell to greenhorns and move farther west or south. That's the true story of the agricultural frontier in America, from colonial days through the Ohio Valley and onward to the Dakotas; those who got rich did so more by selling than by clinging to the soil. Cather herself may have loved the western skies but she wrote under the skies of eastern and European cities. Those shining-eyed Young have been fleeing to either coast since the first pioneers gave birth to them. The prosperity that Cather portrayed among the Swedes and Bohemians of Nebraska in the years before WW1 was an artifact of the world economy. It was a bubble. It collapsed soon enough. Nebraska and the Dakotas haven't thrived in the way \\"O Pioneers!\\" envisioned. Declining populations, stagnant and dying towns, narrow-minded reactionary social and political grudges against the very sort of people that Willa Cather became! The story of Alexandra and Carl ends at the brink of their future; I can almost promise you that if they'd lived as long as my great-grandmother, they'd have retired in Arizona.But there is a resonant grandeur to \\"O Pioneers!\\" It's worth reading, in order to sense the courage and hardihood of the farmer-immigrants who built the heartland of America. It's not as colorful or touching as the work of Ole Rolvaag; \\"Giants in the Earth\\" and its sequels are the greatest 'world's classics' of the American West. It's not as honest and accurate as Hamlin Garland's \\"Main-Traveled Roads\\". It's nowhere near the epic adventure, the magniloquent sweep, of the four Emigrant novels of the Swedish writer Vilhelm Moberg. But once you pick it up, you won't be tempted to read anything else until you finish it, and once you finish it, the woman Alexandra will stick in the family-photo album of your mind."},{"Title":"O Pioneers! (Lrs Large Print Heritage Series)","review":"In this, the author's second published work, the author writes about that which she knew best, early pioneer life in Nebraska, the place to which she and her family moved in 1883 when she was a mere slip of a girl. She eventually attended the University of Nebraska, graduating in 1995, at a time when most girls did no such thing.In this work, the author was on very sure footing. Her clear, straightforward prose lends itself capably to the story of early pioneers who went to Nebraska and set down roots, weathering the exigencies that often plagued a newcomer to a particular region. It is a surprisingly unsentimental look at pioneer life.This thematically complex, but simply written story focuses primarily on Alexandra Bergson, the intelligent, independent, resourceful, and strong-willed daughter of pioneer John Bergson. Upon his death he did what was then the nearly unthinkable. He left his land in the hands of his oldest child, his daughter, Alexandra, rather than in those of his sons, recognizing in his daughter those qualities that would ensure that his land would prosper under her stewardship.This then is the story of not only Alexandra but of that land and those whose sustenance depended upon its fruitfulness. The reader follows the Bergson clan as they live their lives and interact with their neighbors. Under Alexandra's skillful management, the Bergson farm prospers. As the farm prospers, so does its environs, as the area becomes a bustling center of activity with more and more settlers developing the land around that of the Bergsons.Thematically, the book explores the vicissitudes of life, as well as its life-affirming moments. As in all lives, the characters in this book experience moments of high drama and great tragedy, as well as memorable moments of love and hate. All this is grounded within the context of pioneer life, with all its hardships and privations, as well as its occasional abundance. The author skillfully re-creates a melting pot of the many nationalities that cultivated the land known as Nebraska.This is a book that those who like reading about pioneer life will certainly enjoy, as will those who simply like a well-written book with a tale to tell. This classic novel was also adapted for a Hallmark Hall of Fame film, starring Jessica Lange in the role of Alexandra Bergson."},{"Title":"O Pioneers!

If you have a sentimental side but still want intelligent writing, this novel is for you."},{"Title":"O Pioneers! (Lrs Large Print Heritage Series)","review":"If you enjoy Meg Hutchinson's novels, you will also enjoy classic novelist Willa Cather. They both have unique, yet simpatico literary voices, and are worth the investment of your time moreso than many of today's contemporary writers.O Pioneers is rich in detail, making the descriptions of the land and the people so tangible and believable, you will come to believe you know everything about them. Our protagonist, swedish immigrant Alexandra Bergson, is a marvelous pillar of strength, ambition, and determination as she takes over her father's farm following his death. Unlike her brothers, she is willful and able enough to take the Bergson land and make a success of it while shrewdly dealing with other farmers who couldn't cut it, building a successful, progressive little cultural mecca for herself and those who know and come to love her. Fighting against closed-mindedness and scoffing, denied love, and the tragic loss of her beloved younger brother Emil, she comes to gain the respect of all others around her. Beautifully written, personable, and proving there is nothing new under the sun when it comes to human relations, Alexandra is the truest of all pioneers: kindness, selflessness, compassion, and loyalty on top of being tough, determined, and stubborn, Willa Cather has truly created one of the first great early feminists in classic American literature."},{"Title":"O Pioneers! (Lrs Large Print Heritage Series)","review":"I have to give this classic a mixed review. The tone, for the most part, was sweet and wistful, but the action was almost painfully slow. It moved, in fact, something like the seasons of the year, which along with the land, were characters in this play. The story of immigrant Nebraskan farmers of the early 20th century is mostly about how they lived rather than things that happened, and it takes about about three-quarters of the book before the action finally picks up a little.I liked Willa Cather's eloquent and flowing style and the coloring of the land and its people. It reminded me a bit of an old, tinted, softly glowing, romantic movie of maybe 50 years ago. I also liked her animation of the land and weather, although I was bothered a little by its pantheistic flavor; the land, in fact, was the most animated character of the book.In short, if you like a journey better than its destination, this is not a bad book. For myself, I need both journey and destination."},{"Title":"O Pioneers! (Lrs Large Print Heritage Series)","review":"This book represents the pinnacle of American literature. From its beautiful descriptions of the various characters to its concise, yet not quite Hemingway-like writing style. To its deftly crafted plot. This book is an outstanding classic by its own right. What makes this book great is that it is based on character depiction instead of simply writing a book with simple plots. It focuses on people, coping with their strggles and joy, love and hate.The book centers around Alexandra Bergson, a strong-willed, hard-working pioneer woman who has struck rich farming in Nebreska. Yet most of the action are not centered on her but rather on the people around her. She has three brothers, one of whom, Emil, who is 18 years younger than Alexandra, is Alexandra's favorite. He has gone to university and received an education. However, not everyone around Alexandra was okay with Emil. From the 2 other jealous brothers that Alexandra has to the fanatic Ivar, and to Frank, the wife of Marie, who Emil loves with all his heart. Soon, as we find out, things went diastrous for Emil as one finds that love can carry its havoc with a person.As stated from the introduction of this book. \\"O Pioneers\\" had created a new kind of fiction with a new kind of hero in American literature. As seen from Alexandra in the book. With her outstanding qualities as a strong-willed woman capable of caring and love, and at the same time be a true pioneer for this country. Making her the most marked heroine in American literature.Loosely a historic novel. This book has some historical preferences in it. The early days of Nebreska was indeed a time for the brave and the adventurous. The time setting of this novel was probably in the 1880's. Yet, despite many claims as to what kind of book this is. It is no doubt, a classic that will live on for the ages."},{"Title":"O Pioneers! (Lrs Large Print Heritage Series)","review":"O Pioneers is a very fine tale. Willa Cather's descriptions of the farm lands and countryside are wonderful. This story centers on a very strong woman , Alexandra who loved her land. The only part of the story that I found disturbing was Alexandra's view that the tragedy that took place at the end was Marie's fault. Willa Cather was a head of her time in her portrayl of women characters but, in Marie's case her views appear to be those of her time. I liked this story very much."},{"Title":"O Pioneers! (Lrs Large Print Heritage Series)","review":"In this, the author's second published work, the author writes about that which she knew best, early pioneer life in Nebraska, the place to which she and her family moved in 1883 when she was a mere slip of a girl. She eventually attended the University of Nebraska, graduating in 1995, at a time when most girls did no such thing.In this work, the author was on very sure footing. Her clear, straightforward prose lends itself capably to the story of early pioneers who went to Nebraska and set down roots, weathering the exigencies that often plagued a newcomer to a particular region. It is a surprisingly unsentimental look at pioneer life.This thematically complex, but simply written story focuses primarily on Alexandra Bergson, the intelligent, independent, resourceful, and strong-willed daughter of pioneer John Bergson. Upon his death he did what was then the nearly unthinkable. He left his land in the hands of his oldest child, his daughter, Alexandra, rather than in those of his sons, recognizing in his daughter those qualities that would ensure that his land would prosper under her stewardship.This then is the story of not only Alexandra but of that land and those whose sustenance depended upon its fruitfulness. The reader follows the Bergson clan as they live their lives and interact with their neighbors. Under Alexandra's skillful management, the Bergson farm prospers. As the farm prospers, so does its environs, as the area becomes a bustling center of activity with more and more settlers developing the land around that of the Bergsons.Thematically, the book explores the vicissitudes of life, as well as its life-affirming moments. As in all lives, the characters in this book experience moments of high drama and great tragedy, as well as memorable moments of love and hate. All this is grounded within the context of pioneer life, with all its hardships and privations, as well as its occasional abundance. The author skillfully re-creates a melting pot of the many nationalities that cultivated the land known as Nebraska.This is a book that those who like reading about pioneer life will certainly enjoy, as will those who simply like a well-written book with a tale to tell. This classic novel was also adapted for a Hallmark Hall of Fame film, starring Jessica Lange in the role of Alexandra Bergson."},{"Title":"O Pioneers!

The writing is beautiful and the characters memorable. Alexandra is a great yet flawed protagonist and her struggles throughout her life reflect the universal struggles that occupy us all. Some reviewer called this book &quot;dated&quot; and I strongly disagree. There is something here for all human beings living in 2004."},{"Title":"O Pioneers!

It is a story of human endurance, compassion, lonliness, rage and ultimately love, with a strong feeling of reality."},{"Title":"The New Paradigm","review":"Subtitled \\"A Confrontation Between Physics and The Paranormal Phenomena,\\" this book was written by a distinguished scientist who has been able to see the interconnectedness between science and spirituality rather than a conflict between them. According to the biographical information provided on the back cover and gathered on the Internet, Bockris received his Ph.D. from the Imperial College of Science and Technology at the University of London in 1945. In 1953, after moving from the UK to the US, he became a full professor at the University of Pennsylvania for nearly 20 years, then moved on to Flinders University of South Australia for seven years. He returned to the US in 1978, doing research at Texas A & M University until 1997. He has published 704 papers and 22 books in fields such as electrochemistry, energy chemistry, the hydrogen economy and nuclear electrochemistry.While at Texas A & M and holding the title of \\"Distinguished Professor,\\" Bockris experienced much ridicule and rejection from colleagues, including denial of emeritus status, over his ideas on such controversial areas as cold fusion and low-energy nuclear reactions. As he states in the book, his ideas simply did not fit the scientific paradigm that most scientists are locked into.\\"It is simply hubris - that exaggerated pride in one's own achievements which means that - and this applies in particular to professors at universities - those whose careers have been built upon certain theories - existing viewpoints - and who have taught a science based on these, are horrified to learn that they may not have been speaking the truth,\\" Bockris explains the resistance to ideas outside of the existing scientific paradigm. He blames these closed-minded scientists for leading many in the West to approach death without hope, thereby giving rise to a more materialistic and hedonistic world. . Much of the book deals with the existing scientific paradigm and the downside of the \\"progress\\" it has brought, including overpopulation, resource exhaustion, unacceptable pollution, global warming, and catastrophic climate changes.An early chapter is devoted to examining the evolution of \\"scientism,\\" beginning with Roger Bacon and continuing on through Copernicus, Francis Bacon, Galileo, Kepler, Newton, Leibniz, Darwin, and others. The author discusses the concomitant philosophy accompanying the advances in science, calling Nietzsche \\"the most powerful and destructive philosopher affecting the breakdown of the Greek philosophy accepted in the West from the 13th Century.\\"Bockris goes on to discuss evidence for the paranormal, including telepathy, near-death experiences, out-of-body travel, mediumship, reincarnation, apparitions, possession, distant healing, and other phenomena. Scientists reject the evidence, he says, primarily because most of them are ignorant of it and afraid to touch it, out of fear that \\"acceptance would be equivalent to pulling the house down.\\" As for the often-heard claim that paranormal phenomena does not lend itself to replication, Bockris mentions a number of natural phenomena not subject to reproducibility that are accepted by science.With more and more research in parapsychology, Bockris sees some \\"cracks in the wall\\" and an emerging \\"New Paradigm,\\" one with a spiritual component. \\"Materialism can no longer be the basis of public philosophy,\\" he writes. \\"Living beings are not simply sophisticated machines. People do not cease to exist at the time of \`death'...Clear messages are being sent by \\"dead\\" people through sensitives.\\"For the open-minded reader who is concerned about the disintegration of Western Culture, Bockris offers much wisdom, enlightenment and hope."},{"Title":"Freefall","review":"This book was okay. It was extraaaaa long and I thought a lot of it could have been cut out. I never really connected with the characters. The use of the Hawaiian dialect, or whatever it was, really started to get on my nerves. But the plot did pick up after maybe the first 150 pages. I loved Kristen Heitzmann's older books and have bought one of her series, but all her new stuff just doesn't interest me."},{"Title":"Freefall","review":"When I started reading this book, it didn't grab my attention. I kept at it and then it picked up or to be trite \\"the plot thickened.\\" Reading a bit more, the author started throwing in mini \\"sermons.\\" I did not realize this was a \\"christian\\" book when I bought it. The \\"sermonizing\\" detracts from the story quite a bit. Basically, the story has the potential to be a great mystery/adventure/romance story if the author would clean up the \\"sermonizing\\" and fine-tune the editing. I was surprised that when a plane was flying from Hawaii to the mainland, the author referred to it as \\"transatlantic.\\" My geography may be a bit rusty but if part of the trip was transatlantic that plane went way out of the way! If you like christian fiction, mystery and romantic literature then this might be a good read for you. For me, I'll read the reviews a bit closer before I buy books in the future and I won't buy any more by this author."},{"Title":"Freefall","review":"OK.....let's start....if I wanted to read a book that mentions God and Jesus on almost every page, I would have gone to a Christian Book Store. I got this one without realizing that the book is mainly written to preach. My bad. Now on to the story....not too bad but so many references to the bible that it is hard to see the story. I skipped from the first third to the second third and then to the end....while the plot is an interesting concept, again the Christian references ruined the story for me. Lone person out....one star."},{"Title":"Freefall","review":"I was enjoying this book as an easy, fun read even though it was not totally capturing my attention, until a third of the way through it suddenly got religious. The characters all started talking about their faith in God, etc. It was literally every other sentence. I had no idea this was a \\"Christian\\" novel or I wouldn't have started reading it. Good thing I got it for free. I am surprised that the author waited until almost the middle to start preaching. I really didn't see that coming. Definitely not going to finish it and deleted it from my device. Unless you are into reading a novel that kind of tricks you into reading it only to then try to preach to you, don't bother."},{"Title":"Freefall","review":"Another reviewer summed up my feelings about this book pretty well. The dialogue is good, particularly between Jade and Cameron (Kai), the protagonists of Heitzmann's novel. The book could have benefited from some judicious editing, but overall the story flows along nicely, like a stream exiting a mountain.The one nagging problem I had was with Jade (aka, Gentry Fox, an actress). Why on earth would any Christian assume that he or she could immerse themselves in the world of acting, film and television and spend countless hours with nonbelievers and come out unscathed, faith intact, given what Paul wrote at 1 Corinthians 15:33 (\\"Bad associations spoil useful habits.\\")? Given that this culture in particular idolizes actors, why would any Christian put themselves on a pedestal this way? How is Christ honored by people screaming your name?Anyone who belives, as Jade/Gentry does, that their faith will remain intact in spite of their chosen occupation and the risks it entails is delusional.I finished the book in one sitting. It's really not that bad, considering some of the truly idiotic Christian fiction out there, but it's not the greatest novel I've ever read. I'm hoping some of Heitzmann's other books are better."},{"Title":"Freefall","review":"[...]The opening chapter of \\"Freefall\\" is one of the most catching I've read in a long while. \\"Jade\\" as she is temporarily called, discovers herself at the base of a waterfall, fighting the current for survival. Reaching the river's edge, she pulls herself free of the water and collapses. Upon waking, she finds a bloody gash on her head and a blank sheet for a memory.The scene switches to another of the waterfall's prey. However, this one is lying in a cave hidden behind the cascade. Legs broken on the rocks at the base of the falls, Jade's uncle is dependent on her for rescue. Little does he know that she is the victim of amnesia, and as his body deteriorates with disease and hunger, he waits for help in vain.Enter Cameron Pierce, investigator, skeptic, and all around gorgeous. Together he and Jade unravel the details of her life while trying to resist the intense attraction they feel for one another. After discovering Jade's real identity, they realize that the relationship they both crave was not meant to be...or was it?Set on the island of Kauai, Hawaii, \\"Freefall\\" lacks nothing in the way of large-scale action, intense plot twists, and a healthy dose of romance. Throughout this spellbinding novel, the same myriad questions that plague Jade keep the reader turning pages. Who is she? What is she doing in Kauai? What is this foreboding sense of evil that hovers in her sketchy memory? Was the fall an accident or something worse? As each question is answered, another takes its places, leaving the reader hanging to the last page.Not afraid to take romance a step further, Heitzman unabashedly reveals her characters' inner thoughts as they fiercely battle their premarital sexual desires. By doing so, she breathes life into them, and gives the novel an extra zing not normally found in Christian fiction. Every character is a complex creation that interacts well with the others creating drama and emotional turmoil that is all too real.I give \\"Freefall\\" two thumbs up and Heitzman my heartiest \\"you go, girl!\\""},{"Title":"Freefall","review":"My ONLY problem with the novel actually has nothing to do with the novel -- Heitzmann's a very talented writer. The Kindle version is chock full of typos. I have no idea how to report this to Amazon, though. If you plan on buying the Kindle version, you'd better be able to read past typos (it really bugged me).I've been a fan of Heitzmann's for a few years now, and this book didn't disappoint. With equal parts romance, suspense, and adventure, I put it down only to use the bathroom (and was exhausted the next day on only 2 hours of sleep).Quick synopsis: While hiking in Hawaii, a woman is pushed over a waterfall, hits her head on the rocks at the bottom, and is struck with amnesia. She drags herself to the closest backyard and meets Nica, who in turn involves her brother, Cameron, who is a fraud investigator on the west coast. Heitzmann deals realistically with the issues that believers face morally, and she does a fine job dealing with the amnesia situation (which could have been seriously cheesy). I don't think Cameron is a realistic male character, but then, when women write romantic fiction, we tend to make them sweeter than they really are. :)"},{"Title":"Freefall","review":"****This novel is a Christian romantic thriller, long (461 pages) but very satisfying. It is the story of an amnesic woman who awakens in a Kauai rainforest with no idea how she got there. It proceeds to tell her story, interspersed with the male lead's story---he is a detective who helps her and becomes involved in her life.The faith themes are gentle and loving and beautiful, even for those who do not share the Christian faith. The characters are well-drawn and interesting. It is an exciting read, full of adventure. Even though you know what the ending will be (it IS a romantic thriller, after all), you don't know how it will get there, so there is a lot of suspense, and a lot of action as well.For those of us who love Hawaii, it is pure pleasure to read and enjoy the Kauai setting and cultural references. Hawaii, faith, trust, healing from hurt, forgiveness, fame, privacy, dealing with struggles---these are all themes of Freefall.If you are interested in the above themes and relish an exciting Christian novel, Freefall is sure to please. Recommended.****"},{"Title":"Freefall","review":"On the Hawaiian island of Kauai, a young woman lurches down the side of Hanalei Mountains. Monica Pierce finds the severely injured female who also suffers from amnesia. Unable to ignore the woman's plight Monica takes her in to care for her, but also wisely informs her twin, insurance investigator Cameron, who lives on the mainland.Though he is unable to figure out Jane Doe's con, Cameron thinks the \\"guest\\" is faking her memory loss. However, as the woman regains glimpses of her recent ordeal, she fears that the person who was with her may remain in danger though she cannot identity the person or even the gender. Cameron investigates the little that is known until he and the amnesiac locate the missing man, her uncle, who is also ailing. She is movie star Gentry Fox coming to Hawaii with her uncle to escape allegation of her committing indiscretions. Threats to her life while also feeling guilty for not believing her and sensing her vulnerability, Cameron risks his wellbeing to keep the woman he now loves safe.Readers will fully enjoy Karen Heitzmann's superb romantic suspense thriller with the emphasis on the suspense that keeps growing until the final altercation. The action-packed story line is so vivid the audience will believe they are in Hawaii worrying about who the mainlander is. When that is solved, the plot spins into a woman in peril as someone wants Gentry dead. The romance between the movie star and the insurance investigator remains mostly in the background serving a \\"required\\" but unneeded purpose as fans will appreciate this exciting thriller.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Freefall","review":"I pretty much enjoyed this book all the way through. The relationship between the two main characters is well-done, and their conversation is often fairly witty. I was going to give this three stars because, as another reviewer said, it did need editing, It would tell one story (amnesia, being forced onto a plane at gunpoint) and then slack off to describe the emptiness of the Hollywood life, etc. Then the plot would pick up again. It didn't really seem tied together. She did a slapdash job of making the villian seem human, so much so that it might have been better if he was just fully evil. But it held my attention.Then, somewhere in the last half of the book, they misspelled Jane Austen's name. (That's right. I-N.) I paid for this book and I expected a professional job. Especially from Bethany House. It not only took me out of the story, it made me think that if a (paid) copy editor couldn't be bothered to read this thoroughly, why should I?"},{"Title":"Freefall","review":"I bought this book off of amazon.com, sight unseen - which is always a little risky, isn't it? But I've read almost every one of Kristen Heitzmann's novels and this one won't disappoint you. In fact, I couldn't put it down....so, once you start it, carve out some time, because it's one that will keep you up all night long, turning to the next chapter!I think it is longer than her other novels, but all the more to enjoy! One reviewer said 'racey' but I thought it all very inline with Christian romance, and nothing inappropriate, whatsoever. In fact, her main characters have morals and values with boundaries and limits that are superbly modeled here, but does not rob the reader of romance and our inherent thrill of witnessing a new relationship blossom with that new love tension!Heitzmann blends the suspense thriller with romance and gives us a look inside what trusting in God really means. Nothing religious, just a personal relationship with the Heavenly Father and authentic, real, raw faith of the story's characters.Heitzmann's writing doesn't follow formulas, like some books, where you KNOW from the beginning how the book will pan out before you even read it.Heitmann's plots are cleverly written and developed, with characters whom you know well enough by the end of the book, that you can almost imagine them walking off the pages right into your home!I would totally recommend this newest one of Heitzmann's and if you haven't read any of her others, \\"A Rush of Wings\\" is one of my favorites! I found her books by accident in the library one day with \\"Honor's Pledge\\" and ever since, became hooked!

However, when I got to about chapter 7 or so, it really started to pick up! I could NOT put it down. Jade/Gentry is an admirable character because of how she cares for everyone (excluding Cameron, because it takes a while for her to fully develop her trust/relationship with him). She is an in-depth character and I admired her faithfulness in God throughout the novel. It's suspenseful, entertaining, and a page turner once you hit the middle. Pay for it! I promise that you won't be sorry :)"},{"Title":"Freefall","review":"This is an older book by Kristen Heitzmann. As mentioned above, Jade had a fall in the mountain and lost her memory. Somehow she made it to Nica's doorstep but the how and why remains a mystery. As her memory starts to return, she realizes that she was not alone. She's frantic to rescue the person who was with her while Cameron doubts her every step of the way. When she finally convinces him that the person is real, they face the dangers of the mountain in an attempt to rescue this mystery person. As the story goes on and Jade starts to remember more, she realizes this was no accident. Ms. Heitzmann, really draws the reader in from the beginning and doesn't let go until the end!The characters of Jade and Cameron were well developed. It's important for me to be able to connect with the characters, the author did a great job of making them believable. The additional characters, Uncle Rob, Nica, Okelani, Allegra, Curt all brought different perspectives to the story. It was interesting to see the interplay between them all.The storyline has a nice easy flow and evoked several emotions in me during the telling of the story. The thought of losing my memory, of not knowing who I was is very scary. The author did a great job at drawing out this feeling. Her word choices really helped to set the scene and help the reader step through the story. What I liked most is that there wasn't a lot of unnecessary divergence from the main story.There is nothing that really bothered me about this story. I was reading it just about every free moment!From a Christian Perspective: This is what I consider a clean read. This is some kissing and some sexual references, but there is nothing graphic and only enough to support the story line. I don't recall any profanity or inappropriate language. Throughout the story, the redeeming value of God's love is reinforced and embraced. This is refreshing in a thriller.This book was a free download from Barnes & Noble.

Her writing is captivating, intriguing, intense, and hard to put down. FREEFALL did not disappoint. When a women wakes in the mountains of Kauai, she realizes not only does she not remember how she got there, but she doesn't even know who she is. She stumbles into a local's backyard named Monica. She's willing to offer help, but not on her own. She calls her brother, Cameron, an insurance investigator to help her out. Cameron's immediately suspicious, especially after the mystery woman refuses to go to the police. When a stray memory comes back, she realizes she wasn't in the mountains alone. Now she fears she's left someone for dead. Someone she can't even remember. Though Cameron doesn't trust her, he knows she's not well enough to go on her search alone. He follows her, berating her with questions and voicing his doubt about her so-called lost memory. When her traveling partner is found, her identity is found as well, along with her reasons for not wanting to involve the police. Finding out she's a celebrity in the middle of a scandal deepens Cameron's cynicism. But when he gets the feeling her accident might have been planned, he feels the need to hang around a little bit longer before writing her off as a celebrity looking for sympathy. What unfolds from there is a masterfully written story of suspense, romance and twists that keep you guessing until the end. I enjoyed every minute of FREEFALL and know you will too.

Jade's character is intrigueing and so is her relationship with Kia, but when Jade becomes Gentry Fox, an actress, the book loses character and I found myself struggling to keep reading until the end.This story relates real life and christian principles. It also opens the reader's eyes to the aspects of the world that christians live in everyday that aren't pure or filtered around them. Heirtzmann has a very open voice and appealing tone in her writing. The background and details to set the scenes in this story were descsriptive and alluring.I'm looking forward to seeing what she has in store for us through her next novel."},{"Title":"Freefall","review":"Freefall is my second book by this author,and after reading her Edge Of Recall and now this,I have to say how very impressed I am with her writing skills and originality.She takes me places that I have never been before and the historical lessons she gives are at the very least,very interesting,and at times fascinating.Her writing skills make me feel that I am there and experiencing the story myself.Having this story set in Kuai,Hawaii,I found especially pleasing,since I've always enjoyed an armchair love affair with Hawaii,but have never been there. Her descriptions really put me there.She also does an excellent job developing her characters.This is a wonderful,exciting mystery without the gore of so many mysteries,which causes me to avoid most in the 'mystery' genre.I have become an ardent fan of this author."},{"Title":"Freefall","review":"This is another wonderful book by Kristen Heitzmann. The characters were intriguing and refreshingly real. I loved the Hawaiian setting and with every page I turned I wanted to go myself! The pidgen dialect of some of the local characters was fun to read and added an element of authenticity. The character development and spiritual growth (as always in Kristen Heitzmann's books) rang true. I can't wait for the next book from my favorite author!"},{"Title":"Freefall","review":"It took FOREVER to finish this book but I couldn't stop. I loved all the characters but the religious diversions bogged down the story line. I accept that the characters had all found Jesus but entire chapters devoted to that were really unnecessary. I knew who the bad guy was very early in the book so that was pretty disappointing. I bought this book because I love Kauai & was excited about reading a story that featured it. I'll be more careful next time & I will NEVER read another book by this author!"},{"Title":"Freefall","review":"A detailed, intense & intertwined story that doesn't leave you confused as to who's who.. it sucks you in and you can't put it down. Don't miss it!"},{"Title":"Freefall","review":"This book will keep you on your seat not willing to put it down.It is set in beautiful Hawaii and Kristen has made the island just pop off the pages.There's lots of suspence and action as well as tender relationships.I like the fact that this book is clean and I'm not reading trash.Kristen is one of my favorite authors.I always enjoy reading her books knowing there will be lots of action and great life lessons.If you like this one you will also love her other books."},{"Title":"Freefall","review":"If you like CHRISTIAN mystery and or romance, TRY THIS ONE! It is the best one I've EVER read, bar none! From the first sentence to the last, it grabs you and won't let you go! For christians it brings many of the scripture meaning to life, and for the not so christian audience it will stir you heart, body, and soul. It is a wonderful book, read it now, you will never forget it."},{"Title":"Freefall","review":"The story was interesting, kept my attention. Writing was OK. I liked the perspective of life from a celebrity's viewpoint. I enjoyed the unexpected plot turns in the story. The story could have been shorter though."},{"Title":"Freefall","review":"The beginning chapter provided this book the potential to be a page turning thriller. Unfortunately, the reader had to plod through various points of view while the multitude of protagonists and antagonists rationalized every decision and action. If you enjoy soap operas, this book is for you."},{"Title":"Freefall","review":"I have to wonder who this book was written for. I doubt that a secular audience would tolerate the focus on the spiritual development of the characters. And I would hope that many Christians would have a problem with the moral standards of the book. The attraction between the main characters is mostly animal, from beginning to end. The plot, while twisty and well executed, is pure soap opera with all the ugliness of daytime TV. So, if you are not a devoted believer in Christ, you might be warned: some of the resolution in this book involves repentance and characters coming to trust God more fully. Believers, if you want wholehearted purity, you will not find it here. I guess if you are used to TV standards it probably seems tame. But I would sure hate for my teens to think that it is okay to spend the night with the person you are dating, or tell them you want to have sex with them, etc. I am sorry to have read this book."},{"Title":"Freefall","review":"Imagine a fear, a notion, so intense that you know you need to run. Imagine dragging yourself instinctively through dangerous mountains and treacherous waters to safety, not sure of where you are. Now imagine that not only do you not know where you are, but who you are. In Kristen Heitzmann's Freefall, Jade, later identified as the newly risen star, Gentry Fox, encounters these exact thoughts, feelings, and experiences.Freefall will capture readers with its intensity, honesty, and believability. Heitzmann emphasizes the importance of these attributes throughout her novel. Her use of Gentry's traumatic memory loss as a tool to lead us through every page, to give us important glimpses into the story, is phenomenal. A simple anecdote or experience tells us everything necessary about Gentry and her relationships with those around her.The relation of one character to another deeply impacts the plotline as a whole. (It is evident that Heitzmann understood the importance of character bonding when she wrote Freefall.) Cameron, \\"Kai,\\" and Gentry develop such a natural and connected relationship, overcoming their past and present, that we could easily meet them at the restaurant down the road or the church on the corner. The detail so meticulously put into every character and every scene allows us to identify with, and truly understand, the characters Heitzmann has brought to life.When Gentry Fox awakens in the mountains of Kauai, she has no idea who she is. She experiences severe pain, and she knows nothing beyond her need for safety. In order to find that safety, she walks with determination to the nearest home, which belongs to a Hawaiian local named Monica. When Monica sees this downtrodden young woman approaching her yard, she fears that once again someone has come to her to find peace but then will pass on to a better life. Despite this fear, she lets Gentry in, and she calls her brother, a fraud investigator, to help identify her. With the presence of Cameron comes some of Gentry's memory; at first, just enough for her to remember that she was not traveling alone. In time, more and more of her memories open up. As they reveal themselves and events unfold, Gentry realizes that someone was out to kill her uncle, whether or not she was in the line of fire.The reality of the characters throughout Freefall adds an element of closeness, a bond with the readers. The bond allows readers to view Cameron, Gentry, Monica, and all of the other characters as personal friends--not as fictional people only existing on paper. Heitzmann uses flaws and setbacks that we are all familiar with in our own lives to help us relate to the characters' lives. They have broken hearts, broken families, and even broken bodies. The characters experience and overcome real issues, through which they encourage others to do the same.Kristen Heitzmann will engage your heart, mind, and spirit with this well-written novel. A blend of drama, mystery, romance, and humor, Freefall satisfies the yearnings of many different types of readers. Whether folks read avidly or infrequently, for education or entertainment, all will be swept away by this incredible book. [...]"},{"Title":"Freefall","review":"Before reading this book, I had pretty much given up on the entire genre.I am a character reader first, and Christian books these days tend to substitute flesh and blood and feelings for sermonizing dialogue and overall sanitation. How am I to sympathize with a one-dimensional paper doll of a person? I'm not saying Christian books should emulate secular ones in terms of profanity, comedic or sadistic violence, or explicit sex. I am saying that life is gritty at times, that even those ready to \\"give an answer for the hope that is within\\" us sometimes struggle with those answers. Our fellows in fiction, however, usually find perfect peace with everything ten pages from the end of the book. They also rarely do anything wrong or possess any real flaws; if they've had it rough, they're victims on the path to 10-pages-from-the-end forgiveness.Christian fiction also has a tell-all approach to writing, and usually that \\"all\\" is revealed in the first chapter of the book (unless it's a deliberate case of Deep Dark Secrets). If a character is angry, we are told, \\"His anger was intense.\\" If a character's heart is breaking, we are told, \\"She could feel her heart breaking.\\" Subtlety, figurative language, individual character response to situations--lost arts, all.Of course, I'm speaking from my own reading experience. Anyone with title recommendations for me, please comment (but if Dee Henderson is your idea of great literature, we're not on the same page).With this (legitimate, I say) chip on my shoulder, I stumbled upon Kristen Heitzmann's Freefall. I read the back cover. Not the first amnesia plot ever, or the first guy-protects-girl plot ever, but the combination was sufficiently intriguing that I read the first two pages. I, a library reader, bought the book and finished it shortly.Heitzmann's characters do indeed \\"leap off the page.\\" Jade's moral dilemmas relating to her career are refreshingly real, and no quickie solution is offered. Her determination and vulnerability as she regains her memories are well-portrayed. Cameron is an even deeper character--hiding a broken heart behind gruff suspicion, terrified of the world's propensity to steal what he loves, and continuing to believe in God despite it all, just no longer willing to trust Him. When summed up that way, neither of these characters sounds original, but they are. Jade's version of strength is willingness to trek into the Hawaiian wild by herself before asking a man who doesn't believe her for help. Cameron's version of heavenward fist-shaking is to pit his surfboard against the sea and beat it one wave at a time. What makes these characters work? A familiar core demonstrated by original quirks--quirks that at times actually drive the plot, rather than being submerged in it.In addition, this woman can write. She takes the time to construct some interesting similes; her verbs don't require a parade of adverbs to be specific. A pitiless editor could have slimmed the book down slightly, and mitigated a bit of melodrama from Rob's and Allegra's points of view, but these are hardly mortal flaws.Of course, expect the main characters to end up together. But Heitzmann's approach is less syrupy than most Christian romance, and she finds a clean, honest balance that most don't attempt. The attraction between Jade and Cameron is rooted in their souls, not their bodies, yet this author acknowledges the physical desires of men and women without shoving soiled details into her readers' heads.All in all, highly recommended, both for fans of Christian fiction, and for ex-fans like me."},{"Title":"Freefall","review":"Wow! Freefall left me speechless by the time I finished the story. At first I thought, \\"I love Kristen Heitzmann. I've read all of her historicals and they were awesome. This'll probably be good, but not as good as her past novels.\\" WRONG! The suspense was incredible. The plot intricate. The setting exotic (nothing like spending time on the beach on not getting a sunburn. I think I even learned how to surf without hitting a single wave.) The romance also sizzled. Of course, those who know me know I love the edgier stuff (in other words, the passion and realism of romantic tension) and this baby is packed with it! The perpetrators and thugs were believeable and unlikeble--as they should be. I felt the heroine's fear, her confusion, her passion. Boy, that was a wild ride! I liked how the author occasionally inserted another person's POV to give you that person's perspective. Sweet. Overall, I'd have to say that this is the best romantic suspense novel I've EVER read. I mean EVER! I give Freefall ten stars!"},{"Title":"Freefall","review":"With December just around the corner, I imagined I had read all of the best books of 2006. By the end of the first chapter of Freefall I knew I was mistaken!Set on the Hawaiian island of Kauai, Freefall commences with a woman tumbling down a waterfall and the testing of Monica Pierce's fragile emotions. Monica's instinctive compassion welcomes the beautiful but injured stranger into her home, her memory lost due to the traumatic fall. Monica names her Jade. As a result of a tragic childhood, Monica has always relied heavily on her protective older brother, Cameron, an insurance fraud investigator living on the mainland. Monica calls him to utilise his investigative skills to determine Jade's identity. Upon his arrival, Jade's reluctance to contact the police places Cameron's suspicions into overdrive and another man's life in the balance.When Jade's identity is confirmed as the latest Hollywood \\"it\\" actress, Gentry Fox, the ugly side of such fame threatens to overwhelm her as she struggles to remember her past. Cameron's immediate derision of her occupation and the lifestyle he imagines Gentry has sought, is tempered as Gentry's strength of character emerges as they search for answers to the tragedy that befell her. In turn, Gentry glimpses Cameron's cynical and hardened exterior for what it is, a damaged heart and soul, following the early loss of his parents and his wife's more recent betrayal. Cameron resists his attraction to Gentry as danger continues to haunt her. The suspense ramps up and the relationships of all characters are tested as unscrupulous people seek to destroy Gentry's image and possibly, her life.Kristin Heitzmann has written a powerful novel of suspense alongside a beautiful character study of the fragile yet indestructible nature of human emotions. Her characters have depth and authenticity, from Gentry and Cameron through to blind Okelani, Monica and police officer, TJ Kanakanui. The book delves into issues of integrity, the allure of wealth, the burden of guilt and the miraculous and forgiving nature of God. Secrets and Unforgotten are must read books but Kirstin Heitzmann has trumped even those with Freefall."},{"Title":"Freefall","review":"I have to say that this is one of the most engaging, gripping story I have ever read. I am a big of Kristen Heitzmann's and I have to say that this story is one of my favourite stories ever by her. She describes the setting on the Kauai Island in Hawaiian Islands so vividly that I imagined myself actually being on the beautiful island. Gentry Fox and Cameron Pierce are wonderful, unique and yet \\"real-life\\" characters. I enjoyed every bit of the suspense, the mystery as Gentry (Jade) tries to remember what caused her accident and to piece back the details of her life back together. I couldn't put the story down til I have read to the last page!"},{"Title":"Freefall","review":"First I want to say that I think that this book has one of the most beautiful covers I've seen in a while. I just love the waterfall and all the shades of blue in the scenery. And you notice how everyone always looks better when their hair is blowing in the breeze?A mysterious girl who can't remember anything about herself is found on the island of Kauai. Mysterious circumstances surround her and those who try to help her including Cameron, a lawyer who takes it into his hands to protect the girl. Bits and pieces of her memory begin to come back, and it is found that the girl is a famous award wining actress Gentry Fox. Gentry, had left her Hollywood life due to scandal, soon finds herself facing someone who is threatening her life and those around her.I always think that Hawaii is always a great place to have a book setting. It's exotic yet familiar at the same time. The descriptions of the places in the book are lovely and make you feel like you are really there. I liked the book and the suspense storyline, although I felt that the book summary played too much on the Jade/amnesia thing too much, as Gentry gets her memory back pretty quickly in the story. Cameron was a good male lead, even though I felt that his and Gentry's relationship felt a little rushed. His ex-wife was annoying and actually reminded me of Addison from Grey's Anatomy. This book gave an interesting look into the movie industry and what an actress really has to go through. It's not all smiling for cameras and signing autographs. People will do anything to move up in the industry and they will pay any price to reach their goals. I thought it was interesting about how the young boy allowed himself to go along with the story about his \\"affair\\" with Gentry, never really thinking about how it really affected the both of them. I also liked the struggle with the kissing scenes that Gentry has while she is acting. They're not \\"real kisses\\" but it's very hard to not be involved when you are being intimate with someone. Maybe that's why so many Hollywood couples break up. Very interesting when you think about how the lives of movie stars may not be everything that you see on TV or in magazines.The story gets a little long near the end, but I still enjoyed it. Kristen Heitzmann has put out another great book."},{"Title":"Freefall","review":"I can't say I loved this book. It was well-written (what else would you expect from Heitzmann?) and the characters were fully developed and believable. The story itself was intriguing and fresh. What caught me by surprise was that the story started out as a thriller, then with about 150 pages to go slipped into a romance, then morphed into a thriller again at the climax. I must say this, though, kudos to Heitzmann and Bethany House for pushing the envelope with the romantic elements as far as CBA fiction goes (it got quite racey at times). Overall, Freefall was a solid book, a little long (over 460 pages), but written well enough to sustain the story."},{"Title":"Freefall","review":"Author Kristen Heitzmann sends us to the edge with her book, \`Freefall'.

The characters are well-developed and 3-dimensional. The sprinkling of Hawaiian throughout the novel adds color and authenticity to the story, yet it was a bit distracting when there wasn't an obvious translation provided.Our main character is a famous actress who has lost her memory only to wander into the life of a woman with a heart to help and her skeptical brother. As her memory returns, the plot thickens and her relationship with these new friends continues to build.Watching the characters deal with extreme life-changing circumstances is both inspiring and educational. The twists and turns in the plot keep the pages turning. Kristen masterfully pours her characters' inner feelings onto the page making the romance intense. She also presents beautiful moments where Christian values triumph over worldly ones. This is a wonderful, suspenseful Christian romance!"},{"Title":"Freefall","review":"I'm only about a quarter way through, but so far it's been hard to put down.

In the beginning I was gripped by the story line. The main character is lost, hurt, and without her memory. The author does a nice job of introducing her leading man as well as a solid list of other characters to the story. I am not awarding five stars because although parts gripped me and made me want to keep reading there were equal parts in the middle where I was actually feeling bored. Thankfully, the end picked back up again. I think it was an interesting idea to be reading from the perspective of the bad guy through parts of the story. That being said, it was a little too easy to understand who he was after and why. As I normally don't read suspense because I get too freaked out, this was good because the novel didn't become too scary although lives were at risk. However, if you really wanted to get your heart pumping I don't think this book is going to do it for you. (I can't even watch a Harry Potter movie without getting scared, so if I could read this without qualms you know almost anyone could.) If you really love suspense, I don't think you are going to be sitting their trying to figure out what will come next.I did like the romance between the two main characters although I believe that there was so much drama they really didn't get a chance to know each other in normal circumstances. There was no opportunites for dates or being swept of their feet. Overall, who wouldn't love a hero who rescues a lady in distress? This is a Christian Fiction novel. I think almost everyone could enjoy it as its not that preachy. That being said, some of the Christian aspects did feel a bit forced to me. I believe this book could be read by a young adult as there is no sexual content beyond kisses."},{"Title":"Freefall","review":"This book FREEFALL was free at the time I had it downloaded, so I didn't really expect too much even though the description had caught my attention. It turned out that Heitzmann is an excellent writer, despite a number of characters forking their fingers through their hair. That quirk provided a little comic relief."},{"Title":"Freefall","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this book!The characters are easy to fall in love with and completely understandable. You follow them all on their own journeys and watch them grow in Christ. Needless to say, the character development was wonderful!Twists and turns abound throughout the plot and it'll keep you guessing until the end! It is marketed as a romantic suspense, but the suspense is totally underplayed! In the second half of the book, you're sitting on the edge of your seat!The romance is exquisite! No, get your mind out of the gutter! The characters honestly care for each other and you feel it. It's almost like their emotions are your own! Yet all this is done with very little time spent reading about characters 'getting it on.' In fact, there isn't ANY time spent reading about that.This is a book that I've been reading over and over for several years now and this review won't do it justice! Maybe not everyone agrees but it was certainly a lovely book and the least you can do is give it a try. :-)"},{"Title":"Master Your Money Type: Using Your Financial Personality to Create a Life of Wealth and Freedom","review":"Wish I had reviewed the content of this book BEFORE buying it. The six categories have no empirical basis and the author evidently has no experience actually advising anyone. He is a former reporter for Money magazine.His other book, Everyone's Money Book was co-authored with Sonny Bloch (see url link below for article about Bloch) who I since learned landed in prison for his on air crookery. So, lot's to question about this author's judgment and expertise!http://registeredrep.com/mag/finance_talking_dirty/index.html"},{"Title":"Master Your Money Type: Using Your Financial Personality to Create a Life of Wealth and Freedom","review":"I have heard Jordan Goodman on call-in radio shows many, many times (and I've also heard him give keynotes at several conferences), and what comes through loud and clear is that he is an exceptionally well-informed personal finance expert passionately devoted to helping people do better with their money. You discover the same thing when you pick up his books: his high standards, encyclopedic knowledge, and practical emphasis on taking action permeate every book he has written.If you want a thorough personal finance education or a great reference book, get Goodman's Everyone's Money Book, his comprehensive guide to every aspect of personal finance. If you want to avoid investing in the next Wall Street scandal, get his Reading Between the Lies.

Farrell's The Millionaire Code, and the incredible career book Do What You Are, I was naturally attracted to this book, which makes use of personality typing to assist people in attaining financial health and wealth. Goodman focuses on the emotional dimension to money. Most of us do not realize how our emotions dictate our spending and saving habits, and how past experiences mold and shape our present behavior and especially, our financial decision-making abilities.Although not as clinical as the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator, with its often intimidating (and somewhat ambiguous) terminology, elements of this psychological technique are clearly present in this text. Goodman uses such terms as Striver, Ostrich, Coaster Debt Desperado and Squirrel to describe the various types of money personalities that people have, all of which are based on the emotional attitudes we all too often attach to money.Goodman does an excellent job of laying out the emotional dimension to money, and builds upon this to offer practical advice. He does not seek to alter what he believes are basic personality types; rather, he takes them as given (making no value judgments about the types) and immutable, lays out their strengths and weaknesses, and shows how one can use his or her type to one's financial advantage. He also allows for the fact that a reader can possess elements of several different types. Thus, it would be worth one's time and effort to read the entire book. Additionally, a lot of good, solid financial information is presented in each chapter, and one would do well to lift things of use here and there from the book.The book possesses a strong psychological basis, and points the reader to further sources of information on both a financial and psychological level specific to his or her type. On a personal note, I was kind of let down with the advice given to squirrels (of which I am one), which basically amounts to the purchase of more insurance and migration to higher return but higher risk investments, but then, this information and advice is consistent with the fears traditionally associated with this personality type. I am a bit more knowledgeable and financially sophisticated than most squirrels, but at the same time am a bit more risk adverse than I reasonably should be, given my choice of career (civil service) and investment strategy (bonds and low-beta stocks like food and utility companies) in the face of my above average educational and professional achievements. So, on the whole, I would say that the author described me and my financial hopes, fears and worries very, very well. Incidentally, I was already in the process of doing many of the things that he recommended for my personality type, so reading this book not only confirmed the soundness of my approach, but also gave me a lot of support and encouragement to continue doing what I have been doing.I highly recommend the book, as it is a light, fast and accessible read. In sum, the book really hit home with me, and I am proud to be a squirrel."},{"Title":"Master Your Money Type: Using Your Financial Personality to Create a Life of Wealth and Freedom","review":"I found this book intriguing. According to the author, there are six psychological types based on emotional effect of money. They are strivers, ostriches, debt desperadoes, coasters, high rollers, and squirrels. For example, strivers are people whose lifestyles are ahead of their income and squirrels are those who accumulate money but never get to enjoy it. Many of us may not think that the way we feel about money affects how we spend it, and therefore, determines our financial health. This book helps readers to identify their category and based on that, learn how to handle it better to achieve financial success.- Mariusz Skonieczny, author of Why Are We So Clueless about the Stock Market?

Nor does it succeed in \\"Providing a much needed insight into Victorian attitudes, including that of Christian morality, this book makes a distinctive contribution to the history of crime, social welfare and the family.\\"There are so many flaws in this book I hardly know where to begin. Perhaps I should start with the research done. The book is filled with cites: there are 36 pages of endnotes at the back. Impressive, most impressive: until you realise that the vast majority of these notes are citing books published within the fifteen years prior to the publishing of Jackson's work, and generally not outside of twenty-five years prior--a problem when you consider the time period she is examining is over a hundred years ago, nearly two. In the endnotes to the first chapter alone she makes 114 notes, only 29 of which are to primary documents. The remaining 85 notes refer to secondary, sometimes tertiary sources, often three or four different books at a time. Of the 29 original source cites, 4 are for the same page (212) of Blackstone's Commentaries (which is from a century before Victorian times, incidentally), and the rest follow a similar pattern. While she cites a few original documents, the definite impression is one of quote-mining in these cases. It appears very much as if she had a preconceived theory, read quite a lot of similar-minded books, and then found a few spackles of genuine research to make her notions look well-supported.This is not how brave insights are made, or truly groundbreaking original research is done. A real historian would seek to find a theory to fit the facts, not facts to fit the theory. Let us move on from the research to the presentation of it, however. The first chapter to this book is titled \\"Introduction.\\" It is 27 pages long. There are six further chapters and then a four-page eighth chapter, titled \\"Conclusion.\\" Each of the six middle chapters is prefaced by yet another section headed \\"Introduction,\\" with an average 2.5 pages per introduction. A seemingly trivial complaint, yet when you realise that of a 155 page book (of actual writing, and not notes or bibliography), you have 4 pages of conclusion and 42 pages of introduction, the content of the book suddenly shrinks by nearly a third.But perhaps she feels she needs all of the introducing in order to produce a coherent argument. This might seem a plausible explanation, until you read the book and realise that she pretty much has no argument whatsoever. She is not supporting any thesis, not revealing any new social theory. There is none of the promised unravelling of the subject. The closest she comes to an actual coherent argument is in offhand, but at least consistent, remarks against elites and bourgeoisie. The middle class is the engine of all social ills, according to this book, and the proletariat is oppressed directly because of Christian moral strictures. The working class, in a somewhat patronizing and unrealistic view, is described as being totally under the thumb of middle-class, unable to form any sort of morality for themselves. It's all trickle-down from above. Curiously, aristocrats and the fabulously wealthy are generally spared derogation. Her spite is reserved for the Christian middle-class.As for the subject of child abuse, let me pose a question to you: Is there anyone who doubts that child molesters are abnormal? Jackson refuses to make this claim, although she will say any number of negative things about Christians and the middle-class, she will not even label child molesters abnormal. Instead, they are \\"abnormal,\\" to indicate that this label is merely one of those bourgeoisie classifications. She certainly wouldn't be so uncompromising as to say a child molester was abnormal. \\"Savage\\", \\"bestial\\", \\"aberrant\\", you may be sure, will all appear in quotes. Conveniently, she reveals her true stripes right in the introduction, so if you doubt my review, you'll find it right away and can reach for the matches at once.In the introduction, Jackson writes, \\"...Foucault took part in a debate in which he argued that sexual relations between adults and children should not be restricted by law.\\" She then makes a statement that at first blush seems to be a refutation of this stance. But you soon realise she's doing nothing of the sort. Her response to this heinous idea ends with, \\"Such an approach has never been off the feminist agenda; now, however, and mainly as a response to AIDS, the issue of ethics is being taken seriously by other radical voices in the field of sexual politics.\\" To use the terminology of the Victorians here, this is absolutely damnable. Feminism that has any right to call itself feminism categorically does not include molesting children as desirable, yet she clearly thinks it does!She refers to \\"normal\\" girls as being unsuspecting prey to her predators, in quotations, as if this normalcy is a confining label constructed by her ever-hated Christian bourgeoisie. Is there some doubt that normal girls of less than 10 years of age (the age of felony criminality for rape in the time period under discussion) would be unsuspecting? Is there something wrong with this, even if, horrors, it did stem from a Christian philosophy? Should it be assumed that if they were \`normal' they would be pouting tarts? We should expect, perhaps, that a three-year-old, unable to speak a fluently and communicate with any kind of sophistication, could somehow make a rational choice to have a sexual relationship with an adult?She writes about the abuse of male children, \\"The silence that usually surrounded the abuse of boy children can be linked to the refusal to acknowledge that such acts were anything other than deviant aberrations (p 104).\\" Seriously? The abuse of male children was not spoken about because Victorians weren't willing to consider that it wasn't a deviant aberration. No matter what your thoughts are on homosexuality, no person in their right mind would ever think that abusing boy children should somehow be considered non-aberrational. Who lives in a world where this could possibly be considered morally normal? Why does Jackson go to such great lengths throughout the book to avoid saying what every person knows: Child molesters (regardless of the sex molesting or the sex molested, moreover) are aberrant, savage criminals.Let us leave aside these questions as they stem from subjective differences in my viewpoint as a reader and Jackson's viewpoint as a particularly disagreeable historian. Let us instead question how she treats various parts of history as \\"myths,\\" in particular, the trade in sex slaves, both domestic and foreign, in British brothels. She refuses to acknowledge that such a trade existed. Leaving aside the fact that in any prostitution system whatsoever you are bound to have people enslaved into it, even in modern well-controlled systems, she says in the book that we must be careful to believe working-class accounts, rather than middle-class accounts of the working class, because of course the bourgeoisie can't be trusted to have got anything straight.Henry Mayhew, a journalist of the early to mid 1800s, directly interviewed prostitutes of working-class background who tell stories of the \\"mythic\\" trade in sex slaves. Does Jackson believe that we must only believe the working-class account when it suits our fancy? Her evident bias against the \\"elite\\" and \\"bourgeoisie\\" makes a remarkable appearance here: she completely dismisses Mayhew as being a blinkered man of snobby moralistic views--and then ignores everything that the very poorest of the proletariat said to him. Does she think he made everything up? If so, why trust court documents at all? Court reporters, too, would be \\"petit bourgeois.\\" Why should they feel compelled to report anything accurately either?And according to Jackson, they don't. She says explicitly that court accounts are carefully prepared accounts, that depositions don't reflect the true accounts of working-class people, just what they wanted the court to hear. And this is where her entire book becomes worthless. If you specifically say that your sources can't be trusted and you have to give a very careful reading to each and every case to read between the lines (with your modern analysis, influenced by middle-class academia, so how are these better than the originals, I wonder?), then how are your statistics worth anything whatsoever? Jackson indeed draws no conclusions from them, despite all of her attempted unravelling. She points out that the sample size of her cases indicates vast underreporting and that they cannot be used to form conclusions.I could go on. Does any expert on psychoanalysis credit Freud anymore, or is it only Jackson? Why is she even mentioning AIDS in a book on Victorian England? The condition did not even exist until well after the time period the book purports to examine. Why does she go on a rant about the London poor being associated with disease and dirt when she herself cites numerous examples (presumably not to be ignored like the ones Mayhew quotes) where, in fact, the London poor were living in horribly squalid, dirty conditions? Despite all evidence, the idea of dirt and the lack of time and money required to live in pristine cleanliness in Victorian times is simply one of those discriminating myths the bourgeoisie attached to the lumpenproletariat? But to bring up everything wrong with this book would require writing an entire book of my own, so I'll make an end to it now.In short, unless you are willing to read between the lines, ignoring the ridiculous flimflam language of academia, perhaps altogether skipping large sections of confused and rambling postmodern ideology, this book is next to useless.Oh wait. I take that back. It might be useful as a guide to what other books to avoid as well, as Jackson handily provides a list of books she recommends. I plan to strictly ignore them."},{"Title":"My Life As a Male Anorexic","review":"This book is nothing but excellent. It is a true account of what it is like, and what one may go through with an eating disorder. It may seem ridiculous, selfish, and hard to believe for someone who has not experienced an ED, but if you have then at least one account in this book will get under your skin, give you chills, and bring back memories. It said,and depressing, but a true tale of what it is like to have anorexia. And this book proves that it is a problem in men too."},{"Title":"My Life As a Male Anorexic","review":"This book is interesting and I think that it Krasnow provides a very unique perspective. The writing is extremely constricted and factual, but that in itself is an incredible glimpse into the mindset that anorexia can create (and that can cause someone to become anorexic). I'd definitely recommend this book to someone interested in the topic. The negatives: it's a very short read and it's quite depressing. Although I don't think it's very insightful, it does make a unique contribution to the literature because it deals with anorexia in men."},{"Title":"My Life As a Male Anorexic","review":"I intend absolutely no criticism of the author when I say that this book provides the reader with few if any answers as to the source of male anorexia or effective treatment. Krasnow presents the basic facts with a clear, straightforward delivery that asks no pity and promises no redemption. Indeed, as other reviewers have noted, we mourn Krasnow as one of anorexia's ultimate victims. Still, although family, friends, or the men who are struggling with anorexia or bulimia will sympathize with this account, they will have to pose any questions elsewhere."},{"Title":"My Life As a Male Anorexic","review":"In the final epilogue of this book, written shortly before Michael died, he writes: \\"If I thought that there was no hope, then there would have been no reason for me to write this story.\\" Despite its harrowing subject matter, the very fact that this book was written at all is life-affirming. Michael struggled with a soul-crushing sense of inadequacy and self-hatred, yet he expresses throughout the book that he wanted to write this with the hope that it could shed light on his condition and help others. His sentences are often short and declarative for the very reason that you see his constant struggle to overcome the impression that any action of his--including writing--could have meaning to anyone. He forges ahead anyhow, painstakingly reconstructing his story, even researching the parts to which his memory is somewhat limited. He also expresses beautifully his love and regard for his parents, who sound like remarkable and caring people who endured too much. This book lends a great deal of light on how all-consuming anorexia can be. Michael's life and courage should be celebrated."},{"Title":"My Life As a Male Anorexic","review":"I could feel the anguish the writer felt as he wrote this outstanding book. That heartfelt anguish drew me in, and kept me glued to this book. No matter how tired I was, I did not want to put the book down to rest. I found his story riveting."},{"Title":"My Life As a Male Anorexic","review":"This is an absolutely stunning and heartbreaking book. It's a sad story, but it's also an unflinchinglyly brave one. Any compassionate human being will be moved by this author's fearless candor in sharing his remarkable personal journey. Brutally honest and forthright, this book is a must-read not only for men and women dealing with anorexia (or their friends and family members), but it should also be mandatory reading for anyone studying or working in the medical field.It's heartening to read the many excellent reviews and know that other people were equally moved by this book. The only two dissenters either take the book to task for something it never claims to be or seem to have read a completely different book than the one I just finished. The book never claims to offer, as one reviewer hoped for, \\"explanations, theories, hope, or guidance,\\" but only, as the cover states, to share \\"the autobiographical account of a young man's ongoing struggle with anorexia.\\" This is exactly what it delivers. As to the comment about finding it \\"little more than a daily food log,\\" I am at a loss to know what book that same reviewer read. Out of my 134 page copy, exactly 1 page is devoted to a food log, and this (Epilogue II) was added at the urging of the publisher and against the original desire of the author.As an example of what I feel to be the textual mis-reading and mis-analysis of the second and only other dissenter, he criticizes the writer for not conceding to the publishers desire to include a list of eating-disorder organizations, but while doing so he misquotes the author and neglects to include the vital and on point next sentence in the paragraph. Compare the reviewers inaccurate quote: \\"The publisher wants me to have a resource page for anorexic treatments. I refuse to do that.\\" to what the author actually wrote - \\"The Haworth Press wanted my book to have a list of eating-disorders organizations, places where people could (supposedly) get help. I refused to allow this. You see, I don't believe in these places, and felt it would have been hypocritical of me to include them in my book.\\" To exclude that last vital sentence (a theme which echoes throughout the book) and then to go on and blithely call the author \\"demanding and uncooperative\\" seems harsh and unfair. In addition, while I agree with that reviewers concern about the expense of treating anorexia, I find his self-acknowledged presentism rather churlish when commenting on the author's work history. The author was obviously doing all that he was capable of doing at the time, and the fact that he was managing to live on his own and support himself is more than many healthy, less troubled people are able to do. Not to mention the fact that he wrote a book and got it published. Likewise, \\"selfishness and nastiness\\" are the very last things I would ever think of in relation to the man I met in these pages. He appears to have been a man of great heart and feeling, and anything which would appear otherwise was only a result of his ongoing struggles. The strong bond and deep, unconditional love demonstrated by this family is truly something for the ages.As another five-star reviewer wrote, \\"Michael's life and courage should be celebrated.\\" Truer words were never written."},{"Title":"My Life As a Male Anorexic","review":"A great book. Came in really quick. Really good read and competition material if your competing in speech and debate"},{"Title":"My Life As a Male Anorexic","review":"This book, although a rare example of a man with an eating disorder, is very disappointing. I was hoping for some unique perspective on eating disorders, but instead found little more than a daily food log. Admittedly, Michael's is a sad tale, but it offers no explanations, theories, hope, or guidance. It is a list of his complaints and discomforts and in the end, I had a hard time sympathizing. He made no attempts to truly get better or understand his illness and that is reflected in the one-dimensional book. I would not recommend this book to anyone trying to understand the disorder, nor is it interesting reading. It is monotonous and depressing."},{"Title":"My Life As a Male Anorexic","review":"Here's an example from the book that touches on my analysis. The author says his father died of Lou Gehrig's disease. He goes on to say, \\"My dad was the greatest, but honestly, I never think about him. The depression causes that.\\" This guy does not just have no weight: he has no heart, interests, or concern for others.This book is not something to grow upon like Audre Lorde's work on breast cancer or Marlon Riggs' meditations on HIV/AIDS. This guy describes his life as an anorexic but he doesn't care about himself or anyone else. His disconcern for everything is off-putting.He knows that he is rare as a male anorexic, but he never details how he differs from his female counterpart. This book does not deal with gender issues at all. Supposedly, one's sexual role plays a part in the numbers of those with eating disorders, but this guy says nothing about what terms him on. Is he closeted about you-know-what or is he truly asexual? He doesn't say.I am glad that class matters come up a bit here. I hear that treating anorexia is very expensive. Sometimes money restricts the author, but I am still concerned that only the wealthy can deal with this disease.I am being presentist here, but this guy sure seems to obtain and quit jobs with ease. In today's tough economic environment, it's hard to read about someone being so unappreciative. There are many people now who would work hard for anything and the author can just drop jobs like he does weight.Near the end, the author says, \\"The publisher wants me to have a resource page for anorexic treatments. I refuse to do that.\\" The author doesn't care that he has the illness and doesn't care if others develop it. I hear it's hard to get a book deal and he seems very demanding and uncooperative in that regard too.In fairness, the author condemns himself often. Still, he displays a selfishness and nastiness that may turn off many a sympathetic reader."},{"Title":"MARXISM AND LITERATURE.","review":"Yes, i would agree with the reviewer above, this is a challenging read. But that is what makes it so thoroughly lucid and insightful. It takes some time getting use to Williams' style, but once you pick up on the rhythm of his prose, his ideas begin to unfold in a rich tapestry of dialectic critique. The chapters on \\"Hegemony,\\" \\"Residual, Dominant, Emergent,\\" and \\"Language\\" are excellent for anyone interested in moving beyond the base/superstructure of orthodox Marxism and into more dynamic cultural materialist understanding of change."},{"Title":"MARXISM AND LITERATURE.","review":"This is a foundational book in cultural studies-- if you internalize it you'll see that a huge amount of subsequent work is a footnote to it and/or a regression from its insights. The concepts are actually not very hard, they just are presented densely (like a whole course in math laid out in a 20 page article) and if you've been socialized in the US, it pushes you to rewire your brain to some extent, and then afterward you think better. It is also hard at first to learn how to talk, do algebra, tie your shoes, drive a car. Once you learn these things you use them all your life and it is hard to imagine your life within having learned the skills. This book can be like that, but you'll get out of it approximately the same amount that you put in."},{"Title":"MARXISM AND LITERATURE.","review":"I read some of this book in an American Civilization class at Brown University my junior year of college. It was the most difficult reading on the syllabus. Most of it went right over my head. It may be a useful tool for Marxists or others interested in class equality.

I think it is quite easy to read."},{"Title":"Revival Praying","review":"REVIVAL PRAYING is one of the best books on prayer. In fact, I would rate it just a bit ahead of Leonard Ravenhill's best known book, WHY REVIVAL TARRIES?. The book focuses not on revival as much as prayer. It is Ravenhill's firm belief that we lack a true sense and awe of God's holiness and majesty because we don't pray (Luke 18:1). Despite the church being very active in politics, programs, and everything else under the sun, the average church's prayer meeting is either non-existent or lacking. For example a local church near me boasts in their 500 members but only 6 usually come to their prayer meeting. How sad!If you are a weak, defeated, sinning, dead in your sins, no hunger for God \\"Christian\\" then please don't read this book on prayer. Try a lighter book such as Bill Hybels' TOO BUSY NOT TO PRAY but don't read any books by Tozer, Wesley, Ravenhill, M'Cheyne, Morgan, Torrey, or any other of the older saints of God (Colossians 4:2; 1 Thess. 5:17; James 5:16). These books are not books on HOW to pray but are written to encourage those who DO pray (Matthew 7:7-11; Luke 11:1; Acts 2:42; Romans 12:12)."},{"Title":"Revival Praying","review":"This book, like all the others by this author has a powerful message that will stir you to the depths of your being. Len Ravenhill was a man most intimate with God. His manner of writing is biting at times, and frequently harsh. But it is never arbitrary harshness. It is inspired and inspiring. The harshness is from the raw conviction that the words convey. Clearly this, like Bro. Len's other books, is yet another message from the throne."},{"Title":"Revival Praying","review":"I consider Leonard Ravenhill to be my spiritual grandfather. He discipled most of the men who discipled me. To say that Bro. Len was outspoken on the subjects of prayer and revival would be a gross understatement.

Though I don't think this book quite takes hold of you as his masterpiece &quot;Why Revival Tarries.&quot; However, it is still a great book on prayer that all would do well to have on their shelves, after having heavily read it and underlined it. Oh yeah, don't forget to put into practice what you read in this book, otherwise, you will have not gotten anything out of it."},{"Title":"Revival Praying","review":"Leonard Ravenhill does not mince words. He is a man with a heart after God's heart. This books has been written from a place of prayer.

I believe we should read it and reread it until prayer has become a driving force in our lives.

I will definitely be purchasing other books in this series."},{"Title":"Brave Norman : A True Story","review":"disclaimer: I have particular interest in thrown away critters with disabilities; I have a houseful of them!With that said, \\"Brave Norman\\" is a GREAT book. It not only touches on animal shelters and how critters with disabilities are treated (\\"Are you sure you want to keep him?\\"), but Norman is shown as essentially normal despite his blindness. Then Norman even gets to be the hero by rescuing a little girl who was drowning, not only DESPITE his blindness but probably BECAUSE of it (he heard her cries and responded when the humans didn't notice).I can't find a single thing here to even think about taking a star away. PERFECT!!!!"},{"Title":"Brave Norman : A True Story","review":"My son received this book for his 5th birthday. It is a short book about animals, so it keep his attention. It is also great because it teaches that animals with disabilities should be treated with respect and love which a great lesson to carry over to people. A sweet story with a lesson."},{"Title":"Brave Norman : A True Story","review":"My second grade students loved this book! A blind dog saves a little girl from drowning; blind dogs are useful, loving, faithful pets. Blind dogs and blind people can help others! Good for my developing students because it is easy to read but the story was liked by all my students at all different reading levels."},{"Title":"Brave Norman : A True Story","review":"I picked up this book used when I was looking for some non-fiction reading material that would hold the interest of my 5 year old beginning reader. While she can't read it herself just yet, the story was well written and had her mesmerized. A great book for any kid, and much more meaningful content than a lot of books designed for this reading level."},{"Title":"Getting Out","review":"Aptly named, Gwendolen Gross' second book has the same satisfying descriptions of nature as her previous book, Field Guide. The main character, Hannah, yearns to unzip and step out of the skin that is her life. Knowing how that feels, I give this book five stars. If you love the outdoors, you'll love Hannah's adventures."},{"Title":"Getting Out","review":"The day after finishing \\"Getting Out,\\" I threw together some gorp and went canoeing with my 4-year-old son. It was just too much to sit in my backyard for yet one more day and let a fictive character have all the adventure. And Hannah Blue does have the adventures. What with bats and murky cave water and kissing in tents, there is plenty of occupation to keep Hannah at a distance from her troublesome family and from making any commitments to her adoring boyfriend. I loved Gross's descriptions and turns of phrase that make this book an adventure of language as well -- a characteristic that was also present in her first book, Field Guide. What made the book one I couldn't put down, though, were her truisms, sprinkled in like spring water, that reveal the real Hannah beneath the backpacking wonder. Her escapades, it seems, are keeping her from the deeper, more complicated adventure at hand: the work of relationships. How this drama plays itself out is what made it hard for me to put this book down."},{"Title":"Getting Out","review":"Just finished reading Getting Out, and I thought it was just great. Main character Hannah is trapped in her mundane design job and distracted by her dysfunctional family. She joins the Adventure Club on a whim and becomes part of a hodgepodge group of adventure seekers whom she never truly learns much about. However, she does learn a lot about herself. I found the characters easy to relate to and really enjoyed the conclusion to this fun read."},{"Title":"The King's achievement","review":"A real eye opener as to the sometimes ignored narcissism of Henry the Eighth....he was a real piece of work. Thank You Fr. Benson and God rest your soul."},{"Title":"The brig","review":"This book is great erotica for the gay male S/M enthusiast. The author creates a richly described setting for his story which hits home with all the darkest non-consent fantasies a bottom has. Unlike lots of the work in this area, the details are extensive enough to bring a disturbing sense of reality to the story. It may well leave you pondering the depths of your own desires, both sexual and non-sexual."},{"Title":"The brig","review":"This is a work that has political, psychological, psychic, physical, sexual overtones. Power, sex and politics are intertwined into a cauldron of pain, passion, desire and submission. For those who seek the depths of the power to transform, subdue and the life force that ultimately triumphs over it all, this is a great book."},{"Title":"The brig","review":"I first read this novel well over 10 years ago, and it still haunts me to this day. I'd read most of the the \\"Master's\\" (ahem) of the genre to that point and this really seemed the most realistic in what would have to be called a nightmare scenario. It had the hard edge that I found lacking in the works of authors like Larry Townsend or John Preston.Most of their stuff was of the safe/sane/consensual variety. I'd call it \\"pansy\\" S/M Fiction (although Preston did have some good ones). Why would I want to read a story about something I might actually do in real life? I'd prefer to just \\"do it.\\" What I want in my fantasies is something I wouldn't have the cojones to do in real life, or to fantasize of a situation I'd never seriously want to be anywhere near in real life.The Brig is UNsafe/UNsane/UNconsensual and yet believable.The only author of that day (and today) that I find that can come close to creating such a well written, hard edged, believable story would be Steven Saylor, a.k.a. Aarron Travis, and then only in his short stories. Yes, you can find harder edged, nastier, stuff on the net, or in small publishing formats (Metropolitan Slave & Katharsis come to mind--both now defunct): but this is actually a real literary style piece of traditional fiction that also happens to be incredibly hot. And I think that's the difference, it tells a story of self-discovery and growth in a brutal and nightmarish environment.It's a crime that the book is no longer in print. I'd like to send the original publishers to \\"The Brig\\" for some re-education; except my guess is they are long gone by now."},{"Title":"The brig","review":"I am so torn in saying how fabulous this story is, given the events are so horrendous. There is really no other way for me to describe it. The writing is fantastic. I was riveted from the start, hanging on every detail, even though many made my cringe.I absolutely love when a book totally engages my mind and feelings and leaves me slightly drained at the end. The Brig is definitely on that list. I did not want to put this down once I started, couldn't wait to get to the end, but was sad it was over when I got there. I wanted to see so much more of the story and will definitely be taking a closer look at Mason's other work."},{"Title":"The Black Image in the White Mind: Media and Race in America (Studies in Communication, Media, and Public Opinion)","review":"This is a very important book of research. Though written in sociologist language (lots of statistics and repetitition claims), this is one work that provides meticulous reserach about how the media help perpetuate racial stereotypes and prototypes in this society.As a teacher who is studying widely literature about the media, I found Entman and Rojecki's work useful for providing a lens to better analyze media representations of Black and White people. The authors contend that &quot;Blacks now occupy a kind of limbo status in White America's thinking, neither fully accepted nor wholly rejected by the dominant culture. The ambiguity of Blacks' situation gives particular relevance and perhaps potency to the images of African Americans in the media.&quot;They show that though representations of Black people are quantitatively better than in the past, these representations still convey stereotypical or ambiguous images of Blacks. For example, though there has been sharp increase of Black male actors in movies, their roles still revolve around plots that focus on sports, crime, and violence. In the area of news media, Blacks are usually presented as sources of disruption, as victims, and as complaining supplicants. These type of images, they contend, help to maintain a gap in what they refer to as comity on the part of Whites toward Blacks and other racial minorities in this country.They provide a well known but much needed reiteration of why the media maintains these stereotypes and marginalizations of racial minorities: largely it's eoncomics.&quot;Media workers,&quot; they argue, &quot;seek to make money for their organizations and advance their own careers. That means that they must stay vigilantly attuned to the presumed tastes of their target audiences. These creators operate in a professional culture and organizationl milieu that transmits lessons about what attracts and sells, what upsets and repels. Ratings and market research increasingly inform decisions, whether about news coverage or entertainment plots.&quot; They argue that political and White ethnocentricism play an equal role as wellThough critics may disagree with some of the authors'analysis and conclusions, this book deserves wide reading in media studies, communications, ethnic studies, and sociology courses. It should be read as a useful resource by concerned teachers and media activists."},{"Title":"The Black Image in the White Mind: Media and Race in America (Studies in Communication, Media, and Public Opinion)","review":"This is an important and well-researched study of the image of African Americans as presented in the media (mostly TV and Movies). Indeed, it is a \\"must read\\" for anyone interested in white attitudes regarding African Americans. The authors begin with a nice review the dominant survey research approach to gauging change in racial attitudes. They also discuss their own survey and qualitative study of Whites living in the Indianapolis metro area. The findings of the in-depth qualitative interviews are particularly interesting and valuable for folks interested in the validity of survey research on racial attitudes.Rightly reserving the use of the counterproductive term \\"racist\\" for those who feel Blacks are a \\"lower order of humanity,\\" the authors develop a framework for categorizing White American views of the African American population from \\"low denial\\" (enlightened) to \\"high denial\\" (overtly racist) (chapter 2).In their view, most whites fall between these poles--termed by the authors as \\"ambivalent\\" (a mix of positive and negative views about Blacks.)Unapologetically integrationist (assimilationist?) in their views, the authors see \\"low denial\\" whites as those folks who view African Americans sympathetically and empathetically, (as brothers/sisters), who share fundamental interests, but who suffer unique barriers to equal opportunity.What seems to differentiate the \\"low-denial\\" whites from their well-meaning but \\"ambivalent\\" peers is that low-denial whites uncritically accept the victimization explanation for the social problems of the Black community.This is where the trouble begins...According to the authors, enlightened Whites see the Black community as largely helpless in the face of White dominated society. Hence, for example, high rates of crime and non-marital births stem from forces external to the Black community. These \\"enlightened\\" Whites appear to believe that if anti-Black stereotypes and discrimination were to end, the social problems experienced by African Americans would be resolved.On the other hand, the mass of \\"ambivalent\\" whites is less likely to let struggling Black folks off the hook. They tend to see each person as a moral agent with the freedom to make choices even in the face of discrimination and inequality. They also feel that the stereotypes of Black folks have a grain of truth to them--e.g., that blacks do tend to be, say, less educated, more violent, more likely to bear children out of wedlock than Whites or Asians, as evidenced by empirical evidence reported in the media. These folks wonder (rightly in my opinion) whether current discrimination is really so powerful and dehumanizing as to engender the social problems of the black community.The weakness of this morally laden framework is that it perceives folks who have honest questions about the role of individual choice and moral responsibility (i.e., character) in shaping life chances as somehow unenlightened (\\"in denial\\"). With the huge social problems associated with the Black community, I think it is fair to say that \\"ambivalent\\" attitudes towards blacks are justified. Indeed, survey evidence suggests that African Americans also share ambivalent attitudes towards their own racial group. (Even Jesse Jackson has made public his personal ambivalence towards young black men, admitting that he often has felt relieved to discover that the stranger walking towards him on a darkened street is not Black.)If the majority of African Americans also recognize that endemic social problems exist within poor black communities, does that mean that they too are \\"in denial?\\"Later in the book the authors go on to encourage the media to construct positive images that encourage \\"racial comity.\\" They frame this as an ethical and political responsibility. But because the authors emphasize IMAGE over REALITY, the book often takes on an Orwellian tone. In my opinion, if the media seeks honest portrayals of African Americans, it will often reflect the reality of difference.The authors seem to assume assimilation as a valued goal by finding flaw with any racial differentiation in fictional portrayals in movies and television. While multiculturalism celebrates group differences, the authors find problematic any racial differentiation whatsoever. This is a flawed perspective. African Americans are have a distinct history and culture and are not simply white folks in dark face. I suspect the authors would erase expression of these existential differences from the media if given the chance.So while the book is a valuable contribution (as discussed by the previous reviewer), it suffers from a naively self-righteous and assimilationist perspective."},{"Title":"Triumph service-repair handbook, 500-750cc twins, 1963-1975","review":"The seller advertised a motorcycle repair book for the years 1962-1975.

Students instead ease into the whole learning process and will, most likely, gain confidence after their very first self-test using REAL Japanese words made from the symbols they have learned.The author is fun, amusing, unique, imaginative, and above-all, CREATIVE with his mnemonics. He keeps them as simple as they can possibly be and if they can't be simplified, he suggests outrageously silly mnemonics that are almost impossibly to forget! All the learning comes from YOUR imagination rather than memorization.The author's lessons were so successful with me that even THREE YEARS after I learned Katakana from the book (with a touch-up review once a year and without reading katakana regularly at ALL), I was able to read - without even THINKING about it - the labels from a Japanese stuffed doll that someone brought to work!

I've got both. Buy the Hiragana first because the Katana relies on the Hiragana text for its explanations. Both texts are done very well, small books that get straight to the point of helping you learn what you need, and not just memorizing tables of alphabets.

The author does not provide a dry, sterile survey of inventions and proposed military technology during the Civil War. Rather, the author sets forth an engaging and lively portrayal of President Abraham Lincoln and the personalities, character traits, and idiosyncracies of the many people -- both military personnel and civilians -- involved in the invention, development, testing, selection or rejection, and production of many weapons and would-be weapons that were offered to the Union during the Civil War. The people involved, not the technology and weapons, are the primary focus of this book.I recommend this book for anyone: (1) interested in the history of military technology and weapons; (2) looking for a book that examines a different aspect of the Civil War; (3) studying the human element in the success or failure of military innovation; or (4) seeking a different perspective on President Abraham Lincoln."},{"Title":"Daddy by Design (Harlequin American Romance, No. 742)","review":"Muriel jensen really makes a typical Harlequin Romanace come alive.

He's a publishing phenomenon via his superb Aubrey-Maturin series.But TESTIMONIES was his first novel, originally published in 1952. It tells of an English professor of Welsh origins, Joseph Pugh, who abandons teaching at Oxford and moves to a cottage in Wales. There he explores the primal mountain back country and tries to understand the farming culture of his ancestral land. A lonely, middle-aged bachelor, Pugh can hardly keep house, even to basics--cooking, cleaning, maintaining his clothes. He has never known intimacy, let alone close friendship, but he falls fatally in love with the wife of his sheep-farmer neighbor Emyr Vaughan, a violent man . . . He pines for months, keeping his love sickness to himself, but when he becomes gravely ill he is taken into the Vaughan house, where he and Bronwen discover each others' feelings, with tender reserve. The denouement is poignant, inevitable, yet O'Brian handles this difficult material deftly, without over-writing. For a beginning writer in his 20s this is masterful work at the pinnacle of writing.An acute recorder of time and place, human behavior and motivation, action and reaction, O'Brian uses words persuasively, passionately, a craftsman to the core. He captures country, culture and character with Hardy's lyrical affection, idiosyncratic ethnicity, thoughtfully observed. His meticulous work is reminiscent of the great American writers Faulkner, Steinbeck and Capote, or O'Brian's fellow Brits John Fowles and William Golding.Back in 1952 O'Brian anticipated with TESTIMONIES the struggle for relationships, understanding and love in an era--the last half of the 20th century--in which men and women judge and choose first from ethnic or cultural biases or appearances or political/social correctness and only later, maybe, start to understand each other and become acquainted. Or is xenophobia genetic, eternal?Fast forward to Norton's republishing of TESTIMONIES in 1983. We see that beyond Aubrey-Maturin, O'Brian had the chops in 1952, though few knew and it took many years for many of us to find him. Doris Lessing in the '90s offered two books under assumed names to test the market for unknowns. Result: rejection (she couldn't even get the books read!). So how many others like O'Brian flower unknown, unappreciated? What is their 'testimony?'Napoleon allegedly remarked that ability is useless without opportunity. O'Brian won his opportunity, finally, and made the most of it. We are the beneficiaries and TESTIMONIES is the proof--res ipsa loquitur.This book is one of those few that is unforgettable and will remain in the mind and heart for the rest of the reader's life."},{"Title":"Testimonies","review":"I cannot describe how much I think of this book, even 4 years after reading it. How many books have that effect?! For me, it was one of the most vivid renderings of passion, loneliness, the relationship between men and women, and most importantly, the parallel of our emotional state to the land we occupy. The country of Wales was just as powerful as the relationship between the characters in the novel. What more can you ask for? Find a quiet spot and read this book!"},{"Title":"Testimonies","review":"I can only describe the book's effect on me. I was unable to put the book down until finished, and then unable to forget the story. Don't expect a happy ending story in the vein of OBrian's Seafaring historical novels. This novel is very different."},{"Title":"Testimonies","review":"Having been so affected by this book, it is so pleasing to see the unanimity of readers. I finished the book last evening and have been engrossed all of today without waning; it just won't go away. What a mavelous love story where passion is never enjoined except in the spirit. What a painful tragedy that leaves one stunned and wishing himself dead. What a range of humanity. What a blessing on us all that there are writers of the power and imagination of Patrick O'Brian."},{"Title":"Testimonies","review":"This is the sort of book that, when you finish the last page, compels you to sit in silence for at least half an hour, contemplating it. It doesn't allow you to pick up another book right away because you don't want to break the spell that's been cast over you, and the spell lingers for hours and days.I already knew, from the Aubrey-Maturin books, that O'Brian was a master of characterization and of plot and action, but here, with the sailing and the battles removed, I could see even more clearly how masterful his prose is. It is hauntingly beautiful.Like some other reviewers, I was confused and unsure what to think of the ending. There was a part of me that thought O'Brian was pulling a fast one, which I didn't like, but the other part of me was so enamored of the characters and the writing that I just didn't care. Especially when you consider that this was his first novel, you simply can't ask for better. It has echoes of Hardy, or even (if you remove all the melodramatic passion--just my opinion) of Wuthering Heights, with the harsh but beautiful landscape mirroring the harsh but beautiful people.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Testimonies","review":"This book hit me hard. Both with the sheer power of its carefully choosen words and the awesome might of its collective stories.And there is more than one story here. There is the tale of the rugged, unforgiving land of Wales and the equally hard people it has produced; there is the parable of a tragic entanglement between two people who do everything to avoid it; and there is the epic hint of a final justice for the characters, and a final truth for us all.I read this novel four years ago this summer and I can still vividly recall the ecstasy of emotion that I felt when I finished it."},{"Title":"Testimonies","review":"As much as I love the Aubrey/Maturin series, I could wish the author never had been distracted by them, and away from this kind of early work. Testimonies is darker than anything in the sea-faring books and much more mysterious. The impact of the book is indescribable. A wonderful read."},{"Title":"Testimonies","review":"I only bought this book because I'm a big fan of his seafaring series. I really did not like his Rendezvous at all.Normally I would much rather walk over hot coals than read a romance novel. But this book hooks you from the beginning. It starts in a timid way about a timid man and gradually builds toward a real tragedy.Descriptions of Wales and the people are well done. But kind of disheartening to read how unkind people can be towards each other ...for no real reason....just spite and meanness. I guess people are the same everywhere..As the other reviewer mentioned, this book will affect you. It stays with you after you finish it. Not normally something that happens to me."},{"Title":"Testimonies","review":"Though I'm a big fan of the lighter-hearted Aubrey/Maturin series, especially the first three or four installments, \\"Testimonies\\" is my hands-down favorite O'Brien. It's orders of magnitudes darker, written in the 1950s, but if O'Brien had never written anything else he'd still deserve a place of literary honor only for this novel. It's nothing like anything else I've ever read. Without being gimmicky, it uses a shifting point-of-view device that will keep you off-balance right through the last page. The narrative tension builds so slowly that you can't believe what an unbearable vise you're in by the end. He was a master of his craft even at this fairly young age."},{"Title":"Testimonies","review":"O'Brian conveys the feel of rural Wales in the fifties perfectly. I cared what happened to Pugh and Bronwen. I cared not a jot for the fate of any of the characters in the Catalans."},{"Title":"Testimonies","review":"Perhaps one of the more interesting parts of this book, I thought, was the introspective view of the world situation as voiced by Pugh to Bronwen. Keeping in mind this was originally published in 1952 that would mean some of what was at issue for O'Brian was the Cold War and the nuclear threat, but it is fairly easy to interpret the concerns as equally applicable to today. The threat is different but the results on the human psyche are the same, as are Bronwen's curious response asking how that relates to the idea that a person has a soul.Other interesting tidbits include Pugh's description of characters such as Lloyd, Ellis, and Skinner. Loved this bit on Skinner: \\"The stuff he adduced was such an intolerable farrago of rubbish that I was shocked that it should have imposed upon a man of education and some reading. It was such an incoherent, verbose mumbo-jumbo, with esoteric twaddle jostling Gnosticism, scholarship of the lucus a non lucendo order that I could not refrain (burning with my private fire) from saying some sharp things about his authors.\\" (p. 124)I had no issue with the person playing \\"Q\\" assuming it was just a rhetorical device."},{"Title":"Testimonies","review":"A beautifully written book with elegantly drawn characters from a different time and place. My only complaint (and please forgive me if I'm showing my simplicity) is that the question left hanging in the air left me feeling somewhat let down."},{"Title":"Testimonies","review":"I enjoyed the Aubrey/Maturin series so much that I wanted to explore Patrick O'Brien's earlier work. Testimonies is a novel about life in rural Wales. The story is too fragmented for my taste and the end too sad .... Still, it is part of one of my favorite author's work and I will probably read it again to try to understand it better."},{"Title":"Pontius Pilate","review":"What a great book. Very well written. Very exciting to read about a man from the past. It is really great to read about Pilate as archeologists have proven he was a real man."},{"Title":"Pontius Pilate","review":"Pontius Pilate is an accurate historical account of the events in 1st century Rome, yet presented a easy to understand novel format. The entrance of Christ into history is told from the perspective of Pilate, a Roman Prefect governing Judea, an unreligious and logical Roman ruler.Paul Maier presents often misunderstood details and facts, weaving them into an interesting tapestry of rich and vibrant color. He brings practical reasoning to a subject often difficult to comprehend.Seeing this history-making and life-changing event from a purely secular Roman viewpoint colors it uniquely and makes for fascinating reading."},{"Title":"Pontius Pilate","review":"This book was a great read...then when I realized all the research Paul Maier did in creating this book, I was awed.According to the author's notes, Maier researched all historical references available about Pilate, Roman politics, and general life in Judea during the time of Christ. Maier then fills in the missing parts with his own fictional \\"filler\\" that fits the historical facts.I have loaned this book out dozens of times and my friends and family are also amazed. Everybody loves the book. I'm certain you will too."},{"Title":"Pontius Pilate","review":"Too many great Biblical novels, especially those that were made into great movies in the 1950s and 60s, suffered from the fact that they constructed narratives that required a wild dose of historical speculation or embellishment that doesn't square with the accounts we've learned from the Gospels and from the archeological record.But Paul Maier, a Biblical scholar and historian, found a new way of writing a good novel that *also* manages to be informative and scholarly, and it's a pity that his approach has not been emulated by others. In \\"Pontius Pilate\\", Maier starts with *every* known historical fact about Pilate, and constructs his fictional narrative with a keen eye on connecting that which is known. There are no fictional characters at the centerpiece as in classic novels like \\"The Robe\\" and \\"Ben Hur.\\" Along the way, Maier, as a scholar, gives us documented footnotes to explain why he has written the narrative this way and referred the reader to appropriate primary sources from Antiquity.The end result is both a book that gives us a compelling narrative AND enlightens amateur Biblical historians about the scholarly record and what we should consult further. That is the greatness of this work, and along the way I gained more insight and understanding of the Roman politics affecting the governing of Judea at the time of Christ. In particular, Maier enlightens the reader of how Pilate's background likely suggested ties to the notorious Sejanus, who was executed by Emperor Tiberius for conspiring against him. Since Sejanus was disdainful of the Jews, Pilate's association with him might have led to the incidents documented in Philo and Josephus that caused relations to be bad with the Jews (the matter of displaying the Emperor's image on iconic standards, and the use of Temple money to construct an aqueduct). Afterwards, with Tiberius imposing a more pro-Jewish policy, Pilate would have found himself forced to curry more favor with the Jews, lest they complain to Tiberius who might find reason to remove Pilate based on his past associations with Sejanus.And in that context, we then understand perhaps the real reason for why at the trial of Jesus, Pilate was told, \\"If you free this man, you are no friend of Caesar.\\" and why despite the misgivings he seemed to have, he felt compelled to give in. This is likely a true indicator of Pilate's character and motives, and it's worth noting that Mel Gibson's \\"Passion Of The Christ\\" essentially uses this interpretation of Pilate that Maier offers in his film.Maier also depicts Pilate's wife Procula (Maier does not refer to her as \\"Claudia Procula\\" because he notes that the name \\"Claudia\\" comes from a much later tradition than the name Procula) as someone who tentatively is moving in the direction of faith in Christ by story's end. Since history does not tell us conclusively what happened to Pilate after he was recalled by Tiberius, Maier leaves the question of his fate open-ended and while this might not be satisfying to those expecting a more clean narrative, it still works in this genre and one comes away feeling that their knowledge of the 1st century AD has been enhanced greatly.The pity is that this novel never received big screen epic movie treatment, because it deserved it a lot more than other well-noted Biblical novels that did reach the big screen."},{"Title":"Pontius Pilate","review":"Paul L. Maier is obviously a scholar, and his novel about Pontius Pilate is the evidence. Providing endnotes to his facts, Maier paints a picture of a Pilate who is interested in preserving his own neck while making the correct political moves, yet too often the prefect ends up making the wrong alliances as well as the wrong calls. The novel is a little slow in some spots--even getting a little complex as one needs to keep track of the many characters, especially the \\"Herods\\"-- but it's worthwhile sticking with it till the end. I only wonder what Pilate's fate really was, as Maier himself admits that his end is left up to speculation. All in all, Pontius Pilate is good reading, especially around the time of Lent and the days leading up to the Easter story."},{"Title":"Pontius Pilate","review":"Having read thousands of books with Christian themes, I consider this among the more appealing works.

He adopts 3 rules,1) He doesn't invent characters and only uses names of real people 2) He uses information in the primary sources whenever possible and only speculates on plot features where the sources are lacking. 3) He includes documented footnotes for a great number of events in the life of Pilate, these not only lead you to the primary sources, they also give the author's justification for how he interprets them and incorporates them into the story.If you want to read the Christ story from a new perspective, this book will give you an eyewitness account from the eye sockets of one of the key players in Christ' life. You will understand the political background to the New Testament and gain a new appreciation for how the miraculous events in Jesus ministry were interpreted."},{"Title":"Pontius Pilate","review":"Paul Maier does an excellent job in this historical novel of being true to the facts where they are available, and being believably fictional in places where there are no facts available. This book traces the career of Pontius Pilate in Roman administration, his prefecture in Judea before, during, and after Christ. Highly researched and with full reference notes. I think the book is more guided to the student of history than of religion, but it will fit on both shelves."},{"Title":"Pontius Pilate","review":"Two thousand years ago, there was a trial that changed history. Jesus Christ was dragged before the Roman politician who had to make the fateful choice that would place the Messiah on the cross. Who was this man, Pontius Pilate? What was life really like in those days, what political forces shaped events of that moment?***** Paul Maier does an excellent job of exploring these questions in his novel that was published decades ago, but due to the timelessness of the subject, has held up well over the years. Pilate's choices are seen as both political and perhaps even divine necessity as the day that will become Good Friday unfolds. With the use of real figures and well researched customs, Dr. Maier sweeps readers back two millenia. Calling it fiction is almost an insult, because it is so very realistic. One complaint is that there is not a sequel exploring Pilate's wife, a woman who stands beside Caeser's wife in fascination."},{"Title":"Pontius Pilate","review":"This is the kind of book one can hardly put down, reads eagerly, and is sorry when it's finished. Maier is clearly a scholar, who has included as much historical data as can be found (from a variety of sources), and has plausibly interpreted gaps in the record. He draws an interesting picture of first-century life in Rome and Palestine, and makes the reader aware of events that otherwise might have escaped notice. Throughout, he realistically weaves elements of the life of Christ from different points of view, especially Roman, and one comes away from the book with the impression of how the emergent Christian faith appeared to people of that era. For both people of faith and those without, this account provides a fascinating vantage point, and is worth reading as fiction, as history, as an adjunct to belief, or all three."},{"Title":"Pontius Pilate","review":"I thought this book would be all fact, but it is a novel at heart. Pilate is new territory for me, so I didn't realize how little information there was on him.The fiction is painted with a larger brush than the facts to complete the picture and to Mr. Maier's credit, he is very specific about when, how, and why he includes the made up sequences.As a Seminary student, I am very picky about keeping fact seperate from fiction. What is great about Dr. Maier's book is the documentation he has done. An excellent addition to my bookshelf."},{"Title":"Pontius Pilate","review":"Maier is a first-rate theologian-historian, who utilized history as backdrop for this novel. He notes where history is on his side, and on those that he inferences what it would be like, he also provides the historical references which swayed him.The style is smooth and moves from context to context with ease and style. The context of Pilate's role in history of the Christian church is significant, and Maier draws on this to portray an amazing tale of suspense and intrigue.Readers will be captivated and will enjoy giving this as gift for reading as well."},{"Title":"Pontius Pilate","review":"The review written by Marianne S. Rankin of University Park, Maryland is clearly the most insightful of the reviews written to date on Amazon. I have read all three of Dr. Maier's historical fiction (one being an historical fiction / mystery) and can say that few authors have such a command of subject matter -historical, religion, science, etc. - to write works of such quality. One can say, without qualification, that the research is not superficial. His writing style is magnificent. This book, and the others, are truly \\"hard to put down.\\" I read all three within two weeks and only regret that there are not more available. Needless to say, his works of non-fiction are also superb. Whether he has authored or collaborated, a book with Paul L.

It's also a great book to learn about the relationship between the Jews and the Roman and that fateful trial. I recommend it highly, specially for teens who don't want to learn history the old way. Maier predates Dan Brown in this genre and has a key difference, he has the credentials and the accuracy to write a novel that takes no creative license with history."},{"Title":"Pontius Pilate","review":"Outstanding book! I love to see the politics of Pilates decision come to life. Seeing a possible portrayal of his human side is also entertaining and thought provoking."},{"Title":"Pontius Pilate","review":"The Author, Dr. Paul Maier is a Professor of Ancient History at Western Michigan University. In 1968, he wrote the book for which he is perhaps best known for, \\"Pontius Pilate: A Novel\\". I first read this book in 1979, and it has been on my bookshelf ever since, as I will not part with it. I have always been intrigued by Pontius Pilate, especially in his role as prefect of Judea and the infamous trial of Jesus of Nazareth. What kind of man was he? Are there historical records that might indicate what he thought and what he did before he was mentioned in the Bible? Dr. Maier answers these questions, and much more, in this very engaging historical (fiction) novel on Pilate.Pontius Pilate is mentioned in several historical writings besides the Bible, and it is in these that Dr. Maier crafts the life of the man who condemned Jesus to death. Dr. Maier leans heavily on Josephus's, \\"Antiquities of the Jews\\", and \\"The Jewish War\\". Other sources of Pilate include Philo of Alexandria, Tacitus' Annals of Imperial Rome, and in writings of the early church fathers. Using these historical sources, and of course the four Gospel accounts, Dr. Maier constructs Pilate's life, centering on his time in Judea, and then afterwards, when he was called back to Rome. (Very little is known of Pilate's life before his Roman service).The book is written in Pilate's point of view, which certainly engages the reader, and gives the unique perspective of a Roman who had little interest, (much less faith) in the Jewish religious traditions. Pilate's job was to govern the Jews of Judea, a difficult task at best, as they despised Roman rule. The impression the reader gets is that Pilate despised (perhaps \\"loathed\\" is the definitive word) the very people he governed. Being a historian, Dr. Maier takes great care in using historical characters and documented historical events in his reconstruction of the Pilate-Jesus story. In the instances where there is not firm historical basis, Dr. Maier suggests the actions and motives of the characters, (thus, the historical fiction part), yet, I suspect he took few liberties in writing the fiction sections.In the end, one leaves this book with a much better understanding of Pilate, the events surrounding the trial and crucifixion of Christ, and the motivations Pilate had for making the decisions he did.konedog"},{"Title":"Pontius Pilate","review":"An interesting and believable portrait of Pontius Pilate the Roman official, husband and man.

Few can blend so much history and present it in a format lay people can grasp."},{"Title":"Pontius Pilate","review":"No spoilersAll I can say is Paul Maier scores yet another hit with this gem. If you've read any Maier \\"historical novel,\\" you know that he is the absolute best of the genre. He uses only documented historical facts for the majority of all of his novels (including Pontius Pilate), and only takes the liberty to use his literary creativity to construct dialogue between characters. If you think an entire novel about the life of Pontius Pilate would be boring, then you need to forget about whatever you learned about him in catholic school, because this is one story that will keep you held.The bottom line is that if you've ever read a Maier book before, you know how great he is at what he does and I'm sure you won't need much coaxing to get this book.

Name one prefect of a Roman province from the first century A.D.Good grief! Who cares? Those guys are gone forever. You're sure they were politicians. Dedicated public servants, perhaps. Bureaucrats in CYA mode? Very likely. Overworked, underappreciated, misunderstood, and demoralized? It wouldn't surprise me. Suck-ups and panderers? Sure, even the Roman empire had those, too.But one of these bureaucratic, underappreciated, dedicated governors' names HAS come down through history -- Pontius Pilate, governor of Judea, the man who tried Jesus of Nazareth.Out of everything the man worked on over the course of his career, every job he held, every public works project, military campaign, and trial he must have overseen, HOW did this particular trial make him a man fated to be remembered for thousands of years?After all, he is probably the only Roman citizen whose name is a household byword.Paul Maier wrote his story.This documented novel tells the story of a career politician upholding his commitments. Using source material, Maier does an admirable job of recreating the tensions and unrest of Judea in the first century, the challenge of pleasing an emperor gone mad, and the political whirlwinds of Herod's descendants competing for the throne of Judea. It gives a full context for the trial of Jesus of Nazareth.The notes at the back of the book are perhaps the best part, filling in gaps and elucidating what is fact and what is speculation.

As a writer myself, I wanted to find a lot of research for my work. There isn't much out there about this man, Pontius Pilate. This book is a fictional well written piece that Mr. Maier took care to put his readers into the shoes of his characters. He did a great job of moving forward and keeping me hooked. It was one of those stories, that I couldn't put down. Once again, Jim had to cook dinner! I found it to be a great read and I will be reading more of his work.I would recommend this novel to anyone who likes to read about biblical history and the Roman civilization. Paul does well with explaining how the Roman government operated during the time of Jesus' walk on this earth and the confusion that Pontius Pilate dealt with in making many of his decisions.[...]"},{"Title":"Pontius Pilate","review":"This book was published in 1968 and has withstood the test of time. Basically, it is a story about Pontius Pilate's posting as a non-noble governor of Judea (as opposed to Galilee)and his experiences in dealing with the restive folks under Rome's rule. Pilate (fom the Latin 'pilas' the Roman spear with the 6 foot shaft) is from a distinguished Sammite family and has to tread very carefully when dealing with Tiberius, Caligula, and finally, Claudius. But equally difficult are the varius Agrippas (kings noblemen, and famous women) Top this off with the Saducees and Pharisees, the various messianic cults, and it's no wonder that he is famously remembered for washing his hands of a certain (ahem) politically charged affair. The amount of thought and scholarship that went into this novel was considerable. Th footnotes are helpful. But it was the focus on a historically marginal character (Pilate) and his attempts to deal with the world as he has known it that makes it jump off the page. Personally, this help me fill in a lot of gaps about this part of the Roman empire. Hats off to Paul L. Maier."},{"Title":"Pontius Pilate","review":"I had to get this book after reading \\"The Flames of Rome.\\" I did not enjoy this novel as much as \\"Flames,\\" but it still was an entertaining and informative read. I think I learned a lot of Biblical history by reading this book, without the boredom sometimes associated with historical reading. This is an entertaining read for someone looking for an author who doesn't make his stories too complex with figurative language and lengthy, detailed descriptions. Maier effectively brings characters to life without getting lost in the wording. The story flows well."},{"Title":"Pontius Pilate","review":"If you are going to pick up this book, you are probably very familiar with Pilate's role in the Passion of Jesus already. What this book will really give you is a very readable explanation of politics in Jesus' time as illustrated by Pilate's career. If you have been confused before by the succession of Julian emperors and Herodian kings, or by who ruled when in which part of Palestine, or by what was Roman policy in Palestine at which time, this book will make it all clear to you.I already had some knowledge of a few incidents involving Pilate and the Jewish authorities, such as the iconic standards and the Jerusalem aqueduct, but this book really helped me clarify how those events developed and what was at stake. The Roman political environment in Pilate's time was truly horrific (the fate of Sejanus' children chilled my blood) and this book will definitely let you glimpse at the horror and how it might have affected Pilate's thinking.Be sure to read the notes. The author is crystal-clear about when he gives solid historical fact and when he embarks in plausible creative speculation (such as Pilate's dialogues with Cornelius and his encounter with Paul).As the author clearly exposes, the earliest sources and church traditions overall do not give an unfavorable image of Pilate (the glaring exception is Philo who in all likelihood was pushing an agenda). He could not have done so bad a job if he held his post for 10 years. It is quite telling, therefore, that those who were closer to the actual events were indeed sympathetic to him and such is reflected in Maier's book. The vilification of Pilate only came later.In short, extremely informative and enjoyable. I can't wait now to start \\"The Flames of Rome\\"."},{"Title":"Pontius Pilate","review":"Paul Maier's 1968 novel \\"Pontius Pilate\\" is an interesting and creative narrative. Its 372 (paperback) pages through 32 chapters offers considerable learning from his experience with various ancient writers and biblical witnesses.With his imaginative style Maier suggests the life of Pilate, from his appointment as Judean prefect in AD 26 until the post resurrection year of Jewish king Agippa II's death in AD 42, is rife with paradox.Also, one reads here of Pilate's many interviews with important period personalities ranging from Roman emperor Tiberius to newly converted Christian Apostle Paul of Tarsus. Maier also proffers a usable and presentable analysis of Christ's trial before Pontius Pilate (in chapter 18).The novel, additionally, tells the interesting stories of the governor's triumphs (building Caesarea's Tiberieum and Jerusalem's massive aqueduct) and failures (with the Jerusalem standards affair, the emperor's golden shields problem, and the battle of Mt. Gerizim).By the book's conclusion Maier reasons that Pilate's life is a provocative paradox. Late in life the retired prefect realizes that his capital sentencing for Jesus of Nazareth was the catalyst for a new religion. (Maier disagrees with fourth century witnesses who say Pilate committed suicide in Vienna soon after his AD 36 departure from Israel.) The life long religious skeptic, Pilate, with pricked conscience (mostly by the prodding from his supposed Christian convert wife \\"Procula\\") wonders about the necessity of faith. The novel ends with Pilate considering confessional, yet unanswered, questions.The \\"Notes\\" section (pp. 348-372) is most helpful and completes the novel. It speaks to the narrative's historical basis. Two period maps appear in the section.\\"Pontius Pilate\\" is recommendable for scholars and the general reader. It is a worthy candidate for augmenting Bible study, as church school curriculum, and for Lenten/Easter studies."},{"Title":"Pontius Pilate","review":"One of the most accurate historical novels ever written about the 6 trials of Christ, giving the background of the Sanhedrin and a refreshing view of Pilate's political dilemma in the trials of Christ."},{"Title":"Pontius Pilate","review":"Maier has managed to write a story true to its roots, yet also keeps the reader entertained with a truly gripping account of Jesus Christ through the life story of Pontius Pilate.The skillful hands of Maier have crafted a character than many of us know, but few of us understand.

His work is essentially a character sketch of Pontius Pilate that paints a clear picture of the time of Christ from a Roman point of view. His detailing of the politics of Rome and their relationship to Judea as well as the politics of Judea and their relationship to Rome was outstanding. Maier's writing still sounds a little much like a professor rather than a novelist (hence the 4 stars instead of 5), but for me the engrossing way in which the events unfold more than made up for the lack of powerful writing. Ultimately, this was a book I just couldn't put down--even though I was essentially learning world history from cover to cover."},{"Title":"Pontius Pilate","review":"This book, Pontius Pilate by Paul L. Maier, seemed to me to be a realistic biography of a man we know little about. I was especially impressed by the author's affirmation that he strived for reality, what probably occurred, over drama. And I think he achieved that, given cause and effect, what probably happened based on what we do know (from the notes in the back of the book.) Given human nature and the political climate in Rome and Israel at the time, the book has an air of authenticity about it.Also it was written with crystal clarity, to quote a clich&eacute;, and was easy to read --- it kept me rivited, anxious to see what would happen next.The copy I received was in very good condition.No complaints, unless it would be the places that differ from the King James Version of the Bible --- I hold to the KJV over all other versions and books."},{"Title":"Pontius Pilate","review":"Pontius Pilate was someone who wanted to do the right thing while simultaneously be politically correct to advance his political career. But the problem is the two are most often incompatible. He was torn between a pro-Jewish Tiberius the Caesar and an anti-Jewish Sejanus; Tiberius' closest ally and the army commander, before the latter was executed for conspiracy. To complicate the matter, being the governor of Judea, not only did he have to deal with the people of Palestine; perhaps one of the hardest people to govern unless they are governed by their own people, but he was also doing the impossible when he tried to Romanize them. The desire to do the right thing is evident from his good will to build the Jerusalem aqueduct on behalf of public interest. But the most interesting event of his career is when he was hard-pressed to hand a guilty verdict; a death sentence to a Galilean Preacher, known as Yeshua Hannosri or Jesus. The Jewish Council threatened if Pilate decided to acquit Jesus, then he was no friend of Caesar. This \\"Friend of Caesar\\" was no casual term. It refers to Caesar's \\"inner-circle,\\" a coveted position among the Roman elites. So here is when Pilate betrayed the pull toward doing the right thing going against the pull toward political correctness where the latter eventually prevailed.The highlight of Pilate's life does not lie in his failure as the governor of Judea in which he was finally recalled and replaced. The highlight is that guilty verdict implicitly handed against Jesus by bowing to the pressure to crucify him that Maier calls \\"the verdict that changed the course of history.\\" Here I add to be more specific, \\"the verdict that served as a means to accomplish a divine plan for the redemption of humanity from sin and the wrath of God.\\" The immensity of the impact of this verdict can only be understood from the Bible. The Master Planner behind the event that led to the execution of Jesus through Pilate's verdict is given in the account of St. Peter's address in Jerusalem recorded in Acts 2:22-24, \\"Men of Israel, listen to this: Jesus of Nazareth was a man accredited by God to you by miracles, wonders and signs, which God did among you through him, as you yourselves know. This man was handed over to you by God's set purpose and foreknowledge; and you, with the help of wicked men, put him to death by nailing him to the cross. But God raised him from the dead, freeing him from the agony of death, because it was impossible for death to keep its hold on him.\\" The Apostle Paul in his epistle to the Romans wrote that Jesus \\"was delivered over to death for our sins and was raised to life for our justification\\" with the grand purpose of \\"to the praise of God's glory\\" (Eph 1:6, 12).I believe Paul Maier's \\"Pontius Pilate\\" would make a good movie, on par with or probably even better than Mel Gibson's \\"The Passion of the Christ.\\" But the experience of reading the novel itself is highly rewarding already. This is not an ordinary novel, but one backed with solid historical references, and the content of which, beyond the story of Pontius Pilate but primarily of Jesus, has to do with the eternal destiny of everyone."},{"Title":"Pontius Pilate","review":"I am reading this book during the 40 days of Lent.

She argues that, despite the presumption of most in the U.S. that immigrants should, \\"when in Rome do as the Romans do\\", this is an unrealistic expectation for many immigrants who come to America with language barriers and strong ties to thier respective cultures. She argues that predispositions created by a certain cultural upbringing are undeniable and should be admissable in criminal court to provide a partial defense in terms of motive.Although her arguments are unique, persuasive and offer insight into legal questions that are somewhat undeveloped, she does not sufficiently address the power and validity of a percieved American national identity and the sancitity of the American justice system. Further, she does not address the plausibility that the cultural defense would be accepted into any other international court of law, ignoring the responsibility of other nations with substantial immigrant populations to accept a cultural defense as the U.S. is supposed to do according to the author."},{"Title":"The Cultural Defense","review":"The author believes that the rights of humans to follow their culture should trump animal rights, allowing horrific abuse of animals with the excuse that \\"it's their culture.\\" She applies the same excuse for the mutilation of children and the oppression of women. She even applies it to honour killings and child brides. She justifies this cultural relativism by saying that U.S. culture, if such can even be said to exist, is not hegemonic in the world.The obvious flaw here is that just because different viewpoints exist, they are not necessarily all equally valid. Ayaan Hirsi Ali sums it up best: \\"Cultural and moral relativists sap our sense of moral outrage by defending the position that human rights are a Western invention. Men who abuse women rarely fail to use the vocabulary the relativists have kindly provided them. They claim the right to adhere to an alternative set of values - an \\"Asian,\\" \\"African\\" or \\"Islamic\\" approach to human rights. This mind-set needs to be broken. A culture that carves the genitals of young girls, hobbles their minds, and justifies their physical oppression is not equal to a culture that believes women have the same rights as men.\\""},{"Title":"The Cultural Defense","review":"While some would explain away cultural defenses as \\"cultural excuses\\" for crimes, it is important to note (as Renteln's book repeatedly does) that American morals and values are not hegemonic throughout the world. This being said, Renteln's ideas are not without controversy, as providing parents who fondle their children with a sound legal defense is likely to raise the eyebrows of even the most liberal of defense advocates.The very basic point of The Cultural Defense that I believe is often missed is it's indirect attack on the assumption that culture has been established in the United States. If one were to blindly follow the letter of the law as written in 1787, slavery, spousal-rape, and other current crimes would still be legal. The point is that the founding fathers were not representative of the social, economic and racial makeup of the United States at the time of it's founding, nor would they be representative of the US today. Thus, by following the ideals of culture that were set forth in the oldest laws of our nation by denying alternative cultural considerations, the US is placing itself on a dangerous path towards a cultural lag in law that does not represent what modern America needs or wants out of its government and its laws.The Cultural Defense does not excuse those who commit crimes. It merely advocates understanding the background of those individuals who break the law. If a history of abuse or violence within a white family can be allowed into court, surely the cultural history of a racial or ethnic minority should be allowed as well."},{"Title":"The Cultural Defense","review":"\\"The Cultural Defense\\" integrates an abstract theoretical discussion of cultural pluralism with a close and sensitive analysis of a wide range of concrete cases.

W. Sawyer was a Brit who excelled in making even the most opaque topic in mathematics understandable and clear to his many students and readers.Sawyer's *Vision in Elementary Mathematics* adds to his sterling reputation. On the surface, *Vision* focuses on various topics in 'elementary' mathematics including: algebra, arithmetic, and geometry. A deeper look at this book reveals, however, that Sawyer's book goes well beyond rehashing basic concepts in math.The focus in this book -- as the title *Vision* suggests -- is on helping both students and teachers have a stronger inuitive grasp of basic concepts of mathematics that many teachers tend to gloss over. As many people have experienced in their own education, mathematics is often treated as a mysterious, 'black box'-like subject. That kind of mindless and unthinking approach to mathematics teaching and learning tend to turn many people off to the subject. This ongoing tragedy in American education has been well researched by another excellent book, *Knowing and Teaching Elementary Mathematics* by Liping Ma.Sawyer wrote this book in order to combat the unthinking approach to math education. The remedy he offers to that kind of approach is to encourage a deeper understanding of mathematics from relatively simple concepts like fractions, arithmetic, and number properties all the way up to polynomial equations. My favorite quote from this book, which is repeated in different forms, is: \\"We first try to make sure that we can see what the problem means - for if we do not understand the question, we have no hope of finding the answer.\\" As this quote suggests, *Vision* focuses on helping people to truly UNDERSTAND what mathematical problems really mean.*Vision* utilizes various techniques to help readers to have a deeper level of understanding of mathematics. Sawyer encourages people to develop some geometrical heuristics to help them grasp a problem. A great example of this is how Sawyer explains how to easily multiply and divide anything from numbers all the way up to polynomial algebraic equations using 'matrix'-like geometric concepts -- no mean feat!Another great thing about *Vision* is that Sawyer encourages experimentation by students in this book. As many math-lovers know, you can't really learn mathematics without doing it. Sawyer not only encourages people to 'do' math but to experiment with it. By encouraging students to think about math problems in creative and novel ways -- and to not be afraid of making mistakes and, hopefully, learning from them -- *Vision* will help many math students to get a greater appreciation for the subject and will encourage them to be much more creative about the subject. Furthermore, by encouraging student to find out for themselves the whys and hows of a correct solution, *Vision* will encourage the kind of mentality one has to have to become a good mathematician or scientist.In this regard, it should also be noted that Sawyer includes several exercises at the end of each chapter and includes ANSWERS at the end of the book for each and every question (very helpful for self-learning).A surprising -- given its focus on 'elementary' mathematics -- benefit of this book is that it provides solid foundations for more advance topics in mathematics. *Vision* provides excellent foundations for number theory, linear algebra, calculus, trigonometry, and combinatorics. Another plus for this book is that Sawyer deliberately tries to emphasize the fact that mathematics -- at any level -- can be useful to real-life problems because mathematics underlies so much of what we see in the natural world.Who should read this book? The obvious audiences are teachers and students of mathematics in anywhere from elementary school up to high school. This book would be especially helpful to home-schoolers who are interested in providing their kids with a solid grounding in mathematics that can be built upon when they attend university.But those aren't the only people who should read this book. This book should be read by people who feel that they had an 'incomplete' education. People, like myself, who felt a bit cheated by the poor state of the educational system should definitely read this book no matter how confident (or un-confident) about their mathematical abilities.This book can and should be read by advance students and teachers of mathematics in fields ranging from engineers to scientists (including professional mathematicians). Those advanced users of mathematics can use this book both for review and to get some additional insights into their chosen subject. I have no doubt that Sawyer has insights and creative approaches in *Vision* that will prove valuable to mathematicians at any level.Finally, ANYONE interested in getting a 'profound understanding of fundamental mathematics' (often abbreviated PUFM in educational policy circles) for whatever reason MUST read this wonderful book. *Vision* perfectly fulfills Sawyer's vision of writing a book that helps people to look at mathematics in a novel way that will help them to have a deeper understanding and appreciation for mathematics."},{"Title":"Vision in Elementary Mathematics.","review":"Sawyer's text describes visual methods for making concepts from elementary algebra and those areas of arithmetic that tend to pose difficulties for students, including manipulating negative numbers and fractions, understandable. This text was written in response to Sawyer's experiences teaching algebra to a class of mathematically advanced elementary school students, but the methods he discusses here are more widely applicable. Teachers of pre-algebra and elementary algebra will benefit from reading this text.Sawyer discusses concepts from arithmetic and algebra, including even and odd numbers, divisibility tests, negative numbers, fractions, operations on polynomials, graphs, and the Pythagorean Theorem. As Sawyer discusses each topic, he introduces visual models that help students understand the concept that they are learning. Throughout the text, Sawyer warns the reader about the type of mistakes students are prone to make, why they make them, and how to address them.Sawyer objects to the practice of teaching algebra by having the students learn a series of skills that allow them to solve increasingly complicated problems without first placing what they are learning in context. He feels that method of teaching discourages students from wanting to learn algebra. Instead, he advocates posing problems that can be represented visually so that students can see what is happening rather than memorizing a rule. Sawyer has his students explore variations on a problem, including their own versions, and search for patterns. This process, which mimics what mathematicians do, helps students understand the concept, which is preferable to having them memorize a rule without understanding the reason for it. He also stresses the importance of having the students master a concept before building to the next concept, arguing that teaching new concepts to students with a poor foundation does them a disservice since they won't be able to understand the new concept until they have that foundation.The text includes exercises, most of which are routine calculations. However, there are some more interesting problems in which you are asked to search for a pattern. Answers to all of the exercises are provided in the back of the text.I have some caveats. American readers should be warned that this is a British text, so there are differences in terminology and notation. As Sawyer notes, Americans refer to indices as exponents. Also, the roles of the dot used as a decimal point and the dot used for multiplication are interchanged. Readers outside the United States should be aware that the text is old enough to refer to old English units rather than the metric system. It is also old enough to refer to sixpences, half crowns, and shillings, coins that the British have replaced.Sawyer's writing is clear, but it is also dry and pedantic. Consequently, I found the text to be a slow read. Therefore, while I can recommend it to teachers of algebra, I do not recommend it to lay readers."},{"Title":"Vision in Elementary Mathematics.","review":"Clear instruction on guiding students through the the most frequently stumbled upon topics in elementary math and algebra: fractions, negatives, combining vs. multiplying terms, distributing negative signs, and a wonderful introduction to simultaneous equations.His methods leave the \\"rules\\" out letting students SEE why a rule may be made.

It's called TALES OF A RAT-HUNTING MAN. It's the non-fiction memoirs of a British guy who is a rat hunting afficionado. It's all about ferrets and dogs and the killing of brown rats. But there is much more to it than that. It's an extended essay and apology (that is, defense) of a way of life in England that is almost impossible to sustain in that claustophobic culture--but somehow D. Brian Plummer has managed to keep a bit of freedom in the stratified rubble. This is really the only Englishman I think I could ever like. He's got a hell of a narrative voice, and is obviously no eccentric, though he enjoys playing one. Anyway, read this slender volume and you'll have a hard time fighting the urge to go hunt rats with a dog, ferret and stick.

As a journalist myself (not yellow)I always thought of Hearst as a publisher. This book completely surprised me in the way it builds the case for Hearst as the world's first media mogul. There are great details about Hearst's controlling role in Hollywood and puts Citizen Kane in an entirely new light. Great reading."},{"Title":"Hearst over Hollywood: Power, Passion, and Propaganda in the Movies","review":"Hearst Over Hollywood is a book that could appeal to a large cross-section of readers - historians, movie buffs, those with interests in journalism and media, etc. Louis Pizzatola has done an incredibly admirable job in compiling sources and data on William Randolph Hearst and presenting him in a new light - something very difficult to do after over 100 years of Hearst representations in the media and popular culture. That in itself makes it a worthwhile read.While I hate to be the one to knock down this book's perfect customer rating to date, I feel that an honest review on my part would require that I also point out some of the book's flaws. Because it is so densely filled with information, many chapters bog down over sequences that perhaps could have been better conveyed if streamlined. I can appreciate the fact that it would be hard to determine exactly where to streamline, so I suppose that some readers who possess some knowledge on the subject going in will be able to pick out what interests them.The book is about as objective as any work on Hearst could be and it is a pleasure to re-think Citizen Kane from the context of knowing more about its erstwhile main character. If you've never seen it or haven't in a while, I would recommend watching the film, reading the book, and then watching it again.Pizzitola's thoroughness does serve him very well in exploring how Hearst built his media empire from the publishing industry through the nascent Hollywood studio system and balances nicely the clinical examinations with the gossipy show-business scandal aspects of the man's life.Very well done."},{"Title":"Hearst over Hollywood: Power, Passion, and Propaganda in the Movies","review":"The author describes himself as a visual artist and amateur film maker. I've got news for him: he's a first rate scholar too. I cannot remember the last time I've read a book on history that was so well presented and so amply documented. If you want to understand how the US came to become a \\"wag the dog\\" TV-ocracy and how CNN could morph into a televised version of the National Enquirer, check out this masterpiece. The source of our present day media sewer can all be traced back to Hearst's turn-of-the-century and-beyond media 'experiments.' This book belongs on the bookshelf - in a featured location - of anyone who is interested in 20th century American history. It's an absolutely stunning work of scholarship, packed with well documented detail, and completely approachable."},{"Title":"Hearst over Hollywood: Power, Passion, and Propaganda in the Movies","review":"I have never read such a well researched and detailed examination of any topic.

It lists around 1500 words which are allegedly the ones you will most often encounter on the SAT and GRE tests.It does, however, possess strictly the elements you will find in any good dictionary: the words are listed in alphabetical order(a pronunciation note is given for each word), each word is thoroughly defined, and you are provided with several (excellent) examples on its usage, often one for each of its different meanings (if the word has more than one meaning).Although it very much looks like the content of an average-quality dictionary you probably already own, its main function could not be disputed - the author has carefully selected (out of hundreds of thousands) those 1500 words that are most likely that an educated person will need in its vocabulary, not only to take successfully one of the above-mentioned tests, but also in his career and everyday life.There are also some review exercises after each section, which consist solely of the task of linking synonymous words - again a feature with limited usefulness, since almost all dictionaries already provide you with a list of synonyms. I believe the author could have been more creative in his effort to provide good review practice, especially because reviewing is the only way to memorize the words you've just met and ultimately build up your vocabulary by using them. Furthermore, I also think the author could have thought of a better way to group the words - thematically, by level of difficulty, or in any other systematic way. Instead, he decided on listing them alphabetically, which is of limited usefulness to the student. You may soon get bored, since it feels like reading a dictionary. The good side is that you will easily find a word you are looking for (although this could have been achieved with an index at the end of the book). Even so, you do not have to follow this book as it is written. You may choose, like I have, to simply open it randomly and do some reading; the negative side being, of course, that you may do many repetitions and omissions in this way. But repetitions are good for your vocabulary, right :)?Despite this, I find this book quite enjoying and I highly recommend it. Although I do not intend to take any of the tests this book helps you prepare, it still is an excellent way to expand your vocabulary extensively, incorporating many important words that you will certainly use in one way or another in your life. Let me draw your attention to the fact that many studies have shown that your professianal and even social success is directly linked to the scope and depth of your vocabulary."},{"Title":"Webster's New World Essential Vocabulary","review":"I love this book very much.It collects most of the important word for GRE(I don't now SAT so I can't say.)It has example sentences and also a quick review(find synonym) after 12 words.I love this structure and the words within collection."},{"Title":"Statesmen of the lost cause;: Jefferson Davis and his cabinet,","review":"If you want to know what Jefferson Davis' cabinet was like, this book is for you.Even though it is old, the author provides a balanced narrative. Much of what Sesquicentennial historians overlooks is found in this book."},{"Title":"Statesmen of the lost cause;: Jefferson Davis and his cabinet,","review":"Whichever side you favor at the outset, you win a greater perspective on the men and motives behind the great struggle that became known as the American Civil War by reading this book. It proves, beyond doubt, that a 2000-plus date imprimatur does not ensure better thinking!Many true to the cause are profiled here with excellence, many years before Douglas Southall Freeman is credited with having given the \\"Cause\\" credibility and the Army of Northern Virginia under Gen. R.E. Lee the legitimization of having won the \\"Lost Cause\\" argument for time immemorial.We read here and can understand why Vice President Alexander Stephens (without a middle name) rarely strode far from and within a small radius surrounding his modest boyhood home, also why Georgia was easily understood by others of his time as his \\"country.\\" We can also see how Jefferson Davis himself became caught up in a Southern \\"Federalism\\"--almost of necessity. The Confederacy struggled as much as the United States with the concept of \\"states' rights\\"--its constitution being nearly identical. This great volume describing some of the greatest statesmen of the nineteenth century sweeps us up with the end of the true \\"second war for independence\\" and helps every reader understand why another revolution was deemed by many not only timely but necessary. It could and should have been resolved without bloodshed. Yet today, it seems common wisdom that the premise of the founding documents--that a government not responsive and representative of the people should be overthrown--is \\"antiquated\\" or simply impossible so effect.Yet even in diplomacy to the Vatican, under Pius IX, we see the greatest difficulty the Southern Democracy had with acceptance. Acceptance at the Vatican, one would hope, would rest on higher principles than commerce in cotton. Each dipomat representing the Confederacy faced the same question--what consitituency did he represent? How could A. Dudley Mann, emissary from Davis to the Catholic Sovereign, purport to speak for any Confederate State on any remotely theological matter? As the Pontiff queried whether any of the emissaries were Roman Catholic in faith, he hit upon the fact that Mason could not even speak to any individual states' disposition on the fate of slavery, however much anyone would protest that it was everywhere withering on the vine and not much of a substantial diplomatic issue.However cumbersome \\"state sovereignty\\" may have been for domestic government, the diplomats of the fledgling nation saw how as a guiding principle it was as unwieldly a concept as Republican Democracy leading to election of a sovereign through an obscure \\"Electoral College\\". Yet, many times, the brilliance of the Electoral College has shown to function well. Loss of state sovereignty was furthered by the popular election of Senators (which had been elected by the State Legislatures); this did not occur until the 20th century.Although the United States once again faced the cumbersome nature of some of its institutions by way of explanation to many diplomatic and journalistic corps in the infamous election of 2000, we have found somehow that it is stable and \\"works\\" despite obtuse explanations, and this wonderful book dips the pen of rational thought of the reader into the thinking and struggles of men who again pledged their \\"lives, fortunes, and sacred honor\\" onto the untested world stage, believing their cause was as just as the Founders in 1776. It was a time perhaps decades before the diplomatic world stage was prepared to accept unwieldy and contradictory nationalistic thinking on any kind of equal footing. However, today, \\"nations\\" of dubious unity gain easy acceptance on the world stage. We must also ask an ultimate question--were not the diplomats of the 19th century more prepared to accept what they could perhaps not simply understand on a theological, philological, or practical basis with more dignity and general respect than those who supposedly benefit from the advanced \\"communication\\" made possibly by the internet age? This rapid advanced communication sometimes reads to rapid and poorly considered decisions made about whom to support (e.g. in Egypt, in Libya), where we (the U.S.) begin supporting our former foes immediately when they establish themselves as \\"rebels.\\" We have to admit that there are some places that are not yet advanced enough to embrace Jeffersonian \\"democracy\\" or a republican form of government--and none of the founding documents of the U.S. use the word \\"democracy.\\"Just as George Eliot is quoted at the beginning of the new film \\"Gods & Generals\\" and as Alexander Stephens also lauded as possible perhaps only from the resting place of his original front porch in Georgia, perhaps the mere contemplation of world diplomacy is only possible from the tranquility of one's home and hearth.We see how as diverse a nation as the C.S.A., with a West-Indian born Attorney General, Secretary of War, and ultimatley Secretary of State, Judah Benjamin, could be taken seriously on the world stage. Yet, the C.S.A. remained proudly and almost painfully rural, clinging to the values that waves of immigration had simply crushed under the pavements of burgeoning industrial cities. The ruling elite were overwhelmingly Anglo-Saxon and Protestant. The emissaries of the Confederacy were met cautiously on a world stage that still struggles to balance principles of \\"basic\\" human rights with the \\"rights\\" or \\"responsibilities\\" of corportatons to raise the living standards of millions. Yet, this compromises the theological and sometimes cumbersome values of great non-governmental institutions from which sustainence of the spirit seems merely possible. There are many \\"white papers,\\" but little action.Even Pope Pius IX, searching for common ground, asked if the emissary A. Dudley Mason were a Catholic, only to find the very few Confederal diplomatics could carry such common ground.And yet the Confederacy, like the United States itself, existed only under conflicting and controversial mandates, and this country continues to exist despite such duplicity. This of course was brought to light in the Presidential Election of 2000. \\"Statesmen of the the Lost Cause\\" showed long before the publishing was of Douglas Southall Freeman that allegiance to seemingly antiquated and contradictory ideal CAN somehow work politically, and under the premise of good faith, lost somewhere in te 19th century, can function diplomatically. The Confederacy was one battle victory of success in diplomatic entreaties with Anglican Britain and Catholic Spain. Both countries would have enjoyed ultimate retribution against the United States of America, alongside economic advantages. I suggest here that the experiment of the Confederacy merely presaged what Churchill called \\"El Alamein\\"--the end of the beginning of introduction of such lack of clear pragmatic thinking on the world stage. We still are struggling with the \\"end of the beginning\\" of such international diplomacy, aand \\"Statesment of the Lost Cause\\" shows, I think, why this beginning has become more difficult, instantaneous non-communication festers and flounders, and fewer take the time to consider the implications of deep thinking on a front porch swing, as Stephens was no doubt wont to do--as often as possible. One cannot doubt that the organization of the C.S.A. was taken with long and due deliberation over decades, not with the rapid and easily misunderstood rapidity of Facebook and Twitter."},{"Title":"Problem Solving with C","review":"This is a great beginners book for C programming.

The book is a keeper, will pass it on to my kids"},{"Title":"The Pioneers (Signet classics)","review":"The title page of James Fenimore Cooper's 1823 novel \\"The Pioneers, or the Sources of the Susquehanna\\" defines it as \\"a Descriptive Tale\\"; and indeed the narrative is more a series of descriptions rather than a straight-forward plot. There is a well-drawn set of characters living quiet country lives. There is a plot \\"teaser\\" that is fairly obvious and finally resolved in the penultimate chapter, and there is a vague love triangle that never intensifies. In fact,Cooper seems to be not so much concerned with events as with attitudes. The story opens at Christmastime of 1793, and the settlers discuss the tumult of that year in Paris and the Vend&eacute;e. (One of their company is an &eacute;migr&eacute; who keeps muttering \\"Les monstres!\\" and \\"Mon pauvre roi!\\") Unfortunately, Cooper seems to have lost track of his time scheme because several months later in the story it's still 1793. This is one of the Leatherstocking Tales, which means that Nathaniel Bumppo (called Leatherstocking by the newcomers, Hawkeye by the Indians) is one of the major characters. But \\"The Pioneers\\", unlike \\"The Last of the Mohicans\\", does not involve Natty in dangerous adventures. (Which is just as well -- he's suppose to be 70 years old.) Instead, the novel presents frontier life in central New York at a settlement on Lake Otsego through commonplace but colorful occurrences: a fishing expedition, a turkey shoot, a gathering at the Bold Dragoon, a trial. The remarkable aspect of \\"The Pioneers\\", and the reason today's readers will identify with it, is the many arguments for the conservation of natural resources, both flora and fauna. Natty Bumppo's concern is understandable, as he is a man of the wilderness. More surprising is the wealthy entrepreneur Judge Temple's insistence that \\"we are stripping the forests, as if a single year would replace what we destroy. But the hour approaches when the laws will take notice of not only the woods, but the game they contain also\\". Later, both he and the Leatherstocking are appalled by the indiscriminate slaughter of birds in a single outing. This ecological attitude gives an unexpectedly modern tone to \\"The Pioneers\\" and makes it sympathetic reading in the 21st Century."},{"Title":"The Pioneers (Signet classics)","review":"I'm a fan of Cooper and as such have enjoyed all of his works that I have read.

Cooper clearly states through Natty Bummpo, the main character, the struggle to maintain the freedom both of man and nature. I'm a very biased person towards the Leatherstocking books; even if one were actually bad, I couldn't help but see the good in it. If you have a short attention span, don't pick up the book.

Long live, Natty Bumppo!"},{"Title":"The Pioneers (Signet classics)","review":"This is, I believe, James Fenimore Cooper's first published work. Before his writings, there were really no great American writers writing stories based in America. Therefore, Cooper is often considered the father of \\"American\\" American literature. His writings helped shape the image people all over the world had of America.To me, this novel was a disappointment. I was hoping for something a bit more gripping and exciting, but what I found was a sort of feel-good, worry-free tour of a small town in upstate New York with amusing, but rather innocent and uninspiring characters. While there are a number of scenes that present the characters with real and substantial dangers, the way they are written and the manner in which Cooper's characters are dealt with throughout the book, leaves the reader with little doubt that things will turn out fine in the end. Maybe I'm being too critical, but I just couldn't really get excited about this story.This book introduces Cooper's most famous character, Leatherstocking, who appears in numerous other Cooper tales (The Last of the Mohicans,The Deerslayer,The Pathfinder, andThe Prarie). In THE PIONEERS, Natty Bumppo is already an old man that really only wishes to live out his life in peace. His character and motivations remain somewhat of a mystery throughout this book, and it is not clear whether Cooper felt him to be a character that he would write more about all along or only after this book was published.In Cooper's introduction to this book, he really kind of bashes the story, claiming that he wrote it for himself and didn't really consider the importance of a broad appeal for his audience. The setting and characters represent the town he grew up in (the town his father founded) and his own family and friends. This admission together with the undeniably slow first half of the book may have helped sour my view of the whole. While some of the characters, notably Elizabeth Temple and Oliver Edwards, are extremely likable and well-written, they just weren't enough to make me love this story.I like some of the things about Cooper's writing, so I'll give his other books a try, but I wasn't too impressed with this one."},{"Title":"The Pioneers (Signet classics)","review":"Classical Cooper work, it can't be beat. The state of New York is expanding, and the make up of the classes is expounded on. This is pioneer budding New York with the wilderness slowly turning its great land holdings into a people orientended land. This is the land our forefathers knew.The story isn't just about land, its about the people that inhabit it. Our hero is a Long Rifle. A man that was part of the landscape long before people were settling it. The times are changing and he has taken a young man under his wing, one with his own abilities. They both hold a secret known only to themselves.The cast of characters besides our two hero's, include the Squire, the Dr., the Squires black male servent, and of course a young woman, and many others. From the gracious living of the upper class, to the world of our heros, which is the forest, you won't want to put this book down. The events and lives of people in that century, cutting into what had been wilderness is covered, as only Cooper can."},{"Title":"The Pioneers (Signet classics)","review":"It is Christmas eve 1793 in Central New York's pioneer village of Templeton. Although only seven years old, Templeton boasts of 50 structures, two lawyers, a doctor and a sampling of tradesmen and farmers. The town sits at the lower end of Lake Otsego and timber abounds, though the recent settlers cut it down without a thought for fuel and farmland as if it would last forever.Most of the native American Indians have moved west, having sold their land to the King, who then lost it to the successful American rebels. But title to local lands flows from an old Royal grant. And there is a shadow on the claim of the town's richest man, Judge Marmaduke Temple to own the many thousands of acres that he is systematically selling off to immigrants of many ethnic backgrounds.Before the Revolution the Judge had a school friend, son and heir of a well off English military officer, Major Oliver Effingham. This friendship made the Judge's fortune. Came the war, however, and the friends fought for opposite sides. The Judge's side won and the Englishman lost all. The Judge then bought up his onetime friend's lands at auction. Was this greed or deliberate protection of his friend's interests? Read the novel to the end through many mysteries and twists and find out! The Major, who lived in Connecticut, disappeared in the fog of revolutionary war, leaving a son Edward and grandson Edward Oliver.A \\"mysterious\\" young stranger arrives on the lake. He calls himself Oliver Edwards and he lives in a cabin with another white man, Natty Bumppo, a man of 67 and an even older native American Christian called variously Chingachgook, Big Serpent and Indian John. On Christmas eve, this trio is out hunting a deer. Judge Temple in a sleigh is driving his teenage daughter home from years of study in New York City. The Judge shoots at a fleeing deer, as do Natty and Oliver. Oliver's shot kills the beast, the judge's misses, hitting Oliver in the shoulder. But when the sleigh's team bolts, Oliver saves the party from danger, including his beautiful daughter Elizabeth.Has this plot beginning caught your attention? Then read on. For some initially unclear reason relating to land title, young Oliver obviously hates the judge who hires him as secretary. Later Natty and Indian John kill a deer out of season. The law puts Natty in the stocks and then in jail. But he escapes with the help of his two friends. And through thick and thin affection grows between Oliver and Elizabeth.The novel raises questions about who owns America: God, the Indians, the Dutch, the English, friends of the Indians like Natty? Civilization arrives in the form of Templeton (today's Coopertown where author James Fenimore grew up). Civilization brings law and order but also personal power, so much that it can be abused. In the end injustice forces Natty to leave and head for the western prairies. He has seen too many changes, too much loss of space to stores and churches. He says to Reverend Mr Grant:\\"... I see, times be altering in these mountains from what they was thirty years ago. ... Heigh-ho! I never know'd preaching come into a settlement but it made game scarce, and raised the price of gunpowder.\\" (Ch. XII)But readers who trust in God are rewarded when at least partial justice is done by story's end to everyone's claims to properties and rights.THE PIONEERS did for tourism to the Finger Lakes of New York what Sir Walter Scott's LADY OF THE LAKE did for the Trossachs of Scotland. Fenimore Cooper's novel is a salute to old multinnational New York just before Puritans wandering in from Massachusetts put their homogenizing stamp on an easier going culture. -OOO-"},{"Title":"The Pioneers (Signet classics)","review":"i think it's a good book but it does not offer everything about the pioneers a better book would be the ohio history book in the pioneer section"},{"Title":"The Pioneers (Signet classics)","review":"Marmaduke Temple opens this story as he retrieves his daughter Elizabeth from a boarding school in New York City shortly after the Revolutionary War. As they descend the mid-winter mountains of upstate New York into the valley the Temples call home, they meet the other major characters of the story, Natty Bumppo, Chingachgook, and Oliver Edwards. Cooper prefaces this book by telling us that he wrote it for his pleasure, not ours. As Elizabeth's first night back home consumes 178 pages, I was beginning to take the man at his word, but, from here, an outstanding tale unfolds.The Pioneers is a book in the romantic style of it's age which also carries contemporary messages. The loss of wilderness and wildlife were already a concern in the late 18th century. As the population shifted westward, Native Americans were supplanted and the wilds they inhabited were methodically tamed. Marmaduke Temple and Natty Bumppo, the conservationists, approach the issue in differing ways. Temple exemplifies the responsible management of natural resources while Bumppo longs for the departure of civilization so that nature may reclaim it's own.Surrounding the ecological message is a story of a human dimension that, though expectedly formulaic, is nonetheless pleasing to behold. The characters are finely wrought as is the portrait of 18th century American life. Easily transported, the reader will find the descriptions of natural surroundings evocative of period and place.I was sorry to see the last page, though the last page was masterfully done. While James Fenimore Cooper need not be proclaimed by me as the author of classics, I consider this book one and the same and rate The Pioneers a resounding five stars."},{"Title":"The Pioneers (Signet classics)","review":"This is the fourth chronologically of the Leatherstocking tales, although the first to be written. It is different from the first three (the ones I've read) of the chronology, it that it contains less (or no) adventure and really just paints a picture of everyday life on the disappearing frontier of 1790's America. Actually, it paints a romanticized picture of the life of the wealthy landowner's family. The setting was modeled after Cooper's father who founded Cooperstown, NY. The book is a blend of &quot;sociology&quot; with a conservation message, making it ahead of its time in that respect. It does contain the elements of Cooper's later writing: it is florid in its descriptions, verbose, and in places contains an undercurrent of racial prejudice. Its language is a mixture of formal and vernacular, some of the vernacular slightly hard for the modern reader to follow. It also contains the &quot;pain in the butt&quot; character (e.g. Harry March in Deerslayer) which Cooper liked to include. In the Pioneers, the character is only mildly annoying.I found the familiarity of the culture to be amusing and interesting. There is much which hasn't changed in 200 years. Among many examples, there was nearly a &quot;traffic&quot; accident on Christmas Eve, a lawyer trying to drum up a law suit, and the stubborn competitiveness which is both the great strength and the great weakness of our country. This is a very interesting, and educational book, which I highly recommend."},{"Title":"The Pioneers (Signet classics)","review":"The title page of James Fenimore Cooper's 1823 novel \\"The Pioneers, or the Sources of the Susquehanna\\" defines it as \\"a Descriptive Tale\\"; and indeed the narrative is more a series of descriptions rather than a straight-forward plot. There is a well-drawn set of characters living quiet country lives. There is a plot \\"teaser\\" that is fairly obvious and finally resolved in the penultimate chapter, and there is a vague love triangle that never intensifies. In fact,Cooper seems to be not so much concerned with events as with attitudes. The story opens at Christmastime of 1793, and the settlers discuss the tumult of that year in Paris and the Vend&eacute;e. (One of their company is an &eacute;migr&eacute; who keeps muttering \\"Les monstres!\\" and \\"Mon pauvre roi!\\") Unfortunately, Cooper seems to have lost track of his time scheme because several months later in the story it's still 1793. This is one of the Leatherstocking Tales, which means that Nathaniel Bumppo (called Leatherstocking by the newcomers, Hawkeye by the Indians) is one of the major characters. But \\"The Pioneers\\", unlike \\"The Last of the Mohicans\\", does not involve Natty in dangerous adventures. (Which is just as well -- he's suppose to be 70 years old.) Instead, the novel presents frontier life in central New York at a settlement on Lake Otsego through commonplace but colorful occurrences: a fishing expedition, a turkey shoot, a gathering at the Bold Dragoon, a trial. The remarkable aspect of \\"The Pioneers\\", and the reason today's readers will identify with it, is the many arguments for the conservation of natural resources, both flora and fauna.Natty Bumppo's concern is understandable, as he is a man of the wilderness. More surprising is the wealthy entrepreneur Judge Temple's insistence that \\"we are stripping the forests, as if a single year would replace what we destroy. But the hour approaches when the laws will take notice of not only the woods, but the game they contain also\\". Later, both he and the Leatherstocking are appalled by the indiscriminate slaughter of birds in a single outing. This ecological attitude gives an unexpectedly modern tone to \\"The Pioneers\\" and makes it sympathetic reading in the 21st Century."},{"Title":"The Pioneers (Signet classics)","review":"In \\"The Pioneers,\\" Natty Bumppo, the adventurous hero of \\"The Last of the Mohicans,\\" is 70 years old and has become disenchanted with a young American republic whose rapidly advancing population and government encroaches upon the free-spirited life to which he is accustomed. Natty's run-down shack is allowed to stand at the pleasure of Judge Marmaduke Temple, a well-meaning yet stern patriarch who received a vast land grant at the end of the Revolutionary War and who builds a town whose existence depends on the rule of law and order. The plot of the novel flows from the inevitable conflict between the advance of this new civilization and the claims of the rugged individualists who can barely abide its rules.In his Preface, Cooper warns the reader that the book contains none of \\"the strong excitement that is produced by battles and murders\\"; unlike his later books, this is no adventure story. Nevertheless, he still manages to animate his novel with daring heroics, melodramatic chase scenes, and daring rescues. Also adding suspense are the appearance of a mysterious young man (whose identity is fairly obvious, but no matter) and the secrecy of what Bumppo is hiding in his cabin.After several briskly told opening chapters, about two nearly disastrous accidents, Cooper slows things down a bit, describing the Judge's household, the townsfolk, and their churchgoing and barhopping ways. Because the Judge's relatives and friends range from blustering pretenders to crusty old-timers, these sections are filled with unexpected humor. (But one does have to wade through an awful lot of prose about the weather.) Fortunately the last half of the book is fast-paced, including a hilarious yet oddly electrifying court trial and jail rescue.Some readers have been tempted to interpret Natty Bumppo as a primitive Howard Roark figure--an early libertarian struggling against the capriciousness of government overreach. There's a bit of truth in this thematic approach, but such a portrait doesn't take into account the novel's earnest environmentalism (a topic on which both Bumppo and Temple form an uneasy alliance). And the characters of the Judge and his daughter are far too nuanced, likeable, and honest to cast them as enemies of limited government and rugged individualism. Instead, Cooper paints an early American landscape that is sympathetic to both sides--to both the pioneers of Temple's new town and to those who, like Bumppo, came before them and paved the way."},{"Title":"The Pioneers (Signet classics)","review":"\\"...the noble bay horses that drew the sleigh were covered, in many parts, with a coat of hoar frost. The vapor from their nostrils was seen to issue like smoke, and every object in the view, as well as every arrangement of the travelers, denoted the depth of a winter in the mountains. The harness, which was of a deep dull black, differing from the glossy varnishing of the present day...\\"Great movies can come from great books but I doubt that a movie could be made that captures the images and sounds, not to mention the intellectual stimuation, that Cooper evokes in The Pioneers. One can smell the leather harness and the horse sweat and stale air underneath the fur robes in the sleigh. One can see the girl's dancing eyes and feel the numbness of the sleigh driver's hands. One can hear the booming reports of the fowling piece and the long rifle.Read the book and see the movie in your mind about the interaction between native Americans and pioneers on the eastern frontier; about their conservation concerns; about hunting rights and animal rights; about wilderness ethics.New York State is arguably the most beautiful place in the world - winter or summer - and Cooper's book preserves what it was like before the canal system, the agriculture, the telephone lines, the thruway, the golf courses, the airports and the POSTED NO TRESPASSING signs.A great American literary classic."},{"Title":"The Pioneers (Signet classics)","review":"Note the dimensions of this book. Amazon is listing it as a \\"Paperback\\" but it's really a mass market paperback size. I hate books this small, because the text is too small."},{"Title":"The Pioneers (Signet classics)","review":"I really enjoyed this book and how it portrayed the growing pains of this great country. Natty Bumppo is one of my favorite literary characters! He's not afraid to stand up for what he sees is right and when he understands that he cannot maintain his way of life where he is, he decides his own fate. He is noble yet feisty. A true romantic hero!Yes, this novel does require patience from the reader (which most classic works of literature do), but for me, the payoff was worth it. It's not my favorite Leatherstocking Tale, but I do recommend it."},{"Title":"The Pioneers (Signet classics)","review":"'The Pioneers' is subtitled 'a descriptive tale' so don't say you weren't warned. Cooper's first book in the Leatherstocking Tales (the fourth chronologically) lacks anything but the thinnest plot for most of its pages. Instead, there are lengthy descriptions designed to give the reader an idea of frontier life (clearly sanitized for his contemporary audience).Frankly, most modern readers will find 'The Pioneers' aimless and flat-out dull. I give it two stars out of respect to Cooper's intent: he was not aiming to write a fully plotted book. Yet, even as 'a descriptive tale' the book falls a bit short because it's not clear what Cooper intends to describe. Rather than focusing on frontier life, there is a lot of exposition about his characters, most of whom I found paper thin and/or annoying.On the other hand, Cooper's theme that man's love of the wilderness as the very thing that leads to its destruction is clearer in 'The Pioneers' than in any of the other books. There are a couple of powerful scenes depicting the vast waste of settlers taming the wilderness. Massive trees destroyed senselessly when a little care would do as well, and a scene filled with mindless slaughter of wildlife. While the leader of the settlement mouths platitudes about protecting the wilderness, he actually does little or nothing.It is through this theme that the elderly characters of Natty Bumppo and Chingachgook are most effective. Here called the Leatherstocking and Mohegan, the pair represent the fading American frontier. Both watch helplessly as laws and civilization subvert the wilderness they have lived in and loved all their lives. Leatherstocking finds himself in direct conflict with these laws merely by hunting. Mohegan is especially poignant if you have read the books in chronological order. The proud Indian warrior/hero is now a christianized alcoholic. The cause for his fall is pretty clearly laid at the doorstep of the growing nation which displaced and destroyed his people.Unfortunately, these powerful characterizations make up a very small portion of the book. The bulk is given over to tepid Victorian-styled dramatics, complete with stilted plotting around long lost relatives revealed deus ex machina to resolve the corners Cooper writes himself into. Most modern readers will find these elements very cheesy. When Cooper does get around to the plot, he delivers some solid action in the last fifth of the book with some truly cinematic scenes (Leatherstocking leaping through a forest fire to rescue several key characters). However, Cooper renders his denoumont anticlimactic by following it with a silly battle and some revelations you never saw coming (not in a good way). There is a ray of brilliant writing at the end when, in the final scene, Leatherstocking leaves the remains of his home forever to escape the encroaching civilization.Overall, I found this book only marginally interesting, and it feels like Cooper stumbled/lucked into the intriguing Leatherstocking and Chingachgook characters by accident. It's like he realizes halfway through the book that these characters are way more interesting than the ones he's been focused on. As such, 'The Pioneers' should only be read if you truly want to get the entire five books under your belt. Otherwise, start with 'The Last of the Mohicans.'"},{"Title":"The Pioneers (Signet classics)","review":"James Fennimore Cooper's five books known as \\"The Leatherstocking Tales\\" ( the Pioneers is the fourth in the series) are some of the most exciting books I've ever read.

It gives the Christian community ready access to many of the splendid articles that Carnell wrote during his career.\\"Dr. David Hubbard said that E. J. Carnell had a \\"fertile mind and ready pen which blazed fresh theological trails as he sought to defend and proclaim the Christian faith as a world and life view.\\"Christianity Today noted that Edward John Carnell was one of the \\"few scholars with two earned doctorates, he was abreast both of the history of thought and recent modern theology. His books have long been a bulwark of Evangelical Christian faith.\\"A good quote from page 58 states: \\"When formulating a philosophy of life, I contend that the least accessible fact, and thus the most baffling to isolate and classify, is the complex moral and spiritual environment of the philosopher himself.\\"Carnell's died a young man at age 48 of a \\"possible suicide.\\" Some evidence surrounding his untimely death mitigates the ruling of suicide. It should be noted that Carnell was a brilliant and thoughtful scholar. He earned a Ph.D. from Boston University, and a Th.D. from Harvard having written dissertations on the philosophy of Soren Kierkegaard and the theology of Reinhold Niebuhr.In his first book, \\"An Introduction to Christian Apologetics\\", Carnell's apologetic was influenced by Gordon Clark, Cornelius Van Til, and also the philosophical sway of Edgar S. Brightman. In \\"An Introduction to Christian Apologetics\\", he sought to show that Christianity was the most analytically logical, factual, and has the best rational explanatory power. Christianity has the best demonstrable paradigm; Christian theism is the worldview which best explains and fits the facts of human experience.Some scholars insist that Carnell's apologetic system was a synergism of Clark and Van Til, combining a deductive approach with a presuppositional lens. Nonetheless his views changed over his twenty year writing career and since he died young, he did not offer a clear opinion on which of his theological, philosophical, and apologetic positions should lead or dominant his thought. In his writings he went from a type of Cumulative approach to a subjectivist appreciation of Kierkegaard.One test for truth he named \\"systematic consistency.\\" This is much different than Clark's view and doesn't approach Van Til's defense of the faith. Some scholars suggest that Francis Schaeffer was influenced by Carnell. Others called Carnell's system: \\"combinationalist\\" or \\"verificational.\\" Geisler called Carnell \\"Hypothetical or Presuppositional.\\"Notice the difference of Carnell's notion that Christianity offers the best systematic explanatory power of human experience in contrast to Cornelius Van Til's certainty: \\"I think the argument is sound. I hold that belief in God is not merely as reasonable as other belief, or even a little or infinitely more probably true than other belief; I hold rather that unless you believe in God you can logically believe in nothing else.\\"Van Til employed a transcendental approach and explained \\"the method of implication into the truth of God.... That is, we must seek to determine what presuppositions are necessary to any object of knowledge in order that it may be intelligible to us.\\" Van Til warned if one denies the triune God, the world must be \\"encircled by irrationality.\\" If atheism is true, mankind is \\"swimming in a void.\\" A void of irrationality because the finite minds of human beings are claimed by atheism to be the foundation for rational thought. Therefore, atheism is self-contradictory on its own ground. Unbelief, even its fallacious assertions and false notions, presuppose the truth of the triune God. To make sense out of our world, even an atheist, must presuppose Christian theism. It alone supplies the required pre-essentials for the laws of logic. These laws are necessary for communication and for the intelligibility of human experience.Greg L. Bahnsen also went much further epistemically than Carnell proposed. Bahnsen wrote that the unbeliever \\"has no intelligible place to stand, no consistent epistemology, no justification for meaningful discourse, predication, or argumentation.\\" Bahnsen goes on to lay bare anti-theism: he writes that \\"the Christian worldview is true because of the impossibility of the contrary. When the perspective of God's revelation is rejected, then the unbeliever is left in foolish ignorance because his philosophy does not provide the preconditions for knowledge and meaningful experience.\\" Only Christian theism can supply the pre-essentials needed for debate, evidence, and knowledge. Bahnsen asserts that \\"the proof that Christianity is true is that if it were not, we could not be able to prove anything.\\" Bahnsen explains, quoting Van Til, that \\"the intelligibility of anything, for man, presupposes the existence of God--the God whose nature and character are delineated in God's revelation.\\" Colin Brown noted that in Van Til's view: \\"The existence of the God of Christian theism is presupposed by all rational thought and behavior.\\"Carnell was a brilliant Christian scholar who defended Christianity against unbelief and theistic liberalism. This book is a necessary addition for the active and wide-reading apologist.By Michael A Robinson author of numerous books on apologetics and philosophy; Including:The Necessary Existence of God: The Proof of Christianity Through Presuppositional Apologetics"},{"Title":"Betrayal Of A Hustler","review":"B.L.U.N.T. has certainly marked her spot on the urban literary scene.

I read it for my reading program at school. It's a fantasy story about three kids named Johnny, Sara, and Sabrina and they disappear from their grandmother's house because she gave them some magical lemon drops by mistake. This book had some really funny chapters because the kids disappear to a weird planet far away and they land in a town called Sweet Little. It's a town where the people love candy and cookies so much that they have trees that grow candy and they have houses and buildings with cookies and candy on them. The funny and scary chapters talk about the giant insects that scare the people because some insects love candy. I recommend this book to any kids that like funny and scary stories. There are a lot of fun chapters too like when the kids play games and when the parents can't find the kids at home. I bought this book for my friend for his birthday party and he liked it a lot. He said it was really cool because he reads comics and jokes like me."},{"Title":"Candy Lane Craze","review":"Candy Lane Craze is a truly funny story for elementary school kids. When I read it with my students, I thought it was an absolute delight. It tells the story of three siblings, Johnny, Sara, and Sabrina, who receive an unusual bag of lemon drops and experience a magical adventure to Sweet Little, a city where the residents have strange ideas about candy. Then, the children experience hilarious and outrageous events when the author describes the details about their unusual surroundings.I truly believe that Spencer is one of the rarest children's authors in the comedy genre, and I hope to see some future children's stories from him. I want to mention the structure of the book. This book is definitely not for advanced readers because of its simplicity, it doesn't have any challenging twists and turns. It does contain big words throughout the book. However, I feel that children with advanced reading skills will be bored easily. I will keep this book in my school library for students who are struggling with their reading skills and have started to read full-length literary novels. It's really a book about funny, outrageous events that make you smile. The main characters, Johnny, Sara, and Sabrina, are very lovable. They don't have any special talents or skills. They're just cute typical siblings who find themselves in a strange predicament. And the plot is extremely easy to follow. My students read the book really fast because it was so simple.Therefore, I'm writing this review to say that I love the book because it is extremely funny, it gave me a great escape from everyday reality, and I recommend it to struggling elementary school students to practice reading full-length novels and to middle school students who enjoy great leisurely and light-hearted reading."},{"Title":"Candy Lane Craze","review":"If you haven't read this book, I strongly advise that you do. This book is the perfect pick-me-up for anyone who is having stressful days in their life. I'm not saying it's a cure for the blues, it's just a great way to end a stressful day without DVDs, video games, and junk food (it's great for parents too). Anyway, Candy Lane Craze is truly amazing. You will absolutely love the charming details about Sweet Little. This town is dreamy, stylish, and fancy. It's a terrific magical get-away for the young travelers in this story. The good news is, despite all the luxurious surroundings and the humorous mishaps, the kids want to come home to their parents (my favorite part). It's a great way to say that the world today is filled with nice places to go and nice things to buy, but the best place to be is at home with your family and friends who love you. Everyone in my family loves this story and I believe you will too."},{"Title":"Candy Lane Craze","review":"Candy Lane Craze is a really funny story. It was written by a funny author named David E. Spencer. He is one of the funniest authors I ever read. I first read this book online and then I told my mom to buy some books for my family. And then she said I could write some book reviews for other children and kids. I recommend this book to boys and girls that like reading funny stories. It's about Johnny, Sara, and Sabrina and they receive some magical candy from their grandmother, and then they magically disappear from her house when they eat dinner there. They disappear to a strange planet and they find a city called Sweet Little. It's a city where the people love candy and they like to build there houses with cookies and sweet stuff and they like to grow trees that grow candy. The kids meet Gloria and Gloria takes the kids to all the interesting sites around the city and there's candy and sweets everywhere they go. The city has a giant bug problem and the people have to fight the bugs when they search around the city for the candy. That is where the funny stuff happens in the book. This book will make great gifts for kids like me that read silly stories and fantasy stories."},{"Title":"Candy Lane Craze","review":"I read Candy Lane Craze during my last semester in college because my little neices told me about it. They found the book on the Internet and then I borrowed their copy when they bought it. Although the plot is not entirely a winner, it's clearly a book of funny events that make you smile as you read it. I truly fell in love with the main characters Johnny, Sara, and Sabrina. They're so cute together, and I have to admit there were moments where I teared up because of the happy and sad chapters in the book. It's magical, it's fun, it's easy to read. I think I read the entire book in a week or so, it's definitely a page turner for kids that like strange and funny adventure stories."},{"Title":"Candy Lane Craze","review":"Hi everybody. I'm Savannah and I'm 13. I read Candy Lane Craze and my sister read it too. We like this book a lot because of all the funny stuff. We like the stuff about all the candy the cookies and the funny stuff about the giant bugs too. It was a cool story to read when the kids found all the yummy goodies and then they had a lot of fun when they stayed in sweet little. My sister said it was a dream come true because she wants to go to a place like sweet little so she can eat all her favorite stuff. I think thats funny. Btw did you hear my sister on the radio one time. She was 9 when she won some prizes on radio disney.

Amazingly, after all this little boy has been through, he's surprisingly happy and content. Partly because my job is to keep him happy during his challenging ordeal. He is also smiling again because of your children's novel, Candy Lane Craze. Your novel has made him so happy that his constant smiling is contagious and it brightens my day. Thank you so much for bringing such a marvelous and entertaining story to the children's book world. Your novel contains details about a fantasy world that every child would love. Your child and adult characters are funny and adorable, and the action-packed events are highly imaginative and very entertaining. I gave your book high praise to my son's physicians, nurses, and the social workers at the hospital. Hopefully your book will inspire my son to read passionately for the rest of his life.Sincerely,Craig Silverman"},{"Title":"Fore All Golfers!","review":"This is an excellent book that gets down to the nitty gritty of golf.

Unfortunately, the foreword is about the only place where an explanation/defense of the rankings can be found.The remainder of the book is a paint-by-numbers, term-paper rehash of each golfer's bio and records - information readily available elsewhere (and obviously the basis for this cut-and-paste edition).Spelling errors (&quot;symbollic&quot;, &quot;Colin Montgomery&quot;) confirm the complete lack of effort.To use everybody's favorite Amazon cliche, don't waste your time or money."},{"Title":"The Golf 100: Ranking the Greatest Golfers of All Time","review":"Great pictures and great overall history of the game and its players. Looks great on the coffee table too. our male guests always look through it."},{"Title":"Monteith's Mountains: Death Stalks the Southern Appalachians","review":"Skip Brooks's \\"Monteith's Mountains: Death Stalks the Southern Appalachians\\" covers a lot of ground; its range deals with a crucial time in Appalachian history, the development of the logging industry, and multiple individual stories -- stories of self-exploration and self-discovery.Against the sublime backdrop of the rolling Great Smoky Mountains, themselves a powerful presence throughout the novel, Brooks artfully crafts his tale, seamlessly interweaving history with narrative and bringing to life an era long gone. Long before the Blue Ridge Parkway, the Appalachian mountains were a place where beauty and terror coexisted. The laws of humankind did not apply. It is into this surreal world that Brooks introduces the character of Walker Tom Monteith, a serial killer who hears the voice of Jesus.Born to Black John Walker, a fiery preacher who had multiple wives and founded his own colony with his extensive family, Walker Tom Monteith was one of his many children. At a young age, Walker Tom experiences a \\"communion\\" with Jesus; blessed with what he interprets as a divine connection, Walker Tom proceeds to carry out his bloody path in life. He is a being without conscience, lurking in the darkness and luring his guileless victims towards their demise by preying on their weak human natures.The other characters in the novel also play integral roles. Two primary characters are Taylor Henry and David Brant. Taylor, a small woman with tremendous business sense and a quest to fulfill her destiny in the Great Smokies, is a major player in the narrative structure. Her love for Brant, a half-Indian on his own spiritual quest -- and fleeing the wrath of Walker Tom after witnessing the latter commit murder -- gives a fairy tale quality to the story. And, as with many fairy tales, the narrative comes full circle in the end. Brant, representing the emerging world that created the Great Smoky Mountains we know and treasure today, is pitted against Walker Tom, a violent symbol of the era when no rules could exist within the mountain world and an individual lived by their own morals and convictions. The novel's ending juxtaposes the two sides to the personality of the Appalachians and leaves the reader with an appreciation of their solemn magnificence as well as the dangers hidden beneath the foliage.Guaranteed to intrigue, Monteith's Mountains is an interesting sojourn through the Appalachians of a century ago and into the lives of the people who braved to make a life amidst their savage beauty."},{"Title":"Monteith's Mountains: Death Stalks the Southern Appalachians","review":"Brooks makes his villian/victim as scary as Hannibal Lector and, and if anything, more believable. Walker Tom Monteith is like a wild animal -- beautiful, but dangerous. The background of the southern Appalachians at the beginning of industrialization is almost as scary as the fictional serial killer plot -- and it's real. You understand why the characters act the way they do, but at the end you feel that we've all been lucky to survive."},{"Title":"Monteith's Mountains: Death Stalks the Southern Appalachians","review":"Although I enjoy all books with an Appalachian theme, I especially enjoyed learning some fascinating facts about logging in the Smokey Mountains from Skip Brooks' book. The book is full of Appalachian culture and mystery. Even though a serial killer stalks the book, the violence is kept in its proper place (not too much gore). The characters and plot line kept me reading long past bedtime."},{"Title":"Monteith's Mountains: Death Stalks the Southern Appalachians","review":"A superbly written yet chilling account bringing the history of the Appalachian mountains and the demented psychosis of a serial killer under one cover.Skip Brook's writing style is unique, refreshing and very creative... the storyline however is an acquired taste which would probably be enjoyed most by fans of murder/mystery novels and books covering the gruesome acts of serial murderers like Ted Bundy."},{"Title":"Monteith's Mountains: Death Stalks the Southern Appalachians","review":"I enjoyed reading Monteith's Mountains very much.At first was afraid it was going to be too sexual and gory but found out soon that it was neither.

I really think Skip Brooks needs to write us another one in this beautiful setting!"},{"Title":"Monteith's Mountains: Death Stalks the Southern Appalachians","review":"A good read for a dark and stormy night (with a nod to Bulwer-Lytton there), or any time you might want a book evocative of one."},{"Title":"Schaum's Outline of Reinforced Concrete Design","review":"This is a nice book on reinforced concrete design. Although it aims mainly to students, you will be benefitted even if you are a practicing engineer. It is mainly written on ACI code on both USCS &amp; SI units, but the book is useful even if you follow some other country's code. It covers all basic &amp; some advanced design concepts. Chapters include - materials, loads, design methods &amp; preocedures, shear, torsion, detailing, servicability, columns, footings, beam, slabs, retaining walls etc. Main asset of the book is that it is very concise, yet covered almost everythin with a good number of solved problems."},{"Title":"Schaum's Outline of Reinforced Concrete Design","review":"An excellent outline for the ACI 89/92 Code.

My older Thomson Bible was printed on quality India Paper and had a nice stitched in binding. It was made to be worth the 90 dollar price tag charged. Now however the Kirkbride people are producing shoddy and inferior bibles and still selling them at a premium price! The new Thomson Bibles have CHEAP CHEAP CHEAP paper (Thomas Nelson/Zondervan quality) which is nothing like the supple and long lasting paper of the older bibles. The paper is so inferior that the words of the text on the OTHER SIDE OF THE PAGE show through and cause a very distracting and annoying reading experience. Also the Kirkbridge clan is not stitching the bindings in anymore - it is all glued like the cheaper Bibles you see at Wal Mart. But please do not take my word for it. Place your older Bible next to the recent printings and you will see the shameful deterioration of quality. Kirkbridge should be ashamed! It is cheating the public by still charging top dollar prices for their goods when they obviously do not any longer put quality materials in their Bibles. BUYER BEWARE !!!!"},{"Title":"Thompson Chain-Reference Bible (Style 514black-index) - Large Print KJV - Genuine Leather","review":"I purchased a Thompson with a morocco cover. In the past I have also purchased Thompson products as gifts because I was always impressed with their quality and the Kirkbride company that publishes it is located in my state.The chain system is unique and very useful. I never used any of the rest of the \\"helps\\" in the back.After a short time of owning this Bible I noticed that the leather was cracking and chipping off around the edges. Also the gold page edging was turning colors and coming off. I contacted Kirkbride, the publisher. First off, it took them several days and much persistance on my part before someone would talk to me. Finally some junior salesperson responded and sent me an email. He told me that their guarantee was not lifetime and that it only covered defects that you noticed right away. He then sent me an email with a lot of questions in it which I responded with the answers. I told them that I was not looking for a free replacement because I had used the Bible and did not think that was fair. I would have been satisfied with any accomodation that they thought was fair. Evidently they think that nothing is fair because I never heard another word from anyone. At the time I bought the item they were promoting their Bibles as lasting a lifetime. Although they carefully avoided a lifetime guarantee.___________________________________Update: It is now 02/2011. Several years after the above review. A relative of mine purchase a Thompsons Bible a while back and it had none of the issues I mentioned above. Recently, I decided to give Thompsons another chance and because I had some credits to use with another retailer (sorry Amazon), I bought a Thompson NASB Genuine Leather Bible. It is perfect. Beautifully constructed and great in every way. It was made in the USA and has no issues I have found. I did notice that there is no longer a \\"lifetime\\" guarantee. Good thing, they didn't mean it anyway. But I got this Bible for $33.00 and will keep it as my everyday and Church Bible.Looking at other reviews it appears that Kirkbride went with cheaper overseas construction and printing of their products for a period of time. Evidently they are not doing that now and it shows.I thought it only fair to add this._______________________________Another update 11/26/2012:Since I kicked Kirkbride pretty hard in the first review I thought this only fair to add.Evidently they have changed their practices. I still have the NASB genuine leather Bible and it still is great quality. I have recently gifted a NKJV Thompson leather Bible and a KJV Bonded Leather Bible. I carefully inspected them and they seem excellent.Whatever Kirkbride did for those few years, I am glad that they stopped doing it."},{"Title":"Thompson Chain-Reference Bible (Style 514black-index) - Large Print KJV - Genuine Leather","review":"I looked forward to owning a Thompson Chain-Reference Bible, but had to return it. The copy I purchased was printed in Korea, and the type quality was uneven and not up to my expectations. Particularly in the New Testament red letter sections, some of the pages were pale pink and at least two pages were hard to read because the print was so faint. Sorry to not give a great review, but the quality doesn't match the reputation. Maybe they should reconsider the practice of printing it in Korea . . ."},{"Title":"Thompson Chain-Reference Bible (Style 514black-index) - Large Print KJV - Genuine Leather","review":"I love the New King James Version, put out by Thomas Nelson, but I loath Thomas Nelson Bibles. This is how I happened upon the Thompson a few years ago as I was relieved to find a NKJV not made by T.N. I first bought an NKJV in bonded leather. After 2 years of very heavy use, I bought an NKJV in genuine leather, and later a handy size KJV in genuine. All three of these Bibles are wonderful in every way.The Thompson Study system is very helpful and they've graciously spared us from a myriad of religious cliche and personal opinion. The page layout is smart. The Bible text actually fills the page and all study helps and references are relegated to the side margins. There are so many ways to use the studies and references, I am unable to number them here. The concordance is as extensive as any I've seen. The 14 maps are colorful and very well done. Simply put, it's a complete, Jesus-exalting study Bible designed with excellence.The construction of these Bibles is equally impressive. The paper is just right--not too thick, not too thin. The print is dark and sharp. Their font is subtil and very appropriate for the Bible, if you ask me. The red words of Jesus are RED. They're not muddy brown; they're not pink; they're bright, deep, beautiful red. They are printed consistantly page to page, not some pages lighter or misprinted, as the Thomas Nelson folks are plagued by.Now that I own three Thompsons, I feel about them the way a good ol' boy down in the South feels about shotguns. &quot;I have more than I need, but not as many as I want!&quot;"},{"Title":"Thompson Chain-Reference Bible (Style 514black-index) - Large Print KJV - Genuine Leather","review":"I think I should warn you all in fairness about this issue over the current quality of Thompson bibles.

Now however, they are making them so cheap that they are NOT WORTH the amount of money they are asking. I agree with the reviewer that revealed how shoddy the Thompson Bible is now being made. The paper is so thin and cheap that the words on the other pages show through. I can't stand that in a Bible.In short.

I bought a Thompson KJV Genuine Leather about 6 years ago. It was printed on very nice quality Bible paper, creamy white with the words in Christ in a very beautiful RED. The paper held up to lots of wear and tear and still was in good shape. It was a pleasure to ownBut what happened? The new Thompson Bibles are printed on very very cheap paper that is of such poor quality that the letters and words on the other side of the page shows through. I can feel the paper of the new Thompsons and compare it with my older edition Thompson and I was very unhappy to learn I was scammed. Also the words of Christ in red are in such a light shade that I found it hard to read - gone are the deep red print of yesteryear.I do not know what prompted the Kirkbride people to this. Maybe they want to get the more profit from thier Bibles and cut corners on paper quality. They are cheating the public by selling very shoddy Bibles and still charging thier high prices.Dont make the mistake I did and pay 90 dollars for a lousy version of a former great study Bible.

It has many scriptural cross references, (The King James Version)is true to the original meaning expressed in the Greek Textus Receptus. As a seminary student, this Bible has been most helpful to me in sermon preparation, illustration, and contextual application. I highly recommend it. By the way, I strongly urge you to use the Authorized King James Version. Though some words are old, the use of a dictionary can bring new meaning to the words. Additionally, some of the newer translations leave out important words, i.e. &quot;Blood&quot; in Col. 1:14. In the Manuscripts, the word Blood (haima) is there but for whatever reason the translators conveniently chose to leave that out. I know what Jesus did for me, and I know that the Blood of God was shed for me so that I could have remittance of sin.

The smooth and thick Cowhide leather has disappeared, and has been replaced aby some sort of Levant(pebble)grained madness that sells for $84.99, versus the $89.99 of the Cowhide. Definitely not worth it! There are now Bonded Leather editions in some horrible shade of bright purple, and also a forest green---both with black ribbon markers---is Kirkbride so cheap they can no longer afforsd to coordinate the ribbons? Also, most of the ribbon markers are cut very short, so they serve no purpose since there is nothing to hold onto...then there is this miserable Kirvella substance, which comes in Ivory, Grey, and Black. As soon as you hold the open Bible in your hands, the spine caves in. I don't care for red print in the Gospels, but the red-letter is now pink on some pages, or very light red, and hard to read. Bleed through with the inferior-quality paper. Need I go on(there IS more), or have I made my point as to quality?The helps in the Bible are excellent and unchanged. The Thompson has been around for going-on 100 years, and still sells, so something must be right. You can learn much from the Thompson Bible. It's almost a Bible school between the pages.

It's hard to know what each individual may be searching for in a murder mystery, and there are as many different tastes as there are opinions among readers. Nevertheless, this book is not really about \\"murder\\" and \\"mysteries\\" per se. It is far more psychological and personal that many other crude attempts that cloud libraries today. It also explores the depths of human experience in the areas relating to sexuality, fears, sexual identity, and long-repressed emotions. There is much in there for any reader to identify with. The characters are very well developed, and there is bound to be at least one moment for everyone to feel that they have \\"been there\\" or that they \\"have been in that particular situation before.\\"What I like about the book is that it managed to open up certain long forgotten images from my past, some good, and some bad. Once the bad was out of the way (relating to my fear of darkness and bizarre perversions) in the first chapter, then I felt that I could begin exploring the true purposes of the book. There are shocking and disturbing moments in there, but this goes very well with the territory of standard contemporary murder myseries, and it is rather tame compared to other novels that shock for the sake of shocking.I pride myself on being an expert on the music of Sibelius. I am a musicologist and also an orchestral conductor who has been involved in numerous performance of this music. My initial fear when seeing the book for the first time last year was that my image of the composer might be ruined or \\"tarnished.\\" I even told the author this after I contacted him through his book website (http://www.sevensymphonies.com/). However, it was impossible for me to put the book down because I felt that 1) He had me completely riveted narrative-wise, 2) I was intrigued about these strange bedfellows: Sibelius and homicide. It wasn't a direct relation to the composer; the music and life of Sibelius was only used as a vehicle for the story, and 3) The author's use of language was very creative and compellingly real; I felt like everything was really happening.Simon Boswell has obviously put a great deal of thought and planning into this story. It may very well be his apotheosis. As he told me, he has been living in Helsinki for most of his professional life, and the music of Sibelius is one of the things that drew him there. This was exactly the same experience for me (as I know the city of Helsinki quite well), and as a Sibelius scholar, I consider his treatment of the material to be knowledgeable as well as respectful toward Finland's greatest composer. From my perspective, I thought \\"Why not explore another side of Sibelius?\\" Since I know every note of his music by this point, I always find it interesting re-explore it through the eyes of others.I give this an enthusiastic five stars!"},{"Title":"THE SEVEN SYMPHONIES: A Finnish Murder Mystery","review":"Few past the age of 50 can suddenly produce a successful novel. Simon Boswell's talent must have lain dormant like wine, slowly ripening, because this novel's plot could have been laid out only by someone trained as an engineer, as Boswell was. The murder mystery stream and the music of Sibelius (drawn from his composer-teacher talents) continually and maddeningly converge. Expect to have each of your preconceptions proven false, and to sit up all night reading. Then re-read it to relish this astonishing fictional accomplishment."},{"Title":"THE SEVEN SYMPHONIES: A Finnish Murder Mystery","review":"A surprisingly good effort from a new author and a small press. Boswell can write. He creates fascinating characters and maintains suspense. For American audiences, Seven Symphonies would do better in a shorter version. The author invites readers to omit certain sections, which is fine -- but not conducive to the quick reading we expect in a suspense novel. Definitely worth a look, especially for lovers of classical music."},{"Title":"THE SEVEN SYMPHONIES: A Finnish Murder Mystery","review":"Rebeccasreads recommends THE SEVEN SYMPHONIES as a masterful immersion into murder, music & morality.Rather heavy on the language, yet overall when you've finished THE SEVEN SYMPHONIES you'll know a lot about Sibelious & Finland, as well as what makes a killer tick, if not what makes the heart love."},{"Title":"THE SEVEN SYMPHONIES: A Finnish Murder Mystery","review":"Seven symphonies has nail-biting suspense, serial killings, an exotic setting plus a bonus treat of building appreciation for the music in a symphony. Simon Boswell combines the hunt for a spiralling out of control serial killer with the gradual unvieling of the musical life of the great Finnish composer, Sibelius.The plot is a cleverly intertwined production with escalating violence and a frantic pace. The writing style is as clever and captivating as the young characters and the hip Helsinki setting."},{"Title":"THE SEVEN SYMPHONIES: A Finnish Murder Mystery","review":"What a great read. 450 pages is rather formidable for a mystery, and I was beginning to wonder if I would get \\"hooked\\" as I approached page 200 but, for me, the book took off lickety-split and raced to the end from there. I really enjoyed the entirely plausible \\"red herrings\\" the author tossed in and the way he anticipated the reader's (my) confusion in the persons of his inspectors. And he kept my in suspense about the identity of the murderer to the end. What piqued my interested initially and what kept me going was my passion for the music of Sibelius. The many references to the composer and his life, as well as the series of lectures being given throughout the mystery by the inspector's father, is a brilliant plot device. And, may I say, not too much for the casual reader or too little for the music lover. Altogether, a great read--and I learned some new things about the composer as well."},{"Title":"THE SEVEN SYMPHONIES: A Finnish Murder Mystery","review":"This is a fantastic book, well written, & I love the whole Finnish flavour....I would highly recommend this book....I hope he writes more!"},{"Title":"THE SEVEN SYMPHONIES: A Finnish Murder Mystery","review":"This book is unique. It is an intellectual murder mystery. That sounds like an oxymoron, but Boswell manages to pull it off. I couldn't put the book down. My only criticism is that I wanted our heroine Miranda to achieve as much success and satisfaction in her personal (love) life as in her professional life."},{"Title":"THE SEVEN SYMPHONIES: A Finnish Murder Mystery","review":"This really is a fine piece of work in many ways. The plot is, to say the least, intriguing. The police procedural piece is splendid. The serial killing bit surpasses McDermid I think. I loved the lectures on Sibelius and wish that there was some way I could pull them out of my Kindle for separate reading as I listen to my Sibelius collection...I did a lot of reading on my bed and listened through crummy little speakers that doubtless dulled the drama. There were times when the psychologizing got a bit heavy (I prefer the Jonathan Kellerman approach), but one cannot claim to not know the main characters. And, frankly, it is quite a relief to explore the feelings of a relatively young female officer as opposed to the aging guys in so many Rankin and other novels, many of which are set in gloomy northern climes.If I have a complaint it is probably an odd one. I simply did not come away with much of a feeling that this book was really set in Finland. Sure, there were street names, Metro stops, and the odd historical reference. But at the end of the day it simply felt too British. Could have been Liverpool. Not enough reference to local food, city atmospherics, demographics, politics or layout, etc. I know readers may disagree about this particular criticism, but good detective novels or thrillers can be wonderful travel books. Nothing in this one persuades me I should hop on a plane and go to Helsinki. I did go to St. Petersburg, and when I passed the Finland Station gave it the odd thought, but nothing here suggests I should have hopped a train and spent a few days there."},{"Title":"THE SEVEN SYMPHONIES: A Finnish Murder Mystery","review":"I don't read murder mysteries very often and when I do it is mostly to fill dead time on airplanes. Not a knock on the genre per se. I mention it only to point out that I came at this book without normal expectations. What attracted me to it was simply that I was intrigued at the Sibelius connection. I'm a big fan of his music and was wondering if any of what I like about Sibelius would somehow manifest itself in the prose or settings of a novel, and what fun that might be!In the end, I'd have to say no, except for the geographical and temporal considerations, the Sibelius mood/meaning aspect is largely absent. The Sibelius connection is not entirely gratuitous, as it is worked into the landscape and to an extent the motives. But it is fair to say that the entire book could have been plotted without the lectures or the musicology. The author's inclusion of lectures dumped into the middle of an ongoing narrative that demanded a lot of attention to detail so as not to lose the thread could be called distracting. However, I learned about music and Sibelius's life, so I don't consider the time wasted. I suspect the author at one point had grander ideas of how to better integrate a truly Sibelian mentality into the plot but in the end got defeated, and yet could not entirely rid himself of this obsession. Apt, considering how the plot works itself out.I will echo what others hear have said about the plotting, the intelligence, the insight, and the language the author employs. I could not put the book down and was grateful I had a holiday that afforded me the time to sit with it for hours. I especially loved the excursion to the countryside and the observations about the Finns and Helsinki, which I have never visited. I'm now afraid I have to go and see for myself. Sounds like a small but very delightful and engaging city.I do want to chide the author for the perfectly awful job of book design and typesetting. The cover is ugly ugly ugly. The typesetting inside is crude and unimaginative. I understand self-publishers may only have basic word processors like Word available, but surely he could have done a more interesting job and chosen a typeface that is less ubiquitous? On the flip side, the book is well edited and free of inconsistencies and typos. Covers are so important, however, that this poor job is surely going to cost the author a lot in sales and credibility. As Lightning Sources (which is where this books was produced, makes it easy to switch covers, I hope he'll consider a redesign.Ugly production or no, definitely worth picking up and reading."},{"Title":"THE SEVEN SYMPHONIES: A Finnish Murder Mystery","review":"... of the other reviewers here. I don't often read mysteries, but shortly before taking in this one, I'd read another, the beautiful Bury Your Dead by Louise Penny. By comparison I found Symphonies clunky in style and over-plotted. And then I was fairly sure who did it by page 100 or so, and quite certain shortly after 300. I did enjoy the musicological lectures. The author clearly loves and understands Sibelius."},{"Title":"The heart of matter (A Harvest/HBJ book)","review":"En espa&ntilde;ol abajo.Certainly Teilhard has meant for me too much at the point that when I write or say anything about him I just do what he said:\\"As the result of the awakening in me of the notion of Evolution, Spirit(As I have just related) had, in my view, supplanted the Mineral and the Atomic in their dignity as the immutable and the all-embracing essence of the Universe.

This one is a disappointing, incredibly long read that I plodded through without much enthusiasm. The heroine, True, is a very immature woman who is impossible to like. She continues to do incredibly self-destructive things, is a lousy mother to her so-called beloved son, and doesn't listen to a word anyone says. She's condescending to everyone - including the medical professionals who saved her son's life. Her so-called beloved, Hank, is equally a jerk. But I didn't need 500 pages to find out that they deserve each other. Even the minor characters were neither interesting nor likeable. I have found Mitchard in the past, for example in her first book, to show a great insight into the issues and \\"voice\\" of adolescence - but I'm not sure she hits the mark with Guy - a pretty obnoxious kid. The adults in this story seem hell bent on [messing] him up as much as possible - his self-obsessed mother ignores his medical symptoms, slaps him across the face when he's in the hospital, talks about washing his mouth out with soap for swearing, and obviously emotionally drags him through hell and back during her ambivalent new marriage. It's hard to like a heroine who supposedly is motherhood personified when she's such a jerk. Finally, I don't understand this author's obsession with sexual issues and body fluids. Much more information than I need to know - for example - who wants to hear about a 10 year old boy's balls flapping as he runs down the stairs? Come on!"},{"Title":"Twelve Times Blessed CD","review":"I began this book with hopeful anticipation but it wasn't too long before I considered abandoning Mitchard's 500+ page book. Finally, it was all just too much nonsense as just about every sub-plot in noveldom was dragged into the story. I suppose True, the main character, and Hank, the &quot;younger&quot; man exist somewhere, but I don't want to know them. Or even care about them. It's rare that I don't finish a book but midway through (why did I read that far?) I skipped to the last chapter and realized I'd wasted far too much time. A huge disappointment."},{"Title":"Twelve Times Blessed CD","review":"I was a huge fan of Mitchard's other books, but this one was just awful.

It was just awful!"},{"Title":"Twelve Times Blessed CD","review":"I possibly would have rated this book a little higher had it not been written by Mitchard. The story line lacks the originality and insight into character of her other work, especially The Deep End of the Ocean and The Most Wanted, and to that extent, it didn't live up to expectations. It's pretty much a standard love the second time round story, except that the protagonist is a good bit older than the new love, resulting in too predictable rocky steps on the relationship pathway. Its strengths if it has any, are more in the secondary character cameos than in the main cast, especially in some members of the lover's Southern family and how they are perceived by the Cape Cod Northerners. Not nearly as engaging of the reader as Mitchard's earlier books, not quite formula driven but at times perilously close. A pleasant but forgettable read is probably a reasonable assessment. Definitely below Mitchard's usual standard"},{"Title":"Twelve Times Blessed CD","review":"I really have to wonder whether Mitchard had an editor on this one. Almost every line of French has a mistake in it (She can't even spell simple phrases like &quot;Comment vas-tu?&quot; correctly), almost every ballet step is misspelled (&quot;chine&quot; turns for &quot;chaine&quot; turns), and, perhaps worst of all for a novel supposedly set in Massachusetts, she uses the phrase &quot;in Cape Cod,&quot; which a Cape Codder would never use; it's &quot;on Cape Cod&quot;!Aside from the mistakes, the book is slow going and descends midway to the level of soap opera. Don't waste your time on this book."},{"Title":"Twelve Times Blessed CD","review":"Jackie Mitchard won a host of fans and hearts with her appealing novel, &quot;The Deep End Of The Ocean&quot; (also brought to life on the big screen). It was the story of a family; the dynamics that held them together, the pain that pulled them apart. To date, Ms. Mitchard has pretty much stuck to this familiar turf which she limns so well. Such is surely the case with her latest.TV and stage actress Robin Miles imbues her reading of Twelve Times Blessed&quot; with charm and understanding as listeners meet and come to care about 43-year-old True Dickinson. Many would think that True has or has had all that life offers. She is widowed now; it has been eight years since her husband died. It was a blessed union, but now she's raising their young son alone. Her business is a resounding success, and she has a large group of supportive, good friends. Yet, in her heart, True knows something is missing.Chance steps in when True and her assistant are driving home on a winter's night and slip off the road into a snowy ditch. Their rescuer is Hank Bannister, a handsome young chef (actually, ten years younger than True). Nonetheless, the chemistry between them is undeniable, and immediate.After knowing each other only briefly the two marry. This is a surprise to True's son, but he soon adapts to having Hank as a permanent part of their home. Yet, Hank has spent a few years unencumbered. A half grown son is one thing, but when True becomes pregnant it seems that domesticity may lose some of its luster.As always, Ms. Mitchard is an expert at examining the tensile strengths of family love. Her many fans will relish another exploration of the ties that blind and bind.- Gail Cooke"},{"Title":"Twelve Times Blessed CD","review":"This book is one step above pulp fiction. I finished it but only to find out what happened, not because the characters were emotionally compelling. They are a bore and really immature tedious adults.

And then proceeds to doubt every breath in his body 24/7 while raising her 10-year-old son as if he was 3. Other reviewers didn't like Hank (the young husband); I personally though the was a hero of the utmost strength to put up with True for more than a day.Anyway, True goes from one crazy decision to another with absolutely no knowledge of herself or other humans. Case in point: After the whirlwind marriage, Hank is supposed to fall madly in love with Guy, her son, overnight and adopt him immediately. No learning period, no nothing. And he is supposed to look at her, only her, absolutely her, 24/7, every single minute, and not even breathe if it isn't about her. Get the picture?As for the mother, Katherine, and other characters in the book, they are all equally one-dimensional, with the slight exception of Hank's New Orleans family, and they are all good and wise beyond any reality.I have to confess: After reading at least a million pages of this endless, endless book and finding I was dreading picking it up, I was happy for some of the spoilers in the other reviews and don't feel the need to finish it.

The reader is supposed to connect with the heroine, not cheer for her to get knocked off. Essentially this s a story about overbearing and unlikable people with obnoxious habits. It is also crude in a working class sort of way where sex is treated as something filthy, children body parts are described in painstaking order and urination is given more than its due."},{"Title":"Twelve Times Blessed CD","review":"I plowed through this book.

Way too many characters (reflective of the author's personal life, I presume) and way too many swear words.I'm not a prude, but I can't share this book with my mother!"},{"Title":"Twelve Times Blessed CD","review":"I absolutely love this novel! OK, it's no \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" or \\"Gone With the Wind\\", but I'm still not understanding all the negative reviews. I like True, she seems like a good-hearted person, Hank was SUPPOSED to be a semi-jerk, and Franny, Rudy, and Esa were all cute characters. Give this book a chance!"},{"Title":"Twelve Times Blessed CD","review":"This is the story of True, successful business woman, widow with a 10 year old son, single and not looking for love. Then one day, things turn around and she meets Hank, a 33 year old guy, who at first glance wouldn't have much in common with True, but they fall for each other and we follow them through their up and down story, with their families, friends and community having a go at loving or hating it.To be honest when I bought this book I wasn't expecting too much and was hoping that it wouldn't be a predictable or unrealistic story of love after 40 with toy boys or old fashioned guys. After reading the first chapter, I was totally taken aback by this great story. The characters are very real and true to themselves. What happens to them are situations and feelings I thought I could totally relate too, it was like being thrown into these people's lives and unsettling experiences, and seeing them through to the end, for better for worse. The story certainly isn't a fairy tale and a happy ever after type, though it is about love, family and friends, so it does have its romantic twists.I've read all of Mitchard's books, and I thought this one was daring, well-written and gripping. I would really recommend any reader to give it a chance."},{"Title":"Twelve Times Blessed CD","review":"This had the potential to be a good book, but it took me forever to finish it; I had to actually force myself! It just seemed to go on and on...and on. So much of the manuscript could have been taken out..probably 200 pages. I'm glad it wasn't just me who thoguht this."},{"Title":"Twelve Times Blessed CD","review":"I bought this book on a whim, having seen an interview with the author on the Today Show when I was on vacation and on the lookout for a light read. There were some nice segments, but on the whole, it seemed somewhat self-indulgent on the author's part. My favorite part was the feeling in the beginning of the book that you were &quot;inside their heads&quot;, but these explanations appeared to grow longer as we became more familiar with the characters rather than the reverse. It was like being with someone who loves the sound of their own voice--you may keep listening, but part of you tunes out.Having labored through the second half, with little additional (or unexpected) development, I wish I had skipped the last 200 pages and just read the last chapter. I didn't even give this one to the resale shop."},{"Title":"Twelve Times Blessed CD","review":"My title says it all. This book is awful. The writing is sloppy and too wordy, the characters go from one strange quirk to the next, and the story isn't consistent at all. The minor characters are just that, when they could really add to the story in a meaningful way. I'm nearly finished with the book, I don't care how it ends, and I've quit reading it."},{"Title":"Twelve Times Blessed CD","review":"After reading most of the reviews, I feel I missed something important, as I've enjoyed this novel. The dialogue is real, the characters' problems are real, and the heroine's mother - is my mother! She passed away this past summer but Kathleen's personality reflects hers. I am a senior citizen, I guess, but can still remember being 43! Although I'm still in my original marriage and happy about that, I can feel empathy with a young widow who falls for a younger man. And he loves her back! Perhaps I like this book because my most recent read was one of Danielle Steel's stories; anything looks like Pulitzer Prize material after her terrible writing."},{"Title":"Twelve Times Blessed CD","review":"About 170 pages into this book, I still had no idea where the author was attempting to go with the story as she was jumping all over the place and never really laid down a set story line to keep the reader glued. I figured out pretty quickly that is was a story of love, or whatever, between a younger guy/older woman but other then that, I'm not quite sure what to think. Luckily for me, my job allows for passing the time away, and that's really what this book did....so save it for a desperate, rainy day when you really have nothing else you could be doing!"},{"Title":"Twelve Times Blessed CD","review":"What a horrible book. I am an avid reader and have met very few books I could not finish. I forced myself to give this book 100 pages and I wish I had not.

I wish I could have returned the book for a refund."},{"Title":"Twelve Times Blessed CD","review":"The Deep End of the Ocean and The Most Wanted were two of the most creative, and well-written \\"popular\\" books, I have read. The creative process was flowing, and I had the feeling that these characters were so real, that Mitchard, herself, didn't know how the book would end until it was done. I think she was a pioneer in (once more, I'm using quotaion marks) \\"popular\\" literary fiction. A Theory of Relativity was disappointing. All writers, I suspect, have a book that is out-of-sync. However, with Twelve Times Blessed, this indicates a pattern. The characters were uninteresting; the plot pedestrian. Mitchard's narrative is excellent, and she can do this for $$$... All I can add, is I hope Mitchard regains her voice, and does not serve us any more pap."},{"Title":"Twelve Times Blessed CD","review":"Don't take this book seriously, just enjoy the ride.The main character is egotistic and the drama is predictable, but admit it, its a beach book.I wish the author had hired an editor - I would have been glad to trim it up a bit, and there are some serious inconsistencies that should have been caught.But really, if you want a fat juicy novel to take to the pool, this is fine."},{"Title":"Twelve Times Blessed CD","review":"Twelve Times Blessed is horrible. I listened to it on tapes. The protagonist are so unbelievable and childish that my reactions went from: skepticism to wanting to hit one with the other. &quot;True&quot; the female lead is such a wiener and as insecure as a 15 year old, she is relentless in her pursuit of destroying her marriage. She loves no one but herself, gets pregnant to keep her man, suprinsingly enough she does not live in a trailer but is a millionaire...yeah I believed that one and supposedly everyone around her thinks that she is the best friend, mother, lover that has ever been yet she is so self centered it is painfull. Her son &quot;guy&quot; is so spoiled that she lets him control her life and gives him whatever he wants. The male lead &quot;Hank/Harry&quot; is the perfect man, yet he never discuss anything in depth and is as deep as a puddle.As far as the writing goes the plot is non existent. It is supposed to be a book about real love but the relationship is so shallow that it makes for very little content. The writing is good but without content...it makes for a well written nothing. I don't recommend it"},{"Title":"Twelve Times Blessed CD","review":"This book is what you'd get if you inserted a thesaurus into a Mills & Boon novel - an overly long, excessively wordy, sappy romance.The characters are horribly underdeveloped; we know very little about them aside from their romantic foibles and sexual adventures. (And then there were several cases of Too Much Information.)A more positive review quotes \\"'Once again, we readers are blessed with J.M.'s sensuous eye for detail\\". Cursed, would seem more apt.Descriptions of young boys genitalia, the burgeoning of an erection, and several other unnecessary observations mentioned throughout this self-indulgent saga were disappointing.This is not Mitchard's best piece of work. The Deep End of The Ocean and The Most Wanted are exceptional novels; Twelve Times Blessed does not come close."},{"Title":"Twelve Times Blessed CD","review":"I agree with the reader from North Franklin, CT--this book is painful to read. I struggled through the first two chapters only because I was loyal to her book the \\"The Deep End of the Ocean\\". Finally, I couldn't subject myself to any more of \\"Twelve Times Blessed\\" lame \\"movie of the week\\" plot and poorly drawn characters. I was also disappointed in the \\"Theory of Relativity\\", two strikes after Mitchard hit a home-run with \\"The Deep End of the Ocean\\". I discovered \\"Ocean\\" before it became an Oprah read and found the plot to be capitivating and the characters beautifuly written. I hope that Mitchard get out of this \\"slump\\" and rediscovers her true writing roots."},{"Title":"Twelve Times Blessed CD","review":"I had looked forward to Ms. Mitchard's newest-\\"Twelve Times Blessed\\" and after plowing through it, was very glad I had not spent a dime on this drivel, but visited the library instead. The main characters, True and Hank have got to be the most self-absorbed, immature and thoroughly unlikable people I have met in ages. True's son Guy is impossible and obnoxious--but this is understandable given the fact that his idiotic mother thinks nothing of having a discussion with this brat about her love life with Hank after eleven year old Guy asks her \\"what's your frickin problem?\\". Lovely. It only gets worse from here on. Mitchard is all over the place with this book--no character development on anyone interesting e.g. Rudy, Frannie, or Esa. True's \\"I'm the only one who counts here\\" personality is grating and one wonders why her friends think she's fabulous,let alone even wanting her for a pal. When True goes for a sonogram for the new baby, she glibly relates the test as \\"seeing if it has all its marbles\\".This certainly puts her in the running for mother of the year. All in all, I am hoping Ms.Mitchard was simply throwing down thoughts perhaps while sipping (or gulping) wine..This would also explain her obsession with body functions and feminine problems--much more told here than we needed to know. Please, please, Ms Mitchard--get back to your real talent---telling us a wonderful, believable story."},{"Title":"Twelve Times Blessed CD","review":"Nobody -- or no editor -- put the brakes on this thing. Basically, there's too much of everything. Too much repetitive dialogue, too many pages, too much domestic life under a microscope and not enough plot, not enough motivation for characters, and while we're at it, a bit too much cutesy. Mitchard has personally been there done that (marrying a younger man), and it seems the reader is mostly just privvy to 500-plus pages of what that experience is like."},{"Title":"Twelve Times Blessed CD","review":"Mitchard is capable of so much more than what this book demonstrates! The first book of hers that I read was Deep End of the Ocean. I thought it was riveting. For the first time in my life, I went out and bought three more copies and sent them to my two daughters and a good friend. I've read several other of her books and thought they were good, though not as good as Deep End of the Ocean. But this book! Omigosh, this isn't just \\"genre\\" in the sense of a \\"woman's book,\\" this is far too close to being a predictable romance novel. Not 12, but a half dozen reasons why I thought this book was a huge letdown (1) The main character, True, not only had a corny name but she was one of the most obnoxious protagonists I've ever encountered, totally self-absorbed and abstruse; (2) her younger lover was a stereotypical \\"hunk,\\" with just a bit thrown in (his charity work, his dancing, his New Orleans Creole background) to make him potentially interesting, but he never really seemed real to me; (3) the book was far too long, especially in the last half; (4)many improbabilities, including these: Would a supposedly intelligent and with-it True all but ignore her son's and her own dire physical conditions to the point of endangering both of their lives? And would True really go for weeks (months?) without quizzing her mother closely, given her mother's nature, about whether or not Hank had called/written, etc.?; (6) the so-called climax of the book, when True learns the BIG TRUTH about her mother was utterly trite and hardly the stuff of a carefully crafted climax. Actually, if I put my mind to it, I could probably come up with 6 more reasons, thus making the book truly \\"12 times cursed,\\" but this review would be far too long. The one good thing about this book: she beautifully captures the personality and dialog of a 10 year old boy! So Michard definitely has it in her to write convincingly and to create suspense and a real humdinger of an ending (DEEP END . . .), but this book was a gigantic disappointment."},{"Title":"Twelve Times Blessed CD","review":"This book was a complete &amp; total waste of my time. I kept reading it hoping that something would happen. It was too long and drawn out and had no action or movement of story whatsoever.I am very disappointed."},{"Title":"Twelve Times Blessed CD","review":"Was this terrible novel written by an imposter? It reads like a very rough draft that was rushed into print with no editing whatsoever. The main character is sharp-tongued and thoroughly unlikable; the plot is melodramatic and predictable. BUT...the editing, or lack of it! In the first few pages there are uncorrected typos and mistakes in subject/verb agreement. Amazingly, there is even a scene in which a few characters are mentioned, then within a few sentences one of the characters mysteriously disappears and morphs into a DIFFERENT character, who was not present in the scene! This book is an insult to the reader's intelligence."},{"Title":"Twelve Times Blessed CD","review":"A huge disappointment. Just about the only thing consistent in this book was the &quot;cutesy&quot; descriptions of merchandise at the onset of each chapter. The character Hank said it best, things failed when True the woman started behaving like True a girl. To us forty-somethings out here, this character was insulting, and in the real world, could use a swift kick in the . . ."},{"Title":"Twelve Times Blessed CD","review":"I listened to the audio book version. If you think reading it was bad, listening to it was worse. The book was read by the author and her accent is so anoying, I just couldn't stand it.

Very disapointing work from someone talented enough to write &quot; The Deep End of the Ocean&quot;."},{"Title":"Twelve Times Blessed CD","review":"Just about as unlikeable and unlikely a story as I have ever read. Here we have a successful &quot;woman of independent means&quot; who is basically bullied into a quickie wedding with a much younger man of uncertain background. Self absorbed, shallow, trite, wordy, boring and entirely too explicit in the &quot;love scenes.&quot; The author DOES manage to get the controlling, selfish husband down pretty well, but the &quot;True&quot; character is quite lame.Say Bye to this one, I certainly would not recommending you Buy it."},{"Title":"Twelve Times Blessed CD","review":"Unlike many other reviews, I really enjoyed this book. I kept reading it wanting to know True and Hanks fate...I actually wish she would continue the same story including thier life together now with the new baby! I found that she wrote beautifully and always had me feel the characters feelings. Thanks Ms. Mitchard!"},{"Title":"Twelve Times Blessed CD","review":"I feel the reviews here have been somewhat harsh. Although the book is NO Deep End of the Ocean, it's not as bad as people are saying. I am a 43 year old woman with two kids married to a man 10 years younger who had never been a parent. I didn't know that was what the book was about when I bought it. She portrays some of the issues involved in this situation very well. Hank was fairly well developed in showing the resentment of the encroachment on his time that a sudden family brings while True showed the woman's obsession with age issue better. I agree she was entirely to consumed with bodily functions and I did have a real problem with her attack on Christians. But it's not so bad I would throw it in the fireplace or anything."},{"Title":"Twelve Times Blessed CD","review":"I listened via audio book and was totally enthralled - to the point of actually missing the characters once I had finished the book. I was a bit amazed that the marriage/adoption took place so quickly, but thought on the whole that the book was awesome. This is my first book by this author and I look forward to reading more of her work. I found myself wishing I could contact the author to do a follow-up book so I didn't have to lose touch with the characters. I highly recommend this book!"},{"Title":"Twelve Times Blessed CD","review":"The plot isn't worth going into and the writing is poor--clearly no editor took much of a look at it. Some sentences simply don't make sense or adjectives are used to describe something in ways that don't seem to fit. Other times, the storyline isn't coherent--details suddenly change, almost like describing a character wearing a red coat and then two paragraphs later saying the person took off their blue coat. It reads like a book very hastily put together. Glad I got it out of the library-had I paid for it, I would want my money back."},{"Title":"Twelve Times Blessed CD","review":"I agree with all of the above reviewers; I can't believe I stuck with this book to the end. The characters are shallow and annoying; again, its impossible to see why True is adored by her friends. She is so impossibly stupid, its hard to believe she made it to 43. How did this book get published? I have never read any other books by Mitchard, but I thought her reputation as a writer was good. I would be hard-pressed to ever read another with her name on it."},{"Title":"Twelve Times Blessed CD","review":"Jacquelyn Mitchard's book \\"Twelve Times Blessed\\" had to be by far one of the worst books I have ever read in my life. It had no real plot to it, it jumped around and talked about nothign but sex scenes, which if it doesn't interest you, dont read this book. I thought it was really weird how she slept with a guy she didn't even know, while her son was out in the car, it's kind of gross if you think about it. I did kind of like how i could relate to her and her roomate, as they were best friends."},{"Title":"Twelve Times Blessed CD","review":"Jacquelyn Mitchard's books are usually excellent. This one is terrible. I agree with most of what the other reviewers who panned this book wrote and will not bother to repeat their on-the-mark comments. One thing that has not been mentioned about this book, however, is Mitchard's incredible hostility toward Christians. Her Christian, homeschooling mother character, Genevra, is truly appalling, telling small children that they are headed to hell, something no Christian I know would dream of doing. She makes other anti-Christian statements in the book, including a paragraph where she accuses God of mistreating Jesus. Has it not occured to Ms. Mitchard that people of many faiths read her books and that quite a few of them would be offended by comments like these? I don't know if I will ever read another of her books."},{"Title":"Twelve Times Blessed CD","review":"I guess I'm among the minority but I absolutely loved this book. It's my favorite of all the books of Mitchard's that I've read, including Deep End of the Ocean. Sure, it may not be great literature, but it was definitely an entertaining story. I just loved the romance between True and Hank and it stuck with me for a long time after I finished it. I was hooked from the first night they meet in the bar, and I didn't care if it took 600+ pages, I had to know how it would end!"},{"Title":"Twelve Times Blessed CD","review":"I'm not surprised that this book is getting somewhat panned by other readers; it doesn't live up to Mitchard's other work. But if I didn't know it was written by her, and hadn't had the expectations that come with it, I would have considered it a good book. Actually, I put off reading it for awhile, because of the other reviews I'd read; once I picked it up yesterday I read the whole thing in about two days. I couldn't put it down! It is beautifully written, as Mitchard's earlier works. The characters are actually very realistic, as they are neither \\"good\\" nor \\"bad\\", but written like real people, stubborn, flawed, and difficult to communicate with. The book is messy and emotional, like life tends to be. So I recommend you give it a chance; just don't expect it to be a life-changing experience."},{"Title":"Twelve Times Blessed CD","review":"Jacquelyn Mitchard's, Twelve Times Blessed, has to be the book with the most sex involved.

I threw it away in disgust before I made it through 100 pages. My usual rule is I will give a book until page 100. This book did not deserve even that many pages.

The editor of this book should have counseled the author to not publish."},{"Title":"Twelve Times Blessed CD","review":"I am relieved to see so many negative reviews here, because I hated this book and thought maybe I was missing something or just being unkind. Twelve Times Blessed (love that title!) can only be described as dreadful. An unlikeable, immature, self-sabotaging heroine is paired with an unlikeable, immature, self-sabotaging love interest and surrounded by one-dimensional secondary characters who leave you wondering why on earth they put up with her. I've loved a number of Mitchard's other books; I can't believe this one came from the same pen. If you loved Deep End of the Ocean and want more Mitchard, choose any of her other titles, but leave this one on the shelf."},{"Title":"Twelve Times Blessed CD","review":"I very much enjoyed listening to this book in the unabridged tape version.

I also noticed some typos and places where editing was overlooked, but the story itself kept me highly interested while wondering what the fate of True and Hank would be in the end. I did not think any of it far-fetched---who wouldn't be flattered and enticed by the attentions of a younger man, especially after eight years of widowhood and raising a child on your own? While this book may not be one of Ms. Mitchard's best works, it does not deserve the bad rap it gets on this site!"},{"Title":"Twelve Times Blessed CD","review":"This novel by Jacquelyn Mitchard is very drawn out, boring and has way too many useless details. In &quot;Twelve Times Blessed&quot; True Dickenson (the main character) is a very succesful business woman,who marries a younger resturant owner. The story is about their lives as they learn to live with each others faults. Theybecome aware of many things they do not know about each otheras they became involved before they knew anything about theirprior lives or families. This book sometimes loses your interestby involving you in the details of people that are not the maininterest of the story. The story needed more detail on True andHank,less on small trivial details of other peoples lives."},{"Title":"Twelve Times Blessed CD","review":"I have loved Mitchard's other books-Deep End of the Ocean, Most Wanted and Theory of Relativity. I anxiously awaited this book and was so disappointed. I couldn't get beyond 75 pages, and that was difficult. I gave to my mother as she likes &quot;romantic fluff&quot; and she got through 100 pages, but couldn't go any further. It seemed like Mitchard was trying to write like a, let's say Marion Keyes-funny, but with a serious topic. I hope Ms. Mitchard goes back to her wonderful dramatic writing as this is not a path for her to go. It was almost a spoof of romance-type books, but not even good enough at that. I found myself rolling my eyes at some of the writing. Then I just couldn't take it anymore. I had the same thought as another reviewer--I can't imagine an editor, friend or anyone reading this book and not being truthful. Let alone a publisher publishing it!!"},{"Title":"Twelve Times Blessed CD","review":"I thought this book had such promise and I kept reading, but it was just mediocre. Mitchard tried too hard to develop a conflict that just didn't make sense. How absurd that two grown people would keep misunderstanding each other. But I did think her sex scenes were pretty good or did she use the word \\"shaft\\" - I think so and I hate that. If she's going to write graphically about sex, then call it what it is."},{"Title":"Twelve Times Blessed CD","review":"A great deal of this book is devoted to Christian-bashing. The sole purpose of one of the characters is to serve as a vessel for the author's hatred of evangelical Christians. The character is introduced as a &quot;super-Christian&quot; who homeschools her children and is revealed to be a malicious, lying, violent, child-hating gossip.At another point, the main character and her best friend find themselves in a bed-and-breakfast with needlepoint Scripture verses on the walls, which they find frightening and disturbing.These are only two examples.Odd from an author who preaches &quot;tolerance&quot; in her newspaper column ..."},{"Title":"Twelve Times Blessed CD","review":"I've read most of these reviews so thought I would chip in my two cents worth. I think the main thing that bothered me was that Hank couldn't understand why his wife was upset, while he married to her with a baby to a late in life mother was on the way, rushes to the comfort of an old friend, one that he had been most in love with for 6 years. Also I couldn't understand why it took True so long to wonder about 3 people's references to all the letters he wrote to her that she hadn't received. Where was her head. And didn't her doctor tell her it was bed or hospital, which she conveniently ignored and then suffered for it. I don't hold out much hope for the future of that marriage, she is too jealous and concerned with her terrible weight(I should weigh that little) and her age. He is too wrapped up in himself and what he feels like doing at that very moment."},{"Title":"Twelve Times Blessed CD","review":"I have enjoyed Mitchard's previous books, and was surprised to find this book did not continue with her earlier promise as an author. I thought the characters were not believable, which makes it difficult to care what happens to them. There simply is no depth to this book. I never quite understood the reasons why True and Hank separated. Their self absorption was wearying at best and the plot was too thin to hold a reader's interest. It was an effort to keep reading it. I do not recommend this book and hope that Ms. Mitchard gets back on track."},{"Title":"Twelve Times Blessed CD","review":"In a recent appearance in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, syndicated columnist and novelist Jacquelyn Mitchard maintained that her newest book, TWELVE TIMES BLESSED, is one that men need not be afraid of. The comment got a laugh from the large, almost entirely female audience. After all, TWELVE TIMES BLESSED has all the ingredients of a standard \\"woman's book.\\" A successful woman, True Dickinson, flirts with an attractive man on her birthday, only to be rescued from death by exposure by the same hunky fellow after her car swerves off the road on her way home. A disastrous date later, True discovers that this is true love and the proverbial bodice-ripping begins. There is love, there is fighting, there is separation, there is tentative but hopeful reconciliation. It is, of course, a familiar formula.But acknowledging that a book is formulaic is not the same as criticizing the book. After all, as readers of genre fiction know, it's not whether you use the formula, but how you use the formula that counts. And Mitchard's gifts for characterization, humor and pacing elevate TWELVE TIMES BLESSED out of the murky waters of most formula fiction.While True and her beloved, a younger and somewhat wilder man named Hank, are both well drawn, Mitchard does much of her best character work with less central figures, including True's mother, a woman who expresses her displeasure with her daughter's romantic choices in myriad awful ways. True's son, Guy, is also compelling, as Mitchard does a fine job capturing the rapidly shifting emotions and behavior of a 10-year-old boy caught between childhood and adolescence. Guy's struggles are often poignant, but his antics also provide much of the book's gentle humor.Though the book is fairly lengthy, checking in at over 500 pages, Mitchard moves her story along (sometimes even a bit too quickly) as True and Hank encounter a variety of challenges, ranging from the trivial to the tragic. The occasional clunky sentence (sometimes involving confusion over the use of the word/name \\"True\\" at the beginning of a sentence) slows things down a bit from time to time but, on the whole, Mitchard tells a well-paced story and deftly assures that the reader will root for her two lovers from beginning to end.Mitchard was right to tell her audience that men need not be afraid of TWELVE TIMES BLESSED. Though told from True's perspective throughout, the book's portrayal of Hank is well done. He is neither wholly a knight-in-shining-armor, nor wholly a rouge. As a result, he is both believable and likeable, as is the novel as a whole.--- Reviewed by Rob Cline"},{"Title":"An Outline of European Architecture","review":"I've read dozens of books on the history of architecture, and this is the best introduction to the subject I've ever encountered, despite the fact that it is now over half a century old. I used this book intensively on a three-month trip to western and eastern Europe some years ago, and it was a great help in appreciating all the many important buildings we encountered, especially the Gothic cathedrals and early Renaissance Italian architecture. As the back cover says, Sir Nicholas is reckoned one of the most stimulating writers on architecture alive, and I would have to agree with that. His great enthusiasm for his subject is contagious, and his descriptions of important buildings are often nothing short of inspired. This is truly a great book by a great scholar."},{"Title":"An Outline of European Architecture","review":"Read this book; it is quite simply stunning and makes a complicated subject seem simple ( well I understood it ).The ' Introduction ' alone is more than worth the purchase; it is often quoted and reproduced as a seminal article.A treat."},{"Title":"An Outline of European Architecture","review":"It is a most wonderful book on the architectural history of Europe, even if the subject is not exactly your cup of tea.

Brunler, who was a recognized expert in the field of physics and medicine, guides you through the world of radiation and rays, convincingly summoning up a great deal of useful intelligence. This book will have you thinking in many dimensions at once. It truthfully analyzes our universe and rightfully acknowledges that people give off rays which can be analyzed. Brunler marvelously took this knowledge and developed a Mental Potential Chart (not included but referred to) of human consciousness, which later was adopted by The Balancing Program (www.thebalancingprogram.org). This booklet can be had through Health Research Books.com. If you favor unusual takes on reality, with personal application, then this book is for you!"},{"Title":"Cucina Essenziale: Essential Cooking","review":"I liked this cookbook a lot, although I know it would not be for everyone. Mr. Cavallini trained under the famed master chef, or Grand Maestro Gualtiero Marchesi and shares his passion for Italian cuisine by creating recipes that would be fit for Michelin three star restaurants rather than a typical Italian kitchen. If you are looking for recipes basic hearty soups, traditional pastas, and simple entrees than you would not buy this book. However, if you enjoy truly wonderful food on a gourmet level, than this book will help you to create dishes that you normally would only find in fancy restaurants right in your own kitchen.Mr. Cavallini explains Essential Cooking, or \\"La Cucina Essenziale\\" as being derived from research into ancient Italian culinary traditions that are reinterpreted in the light of today's taste and way of life. His recipes replace heavy sauces, fats, and cream with vegetable broth, olive oil, and other light ingredients. His cooking techniques are chosen to maintain the integrity of the ingredients, and the dishes are simply yet dramatically presented.The book includes a well thought out chapter of basic recipes that are used to create more developed recipes throughout the rest of the book. Although the ingredient list for some recipes may be a challenge for some who do not have access to such luxuries as partridge, or foie gras, there are many other recipes that could easily be created from ingredients found in your local grocery store. Even reading through the recipes that contain ingredients I would never use, I was able to take away some new ideas on how to use more common ingredients in unique ways.I would recommend this cookbook to anyone that shares a passion for truly wonderful food, likes to experiment in the kitchen, and for those who are interested in preparing gourmet quality food at home. Novice cooks interested in basic, traditional Italian recipes would probably not find this cookbook helpful. I think of Mr. Cavallini as my \\"Italian\\" Charlie Trotter."},{"Title":"The Everything Selling Book (Everything)","review":"This is a great book for someone who does not aspire to be a sales professional, but still needs some sales planning and presentation skills; someone like a home / small business owner.

The last few pages, however, do include sections on possible additions, garage styles and renderings of interior and exterior doors."},{"Title":"101 Classic Homes of the Twenties: Floor Plans and Photographs (Dover Architecture)","review":"This is a reprint of a house plan catalog from 1925; originally, it was the catalog of the Harris, McHenry & Baker Co., a lumber company. These books from Dover are exact reprints of original plan books from the turn of the century (1880-1925, roughly - this book is one of the latest years in the series). Dover adds little or no modern explanations, just presenting the catalog as it was. So when one looks to review these books, one isn't really judging the modern-day publisher, or editing, or writing. To judge the books, one has to compare each one to others of its kind, and then to decide whether the material in it is thorough and complete according to the standards of its time. Since there are several dozen of these catalogs published by Dover, we have the basis for such a comparison.This particular homes catalog has several unusual elements to it which make it worth adding to a collection. For starters, almost all of the houses are illustrated with photographs, rather than drawings, so we are seeing actual, finished models of the houses. The photographs include some things we'd be unlikely to see in a drawing or artist's rendering, for example, the photo of the Webster model shows the driveway, and the garage with carriage-house type doors behind the house. And the Kingston shows a car in the driveway - just the rear of the car, I couldn't identify the make or model, but it is neat to see a nice middle-class house with a car, something we couldn't take for granted in earlier years.Some plan books have no text except the price listings and how to order; others have entire sections of articles, or extensive suggestions as to furnishings, colors to finish the house in, etc. This book falls in between those extremes as to amount of text, but what's actually written for each house, although short, is quite unusual. The company is apparently trying to push social engineering along with new homes. For example, here's the text accompanying the photo of the Van Buren model: \\"Clean men, both of hand and heart, are invariably the product of happy home unions. It is around the harmonious hearthstone where the glow of mutual interest and understanding temper the finer senses that men mould character of sterling worth. It would be a violation of a natural law if homes in The Van Buren class should produce other than men of clean purpose.\\" And here's the text for the Dumont Duplex: \\"The Dumont cannot be surpassed as a double house, and will make homes of exceptional advantages and refinements for those whose experience and education have taught them the value of good fellowship and neighborly kindness. Learning to co-operate with our fellow creatures is the secret of overcoming selfishness and all of its poisoning effects upon our better selves.\\" Well! Is that the best reason for living in multi-family housing you've ever heard?This book is late enough into the century that we can take interior bathrooms for granted; the 1920's are quite modern compared to 15 years earlier. A plan book from 1912, for example, still has half the houses without indoor baths, and many not wired for electricity. On the other hand, there are not yet garages featured automatically with the houses, and the kitchen stoves still need a chimney vented to the outside. I greatly enjoy comparing books from a few years apart, to see the progress being made. Many of the houses have the \\"built-in\\" features that became popular in the teens: built-in fold-down ironing boards, breakfast nooks with built-in bench seating, laundry chutes from upstairs to downstairs, built-in bookcases next to the fireplace or between the living room and dining room.There are quite a few houses that seem ahead of their time as to modern features. The Van Buren has two bathrooms upstairs, one for the master bedroom and the other for all the other bedrooms. Both bathrooms have both a bathtub and a shower stall. In fact, looking at the floor plan for the Van Buren, one could imagine living in it today fairly easily, with just the addition of a bit more kitchen counter space. The Chesterfield, likewise, is a house I'd love to live in, with not only two full bathrooms, but built-in bookcases downstairs, and built0in window seats upstairs in the bedrooms, a walk-through pantry with more built-in cabinets than most, and beautiful balconies. The Webster has a \\"radio room\\" off the dining room - presumably for the hobbyist! It also has a downstairs powder room as well as the usual upstairs bathroom. The Westhaven offers a dumbwaiter to the basement (presumably where there is storage), a separate laundry room, a downstairs washroom with both toilet and a double sink and an upstairs bathroom, as well as a sewing room, a clothes chute, an indoor refrigerator instead of an ice box that has to be near the back door, and a waste-burner disposal. (Remember, this is before we were worried about air pollution! A waste burner was very modern then!) Most of the houses still have the refrigerators situated right by the back door, still assuming the need for ice delivery, and many with slots for milk delivery as well, but there were the first few real refrigerators, as well as real washing machines, at this time, and this company appears to be forward thinking enough to have designed houses for these brand-new conveniences.In summary: a must for continuity from \\"old\\" houses to \\"modern\\" and also for the unusual text which will keep you amused."},{"Title":"101 Classic Homes of the Twenties: Floor Plans and Photographs (Dover Architecture)","review":"This book is a good starting point for anyone interested in the homes built in the 1920-1930's.

The advertisements are wordy, trying to convince the buyer that if he builds his own house, his wife will love him more and his children will grow up to be better citizens. Some of the descriptions are hilarious and others are almost touching, given today's society's relative ignorance of the concept of civic duty."},{"Title":"Children With Disabilities: A Medical Primer","review":"Received book fast after ordering.

Indeed every minute, every person, every story that was ever written down or told about August 4 and 5 is scrutinized with a precision of which renowned historians should be envious! Not all questions are answered but some are and the story that is eventually presented at the end of the book as the most probable about the last hours and death of Marilyn Monroe is the most convincing of all the so called great biographies about the legend I have read.

The books were all saying that Marilyn's death was a straight-up, no-question MURDER. Don't get me wrong, it's fine if you think that it was happened, but please don't ignore the evidence that the murder theory was completely blown out of proportion by people trying to profit off of Marilyn's image.Around the time I was starting to get ready to give up on trying to find out what really happened to Hollywood's most iconic legend, a friend of mine recommended that I read \\"The DD Group.\\" I was hesitant at first to spend another sum of money on a Marilyn book, considering I already owned pretty much every other one in publishing history, but in the end after my friend convinced me that it was amazing and was a really great read, I decided to buy it and see what all of my friend's hype was about.I am glad I did! \\"The DD Group\\" is a F-A-N-T-A-S-T-I-C book on the death of Marilyn Monroe. It is BY FAR the best I have ever read on the subject at hand.

This is THE cold truth-finding panorama - to its definitive end.Was Marilyn murdered? Over a dozen different conspiracy theories claim she was murdered - by the Kennedys, for the Kennedys, to destroy the Kennedys, to protect the Kennedys - by the Mob, by her own doctor, by her housekeeper, by the FBI, by the CIA - because she knew about Castro, knew about the Bay of Pigs, knew about Area 51 aliens, knew about......Can ALL these conflicting claims simultaneously be true?WHAT HAPPENED?Is any ONE of these murder theories right? If so, which one?OR - ARE THEY ALL fabrications, made up by their various proposers eager to jump on the publicity bandwagon of fame and notoriety - or worse, for money?If you NEED to know the answers to the always-asked questions about Marilyn's death - 'if suicide, why was there no pill residue in Marilyn's stomach?' 'if suicide, why was there no drinking glass in her room to down them with?' 'if suicide, how could the blood levels of Chloral Hydrate and Nembutal be so high?' 'was there really a secret Red Diary?' 'did so-and-so really talk to Marilyn the day she died?' THEN YOU MUST READ THIS BOOK.Who was Robert Slatzer? Did he really marry Marilyn? Or not? Is Slatzer a credible witness and conduit of real communication from Marilyn over the years and on the last day of her life? OR WAS HE A LIAR?What about Frank Capell? Milo Speriglio? Jeane Carmen? Jose Bolenos?Was Marilyn really romantically involved with JFK? With RFK?Was Bobby Kennedy in L.A. Saturday August 4, 1962 or not? Did he go up to Fifth Helena Drive and visit Marilyn? At what time? Why? What happened?Most importantly: did Bobby Kennedy or President Kennedy or someone acting for the Kennedys or someone else - really murder Marilyn Monroe?How do you sort out the endless stream of conflicting witness testimonies since 1962 - through the 1970's, the 1980's, and the 1990's in magazine interviews, TV interviews, in-depth biographer interviews - with their ever-changing stories? With THE DD GROUP.ALL these questions and dozens more are exhaustively examined by a group of ten investigators - until answers are found. It's all succinctly summarized and organized by David Marshall's extraordinary study which he personally moderated online during 2 years with The Death Discussion Group. THE DD GROUP scrutinizeds every speck of the minutest details of this highly controversial, hotly debated and contested death: the death of Marilyn Monroe on August 4, 1962.If you have read any of the major biographies of Marilyn Monroe - Mailer, Guiles, Wolfe, Summers, Leaming, Brown & Barham's \\"Last Take,\\" Spoto, Churchwell - YOU NOW MUST READ \\"THE DD GROUP.\\"ALL the biographies - and evidences - are reviewed for you: the FBI files; the Coroner's autopsy report; the many conflicting testimonies given by those who were - or claim to have been with her or in contact August 3rd and 4th.The 2-year's exhaustive examination and evaluation of ALL the facts declare the final conclusion, as the facts securely dictate: MARILYN MONROE DIED BY SUICIDE.What happened? READ \\"THE DD GROUP!\\""},{"Title":"The DD Group: An Online Investigation Into the Death of Marilyn Monroe","review":"David Marshall has taken on quite the task of organizing and presenting a years worth of online discussions based on Marilyn Monroe's last days in his new book, \\"THE DD GROUP; An Online Investigation Into the Death of Marilyn Monroe\\" and he has done it admirably.Having had the privilege of starting the online club Forever Marilyn's Death Discussion (www.forevermarilyn.com) and being one of the original members that contributed to the discussion which lead to the writing of this book I am personally pleased to share with you my review of this highly unique book on Marilyn Monroe's death.With all the controversy that still swirls around Ms. Monroe's untimely death here is FINALLY a book that takes on every theory fearlessly and without prejudice. Diving head first into Marilyn's final days is a group of educated scholars on Monroe's life, each one with a different and valid opinion on her mysterious death.This 497 paged soft-covered book is well worth the $30.95 cover charge. Aimed at educating the reader on the facts of Marilyn's death this book goes well beyond the confines of the timeline of August 4, 1962. The cast of characters in Monroe's life, as well as the events surrounding her last days are mapped out in the 23 chapters of this hefty book. The only draw back to this nonfictional piece of work is the lack of an index. But with each chapter covering so specific of details you hardly notice this tiny omission.Much of the material in this phenomenal book is new in presentation. Facts on Monroe's death that you thought you knew are thrown into question and material never before released is presented in a revealing and titillating light that may startle even the most educated of readers.Mr. Marshall skillfully lays out the theories of the original ten online DD Discussion Members in a format that is easily accessible to even the most novice of fans and is backed by impeccable research. From start to finish this book is riveting, holding the reader spellbound as you are challenged to come to your own opinion by the end of the book. That is not to say conclusions are not drawn by the author himself, but Mr. Marshall allows for plenty of room for the reader to take the information available and form their own opinion.If you have ever wondered about or questioned the death of one of the world's greatest (and most tragic of) movies stars then this is, without hesitation, THE Marilyn Monroe book for you!"},{"Title":"The DD Group: An Online Investigation Into the Death of Marilyn Monroe","review":"David Marshall's \\"The DD Group: An Online Investigation Into the Death of Marilyn Monroe\\" is a must-read for anyone interested in learning the truth about the premature demise of Hollywood's most enduring star. The book examines all aspects of Miss Monroe's death by carefully reconstructing her final hours and analyzing the facts in a logical, detailed, and organized manner. Medical and forensics evidence is carefully dissected, and the possible agendas and questionable credibility of several key associates of Miss Monroe's {as well as a number of contemporary biographers} is presented for consideration. The book contains numerous startling new facts never revealed in any other Monroe biography, information which is compelling, ground-breaking and startling in the extreme. The intense research conducted by the participants of the group is impressive and unprecedented, and Mr. Marshall did an admirable job condensing what must have been an intimidatingly vast amount of information into a concise, well-written and thoroughly gripping investigative report. I highly recommend this book to anyone searching for the truth about what happened to Marilyn Monroe on the night she died. Fact and fantasy will become very easy to discern, and readers will arrive at a possible conclusion which is credible, realistic, and devoid of sensationalism. This book is a tremendous accomplishment, and you will never look at the death of Marilyn Monroe the same way again."},{"Title":"The DD Group: An Online Investigation Into the Death of Marilyn Monroe","review":"What a remarkable detailed account of Marilyn's last days. The book focuses mostly on the last day however gives detailed information from other times that relate to the events on Aug.4, 1962. This would be a good book for someone just beginning to research MM or for someone who has read all before it and has their own conclusions about her death, since this book references other popular biographies written about Marilyn. This book is great becuase it's only purpose is to provide detailed information both before and after death so as to help the reader decide on their own conclusion. Although the author has his own beliefs which he shares with the reader, there is absolutely no intention of pursuasion to try and promote any one idea or theory. A personal thanks goes out to David Marshall and all who helped make this book possible, as it the best read on Marilyn Monroe I have come across yet. I have read many biographies and documentaries on Marilyn, and absolutely could not put this book down. I hope all others will enjoy it as much as I have."},{"Title":"The DD Group: An Online Investigation Into the Death of Marilyn Monroe","review":"Just finished the book this morning. Couldn't put it down since I purchased it a couple of days ago! I believe it has demystified so much here about Marilyn that it has to be very close to the last word on the subject. I took an interest in MM a few years ago and read many books on her. I was so impressed with her life that I wrote a three-act play called \\"Bye Bye Baby\\" about her last thee days. It hasn't been staged yet but one lives in hope! It was heavily biased by the Slatzer, Wolfe angle [murder] but since I read this book I'll have to re-write it removing this bias. After I read it I immediately went to Matthew Smith's Last Words to see if the DD Group's versions matched in any way. I believe, with a little bit of editing, it has second-guessed the Marilyn's tapes which weren't published at the time! It all makes sense now!!! However, although I really believed all along that she had been murdered, I now believe she did kill herself and that she made her mind up after RFK'S visit. It would seem that her whole world caved in then. When she asked Dr. Greenson \\"Did you take my Nembutal?\\" I think she was calling his bluff. She probably told him earlier that she only had one or two left and hid the 24 or 25. He may well have given her a shot of a small, controlled amount of Nembutal, with this knowledge in mind, when he returned, advising her to go to bed immediately. [I think most psychiatrists can and do give shots]. Remember that her total well-being depended almost entirely the esteem in which the Kennedys held her. If that was lost irretrievably, MM was lost. And it looked pretty final at 4.00 that Saturday. Dr. Greenson alone couldn't keep her from ending her life, even though he was indispensable to her in many ways. She was too intelligent for them all but must have made up her mind that afternoon.MM must have felt lonelier that evening than any other time in her life and in that lonely bed in Brentwood she must have sobbed herself into that deep, deep sleep. I do believe now that she did say \\"Say goodbye to Jack...\\" to Peter Lawford. It's so, so tragic.This book is a wonderful, intelligent and compassionate insight!!!

The book was so well researched (by so many), debated and documented. I actually changed my opinion as to the mode of her tragic demise because of it...I still don't believe that MM intended to commit suicide, which correlates to BOTH of the author's final speculations as to how she died, but I am swayed by the opinion that others were (innocently) responsible for her death, due to gross negligence. This negligence made it absolutely necessary to hide the real way MM died. (it saved careers)...Her Dr.'s. had an unknowing hand in her death, and even Mrs. Murray, which would fit in to why she said, \\"Why, oh why, after all these years, do I have to keep hiding this...\\" Marilyn did not intentionally commit suicide...That is my opinion after reading this excellent book.

I,who have read EVERYTHING on MM,really didnt change my opinion and I found the book somewhat irritating,as it kept going round and round the subject without ever getting anywhere. I find peoples analysis of info interesting. The infamous question Marilyn asked on sat Aug 4th in the afternoon, mrs Murray, do we have any oxygen? Everybody automatically assumed she asked because she was contemplating an overdose and wanted to be rescued...........well, Pat Newcomb spent Fri nite at Marilyns and was still there and had a terrible case of bronchitus. Did anybody stop to think that Maybe Marilyn thought the oxygen might be needed for Pat s condition? No, everybody has to rush to conspiracy and complicated motives.................Pat and Marilyn were arguing that day.........oh it had to be about Bobby Kennedy. No, in fact Pat had gone behind Marilyn s back the day before and cancelled future publication of Pictures of Marilyn for Playboy, as Pat didnt think Marilyn should do it. Marilyn was rightly angry when she had found out what Pat did that Sat morning.I think you have to look at the medical evidence, and that would be the autopsy, and the blood level toxicities........it seems likely that Marilyn was taking nembutal that day on Sat to calm her down due to anxieties concerning Murray and Greenson. It was Murray s last day on job and Greenson was about to be let go ALSO by Marilyn. She was slurring her speech in the afternoon due to too much nembutal. The nite before she got almost no sleep despite the drugs..........Greenson felt she was physiologically resiting them. So, since he couldnt locate marilyn s md to give the needed injection early sat evening to guarantee sleep...the other method was chloral hydrate enema. He chose Murray to administer it after he left the house, and I believe Murray gave an accidental incorrect dosage and that was what led to her death..........the combo between the 2 drugs. Her colon was discolored in a major way discovered at autopsy consistant with the administration of a drug enema.You cant hide that evidence under the rug, There were no injection sites, there was no pill residue,so it wasnt massive overdose of pills, the drug amt was enormous, it was liqiud chloral hydrate. There was purple discoloration far extending down the colon. The pathologists had never seen that before in a drug suicide. Does anybody think the Kennedy brothers or the mafia was going to kill Marilyn by an enema? Murray was at the house for 24 hrs the entire last 24 hrs of Marilyn life and after and the dr was there most of that time as well (greenson).....why dont people get that it wasnt some mysterious conspiracy...........it was accidental brought on by a dr out of control and an unstable untrained cleaning lady acting as a nurse way outside of her capacity. Greenson should have been found out and had his medical license taken away. I think he was unfit to practice psychiatry,personally. He had I think struck Marilyn in a fit of anger in early June ( no it wasnt a fall in the shower, marilyn took baths) and Marilyn should have had him arrested at that point and charged with assult and battery. Perhaps she would have been alive today if she more circumspect on who she chose to be around her. She also shouldnt have been taking nembutal as a tranquilizer in the middle of the day especially and not inform her dr of how much she had taken. So she was complicit. Thats my conclusion, and it was before reading DD."},{"Title":"The DD Group: An Online Investigation Into the Death of Marilyn Monroe","review":"I couldn't put this book down.

Perhaps a better way of looking at what happened than individual writers have done. Worth a look see."},{"Title":"The DD Group: An Online Investigation Into the Death of Marilyn Monroe","review":"The group called the DD group grew out of a fan site discussing MM's death. Out of this collection a 500 page tome has been published which attempts to rehash into infinity the minute by minute account of Marilyn's last days. They attempt also to take us all back to 1962. We are to believe that everything the Coroner released, \\"probable\\" suicide is actually true! After 45 years we are to drop the thousands of words that have been pinned making it very clear not only did she not committ suicide, but that she indeed was murdered. This group of clowns who did not know MM, were probably not even born yet, but dismiss people around her who did know her, who did care about her, namely Robert Slatzer. Slatzer was the first person to go public with his knowledge of her last days. Some information had been previously published by Frank Capell in a political 1964 booklet. However, Mr. Slatzer fleshes out MM's days no one could know unless they were close to Monroe. Yet, here he is not only dismissed but labeled a liar. Also, they allude in bulk to two very questionable biographies by Donald Spoto and Barbara Lemmings, as well as the very definition of a liar, Eunice Murray, MM's maid, driver. The best book ever written about MM's last days was by Brown & Barhams 'The Last Take'. There are some incidents of dramatic license and embellishing in this book, but overall it is rock solid. And, Donald Wolfe is the only person to speak with Norman Jeffries, Eunice Murrays son in law who was at Marilyn's the entire day of August 4. If anyone should know what went on, he certainly was privey to all of it. He was a contractor working on MM's Brentwood home, and was at the house on a daily basis. He too is completely dismissed. In other words in order to conform their preferred theory into fact they ignore what they choose to and make up the rest. We might as well have a new Peter Lawford book written as fact as to all he said thru the years. Poor Marilyn, here she cannot even trust those who claim to care about her and allow her to go down in history a suicide. I bought this book, but 50 pages into it I knew what I was in for. After completion is was straight to the trash, this is not a book I would want to keep in my treasures on Marilyn."},{"Title":"The Life You Save May Be Your Own: An American Pilgrimage","review":"&quot;The Life You Save&quot; turns out to be a challenging and powerful read. A prism lense for introspection--something greater than the sum of its parts. A tapestry artfully created from the strands of the lives of four contemporary &quot;saints&quot;--using that term in sense of those set apart for a special task. It is moving; it challenges preconceptions; it inspires, even as it is honest in appraisal. What a portrait, finally, of four pilgirms traveling the Way together, seeking to work out their own salvation with fear and trembling in order to help the rest of us fearful and trembing pilgrims along the Way! Fine, also, in its depiction of an age of transition--moving out of modern into postmodern.

I knew of them and had read many of their works but I did not recognize how aware they were of one another. I was also surprised by the involvement of so many prominent literary figures in their recognition and advancement. The book helped me to find a better understanding of Flannery O'Connor's work, which I have admired even though I found it difficult to grasp and a keener insight into the novels of Walker Percy. Merton and Day are what they have always been but the candor of their journals and letters adds to their stature.

As someone who grew up in the generation after these writers, the book is a key to the thought patterns of my own elders. The least of the figures here is Walker Percy, who, really, only wrote one masterful work (The Moviegoer), and seems to have been not very interesting. The others are powerful persons in their own right. The ones I know best are Merton and Day, and Elie does an excellent job with them and their lives. One strand of the period that is not quite emphasized as much as it could have been (though it is there) is the resurgence of medieval philosophy as an alternative to Descartes and modern philosophy generally. This would have tightened the references to Aquinas, Marcel, etc., and even allowed for Heidegger to make an appearance. It would have heightened the strangeness of the Kierkegaard/Dostoyevsky/Hopkins/Scotus/Aquinas synthesis that seemed so prevalent among Catholic intellectuals in the 60s. (You can find it even in figures like Marshall McLuhan). Another strand could have been the rise of archetypal philosophy (Suzanne Langer gets a brief mention), which moved people like Pollock from surrealism to universalism. But you can't have everything.The footnotes are an education in themselves!!!"},{"Title":"The Life You Save May Be Your Own: An American Pilgrimage","review":"Inevitably, the attempt to merge four writers into one narrative that reviews their correspondence, books, essays, pronouncements, talks, and travels makes for an ambitious if uneven journey. Percy's Christian existentialism by contrast with his determinedly contrary if congenitally eccentric fellow Southerner O'Connor's keen eye and bitter comedy comes off as aloof, bookish, and not that interesting if by no fault of his own. His novels nearly all pale by comparison with her best fiction, and Elie has difficulty making some of his lesser novels even minimally engaging.Day, by contrast with Merton, herself suffers from asceticism! While the two converts and one-time near counterparts in NYC progressive political and au courant literati circles in the years between the wars (albeit at some remove from each other's direct influence and circles of friends) share roots in what we'd call the typical avant-garde movements of Modernism and experimentation that generally any bright young thing in an urban East Coast environment has wandered into over our past decades, Day comes across as markedly more inflexible, so as to anchor her pacifist and anarchist commitment to individual choice to live the Gospel as \\"fools for Christ\\" must. Merton learns by contrast to adjust whether to his moral shifts before he entered the Trappists, his infatuation with the Abbey of Gethsemani and his sudden fame after he wrote his memoir, his diagnosis by a shrink as a \\"narcissist hermit,\\" and his love affair with a nurse in the mid-1960s just as so many of his clerical colleagues were reneging on their vows and falling in love themselves with women rather than, or as well as, their calling to separate themselves from the ties that bind most of us, or used to.Elie makes the best out of the enormous secondary criticism that has accrued around O'Connor, and of the correspondence and previously censored material now available to Merton scholars. He gives instructive close readings of \\"Wise Blood\\" and \\"Everything that Rises Must Converge\\" as well as contrasting the letters to Elizabeth Hester that show her public manner as preserved for posterity vs. hints of a more combative and much less PC Jim Crow-era attitude in her letters to Maryat Lee. The hints of what happened to Robert Lowell as a result of his manic visions of God and Caroline Gordon's own descent into a rigid form of Catholic scrupulosity needed more detail, however. Percy's life fails to emerge, and his family and career shimmer only vaguely throughout. Also, we have almost no sense of what Flannery did in college or during her MFA years in Iowa City, not to mention her own NYC stint prior to her diagnosis for lupus. I wanted more connection of her own urban flourishing to tie in to Merton's previous trajectory there, and Day's own movement away from the secular boho to the Catholic boho contigent, but perhaps such tracks remain too vague for serious biographers to retrace or imagine.Well-chosen photos: young Percy strolling a German rustic trail, Day in the Bob Fitch snapshot of her sitting defiantly as two sheriffs loom to arrest her at a UFW rally, O'Connor radiant as she holds a new copy of \\"Wise Blood,\\" Merton slouching in a straw hat and kicking back against a bench on the day of his ordination. These enliven these writers, too often reduced to small book jacket photos we have seen perhaps too often.Percy appears genial if gloomy. The loss of much of his correspondence, unlike the stacks of carbons that fill up the enormous epistolary collection \\"The Habit of Being \\" for O'Connor and the letters and diaries for Merton posthumously published may explain Percy's diminished presence vs. his other two rivals for literary and spiritual audiences. Day seems not to be much interested in writing even though she dutifully published her memoir, carefully glossed as was Merton's for a more reticent era, \\"The Long Loneliness.\\" Day early on appears to have chosen a lifestyle and a manner committed to renunciation of her own early fling, her sexual adventurism (although by our standards she and Merton are the norm, more or less, for those raised less religiously at least today), and her flirtation with Marxist and leftist movements. I like Merton's advice around the time of the grandstanding Berrigan Brothers agitprop: \\"I think the best thing is to belong to a universal anti-movement underground.\\" (qtd. 396)Elie is at his best in this section, as he shows how Day separated herself from the peacenik hippie priests and those playing to the camera while \\"the whole world is watching\\" in the later 60s for revolution that made Jesus a proto-Che. Elie explains that Day took pains to empathize with the other side, always, and not to place any dogma or manifesto between her and her identification with those who may have not wanted war in Vietnam but who could not be led to sympathize with guitar-strumming hippies and angry clerics spilling napalm and blood on shredded draft documents as cameras rolled. Merton, too, as Elie takes great care in documenting, struggled to be a leader of the Catholic reformers and the progressive left from his hermitage on the Abbey grounds where civil rights organizers and leftist luminaries made their own pilgrimages to meet with him and where he attempted to stay in touch from behind the monastery walls with a world that he knew needed his advice even as he vowed to stay faithful, at terrible and necessary personal cost, to his promises to remain a loyal priest and obedient monk. Merton too shrank from the violence that inspired young people to immolate themselves as burnt offerings against the war, and soon enough he too would meet in his sudden death \\"the Christ of the burnt ones\\" to whom he ended his memoir \\"The Seven Story Mountain\\".O'Connor, being like Merton the more familiar of the four writers, comes across like him as the one you might like to meet and chat with, although unlike Fr. Louis I would fear reading about myself in her letters after the fact. Day's harder to make appealing, as her severity and devotion to seeing the Lord in the shattered ones kept her focused upon the less prosaic and less easily dramatized side of life that eschews sentimentality and exalts the utterly assured recognition of the Messiah in the poor and the crazed and deluded ones. Her choice, despite the convulsions of the Catholic Worker Movement and the fact that she could rarely find the time alone that Percy, Merton, and O'Connor needed to become speakers to the rest of us, \\"making oratory out of solitude,\\" does make her active apostolate all the more admirable.I conclude with a couple of passages. Elie compares O'Connor with Merton, Day, and Percy. Discussing an admittedly unlikely essay anthology in the tumultuous days of '69, \\"Mystery & Manners,\\" Elie describes how she combined \\"objectivity and fierce personal conviction,\\" speaking out of \\"aloneness and absoluteness,\\" and how her Southern allegiance in the North, as \\"a believer in a disbelieving literary society,\\" as \\"an artist in a church of philistines,\\" transcends loneliness or alienation. What she and her fellow writers share is what all believers today share: \\"the aloneness of the religious believer generally.\\" (426) She knows faith, the \\"substance for things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen,\\" as I paraphrase the old Baltimore Catechism (as Elie I recall did much earlier in his book).If O'Connor derived her power from her inflexibility, Elie continues, Merton by his sudden death escaped the end-time days of rage constant upendings of the 60s. His fluidity enabled him \\"to represent and call forth the aspirations of others.\\" (427)Elie finds his appeal in his \\"radical identification of himself with another\\" that evoked in his readers a similar identification. Merton was able to mature and recognize that his smarts, his charism, his desire for the spotlight could be used to turn attention from himself as the bestselling contemplative, the talkative monk, the literary talent submitting his work to censors (well, at least most of the time--the love letters he sent his nurse Margie notwithstanding, and showing the humanity that endured and made him ultimately a better monk and a kinder Christian at again what must have been enormous sacrifice and, at fifty-two, having to \\"grow up\\" even more). He had the gift of getting us to feel as if we were in his sandals, observing wryly and compassionately and righteously what he could see from beyond the walls around his hermitage, and beneath his own defenses within himself, schooled as he was in all the trends of the literati at the shrink.A year and a half before his death, Merton in the thick of the antiwar campaigns addressed his brothers outside the monastery. Reading Camus, Merton came to realize the existential predicament for the believer mattered as much as for those like Camus who could not return to believe what they had left behind. Merton reflects in the letter to his superiors that he has moved beyond the \\"answers\\" that his early years in the monastery once led him to think that he had gained.\\"Can a man make sense of his existence? Can a man honestly give his life meaning merely by adopting a certain set of explanations which pretend to tell him why the world began and where it will end, why there is evil and what is necessary for a good life? [. . . .] I have been summoned to explore a desert area of man' s heart in which explanations no longer suffice, and which one learns that only experience counts.\\" (qtd. 402)This journey into the arid regions impels the monk. He leaves the world's distractions to concentrate upon the battle within, and behind the defenses of the cloister he stands vulnerable \\"to remain open to God wholly and directly.\\" Whether God answers is not up to the monk. Merton finds God must be known, not proven. \\"To seek to solve the problem of God is to seek to see one's own eyes.\\"Elie on the last page sums up how these four writers' predicament is now that of any believer, half a century and more now since these four writers thought and argued and prayed. Elie insists that they all knew what any believer or unbeliever today knows: authority lies not on the institutional Church or a social monolith commanding conformity to the Magisterium. Elie imagines a reform of today, for assimilating or uncertain Catholics, or anyone \\"quasi-religious,\\" might be abandoning the idea of a true faith. Elie tells us now that \\"clear lines of orthodoxy are made crooked by our experiences and complicated by our lives.\\" (472)All of us look for signs. Readers, we are trained to and thrive by our own pilgrimage for meaning. Elie notes that \\"the burden of proof, indeed the burden of belief, for so long upheld by society, is now back on the believer, where it belongs.\\" Now we have the testimony of Day and O'Connor, Merton and Percy, who all had to balance their unwanted label as \\"Catholic writers\\" or intellectuals in thrall to the Vatican with their own real tensions and longings and upsets. They imagined their own afflictions and some made poems and fiction out of it, others and other times these became editorials, letters, diaries, and conversations. And, the four new evangelists all witness to us, as evangels, messengers, of the pilgrimages they too stumbled through as their narratives ended."},{"Title":"The Life You Save May Be Your Own: An American Pilgrimage","review":"While the common theme of this book is on how four very distinct writers: Thomas Merton, Dorothy Day, Walker Percy, and Flannery O'Connor, expressed their faith through their literary lives, the real beauty of the book is in seeing how the four authors dealt with issues of their faith in their own lives. At times it seems like a story contrasting Doris Day's fiery activism to Thomas Merton's move into monastic life, both in response to the passions of their own lives and the events of the world. Walker Percy and Flannery O'Connor seem like much more of a middle ground between the two extremes, living much more in the world of literature than Day and Merton.Each life makes for a fascinating reading on its own. The beaty of Paul Elie's book is that he allows each life to stand on its own, while combining them into a larger book on how to live as a religious thinker in the secular world."},{"Title":"The Life You Save May Be Your Own: An American Pilgrimage","review":"A walk through the wilderness of 20th century America with four of its most interesting Catholic writers: Dorothy Day, Flannery O'Connor, Walker Percy, and Thomas Merton. Both a biography of these postmodern pilgrims and a meditation on their work and how they were all able to be part of the same communion while each of them found God through different paths: contemplation, art, philosophy, andcharity, respectively.I had read \\"The Seven Story Mountain\\" years ago and found the young Merton, like any recent convert, to be a bit too smug and assured that he had all the answers. This book puts the arrogant young Merton into the fuller context of a life that had its share of doubts, disappointments, and struggles.Flannery O'Connor was young, smart and talented (and knew it) and looked forward to the promise of an elite cosmopolitan life. That promise was lost when she contracted Lupus and was consigned to spend the rest of her short life living on her mother's farm with a little company other than her mother, a few pen pals, and a flock of peacocks. She turned this curse into a blessing by using her isolation to go deep within herself and to explore the mysteries of faith through unforgettable, fantastic stories and eccentric characters.Dorothy Day spent her life serving the poor of New York City and fighting against militarism and violence through popular and unpopular wars. Whether or not all of her decisions were wise, she never faltered in her determination to live according to the teachings of Christ.Walker Percy was a physician and pathologist who used his pungent imagination and his firm grasp of philosophical literature to attempt to diagnose the spiritual alienation that has infected the modern world.Of course, reading this book is only the beginning. Once you have become acquainted with these four, you can get even more insight by going back and reading through their own books."},{"Title":"The Life You Save May Be Your Own: An American Pilgrimage","review":"\\"An ingeniously woven literary tapestry. In Elie's moving study, imperfection becomes the starting point of spiritual journeys and the stuff of which wisdom literature is made.\\" Lance Morrow of Time writes as the best of 20 accolades.The senior editor of Farrar, Straus, and Giroux describes, then contrasts the literary aspects of four great persons in American Literature: Dorothy Day, Thomas Merton, Flannery O'Connor, and Walker Percy. They are pictured in personal photos, first near the title page and in the center of this lengthy book. Elie begins with their common traits of dress and description from Flannery O'Connor, on crutches in a black dress, to Fr Merton looking uncomfortable in his Trappist habit...yet with vitality shining thru his eyes. Walker Percy's face frames a smile as if just another duffer at the South Country Club. Shown in her old cast-off overcoat and neck kerchief, Dorothy Day maybe a Nun or Social worker, not the radical foundress of The Catholic Worker.Chapter Two, \\"The Downward Path,\\" dramatically portrays downward paths of Thomas Merton as a youth in London, facing the loss of his father, Owen Merton. Merton's rebellion in feeling wounded, bereft, and helpless is parallel to discretions of Dorothy Day. The graphic pictures of his sordid affairs of behavior alongside his fierce sense of sinfullness, are cut-out by the Trappist superiors from his autobiography, The Seven Story Mountain.One of Paul Elie's best habits is to enhance, as embroidery for his quotations: \\"Day meanders toward God; Merton throws himself headlong at God. For her, sin is dull and dreary. For the young Merton, sin is everywhere; grace comes gradually to wipe clean his soul, as life goes on... Faith slowly becomes his pathway thru the territory.\\"Seeing their common downward pathways, I noted Elie's ability to picture their inner reconciliation with their Creator-God. Being more familiar with Merton than Dorothy Day, I discovered their personal relationships better than those of O'Connor and Percy. Yet I learned about the poignant lives of two awesomely creative writers living their faith in common struggles of endurance.\\"The creative action of the Christian's life is to prepare for his death in Christ.\\" That fits-in with O'Connor's close friend, Mary Ann Long, who died amply prepared! The Dominican nuns had shown Mary Ann the value of her life and meaning in her death. Gratefully and graciously to being a bit-part of this American Literary Heritage.

My personal thanks to Paul Elie for showing me how these four exemplary literary figures of my generation managed to live out a life of love and creativity within their constant struggle for faith. Such a universal story of people moored by the faith, but beset by the pityful human sinfulness of the institutional Church. Elie shows us how Merton, Flannery O'Connor,Dorothy Day and Walker Percy, renegades all, pursued their art and intellectual/spiritual quests in such different ways. Though I have read almost all of Merton and O'Connor and much of Day and Percy, it was with particular joy that I learned how much these figures overlapped in time and space, knew each other and were often correspondents. Elie's weaving into the text much of their correspondence gave me new perspectives."},{"Title":"The Life You Save May Be Your Own: An American Pilgrimage","review":"As someone who came of age when these four authors reached their floruit in the early sixties, and who drank water from their well even then, I enjoyed reading this book greatly. It was during this time that American Catholicism became a force in the wider culture, thereby changing itself from anti- to pro-modernist, symbolized by the election of John Kennedy, the papacy of John XXIII, and the embrace of the Jesuit evolutionist Tielhard de Chardin by most, if not all, of the heroes of this book. I do, however, have several remarks. First, if these four authors were at the core of a unified literary movement it was primarily through the ministrations of several book editors, Robert Giroux and Caroline Gordon in particular. Elie reports on their web-weaving but they could have had interesting and informative chapters to themselves. Is it an accident that Elie is not only a book editor himself, but Giroux's successor at Farrar, Straus and Giroux--yes, that Giroux? There would never have been a phenomenon named Thomas Merton without his old Columbia buddy Giroux. As for Caroline Gordon, who knew Dorothy Day in her wild bohemian days, appreciated O'Connor, and coached Percy (badly), she comes across less well: as in fact a busy body who seemed to flaunt her Catholicism in the same way Claire Booth Luce did. Second, the gap between the clerical culture of the Catholic church and its progressive wing grew wider and wider in the late sixties. This fact should have been better drawn if the story Elie tells is to make sense in its context. This is because these four figures acquired lasting fame among Catholics because, along with Tielhard, they became retrospective (and in some ways miscast) heroes of the lost battle against the clerical counter-revolution whose tragic consequences are there for all to see. Elie's book springs from this construction of the significance of his four heroes. It is being read, I presume, by people to whom, like myself, this matters. This fact should not go unnoticed. Third, everyone has their limitations, and Elie's strengths as a literary man are inseparable from his weaknesses in reporting on philosophical issues. What makes Catholicism as a culture unique is that its theology is, or was, built on a highly developed philosophical foundation. Catholics can lose their faith without losing its distinctive form of reason. Here we encounter a gender gap. Day went admirably to work with the poor, rolling up her sleeves. She got along with clerics because in all abstract matters she deferred to authority without thinking much about it. O'Connor waxed philosophical only when she encountered Teilhard in the early sixties, when she had reluctantly to confront the civil rights movement and (far less successfully) her own racism. But Merton, like Augustine, had a philosophical conversion before he had a religious one. Elie duly reports it as having something to do with Etienne Gilson and Jacques Maritain, but he does so in a sketchy and garbled way. The same is even more true of Percy. For someone who can guide you through the philosophical issues, and their political implications, I recommend Garry Wills. Finally, the context in which this Catholic counter-culture emerged was highly colored by the threat of atomic annihilation. It is the fact that secular modernity had brought the world to this pass (and to the Holocaust) that made it plausible for intelligent people to think about how to bring the virtues of pre-modernity into the modern world. As one who has tried to teach the Cold War to students who were born after the collapse of the Soviet Union, I can say: you had to have been there to see how it could turn you into an existentialist. This context, too, could have been sketched better. All and all, though, a book that I am grateful to its author for writing."},{"Title":"The Life You Save May Be Your Own: An American Pilgrimage","review":"I bought this book because I am a devotee of Flannery O'Connor, and I have read and been enchanted by both Merton's and Day's autobiographies. The author's approach to the lives of these four Catholic writers is unique and seems at first to be somewhat of a stretch. The connections between most of them are tenuous at best - Merton and Day had a long-running correspondence, but O'Connor only was only ever in direct contact with Percy, for instance. However, the connections they made during their lives, though interesting, are not really the point of this book. What the four really had in common was their writing, religion, and their approach to similar themes during an overlapping era, as well as the enduring influences that they had on each other and on other writers (the author mentions John Kennedy Toole, etc.).All four sought to define through their work the roll that religion plays in the modern world and in their own lives, and this book gives a particularly insightful and well analyzed overview of how each of them went about this all-important task. The author has clearly done a great deal of research. The contemporary commentary he includes about each author is fascinating.This book was particularly interesting to me because I am quite familiar with most of Flannery O'Connor's work, and it was wonderful to finally be able to connect her stories to her life and to the time and place she was writing from.I highly recommend this to all searchers, and to those interested in that which is mysterious in life and religion. This book should be read by all people interested in Catholicism in America, religion in the modern work, and in literature or American History in general."},{"Title":"The Life You Save May Be Your Own: An American Pilgrimage","review":"Many people have felt the need to ask the very basic questions of their existence; as in, 'Why are we here?' or 'What is our purpose?'. Lives can be seen as pilgrimages that are made in an effort to find answers to these questions, to fulfill something that is missing in one's life. The human pursuit of knowledge is a pilgrimage, according to Paul Elie, the author of \\"The Life You Save May Be Your Own\\". The book is a pilgrimage in itself, to connect four Catholic writers who seem to have little in common other than their faith.Paul Elie begins by tracing briefly over the youths of these four writers; Doris Day, Thomas Merton, Walker Percy, and Flannery O'Connor. He details their shortcomings and their conversion to Catholicism (except for O'Connor who was a Catholic born and bred). Each author tries to figure out what their purpose in life is, and what role their faith plays in that calling. Doris Day is the founder of the Catholic Worker, a newsletter, and organization, that strived to fight poverty and advance the true purposes of Christian love. Thomas Merton feels a calling to the priesthood and settles on a life as a hermit at a monastery in Kentucky. Walker Percy attends medical school, but after suffering from tuberculosis, reconfigures himself as a writer (even if it takes him the rest of his life to figure out just what or how to write). Flannery O'Connor, striken with Lupus, must resign herself to a life of illness, searching and traveling almost solely through her writing.Over the years, these four writers formed connections with one another - either through common friends, letters, or personal meetings. They may have agreed or disagreed with each other, but they recognized the efforts that each were making in the name of their faith. Paul Elie has done an excellent job in tracing the trials and tribulations that each author experienced, without ever letting his narrative bogged down. And one does not have to have read every piece of writing by these authors; Elie's exegesis of their works is sufficient, and perhaps a prompter to read (or re-read) some of these profound works that demonstrate how one's faith can be pursued in every aspect of one's life."},{"Title":"The Life You Save May Be Your Own: An American Pilgrimage","review":"An excellent read, the livesof Merton,Day,Percy and O Connor beautifully melded and yet distinct.

I would highly recommend this book to anyone on a spiritual journey."},{"Title":"The Life You Save May Be Your Own: An American Pilgrimage","review":"This book combines biographical sketches of four Catholic writers (Day, Merton, O'Connor and Percy) with literary criticism of their writings. Paul Elie, the author, does this from the perspective of a Catholic analyzing the lives and writings of four other Catholic writers whom he respected and admired.Every reader will take away their own impressions. Mine are these.Re: Dorothy Day - I would not have liked her as a person. I sense that she was cold and aloof as well as strident and uncompromising. On the other hand, she is eminently admirable and I admired the way she combined heroic social action with a profound interior spiritual life.Re: Thomas Merton - I see him now as an escapist par excellence. He sought to escape the world by going to Gethsemani; then, he sought to escape Gethsemani; then he sought to escape Western monasticism. A perpetually unhappy and unsatisfied man, and at the same time one who constantly strove to be \\"connected\\" and \\"relevant\\" to all the 'movers and shakers' of his time. An unlikeable man, but one of deep faith and a genuine man of letters.Re: Flannery O'Connor - A woman of dazzling honesty, a loner at heart, humble, yet proud, too. By far, the most interesting of the four. Both as a writer and as a person, she was the most profound. Plus, an admirable woman in every regard.Re: Walker Percy - In terms of personality, the bourbon-loving Percy was the most approachable by far. An ordinary man and an ordinary 'believer,' but with a huge talent for fiction. I liked him and like his writings the best.To his credit, I give Paul Elie high marks for even-handedness in this long interpretative and evaluative essay. He is obviously fond, and rightly so, of all four. It is a fair and full book, and best of all, it motivates readers such as myself to read more ( and more intelligently) of the fine writings of these four authors."},{"Title":"The Life You Save May Be Your Own: An American Pilgrimage","review":"The author sets a high bar and then glides over it.In a word, one of the best books I've ever read."},{"Title":"The Life You Save May Be Your Own: An American Pilgrimage","review":"This attempt to link Day, Merton, O'Connor, and Percy doesn't work. While it's true they were Catholic writers whose lives overlapped to some degree and who read each other's work to some extent, it's also true that their lives were extremely different and that they rarely had contact with one another--a few meetings, some small bits of correspondence.Also, the Publisher's Weekly reviewer is incorrect: the book is ponderous, and the prose is the very definition of workmanlike. The author was evidently attempting a self-consciously literary style--lofty, philosophical--alas for his readers. The writing reaches a particular crescendo of blandness in the pages when these Catholic writers come to the end of their lives. In fact, I couldn't quite make out how Merton had died from the account here and had to look it up on Wikipedia.Perhaps because of the detached prose style, I felt that the author had little if any affinity for either the writers or their writings. The New Yorker says O'Connor is his favorite, but Day comes off best in the book, as the author sympathizes with the Catholic Worker movement and with Day's pacifism. He also seems to have found value in Wise Blood and the Moviegoer.In general I wondered if the author's own pilgrimage in writing this book had left him fatigued and simply glad to be finished with it. I know that's how I felt by the end.On the positive side, I did find some of the details of these writers' early lives fascinating. If you have not read such details in other biographies or autobiographical writings, you might find it worthwhile to check out the first half of this book."},{"Title":"The Life You Save May Be Your Own: An American Pilgrimage","review":"The author knows his subjects (Merton, OConnor, Day, Walker) well, displaying a deep knowledge of each person, their traits and idiosyncrasies. He seems to like his subjects and enjoys writing about them. I thoroughly enjoyed this immence yet readable book."},{"Title":"The Life You Save May Be Your Own: An American Pilgrimage","review":"I don't believe I have ever read a book in which the author worked so hard to distance himself from his subject matter. Based on his writing, I picture Mr. Elie as exactly the sort of secularized &quot;Big Intellectual&quot; that all four of the people he writes about would have regarded with pity. Why would someone so convinced that Catholic orthodoxy is dead, and that no modern person takes the teachings of the Baltimore Catechism seriously, write about these four people, of ALL the people in the world to write about? I never cease to marvel at how crabbed and parochial the world of the east coast writer really is. Was there no one involved in the editorial process who might have pointed out to Mr. Elie that the Baltimore Catechism is alive and well, and that the Catholic faith remains as credible for millions today as it was to Merton, O'Connor et al.? All I can figure is that Elie is trying to exorcize the ghost of a parochial school education. In that case, methinks the gentleman doth protest too much."},{"Title":"The Life You Save May Be Your Own: An American Pilgrimage","review":"I stumbled upon an advance reader's copy of this work in a used bookshop--I had never heard of the book's author, an editor at FSG, but I was curious to find out how he would weave together the stories of his four subjects: Dorothy Day, Thomas Merton, Flannery O'Connor, and Walker Percy. At first glance, they seemed to have little in common apart from their religion.As Elie shows in this entertaining and informative book, these writers were all highly aware of each other, and would meet on their separate \\"pilgrimages\\" toward authentic spirituality in increasingly secular times. \\"The School of the Holy Ghost\\" (as this quartet was once called) was not a school at all, as the Imagists or the Beats were; however, Elie shows, they felt a profound kinship, and one of the most fascinating aspects of the book is Elie's depiction of how they reached out to each other, through fan letters, postcards, reviews, publishing each other's work, and not-always-successful meetings (Merton and Percy had little to say to one another as they sipped bourbon on the porch of Merton's hermitage in Kentucky.)Above all, what brought these Catholic believers together was a love of literature, and Elie's book happily overflows with this same virtue. Whether discussing Day and Merton's dispute over Vietnam draft card burning, or the racism of O'Connor's letters, Elie writes elegant and opinionated prose. He shows how hard these people had to struggle to find a path for themselves, and how they came to see struggle as an inherent quality of faith. His readings of O'Connor and Percy's fiction are astute, and he productively contrasts Day's activism with Merton's withdrawal into solitude. Elie's use of letters--especially O'Connor's--brings out the voices of the principals, and at the end of the book, you feel that you know them personally. I would recommend this superb synthesis to anyone interested in the intersection of faith and literature."},{"Title":"The Life You Save May Be Your Own: An American Pilgrimage","review":"The title of Paul Elie's book THE LIFE YOU SAVE MAY BE YOUR OWN is borrowed from a short story title of Flannery O'Connor, one of the four writers discussed in his book. The other three are Thomas Merton, Dorothy Day, and Walker Percy. The focus of Elie's work is not as much biographical as it is literary. He looks at the two things that connect these four great people: faith and writing, and shows how both work together to produce the great literary output of each author. Elie sees these four people as being part of an informal \\"Catholic\\" school of writers. Elie looks at an analyzes many of the writings of each author, and presents it in a manner that will appeal to the scholar and lay reader as well. Though the book has biographical information, and is arranged in a chronological manner, biographical and historical details are only provided where absolutely necessary to discuss the literary works of Day, Merton, O'Connor, and Percy.There has been a temptation to see Merton and Day as larger than life, almost saintly figures, Percy and O'Connor as eccentric southerners who happen to be Catholic, and in the case of O'Connor, a Catholic writer trying to impose blatant symbols of faith in all of her writings. Elie certainly admires all four, but shows them from a human point of view. In doing so, he debunks many of the myths surrounding these four figures. From a spiritual point of view, they are just as human as we are, and it is because of their very human struggles that their literary output is possible.Elie breaks important ground by looking at these four great Catholic figures as writers, and his work will undoubtedly set the stage for further study of the literary connections of Merton, Day, O'Connor, and Percy. His book includes copious endnotes that will enable a person to easily find works by and about these four authors. In most chapters Elie discusses each of the four, but he uses breaks after sections about each author which makes reading easier. Elie himself is a book editor and he uses his skills as an editor to write a concise work. The length of the book demonstrates this alone. The text without endnotes is approximately 475 pages. There are certainly individual works about Merton, O'Connor, and Day equal or greater in length than Elie's work, but hardly say as much. I cannot say for certain about Percy since I am not familiar with scholarly or biographical works about him.This book will more than likely be of interest to Catholic readers, but anyone who wishes to study the role of faith in Day, Merton, O'Connor, and Percy, will find this book a great read an a valuable resource."},{"Title":"The Life You Save May Be Your Own: An American Pilgrimage","review":"If you are interested in any one of the four authors represented here (Day, Merton, O'Connor, Percy) you will find the context and comparisons that Elie makes extremely illuminating. It is a challenging task to interweave four biographies in a way that is interesting and mutually enriching. Elie does it. He writes well and his comparisons of these four along with other important influences are always clear and helpful. Very well done piece of work."},{"Title":"The Life You Save May Be Your Own: An American Pilgrimage","review":"This book is undeniably a classic of literary criticism and biography. Paul Elie gets it just right--he takes the spiritual concerns and the religiosity of the four authors very seriously while demonstrating a careful concern for the complexities and ambiguities of their faith. And he has a real knack for analyzing how all of this informs and undergirds their writings in ways that aren't necessarily straightforward and obvious. Furthermore, he accomplishes all of this in clear, jargon-free prose that is almost literary in its own right.Certainly other biographies and autobiographies of Dorothy Day, Thomas Merton, Flannery O'Connor, and Walker Percy are out there (sorry, Barthes, \\"the author\\" is not dead), but \\"The Life You Save\\" accomplishes something a little different. Elie weaves in and out of their different lives and in so doing both suggests commonalities and similarities shared by them (the chapter titles are usually a reliable clue to these) as well as differences and contrasts that mutually highlight their characteristic particularities. Developing along these lines, later as the book progresses and our foursome become aware of each other Elie discusses their communications with each other and impressions of each other, which sheds invaluable light on all four of them and their concerns.All of this could easily fly out of hand, especially in so large and substantial a book, but Elie holds it together and keeps the story/stories flowing along together, using the metaphor of the \\"pilgrimage\\" on multiple levels as a sort of common theme smoothing out his narrative while adding meaning and significance to it. At the end, appropriately enough, the image of the pilgrimage symbolizes his own involvement with the four authors and the writing of this book itself.I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in the relation of literature, religion, and social history. If you take the spiritual dimension of literature seriously while knowing full well that literature is more than just a disguised form of preaching, this book will definitely be right up your alley."},{"Title":"The Life You Save May Be Your Own: An American Pilgrimage","review":"Paul Elie's combined biographies of Merton, Day, Percy, and O'Connor has many virtues, which other reviewers have mentioned and elaborated upon. No doubt the convergence of the lives of these four gifted writers is a fascinating story, and Elie's footnotes in the back are very detailed and helpful. The main problem I have with this book is that Elie's Catholicism is so attenuated that it can hardly grasp much of what these writers were trying to do with their lives and with their work. On the last page of his book, Elie states plainly his position that \\"there is no one true faith\\", true for all people, all times. That's a proposition that I think his four subjects would take issue with, and sharply. As O'Connor famously said of the Blessed Sacrament, \\"If it's a symbol, well the hell with it.\\" Elie also has a fairly superficial understanding of what a pilgrimage is in traditional Catholic culture and theology. He reduces it to a journey undertaken to see something with one's own eyes, something akin to a story lived out. Well, sure, but of the deeper sense of that word--one central certainly to Percy--Elie has no idea. The \\"homo viator\\" is essentially a pilgrim, a wayfarer, and is central to Percy's idea of the self, and thus to all his work. Alas, Elie's faith--at least as expressed in this book--is nothing like the faith of the writers he finds so fascinating. Merton, Day, Percy, and O'Connor knew their faith allowed them to assent to something that transcended their reason, that allowed them to partake of mysteries that are not \\"projected\\" by their desires, but are the source and goal of all natural human desires in the first place. Elie's interesting but flawed work shows that heterodox Catholicism is hardly up to the task of really appreciating these gifted writers. Unfortunately, that is the least of its problems."},{"Title":"The Life You Save May Be Your Own: An American Pilgrimage","review":"I had read a lot of Flannery O'Connor, but didn't know as much about Merton, Dorothy Day, or Walker Percy. Elie's assessment of O'Connor's writing is not only accurate, but insightful. He is a very gifted theologian, literary critic, and biographer.In reading him, I gained several new insights into O'Connor's stories and how her life and Catholicism influenced them. Some of his images (for instance, describing Mrs. Turpin in &quot;Revelation&quot; as a &quot;hillbilly Thomist&quot;) were absolutely delightful and right on target. Through Walker Percy and Flannery O'Connor, he also paints a wonderful picture of the strange and wonderful world of Southern Catholics.What is most impressive about this book, however, is how he weaves the lives, writing and faith journeys of four very different persons together, showing that indeed, grace perfects nature, even when the &quot;nature&quot; is quite different from one personality to another. They were all clearly influenced by the same threads of Catholic theology and spirituality, but reflected it back to us in very different ways.This book was interesting to me because of its literary and theological themes. But even more, it was spiritual reading. Again and again I stoped reading and compared their spiritual journeys to my own. Reading Elie's book has deepened my faith and given me hope that despite my own doubts and the &quot;bumps in the road&quot; on my spiritual journey, I might still one day hope to achieve some measure of holiness. What's more, I highlighted many passages which will surely be fodder for some future preaching!Fr. Charles Bouchard, OP"},{"Title":"The Life You Save May Be Your Own: An American Pilgrimage","review":"Paul Elie ably portrays the lives of four American saints in The Life You Save May Be Your Own. Elie follows the lives of Trappist monk Thomas Merton, Southern outcast Flannery O'Connor, literary gentleman Walker Percy, and Christian radical Dorothy Day. Rather than strict biography, Elie follows each writer's life as a pilgrimage, seeing the progression of the country's history and American Catholicism along the details of their lives.For a book weighing in at 560 hefty pages, Elie provides a surprisingly quick read. He has an excellent ability to feel with each of his subject's quite different personalities. Elie also examines the strength and limitations of Catholics in America, the heart of a writer, and different ways to express one's faith in art and in life. Not only a read for critics or for Catholics, this is a wonderful bedtime book for anyone who wants to combine their love for God, for literature, and for the poor and outcasts of our world today."},{"Title":"The Life You Save May Be Your Own: An American Pilgrimage","review":"THE LIFE YOU SAVE MAY BE YOUR OWN (an American Pilgrimage)Peter ElieThis sounds merely like a book that mingles biographies of four Catholic writers. As the subtitle tells, it is an American Pilgrimage and lives like these could only be found in America. The book is a journey to the shrines of life and wisdom found in these four and through their writing. Flannery O'Connor, Walker Percy, Dorothy Day and Thomas Merton: Four Americans, Three converts, Two Southerners, one Priest, all dedicated to the proposition that each of us is capable of Love. A cripple and a candidate for sainthood, an ascetic and an archetypal gentleman. A motlier crew would be hard to find. Yet the reward is ours. When you realize the pain and passion involved in their lives and writing, you can only ask - what have I done for love? The book is a spiritual history of America from the late 40's through the 70's based on little people whose lives become large enough to model real Faith. We need to remeet such writers."},{"Title":"The Life You Save May Be Your Own: An American Pilgrimage","review":"This book is a good book. Paul Elie is a very fine writer, particularly fine at plot, which is ironic and rather odd since he is writing a sort of quadruple literary biography in which the life stages of his protagonists do not align chronologically (e.g., Dorothy Day, 1897-1980; Flannery O'Connor, 1925-64). But he plots the book so that we are reading about four independent authors in relation to each other. Their pilgrimages have similar stages, scattered throughout the years, even as they deal with the same world issues simultaneously: World War II, the Cold War, race relations, etc. We have a sense of four different stories deeply akin, which seems to be the story Paul Elie wanted to tell. Elie is also good at stylistic analysis. Sometimes he will quote from a letter or an essay and, in a few impressionistic words, identify how form and content perfectly fuse. This moved me at several points in the book.All this is interesting, but I find myself more interested in my dissatisfactions with the book, which other readers may actually see as positive characteristics, so I'll record them and you can be the judge.1) This book does not seem to me to be a Catholic or Christian book. It is a profoundly religious book, though. Elie in his prologue suggests that he will be reading his four subjects through the critical lens of Harold Bloom-the four creatively misread medieval European Catholicism into their new context. He also introduces them against the historical background of William James and Henry Adams rather than a Catholic background. As I understand Bloom, Bloom insists that misreading is inevitable; at any case, I wonder if reading Catholic works through Bloom's lens, or any lens other than Catholicism, might sentence biography or criticism of these authors to misreading from the beginning. What I fear is that at least some of these four writers might find Elie's conclusion reductive: \\"They saw religious experience out before them. They read their way toward it. They believed it. They lived it. They made it their own. With us in mind, they put it in writing.\\" It is simply a case of putting \\"religious experience\\" (and Bloom's misprision, and William James's naturalism, and postmodern skeptical self-finding) as the transcendent element in the story, instead of the Catholic church in whatever manifestation these authors encountered it. I think Elie is leaving these trails for people who are not Catholics to enter his work anyway, and that's admirable to a point, but, as Flannery O'Connor would say, Catholicism is either true or it isn't, and there is a fundamental inaccessibility within these works which I think Elie might be sacrificing. In short, the trails Elie leaves don't lead to Catholicism, but to a generic \\"religious experience.\\"2) The book is as fiercely individualistic as any book about Catholics can ever be. The title says so: The Life You Save May Be Your Own. The dominant motif, according the preface, is pilgrimage, chiefly and most fundamentally individual. As such, with the exception of correspondence, the book gives us very little idea about how these authors related to other people and existed within the context of community. Only cursory attention is given to family and extra-literary friends during each author's productive period. This is alright, especially for the Trappist monk of the bunch, but I am sitting on my loveseat trying to apply these ideas and practices to my life and thinking, \\"But I'm married.\\" And I'm a son, a brother, a co-worker, etc. These four people were rather solitary people, and created themselves through literature (theirs and others---one of Elie's main points), so perhaps we who live deeply in community might just want to find other examples to misread creatively.3) The book is about pilgrimage, which sounds either teleological or \\"the joy's in the journey.\\" You either go on pilgrimage because you want to get somewhere or because you like the company and the situation of the trip itself. But the way the book is written (form vs. content, in this case) clashes with the pilgrimage motif. The book is a series of little sections (less than a page, one page, several pages), each being a little unity, a little vignette to itself. And Elie often closes these vignettes with a pungent quote from the author in question, the sort of burst of insight that you might find at the end of something. Rather than feeling as if I was going somewhere, or that I was on a meandering but pleasant journey, I as a reader felt as if I was perpetually arriving. Generally, each little vignette was a crisis that ended with at least a provisional resolution. I actually liked this sensation (each moment in your life is the end of one story), but it did render the book's pilgrimage to Elie's conclusion rather anticlimactic."},{"Title":"The Life You Save May Be Your Own: An American Pilgrimage","review":"Paul Elie's book is a sort of multiple biography of four well-known American writers (Flannery O'Connor, Walker Percy, Thomas Merton, and Dorothy Day), as well as a social and intellectual history of 20th century American Catholicism. This is a very ambitious book, but Elie pulls it off with great style. The strongest parts of the book are about O'Connor and Percy; maybe this is because they were the more accomplished writers. Elie makes O'Connor come alive again; we see the maidenishly lovable and strong-willed young author as she is struck down by illness and condemned to a confinement in her rural backwater. Instead of giving into despair she turns to her faith and casts a compassionate but unblinking eye to the human \\"grotesques\\" of the South: they come to unforgettable life in \\"Wise Blood\\" and \\"A Good Man is Hard to Find\\". She becomes interested in the powerful, consoling theology of Pierre Teilhard de Chardin, who taught that \\"everything that rises must converge.\\" She dies of lupus at age 39.Walker Percy also had to battle with despair. Both his father and grandfather committed suicide. The Percys were an aristocratic Southern family with a strong tradition of stoicism; that is, the nobility of suffering as the sole consolation. Percy eventually came to see that wasn't enough. In his first novel, \\"The Moviegoer\\", he examined \\"the greatest despair: that it does not know that it is despair.\\" And in his best novel (in my opinion)The Thanatos Syndrome: A Novelhe explores the death wish of western civilization and the necessary faith-based cure.Elie's accounts of the lives of Merton and Day are also very interesting, but those authors are perhaps not quite as prominent as they used to be. Day is better known for her many good works than her prosaic writing. And the monasticism of Merton seems to be a little esoteric and removed from quotidian, everyday life as it is lived by most of us. But they are still worthwhile as studies of what it means to take religion seriously in your life; to try to see the ultimate, luminous transcendental reality above and beyond the immediately visible one.

Its purpose helps the reader today to better understand any psalm- interaction with other ancient near eastern literature, when relevant- textual notes on the Hebrew, with his own careful translation. He notes when the text is confusing, for example, but walks the reader through the issues- a good section called \\"Comment,\\" in which Craigie covers the important points, theology, and usage of the psalm- and a concluding section called \\"Explanation\\" that connects the psalm to New Testament or Christian theology, to present-day concerns of Christians. He often says something helpful and edifying.I recommend the volume highly. Even without knowledge of Hebrew, the reader will benefit from it. And for those with Hebrew and some background in the ancient near east (and in the historiography of this literature), it is probably the best, more recent work available."},{"Title":"Word Biblical Commentary, Vol. 19: Psalms 1-50","review":"Peter Craigie was to write the entire commentary on Psalms. His untimely death left this legacy of inspiring, intelligent, faithful survey work of Psalms 1-50 in a commentary series that occassionally gives up scholarship for conservative bias.This is a superb survey of Psalms interpretation, and his own reflection and hermeneutic is inspiring in the least. Use it above even the likes of Casemann, Mays, and Bruegemann.Joseph A. Weaks"},{"Title":"Word Biblical Commentary, Vol. 19: Psalms 1-50","review":"The Word commentaries on Psalms proceed upon the grossly aberrant belief that meter (or rhythm as it prefers) is one of the primary forms of Hebrew poetry. Instead, as Berlin has observed (The Dynamics of Biblical Parallelism), Biblical poetry lacks meter as far as we understand it. The only ancient Semitic poetic text that uses meter throughout is the Babylonian Theodicy (i.e., not Hebrew). Pardee declared that Ugaritic, which is extremely similar to Biblical Hebrew, has no meter at all. In an attempt to salvage some kind of meter from Biblical poetry, Watson (Classical Hebrew Poetry), suggests, very cautiously, that just maybe, though there is no regularity, there may sometimes be rythmn according to stress/accentuation. And, perhaps, there may be brief moments were something like a \\"qinah\\" exists or where stress, intonation, and other sound patterns form a kind of meter, but this is an exception that proves the rule. Meter is a classical Greek form of poetry, alien to ancient Hebrew, which the Word commentaries force the poetry into almost as if with a straight-jacket. Every translation of a psalm is treated to this violence, with its supposed meter relayed at the side. In the Introduction, the author adds a disclaimer that \\"the approach to meter in Hebrew poetry which has been adopted in this volume may seem to some to be rather old-fashioned,\\" which I think it not strong enough of an admission! This is a blatant reliance upon scholarship centuries old, which understood close to nothing about historical grammar, had little to no truly ancient texts or comparative ancient near eastern examples, and was based on ideas and assumptions that were completely foreign to the language being studied. At least he admits that there is \\"no evidence that a theory or system of meter was ever articulated in ancient Israel,\\" which begs the question why, then, such a theory or system would be applied to their texts!And to further add insult to injury, the Word commentaries on the psalms proceed upon Lowth's tired and unhelpful categories of Hebrew poetry (synonymous, antithetical, and synthetic), which even Kugel admitted were vacuous, though he didn't do much better with his \\"line 2 says something more than line 1 did\\" (or as he called it \\"A and what's more B\\"). The declaration that \\"Lowth's system has been modified and corrected in a number of details, but his basic insights remain unchanged,\\" is horrendously out-of-date and stupefyingly over-simplified to the point of rendering any poetic analysis of the psalms in these commentaries virtually pointless.Despite these complete and utter failures, however, there is good that can be gleamed from them. What I like most is how they comment on and summarize other notable commentaries and articles so that one gets a good sense of the field of study and its ideas without having to do all the research oneself. Such work with secondary sources is the strength of these commentaries. I imagine they would be more than what a pastor needs to preach to a congregation, but those wishing for something more useful for research and investigation in the original languages and with primary texts should go elsewhere. This is a helpful grocery list of items that can make a tasty delicacy, but not the recipe for it.Unfortunately, there are not very many good commentaries available for the book of Psalms. Dahood is wrong just as often as he is right (if not more so) and the old ICC commentaries only magnify the atrocities of the WBC. Until something better comes along, those looking for good commentaries on the psalms will find Hossfeld and Zenger's Hermeneia volumes far more satisfying."},{"Title":"Word Biblical Commentary, Vol. 19: Psalms 1-50","review":"After searching through a few commentaries on the Psalms, it was refreshing to view a commmentary that shared all of the scholarly comments on form, structure, word studies, historical and religious context of the Psalms AND comments on how the Psalms often point to Jesus the Christ. Craigie includes explanations of how particular psalms reference messianic prophecies fulfilled in Christ. He references New Testament quotes and references that interpret the psalms as fulfilled in Christ. Craigie demonstrates evangelical, mature faith in Jesus Christ along with seasoned and researched scholarship on the psalms. For Psalms 1-50, this commentary fulfills the substance needed for pastors, seminary students, academics and students of the Bible seeking understanding and insights.The structure and organization of the book is user-friendly and conducive to finding what you are seeking."},{"Title":"Short Eyes: A Play (Mermaid Dramabook Series)","review":"Miguel Pinero's play &quot;Short Eyes&quot; opened as part of the New York Shakespeare Festival in 1975. This play deals with life in prison; its flavor of authenticity probably comes from the fact that the author himself had spent time in prison.&quot;Short Eyes&quot; involves a multiethnic group of inmates whose lives are affected by the incarceration of a mild-mannered white man charged with a particularly shocking crime. Pinero creates a fascinating portrayal of a racially fractured subculture in which whites are the minority. His prison is populated with many memorable characters: the African-American inmate El Raheem, whose &quot;Black Muslim&quot;-inspired dialogue is marked by quick wordplay and messianic fury; Longshoe, the tough white inmate; Cupcakes, the pretty-boy who is the object of another inmate's lust, and more.Pinero's claustrophobic world of Blacks, Puerto Ricans, and whites could be seen as a frightening microcosm of the larger American society: a world of destructive compulsions and violence. Pinero's dialogue is often penetrating and shocking; his characters are alive with raw pain and rage. &quot;Short Eyes&quot; may be too much for some readers to handle, but those with a serious interest in American drama or Puerto Rican literature, this is a remarkable work of art."},{"Title":"Short Eyes: A Play (Mermaid Dramabook Series)","review":"An insider's view of life in the notorious Tombs on Rikers Island, where New York City used to house prisoners awaiting trial. Pinero was an important poet and playright, and co-founder of The Nuyorican Poet's Cafe. This drama tells the story of a middle class white man arrested for child molestion, a &quot;short eyes&quot; in prison slang. These prisoners are held in special contempt by the rest of prison society, and this man is a particularly easy target. Pinero has the voice of authority, making this a rare prison drama with the ring of truth. The play was was also made into a brilliant movie."},{"Title":"Short Eyes: A Play (Mermaid Dramabook Series)","review":"The play \\"Short Eyes\\" is a powerfully told truth about prison life. The setting takes place in the day room of a House of Detention. The cast of actors are mostly made up of Blacks, Puerto Ricans and a few Whites. They are young convicts. They exchange taunts, fighting &amp; insults just to keep their sanity intact, and some sense of a community. An accused child molester is brought into the cellblock. He is called a degenerate by a guard. A child molester (or in prison slang a \\"short eyes\\") is considered the most despicable of people. Mr. Pinero, while serving a five year sentence for armed robbery in Sing Sing Prison, started writing the play. Marvin Felix Camillo read some of Miguel's work and asked him to sign up in his drama workshop in the prison. This was a workshop for convicts interested in writing and acting. Miguel was encouraged to write plays. The drama work shop evolved into an acting company called The Family. Joseph Papp produced the play \\"Short Eyes\\" at the Lincoln Center in New York City. Short Eyes won the best American play of 1973 &amp; 74 by the New York drama critics circle award. Miguel Pinero's play \\"Short Eyes\\" is straight on! It doesn't pull any punches. It holds back absolutely nothing on life in jail."},{"Title":"Short Eyes: A Play (Mermaid Dramabook Series)","review":"This was a real dark, nasty play that speaks directly to the ghetto experience. I wanted to teach it to a high school class, but my boss said no way - far too violent, too much bad language and prison homosex. The author was a legitimate convict himself - a small-time thief and drug fiend who died of AIDS (I think) at the age of 35-40. This play was something that he started in a prison writing class, and while he may have been a hoodlum, he could really write. This is very potent, intense stuff all the way thru - it is a harrowing journey, but one worth taking. Pinero had an excellent sense of drama and tension, and this play is brimming with both.The story focuses on a group of toughs in a New York State penitentiary. Most of them are Black, a couple are Hispanic, and one is an Irish-American. One of them is an attractive young man who keeps getting hit on by a predatory gay convict. Another has adopted a half-baked radical philosophy. Into this mix comes Clark, a quiet, seemingly respectable upper middle-class white man, who has no business being there except that he is a \\"short eyes\\" - a child molester. The tension grows as it becomes clear that some of the other inmates want to kill him or at least turn his life into a hell. At one point, Clark confesses in great detail to another inmate - he is a hardcore, serial child molester and Pinero sticks the knife in and turns it as he describes the little girls falling for Clark and thinking of him as a boyfriend or something.I have seen several movies or plays that depict prison life, but this one is the best. It is dark and brutal, but also totally believable."},{"Title":"Short Eyes: A Play (Mermaid Dramabook Series)","review":"Powerful, Extremely easy to read. I wish I could see it done as a play."},{"Title":"Short Eyes: A Play (Mermaid Dramabook Series)","review":"This play captures the intense racial and ethnic survival networks that develop in a prison. Men must join with other men of the same race or ethnicity or risk being victimized. Blacks bond with Blacks, white with whites, Latinos with Latinos. Conflict, competition, and smoldering violence characterize the relationship between these groups. Pinero captures this prison sub-culture very well in his play Short Eyes.Yet within each group are individual characters with their own motives and desires and manipulations. Again Pinero captures these characters very well, especially the White gang leader, Longshoe, and the Black Muslim gang leader.Into this mix comes a white fellow, who is initially recruited by the white gang until it is revealed that he is charged with child molestation, a crime called 'short eyes' by prisoners. This man is brutally tortured and killed in the jail setting, only to find out later that he was misidentified. Yet he demonstrates clearly what happens to the scapegoat, the outsider, even in a world of outsiders.The language is rough and realistic. The tension between prisoners remains taunt, never letting up, and thus revealing the terrible existance that life behind bars presents.In 1975 this play was highly controversial with its display of racial tension, homosexuality, and murder within a prison. However such TV shows as OZ have introduced US audiences to the racial dynamics and the sexual relationships behind bars. Thus this play was ground-breaking in its time, even though today's audiences may not find it as shocking as viewers/readers in the 1970s.It is still highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Slip and Fall Handbook","review":"I am an attorney in Southern California and retained Dr. Rosen for a case.

The teacher will find the book helpful as a source of authoritative pageant suggestions. The homemaker will enjoy new ideas for home fun, decorations and foods... Children will enjoy the Christmas tales as retold from these pages.\\" (Pg. 7)He observes, \\"The roots of Christmas observance, however, go deeply into the folklore of the Druids, Scandinavians, Romans, and Egyptians. What we may read of Christmas in ancient days finds its full flower in the past and present customs of our ancestral homes in Europe. There is not an American home that does not color its Christmas with some European observances---gift-giving, trees, greenery, food, games, or ritual.\\" (Pg. 10)He notes, \\"It was a much changed St. Nicholas which the Dutch settlers brought to the United States... The lean ascetic is now a fat, jolly old fellow, more humanist than saint. Laying aside his canonical robes, his miter, and his pastoral staff, he has chosen an ermine-trimmed red cap and suit. He had traded his old gray mare for reindeer and sleigh.\\" (Pg. 37)He points out, \\"Red and green are the conventional colors of Christmas, no doubt because of the green Holly with its red berries, but there is no historical or legendary reason for these two colors. White is really the true Christmas color if we are to observe the dictates of the church.\\" (Pg. 84) Later, he adds, \\"In ancient Britain [mistletoe] was the sacred plant of the Druids... The church never sanctioned the use of Mistletoe in the decoration of a religious ediface because of its heathen origin.\\" (Pg. 149-151)Although 75 years old, much of the historical information presented in this book is \\"timeless,\\" and still of considerable interest to a modern reader."},{"Title":"Natural Soda Ash - Occurrences, process and use","review":"I read this last year during an independent chemistry study.

Reading the other reviews on Amazon makes it obvious this is not the book for someone looking for a lot of detail. However, I found it well-written and enjoyable. It is drawn from first-person accounts, but is narrative style with just a few quotes. In all but one of the stories the author has included a portrait or photograph of the subject. A reader should have no trouble identifying with each of these eight women.This is a diverse set of women and an equally diverse set of situations. Two women are essentially enjoying a honeymoon as they journey to a new home and a new life. Some of the women faced a great deal of hardship, in fact one so damaged her health that she died only a year and a half after reaching California. One of the most heartwarming stories is of a black woman. Most were young, although Tabitha Moffatt Brown was sixty-six when she made the journey over the Oregon Trail in 1846.Each woman traveled a different trail and between them they covered nearly all of the trails west. The author has included a wonderful map showing the route of each. Some traveled as part of large wagon trains and others traveled alone or in small groups. The destinations were also diverse: Oregon, California, Montana, Colorado, and New Mexico.These women represent the early settlers of the west. Although a few were seeking gold, most came with a goal of establishing themselves. In many cases, they were among the first settlers in their communities. They set up schools; Tabitha Brown's school grew to be Oregon's Pacific University. They helped start churches and launched charities. Often, they and their husbands became leaders in their communities, territories, and developing states.This book joins many other accounts of women on the western trails. Here, readers will get an accurate feel for varied experiences in a short, easy-to-read form."},{"Title":"Heart of the Trail: The Stories of Eight Wagon Train Women","review":"This book was a big disappointment for me personally. I am a country person accustomed to hardship and was searching for details of how the women handled delicate personal problems on the trail and the survival methods they employed to make do. Diapers: How did they deal with them? Did they soak the beans, etc? Detail is sorely lacking in this presentation. Were excerpts from these women's diaries and accounts selected for content purported to be of interest to the reader? If, so my curiosity was not satisfied. I was also wanting more detailed information and accounts regarding the care and transport of domestic animals and pets, plants, seeds, (How did they keep their seeds dry, care for the chickens, trail-born lambs, pigs, etc?) If a reader wants detailed information, probably the best route is to obtain complete diaries and after-the-fact accounts of the eight women in this publication.

Never before has there been an accurate book written on the history of the black boxer. Mr. Smith obviously did his homework, using a wide variety of long forgotten sources to deftly craft this fascinating story. I particualrly enjoyed the chapter on the tragic Tom Molineaux and also loved seeing the records of all the fighters in the back of the book. Smith did a very good job in capturing the feel and flavor of bareknuckle fighting as well, using detailed descriptions with the language and terms of the day to capture the grittier aspects of the sport.Overall, with the exception of a few typos, which must have alluded the wandering eye of Mr. Smith's editor, I found the book to be a wholly enlightening, entertaining and exhilirating ride through prizefighting history."},{"Title":"Black Genesis: The History of the Black Prizefighter 1760-1870","review":"As I grew up in a &quot;Boxing Town&quot;, I developed an appreciation for the sport at a very young age.

Smith's research details events and fighters that indeed made and changed history in a period when Blacks were not recognized fully as citizens of the United States and abroad.Kevin Smith does a good job in the layout of the events and as well as the fighter's lives. The amount of detail is a testament to his passionate research. Furthermore, Smith is honest with the reader and shares all potential occurrences to events that have been interpreted differently by others in previous works. His facts are straightforward, free of romantic rhetoric, but organized and presented in a manner that leaves the reader wanting more."},{"Title":"Black Genesis: The History of the Black Prizefighter 1760-1870","review":"It's high time that the contributions of African-Americans to the early years of prizefighting recieved their due and to that end, Smith has done a succesful job. He's unearthed information about many hitherto unknown black fighters from the 19th Century together with evidence of a substantial amount of research to back up any assertions or claims.However, the quality of writing is very pedestrian and Smith fails to conjure up an impression of what the experience of prizefighting was like in its time. His prose is leaden and unimaginative. After completion, you're hard pressed to remember any of the characters or their fights. Nothing in here has that \\"memorable encounter\\" quality and every incident seems to merge into another rendering everyone anonymous by the end.Also, I think that if you are going to write a book about a certain demographic - African American fighters in the 19th Century in this instance - there has to be a reason and that reason must be to document the experience of what being a member of that demographic must have been like. It's also an excellent opportunity to describe the nature of a culture, in this case 19th Century England. In Black Genesis, we learn very little about that culture nor do we learn much about the black man's place in it. The book is little more than brief biographies of prize-fighters who might as well have been Irish.Ultimately, a disappointing read that, despite being short, was a slog to get through."},{"Title":"Joe Gould's secret","review":"Joe Gould's Secret, crafted by Mitchell from what originally ran as a Profile piece in New Yorker magazine, brings concise focus to the sprawling humanity of New York through the very-real biography of one Joe Gould.Mitchell's Gould--a real-life, Harvard-educated eccentric from the best of New England's Brahmin families--winds up as a celebrated Greenwich Village low-life and a self-described 'last of the Village Bohemians'.Gould's knack for mixing with the hodge-podge of 1940-50's Village inhabitants (including the famous ee cummings and Mitchell himself, among others) and his quixotic and never-ending scribbles and rants comprising his well-known 'Oral History' project, boils the now-long-gone New York of the era down to its core essentials in the form of a single inhabitant's day-to-day struggles for survival and immortality in an all-too-human town. In the end, as we weep for Gould, we weep for the NYC now gone...a well-executed snapshot of the era.R. Fields"},{"Title":"Joe Gould's secret","review":"In hindsight, I am a bit shy to admit that I first learned of Joseph Mitchell through the made-for-TV version of this story. Trusting that the story would be better in print than on screen, like so many books, I was pleased to find that Mitchell's account of Joe Gould made for an excellent read. Mitchell is a superb writer in my view. I have read few authors who are able to write nonfiction in such an eloquent and moving fashion. Beyond his technical skills, Mitchell also tells the story of Joe Gould. Gould is an eccentric Bohemian living in the Village during the 20s, 30s, and 40s. Mitchell one day decides to explore Gould's life and profile him in The New Yorker. Gould's profile appears in two forms. The first is &quot;Professor Sea Gull&quot; which appeared in 1942, and the second is &quot;Joe Gould's Secret&quot; which was published in 1964. As we read through the two accounts, we see and feel Mitchell's attraction to the eccentric Gould, his frustrations, his discovery of--and about--Gould's &quot;Oral History,&quot; and his patience and compassion as Gould's fellow man. In the end, I think we are left with a book that is much a profile of Gould as it is of Mitchell. I certainly would have enjoyed having a martini and watching these two interact one evening. Since that is not possible, I am pleased that we have Mitchell's account which is good enough to make me think about and want such opportunties. I hope you enjoy this book as much as I have."},{"Title":"Joe Gould's secret","review":"Reading anything by Joseph Mitchell is like finding buried treasure and reading \\"Joe Gould's Secret\\", a fascinating profile of a well-known Greenich village eccentric, is well worth your time. Joe Gould was, for upwards of thirty-five years, a homeless dropout living from day to day on his wits and handouts from any sympathetic ear, whether friends or strangers, surviving on a diet of fresh air, dog-ends, strong black coffee, fried egg sandwiches and bottles of diner-bar ketchup supped off a plate. (\\"the only food I know that's free of charge\\") The two parts of the book, headed Professor Seagull, and Joe Gould's Secret, first appeared in the New Yorker in 1942 and 1964.The son of a medical practitioner, Harvard-educated Gould arrived in New York in 1916 and soon dismissed all thought of holding down a steady job when he had a flash of inspiration to write what he called \\"An Oral History of Our Times\\". Over many years, Gould would add daily to this work \\"in progress\\", all he had to show for himself, even when badly hung over; loading his fountain pen in the Village post office, scribbling in grubby, dog-eared school exercise books in public parks, doorways, cafeterias, Bowery flophouses, subway trains and in public libraries as he struggled to get his thoughts down on paper. Some of these hangouts also served as places to doss - alternatives to the floor of an artist friend's studio or a subway station. 270 filled notebooks had been stored in numerous drops for safekeeping until the work was completed.Mitchell, intrigued by the \\"Oral History\\" idea, wrote a compassionate profile of Gould showing much patience and sensitivity in his dealings with his subject with whom he spent an inordinate amount of time. When a publisher friend of Mitchell asked to see Gould's material, with a view to publishing a book of selections, an indignant Gould declared that the material would either be published in its entirety or \\"not at all\\". Scruffy in appearance, wearing cast-offs, often unwashed for days at a time, all the time dogged by \\"homelessness, hunger and hangovers\\", (\\"I'm the foremost authority in the U.S.A. on the subject of doing without\\") Gould's norm was to hang around bars and diners in the Village cadging food, money and drinks from friends, visiting tourists and other regular contributors to the \\"Joe Gould Fund\\". Once asked what made him as he is today, Gould answered it was all down to a strong distaste for material possessions, Harvard, and years on end of bad living on cheap booze and grub \\"beating the living hell out of my insides\\".Gould died in 1957 whereupon Mitchell, who knew as much as anyone about the \\"Oral History\\", was persuaded to join a Committee set up to organise the collection of the mass of scattered material that made up \\"An Oral History of Our Times\\". Joe Gould's secret??? That's for you to discover when you read the book! If you enjoy \\"Joe Gould's Secret\\", read also \\"McSorley's Wonderful Saloon\\" and \\"Up In The Old Hotel\\", marvellous collections of profiles of old-time New York characters in a New York that is no longer."},{"Title":"Joe Gould's secret","review":"It is rare to find a book such as Joe Gould's Secret and even rarer still that through reading it, one would fall in love with such a irritating, grubby, vile little man as Gould. But love it was - certainly not at first sight but as I began to learn his history and then finally his secret, my heart just gave way.Joe Gould was a well known &quot;vagrant&quot; in New York's Greenwhich Village during the early and mid 1900's. During his years as a bohemian in New York he met many people, some famous (such as ee cummings and Ezra Pound) and many more equally interesting yet unknown people. Through his many friends and detractors he drew the attention of a young reporter, Joseph Mitchell, who interviewed him for a piece in the New Yorker.The book contains the two pieces that Joseph Mitchell wrote for the New Yorker about Joe Gould and his unpublished work, rumored to be ten times larger than the bible (over 10 million words), The Oral History. The more I read the more I craved to know more about Joe Gould and his life.I highly recommend this book as it is a true snapshot into the life of someone who deserves to be known. Joseph Mitchell truly captured the feel of New York and inner workings of Joe Gould and his crazy life.Apparently, 11 dime-store composition books that make up a nearly 150,000-word diary (part of his Oral History)are quietly tucked away within NYU's archives in NYC - I can't wait to get a look at them as well!Live on Joe Gould!"},{"Title":"Joe Gould's secret","review":"The first sketch that Joseph Mitchell made of Joe Gould, \\"Professor Seagull,\\" primarily a simple exposition of a bohemian character that the New Yorker and its readers found to be an entertaining piece about an eccentric who claims to be writing an oral history, a book containing so many pages that it would dwarf the author if neatly stacked up. A work that would place the title of grand historian on Joe Gould, this so called Oral History was said to contain not just the usual dates and names of what people think of as history, but the over-heard conversations of the common man as well as scribbles lifted from park benches and washroom walls that Gould deemed to be more telling of history than the formal history taught in primary and secondary institutions. Mitchell infused this first work with witticisms and anecdotes that placed Gould in a more positive light than what is revealed about the man in the second story. There are many parallels in both stories; the opening paragraphs in both stories almost mirror each other but for a few telling and well-placed words, but for the most part, the second story gives the true definition of the character Joe Gould. The second story, \\"Joe Gould's Secret\\" gives the reader a different view of the same man. This version lifts the mask from the faces of the author and subject, exposing the truth that is not entirely based on fact. Here, Gould is shown to the reader with all faults and disagreeable characteristics intact. The feisty little homeless bohemian has turned into a scavenging, begging, egregious bum dead set on getting the attention or money he craves, and acts like a child when he does not get what he wants. Joe Gould doesn't actually crave money as much as what a couple of dollars can get him in the way of alcohol, coffee and the notebooks he scribbles in incessantly. The scribbles are later shown to contain not one bit of dialogue overheard by Gould, but the same four or five essays he has been working on for many years. The fact that Gould has been re-writing, tearing up and re-writing the same stories for several decades is the reason for the second installment of the character sketch given to us by Mitchell.For twenty years, Mitchell has lived with the lie imbedded in his first sketch of Joe Gould, \\"Professor Seagull.\\" The lie is intricate in nature and has many facets that kept it a secret for twenty years. With the injection of Mitchell himself into the second story, \\"Joe Gould's Secret,\\" a light is thrown on the subject of the interplay between Joe Gould and Joseph Mitchell. There is a reason why Mitchell has placed himself in the story instead of writing from an onlooker's prospective as most profiles were written at the time and are written still. With this injection of author placed into the context of the story, Mitchell is giving the reader a glimpse of how the author can be seen in the same vein as the subject of the story. The two are entwined in a circle of deceit that encompasses the meaning of the word \`lie' in the direct or ordinary definition of the word.After stumbling upon the mendacity that Gould wove with his stories of the Oral History, Mitchell feels as if he has been duped by Gould, that everything that Gould stands for is an enormous and cruel lie that Gould constructed in order to gain whatever it is that he needed for self-acknowledgement and worth. After ruminating for a while, Mitchell begins to feel some sympathy for Gould by remembering an endeavor of his own. Mitchell had a dream to write a novel that would be about a man and his conquests and revelations in New York City. The novel was to have some of the same elements as Gould's Oral History in the form of spoken dialogue from an old Negro street preacher. This novel was everything to Mitchell that the Oral History was to Gould, that is, as Gould is quoted as saying, \\"My rope and my scaffold, my wife and my floozy,\\" etc. Although Mitchell was obsessed with writing the epic he constructed full-form in his mind, he was never able to actually write one word of it. This remembrance cools Mitchell's anger and he allows Gould to proceed with his deception without intervention. It takes a while for Mitchell to win his trust, but once it has been done, Gould once again dons the mask of the historian of his times and carries on as usual. Mitchell feels it unnecessary to expose Gould after this revelation of like characteristics between himself and Gould, and publishes the first profile, \\"Professor Seagull.\\"While Mitchell was able to place his dream novel on the backburner and continue life as a journalist, Gould continued to live the fantasy of the man who would someday be known as a great historian based on the jumbled dross floating around in his head. Gould had no other life and despised monetary gain and believed that he could never accomplish his goal of writing his history book if tied down to a regular job. Gould was hopeless in his yearnings and dreams. The one thing that he wanted and needed was the one thing that kept him from succeeding, whereas Mitchell rose above his desire to create a grand opus and settled for what he knew he could accomplish. The answer to the question that would tie this story neatly together is the one thing that Mitchell does not completely decipher after he has accused Gould of deception and trickery. The one line, if heard correctly, would answer many questions concerning the Oral History as well as Mitchell's dream novel, and that is when Gould indistinctly says, \\"It's not a question of laziness.\\" If heard correctly, then what has kept Gould and Mitchell from realizing their dreams comes down to self-doubt and insecurities, and not from a lack of skill. These unrealized works of grand design are not with us today in written form only because the creators did not find themselves worthy of the tremendous work of placing into print what was fully realized in their heads."},{"Title":"Joe Gould's secret","review":"I want to like this book. I really do. Joseph Mitchell is a terrific writer. His descriptions of old-time New York evoke a time and place long gone. His long, evocative sentences are extraordinary. His affection for Joe Gould is obvious and somewhat infectious. The old man, Gould, is a genuine character, the kind you don't see much in today's newspapers or magazines.There's a reason. The story, like Joe, goes on too long. As a profile of a strange, intelligent but dirty old man, it starts wonderfully. But after page upon page upon page of Joe's same old harrangue, it gets tiresome. More Mitchell and less Gould would have been better.Still, if this book leads you to one much better -- &quot;Up In The Old Hotel&quot; -- that's good. In fact, &quot;Hotel&quot; contains the entire Gould story, plus many other, much better tales of old New York. That's the book to get. Mitchell is a fabulous scene setter. He puts his talents to better use in the shorter non-fiction stories.As long as you can pick up &quot;Up In The Old Hotel,&quot; which contains &quot;Joe Gould's Secret&quot; in its entirety, there is no reason to get this book."},{"Title":"Joe Gould's secret","review":"This slim volume caught my attention in the bookstore, and, after reading the first few pages at the store, prompted me to purchase it right away.

Buy it today. You will be glad you did."},{"Title":"Joe Gould's secret","review":"It is not often that I can honestly say a book has changed my life; I suppose that is at it should be else my life would be in a constant state of flux regulated only by the ebb and flow of books on my nightstand.However, &quot;Joe Gould's Secret,&quot; or more to the point, &quot;Up In The Old Hotel,&quot; which contains &quot;Joe Gould's Secret,&quot; brought to my mind several life-wrenching questions of the &quot;What the hell am I doing slaving away at a meaningless job I hate&quot; variety.I would try to deconstruct the titular secret(did I really just write &quot;deconstruct&quot; without being sarcastic or tongue-in-cheek?), but I'm not sure my feeble powers of comprehension are up to the task. Let me just say this is the type of book parents should pass to their children, perhaps with no more explanation than a silent shrug or a twinkling eye.

I see a lot of Joe Gould in many of the Village characters I have known and loved in my life.Mitchell's style of writing is short and to the point but each sentance is crafted to paint a very vivid image. Up In The Old Hotel may have been his most renowned work but Joe Gould's Secret, I feel, is his truest gem. You can tell Mitchell came from a journalist background, his careful use of brevity is pronounced in this book. His imagery takes you back in time. It is fun to walk the very same streets that Joe Gould himself walked some 70 years ago.If you are a fanatic about character studies or characters in general, this is a must read! To think that all of the characters are indeed true, makes it all the more wonderful.Tim SchreierNew York, NY"},{"Title":"Joe Gould's secret","review":"Having seen the movie before reading the book, I wasn't sure what to expect. I'm happy to report that the movie had been totally faithful to the book. Joseph Mitchell's writing style is eminently readable and pulls one along effortlessly. Joseph Gould likely suffered from a mental illness, which would have gone undiagnosed in the 1920s-1940s. Mitchell's writing presents the subject in a sympathetic light, despite also showing Gould's negative traits. Mitchell shares his eventual exasperation with the reader, alternating between that and genuine sympathy for Gould. Highly recommended! Longer character studies may exist, but none better."},{"Title":"Joe Gould's secret","review":"Joseph Mitchell has written a piece of journalism that is true, but seems almost like a fictitious story. I won't ruin anything. It's about a man (Joe Gould) who chose the life of a Bohemian ( a bum) and J. Mitchell's quest for something that Gould had been working on for many years. There are so many different emotions in this story. It's very funny yet it is very sad at times. Above all, it is a true story. It seems more powerful because it is true. I highly recommend this book to anyone who enjoys or studies journalistic techniques. It teaches you many things. Mitchell is one of the best reporters of this century."},{"Title":"Joe Gould's secret","review":"Joseph Gould was a member of one of the oldest families in New England. A graduate of Harvard the world was at the feet of this New England scion. Joseph Mitchell was a good old boy from North Carolina. Anxious to work as a reporter he came to New York where he cut his journalistic teeth. His particular subjects of interest were the down and out denizens living on the edge in New York city.So what has one Joe got to do with the other? Plenty. Joe Gould was the subject of a profile for the New Yorker (1942) as written by Mitchell. Mitchell's encounter with Gould is an intiguing story that carried him through the bizare behavior of a man who had a secret. More than that Gould grows on Mitchell like a fungus that he rewrote another story about Gould twenty-two years later. The reflections, insights and comedy of both profiles and the character that inhabits them will build within you a disgust for Joe Gould or deep pity for a man who threw away his life.Who was Joe Gould? What was his secret? What part did Mitchell play in his life? All of those questions race through your mind as you read this story. Mitchell encounters a stinking, alcoholic, and dirty bum. Ah but this bum is more than he appears. He is a master in using people and sees himself as a bohemian. Young Joe Mitchell is naive at first in dealing with this older man but as the two get involved we see a relationship being built. Mitchell cares about his subject regardless of the lies and grandiose ideas that Gould shares with him. Mitchell has the gift of seeing through his subject without taking away the subject's dignity.Gould's profile could easily become a study about mental illness, homelessness, bohemians and skid row during the depression and afterwards. If you look at the story more carefully you find the subject says more about Mitchell than it does about Gould. Mitchell uses Gould as a feature for an article. He serves as Gould's co-dependent in providing him with money for alcohol. He refuses to confront Joe about his secret and after awhile he begins to dislike the man.The two Joes are an intriguing duo of two men trying to find and define themselves in a harsh world. Joe Gould indulges in fantasy. Mitchell keeps punching away at life and becomes in one sense what Gould could have been. After twenty-two years, Mitchell couldn't extricate himself from the memory of a man who impacted his life. Joe Mitchell has shared with us what it means to be compassionate to a man who was a rascal of the worst kind."},{"Title":"Joe Gould's secret","review":"This book with two different pieces about a homeless person of NY is remarkable demonstration of how to write a profile.

He just descrives the life of Joe Gould on a very fair way."},{"Title":"Joe Gould's secret","review":"Like Jon Krakauer's &quot;Into the Wild,&quot; this portrait of a troubled hero begs the reader to wonder whether the main character is just a nut, or whether he has a keen sense of the human condition.

I especially got a kick out of Joe's Harvard connection...and I'm sure that Joe (class of '11) will remind other Harvard grads out there of at least a few of their old classmates--he sure did for me."},{"Title":"Joe Gould's secret","review":"Joseph Mitchell takes two looks at the life of Joe Gould, a homeless denizen of NYC's Greenwich Village. From a well-known Massachussetts family and a Harvard grad, Gould lives from day to day on handouts to support his great work; An Oral History of Our Time, a mammoth undertaking which is said by Gould to be the longest book in the world. His story and its eventual sad end is reported by Mitchell with compassion and intelligence. Mitchell tells a solid tale but Gould is such an unlikeable character I felt distanced from him and never truly warmed to the book despite the author's obvious skill.

Seeing a person on the street beg for money, to beg for food, or to watch them shuffle through a trash can...it almost brought a tear to my eye to see a human being struggle so hard to survive. Luckily for me, my parents found us a nice neighborhood in which the homeless could be viewed only on television. Movies such as Tom Hank's \\"Philadelphia\\" portrayed a homeless man as someone who was smart and noble; a person that simply couldn't support themselves due to one large misfortune. I liked to believe that the homeless were good people and that they deserved some of my help. I had a place in my heart for them...I gave them my hope. That was soon going to change. Walking down the streets of downtown, it is not uncommon for people to be bombarded by pleas for money by the homeless. On my way to visit my brother at the Georgia State Village, the homeless tread along the sidewalk, and with their dirty clothes and their hot breath still reeking with alcohol, the simple task of walking up the street becomes a virtual war zone for my emotions. Should I give them some money, the money I know they will spend on another bottle of alcohol, or should I just walk on and ignore them? Somehow, I've learned to look away. I ignore them, and I get to save some pocket change. When my teacher gave my English class an assignment to read a nonfiction novel, I wanted to make sure that I picked one that I would like. So I asked for a recommendation. The book he proclaimed to be worth the time was Joe Gould's Secret. The story was written by Joseph Mitchell and it told about his relationship with a bohemian that was working on the biggest history book ever written. Joe Gould was homeless and for the first time, in a long time, I started the book with hope that Joe Gould was different from all of those other homeless people I see on the streets. There were reasons for my high hopes. Not only had Gould gone to college, but he actually graduated from Harvard University. An educated man, I thought who better than Joe Gould, a bohemian, to write an oral history of the modern man. The book is broken up into two parts. The first part is an article written by Mitchell called \\"Professor Sea Gull\\". It told about how Joe Gould was a true bohemian. Not only did Joe Gould detach himself from society, but he claimed that he would have run away from it if he was given the chance to be apart of it. It portrays Joe Gould to be a good man. It told about how Gould was not a beggar, he was more like a sort of Socrates. He would ask for a conversation and in return, for giving a person information, or a lesson in life, he thought it to be fair for them to pay for it. Also, Gould had a circle of friends that helped contribute to the Joe Gould Fund, the fund Gould set up to help him write his Oral History. Gould's favorite joke to do included his indulgence in getting people's attention at parties by jumping-around-upside-down while \\"speaking\\" like a seagull, hence the name Professor Sea Gull. The second part of the book is from the personal account of Joseph Mitchell. Like many others, Mitchell is a contributing member of the Joe Gould Fund. Not only that, Mitchell is one of Joe Gould's listeners. At first, to get info for his story, Mitchell adamantly takes notes of Gould's accounts of the Oral History. When Mitchell asks Gould to produce the Oral History, Gould tells him that it is in a safe place off of Manhattan...in one of his friend's cellars to be exact. So, Gould tells Mitchell that he will go and get it as long as Mitchell funds his trip. He agrees. Upon returning from his trip, Gould makes up the excuse that he could not open the cellar on the account of the fact that the owner of the cellar is not at home. This is the first in many lies that Gould would produce for money. As the story progresses, I see how Mitchell is beginning to get annoyed with Joe. He tries to find ways to get him off his back. Gould forms a relationship with Mitchell in a way that no other has had before. However, Gould's stories are never about the Oral History, but instead, the about the story of his own life. During this session with Gould, Mitchell peers into what Gould is writing about. He finds five essays. These five essays are all about the life of Joe Gould. Never does Mitchell spot him writing on the Oral History. One day, Gould comes into Mitchell's office. As always, he has a pair of dirty clothes on and his breath has the stench of alcohol (Joe claims is helps him to think better). Earlier, Gould refused to meet a book publisher, so Mitchell goes out of his way to make it so that Gould and a publisher meet coincidentally in his office. Gould practically kicks the publisher out, \\"Publish all of the Oral History or none at all,\\" he says. How is it that Gould was so against the publishing of the Oral History? It is here when it finally hits Mitchell that there is no such thing as the Oral History. As Mitchell is about to confront Gould about his lie, he realizes that the lie Gould tells is the lie that Gould lives on. He doesn't confront Joe. The good in Joe Gould is destroyed. Gould is aware of the fact that Mitchell does not want to confront him with the lie. With the power of denial ability, Gould goes on with his lie, but is careful when Mitchell is around. Joe Gould's character of being a bohemian is further destroyed when a rich woman, who wishes to remain anonymous, decides to help Joe Gould live a healthier life style. He is secretly given enough money to live in a hotel and is given enough money to have three square meals a day. Just as any other human being, he realizes how much he enjoys comfort. He becomes adept to living like a normal person, only for it to be ripped away when the funding stops pouring in. Gould scrambles to hold onto his life style when he is finally kicked out. He was never meant to live out on the streets. Gould would die in a psychiatric hospital, alone, the way it was meant to be. With his death, a horde of people sent out a manhunt to look for the Oral History. The book was never found. Fact, Gould was not a bohemian. A bohemian is a person, as an artist or writer, who lives and acts free of regard for conventional rules and practices. Sure Gould wrote about his own life, but that does not make him a writer. Fact, Gould was a liar and a conman. Gould lied with the fact that he did not have a history of the people. He conned people, people like Josef Mitchell, into giving him money. Fact, Gould enjoyed the comforts of having a home. Gould didn't want to let go of his cozy little hotel room nor the comforts of knowing when the next meal is coming to you. The truth was that Joe Gould was just another bum. When I first finished reading this book, I felt ...empty. I really didn't have any feelings on Joe Gould. As I began to think about it, I began to hate the book. I absolutely hate the fact that I read the book. It was an average story, of an average writer, about the average bum. There was no lesson to be learned from the book. There was no tragedy, no honor, there was just some humility shown by Josef Mitchell. My hopes of finding a homeless person who carried with them some integrity and some basic decency, was lost. Joe Gould's Secret was an incredible waste of time, just the same way that Joe Gould's life was. Now, it's just a little bit easier to turn the other cheek when a homeless person begs me for some money."},{"Title":"Oh Call Back Yesterday, Bid Time Return","review":"Expected \\"Oh Call Back Yesterday,Bid Time Return\\" to echo the movie,\\"Somewhere In Time\\"!

Muldoon's progressed into ever more difficult territory in his collections, and for a poet still relatively young (just over 50), he reminds me of a musical prodigy (first volume at 23) who's not fallen victim to trends, nostalgia, or predictability. I tackled these 250 poems ready for a challenge, and received one. The headings with a major Western thinker helped me in the way that Joyce's scheme aided readers of Ulysses: the titles are detached from the work--in brackets--yet need to be integrated into the poetic sequences.Like Joyce's Homeric template, how each thinker fits into the poem below remains rather obscure to those of us lacking a knowledge of 250 big names in Western thought. Puns, wordplay, imagery, and content sometimes surfaced recognisably, but many of the names were only vaguely recalled by me or not at all. Surely a thesis awaits on their correspondences. Meanwhile, the narrative itself remains clever throughout. Its fragmentation depicts well the colonial utopian dream being shattered by Native and post-colonial realities, although I was disappointed that the whole Madoc-Mandan-\\"Welsh Indian\\" topic remained, as the subtitle perhaps indicates, a \\"mystery\\" barely acknowledged.Muldoon's more engaging, IMHO, than his near-counterpart in age and origin Seamus Heaney, for PM possesses less of a gravitas and more intellectual playfulness in his concentration of an almost cinematic, and non-agrarian, employment of myth, action, and reaction within the mind of his characters. He's set himself a grand canvas upon which to paint his masterpiece here, and he's not so transparent that he easily exhausts close readings. Like musicians in it for the long haul, he's still improving after decades of honing his craft, and this work, while surely for a rather recondite reader, rewards and entices in its flirtatious teasing of what we can know and what remains enigmatic, a mystery despite manifest destiny and all the philosophies we can accumulate, in books or in life's own battle."},{"Title":"Madoc: A Mystery","review":"An Irish poet who has become, or must be becoming, an American poet does more than bridge the Atlantic with this grand work, singlehandedly with it he redefines American literature.

It's almost like a textbook, because it has SO much information in it. But it doesn't read like a textbook. It's almost as if you're just listening to someone telling you the story of hip hop.I am a true underground hip hop lover, so it's really cool to be reading this book and getting such an in-depth perspective on it's history. I don't know of any other current genre of music with so much history. It's impeccable.If you love hip-hop (whether you listen to De La Soul or A Tribe Called Quest, Lil Wayne or Drake, Blue Scholars or Eyedea & Abilities) or you're just truly interested in music, PLEASE buy this book. You will gain a better appreciation and understanding for not just hip hop, but music and pop culture in general.

For me, it was important that he located the development of hip hop in socio-economic contexts of the last few decades. Some were disappointed that this book was not a mindlessly celebratory litany of great artists, but a critical history of great art made by real people with real conflicts. I think we need less cheerleaders and more thoughtfulness.While everyone has topics that they would like to see addressed, I was surprised that the author overlooked a major controversy in hip hop: the shootings of Tupac and Biggie. I am not nitpicking here, this was more important than the KRS-ONE/MC Shan dispute, y'know? This caused a great deal of anguish within hip hop and reverberated outside of it. Besides refocuing the question of violence in hop hop, it re-raised questions about the relationships between art, race, communitty and commerce.Perhaps in future editions, something could be added?"},{"Title":"Can't Stop Won't Stop : A History of the Hip Hop Generation","review":"Mr. Chang, don't sweat any negative reviews. This is the book that Hip-Hop's been waiting for. IMHO, Hip-Hop is now in it's \\"teen years\\" so to speak. We've already gone through all the environmantal discovery that a child goes through, all the playing and such. But now in the teen years we are becoming more aware of ourselves, and Hip-Hop is growing it's own consciousness more than ever. In such a drastically changing time, we need a guide to know where we've been. You'll find that guide/mentor in this book. I've learned more from this book than I have growing up in tha LBC and surrounding areas.This book is essential and vital.We've been talkin it up over at http://www.templeofhiphop.orgAnd as a writer, I love Mr. Chang's use of words and masterful imagery that BOOM! explodes thru the pages.If you want an education, start here.Peace and one luv,~ LordShenhttp://www.thelordshen.com"},{"Title":"Can't Stop Won't Stop : A History of the Hip Hop Generation","review":"This book provides the most comprehensive and insightful historical narrative of the hip-hop era that I have ever read. I knew it was a book dealing predominantly with the pioneers and early innovators of the culture rather than the music itself,the diasporic and intergenerational aspects underlining hip-hop are given heavy emphasis as well. I used this book as a source for a paper that I wrote in college and now I have my own copy.

With the changes in the industry through the last decade, the average person has a misconstrued image of what hip hop is. Chang takes the reader back to the roots of it's beginning and the raw essence of what hip hop really is. This book should be a prerequisite for any upcoming artist wanting to participate in the movement.

Just goes to show how powerful of a catalyst music is.A MUST READ FOR ANY MUSIC LOVER.Rocky"},{"Title":"Can't Stop Won't Stop : A History of the Hip Hop Generation","review":"As a literate college graduate who loves hiphop and reading, this book bridges the gap by bringing a history of the movement and the place that, more or less, made hiphop. The initial chapters about NYC and Jamaica from the sixties onward really clarified the scene for me: white flight, the major NYC highway projects and the civil strife in Jamaica created a cauldron of creative activity in the center of the greatest city in the world, among its poorest citizens. This book rules, quite simply. I read it over a weekend, while downloading a lot of the music along with it, immersing myself in an epoch and a movement that I have only begun to truly appreciate in the last 3-4 years. Excellent and highly recommended."},{"Title":"Can't Stop Won't Stop : A History of the Hip Hop Generation","review":"While I don't know much about Chang's authority, he must have some sort of rep or he wouldn't have access to so many of the most important people in hip-hop to give their verbatim accounts of & reactions to the events in hip-hop and potential changes it will undergo. His language is lively and he is on point with all of his propositions and observations. I also included this material in my work for Icons of Hip-Hop (Greenwood Press). Great style, and just like Nelson George, he is unafraid, eager even, to explore the ramifications of hip-hop in both its original and commercial forms.

The author did a good job giving the reader an inside look at this topic. The book shows just how hip hop has grown to the point we have coined a whole generation \\"The Hip Hop Generation\\". After reading this book and others about hip hop, I feel that hip hop is going in the wrong direction. Another book about hip hop The Lost Generation and the book by Bakari Kitwana points this fact out in an excellent way. As a matter of fact, if you liked this book you will enjoy reading The Lost Generation as well.

I agree with the other poster, this book was written like it was 50 years ago. So full of political, anti-community, anti-white anger, it was hard to read. Typeset in 10 point avante garde, (what a chore.) One chapter title: \\"Hip Hop is the big F-U to white society\\" yeah, you got that right. I learned a few things about the Trenchtown ghettos, (the anger) how Africa is AFU, (the anger) Killer cops who shoot \\"innocent black men for NO reason,\\" (now, they're REALLY angry) and the down trodden black man who can't elevate in this \\"white society no matter how hard they try to get out of the ghetto\\" learned little about why such an profane art form called Hip-Hop is so popular - by the last few chapters, they're angry at the corporate, branding and mainstream businessman who marketed it to the world. Like all things today, zero accountability on the very culture who blames everyone for their anger, all the while becoming some of the richest, politically connected well paid people in the world. Glossed over Russell Simmons and his empire, P-Diddy, no mention of how much money he's made. Lots of negative references to \\"right wing neoconservatives.\\" Rip off the title about hip-hop and it's a book about justification for hate and violence, 50 years later with ZERO accountability on how they got themselves there and have no plans to give up the anger Shtick, it's the bread and butter of the wares they sell. A massive downer of a book that brought me no closer to understanding the music, rather that they will play this tired, worn out record as long as they can.

The research that goes into creating such a detailed history is nothing short of spectacular. Tracing the various threads that came together to create hip-hop, in all its myriad forms, is a staggering accomplishment. While, as Mr. Chang himself notes, one cannot create a definitive history of hip-hop, this does an excellent job of covering the first two decades of this art form.Sadly, as with many histories that try to encompass such broad topics, it does eventually start to slip. Much of this is likely due to the absolutely explosion of hip-hop during the late 80s and early 90s. There is simply too much to cover. While it is perhaps silly to be bothered by the exclusion or lack of attention to certain important groups (Tupac and Biggie being some of the most notable), the material does become much thinner as the book moves into the 90s.Personally, I would have been happy if the book had cut off somewhere around 1991 and eventually been left as the first volume of an ongoing series. There is much material left to cover and it is also much more difficult to write about events without sufficient time to generate perspective.With that said, I would heartily recommend this book to anyone wanting to learn more about the birth of hip-hop. It is an engaging read that was difficult to put down. I know that I have a much greater appreciation for the history surrounding this art form now than I did before reading Mr. Chang's opus."},{"Title":"Can't Stop Won't Stop : A History of the Hip Hop Generation","review":"Its refreshing to see that the history of Hiphop does not have to be boring. I really enjoyed jeffs descriptive and informative style of writing there were many places in this book where I felt like I was acctually there and that my friends is the mark of a great writer some times he tends to stray from the topic a little to much but given the amount of info he is trying to pack in this is forgivable. I was only expecting to learn about rap and Hiphop by reading this book but ended up learning about a variety of subjects such as the colapse of the bronx, gang warfare, a fairly extensive section on reggae and the birthplace of hiphop as well as various other topics and subjects to and this is the main problem that many people will have with this book it is not just about rap music but also about the events and key people that lead up to the music as well as social and economic struggles that give the reader a good idea of what was going on at the time some people might find it boring but I enjoyed it throughly. a great read dont listen to the 1 star reviews."},{"Title":"Can't Stop Won't Stop : A History of the Hip Hop Generation","review":"Mr. Chang has repeatedly denied that his book is definitive, but his subtitle says otherwise. The volume struck me as being comprised of two rather disjointed halves. The first is more about hip-hop and the latter more about violence, gangs, and race relations. It's the second half which falls apart as he fails to tie all those stories of riots and truces back to hip-hop. This section might as well be a separate book.The author goes into excruciating detail around many historical and racially motivated killings (those of Karen Toshima, Michael Stewart, Amadou Diallo, Michael Griffith, Yusuf Hawkins, George Jackson, Eddie Lee, Latasha Harlins, Oliver X. Beasley, Henry Peco, etc.). Cataloging these injustices apparently seemed topical to him, but they are tangential to his ostensible subject, music. Failures in race relations are treated over and over again in the book, to the detriment of many other roots of hip-hop (funk, 808s & 1200s, marijuana, the dozens).Mr. Chang is prone to hyperbole: \\"A millennial impulse was brewing.\\" (329) \\"Youth itself was being criminalized.\\" (389) \\"The discourse was migrating from the realm of the political to the cultural, from the intimacy of street corners and race papers to the fishbowl of the global media.\\" (273)The author's grip on economics is shaky and anecdotal; he makes many difficult uncited assertions. Several egregious editing mistakes crept into the first edition. The 500-page book is inexplicably set in a sans serif font.The detailed histories of graffiti, Public Enemy, and Source magazine were excellent and worthwhile. The letters and speeches quoted are illuminating and would be difficult to find elsewhere.While I did finish the book, and enjoy many parts of it, the hip-hop generation Mr. Chang describes is apparently not the one to which I belong."},{"Title":"Can't Stop Won't Stop : A History of the Hip Hop Generation","review":"I just finished reading Jeff Chang's book and I have to admit, although I was a bit skeptical, Chang did a good job of placing the agents within his historical narrative of \\"the hip hop generation\\" within their proper context, thus allowing us to see the complexities inherent within infamous/famous movements and events in hip hop.But I'm not really writing this to heap praise on Chang, he tends to focus on things that possibly in time won't seem too important and ignores events that will be written about years afterward, particularly Tupac and Biggie were marginalized while the Source & Benzino's role within the source was emphasized. This is probably due to Chang's self definition as hip-hop journalist and the importance (and possibly expertise) he expresses in regarding the subjects of Media/Publication/advertisement. In addition the ending of the book was troubling, particularly Chang's insinuation that hip-hop's political/cultural culmination is/was expressed at the democratic national convention. Unfortunatly Chang might be projecting far too much of his own post-civil rights ideals onto his perception of the politicized \\"hip hop generation\\". Finally like any attempted history set in the immediate past, this history suffers from attempting to pick out the important events & movements post mid-1990s. The writings get a bit murky, not much can be really analyzed historically being so close to the subject. In terms of Chang's attempt to connect the dots (globally to locally and back again) some dots are missing within his analysis and some dots shouldn't even be mentioned.But as I mentioned earlier the real reason I HAD (I hate capitalizing letters in order to emphasize a feeling, but I felt this was a good reason)to write a review was to respond to the utter uselessness of A. Johnston's review and absurd assertion that Chang's supposed absence of \\"positive\\" white primary characters of the hip hop generation's history is an indication of racism. Did Johnston even read the same book? Or did he just skip all the narratives of historical framework that Chang provided. The sad truth Johnston (even though you supposedly \\"lived\\" through this) is that the historical context of Black culture (which is undoubtedly the roots and the current main selling point of Hip-Hop or as a matter of fact exploitable cool)consists of white supremacist formed local to federal laws, enforcement, cultural hegemony etc. that consistently targeted, exploited and constrained communities of color. To believe that hip-hop history should be rewritten to appease white liberal dreams of multi-culti mutual struggle is irrational and pseudohistorical. It's bad enough that hip-hop culture has been co-opted, now white liberal? pseudohistorians such as Johnston (who cries \\"reverse-racism\\" when there is no such thing eg: power + privilege = racism, something peopele of African descent definitely do not have on any broadbased level culturally/politcally/demographically in the U.S.)want to take credit for hip-hop historical discourse? Please. In the words of Ice Cube: You better check yourself before you wreck yourself.peace."},{"Title":"Can't Stop Won't Stop : A History of the Hip Hop Generation","review":"Chang's history of hip-hop starts at the beginning (in the 70s) and examines the phenomenon from musical, cultural, and political viewpoints. His main strength is that he refrains from discussing \\"current\\" events, lest the book become dated too quickly. Indeed, only the last couple of chapters deal with the last ten years, and at that it's a cursory look. Chang's writing is outstanding, if a little too focused on certain acts (Public Enemy seems to take up the entire mid-section of the book), but his depth of knowledge of his subject matter and his manner for conveying it are excellent. His primary weakness is that he has a definite political slant to his work, occasionally dropping his journalistic guard to take shots at right-wing causes/politicians. It doesn't get in the way of the text, but it does get annoying. It's hard to write a history of a person/event/phenomenon that is ongoing that actually seems like a history, but Chang has done an excellent job doing just that."},{"Title":"Can't Stop Won't Stop : A History of the Hip Hop Generation","review":"Unfortunately I think the previous reviewer may have missed the point of my book.As I've said, in the book and in talks I've given on the book, I never set out to do a \\"definitive\\" history of hip-hop culture, let alone one simply about rap music. I don't believe that any one book could capture the breadth and depth of the hip-hop generation's contributions to culture and politics.In 14+ years of writing on hip-hop from the street level around the globe, working (and often battling) in an international cipher of incredibly talented, passionate, and committed hip-hop artists (not just rappers), journalists, activists, writers, and scholars, I have developed a very strong opinion on this point: there are millions of ways to tell the story of the hip-hop generation. Mine is but one version. It's not \\"the\\" history, it's just \\"a\\" history.I want to point everyone to some of the incredible writing that is available-in anthologies edited by people like Raquel Cepeda, Oliver Wang, and Rob Kenner, in books by Joan Morgan, Selwyn Seyfu Hinds, Bakari Kitwana, Raquel Rivera, Michael Eric Dyson, Mark Anthony Neal, S.H. Fernando, Adisa Banjoko, and Cheo Hodari Coker, and in fiction by Danyel Smith, Black Artemis, Erica Kennedy, and Adam Mansbach. There are classics of hip-hop writing by Tricia Rose, Brian Cross, Steven Hager, David Toop, Greg Tate, Billy Upski Wimsatt, James Spady, Jim Fricke and Charlie Ahearn. As I write this, I know of future classics still coming by people like Dave Tompkins, Brian Coleman, and many others. Nor am I trying to exclude the many other worthy and important writers out there-trust me, I've only scraped the surface of this expanding field of hip-hop generation (not just rap) books. Before long, our shelves should be bending from all the great stuff.Let me talk about this book. In Can't Stop Won't Stop, I wanted to explore the notion that hip-hop is one of the big ideas of my generation. It's a powerful idea that unites us, divides us, that we feel deeply passionate about, that for many of us helps to define our identity, around the world.So what I've tried to do here is to present the emergence of the hip-hop generation, through the cultural and the political changes that we've made and that have made us. In doing so, I chose to tell many less-told stories, both because I wanted to add to the shelf of books above and because each of these stories revealed a certain truth about the generation we have come to be.I wanted the book to be a window on the last three decades of the 20th century, the so-called American Century. In another three decades, this will sound like common sense even if it doesn't right now: you can't talk about America without talking about hip-hop. And you can't talk about hip-hop without talking about America. This is why the book moves back and forth between hip-hop's content and hip-hop's context. I think they are inseparable. Understanding one only helps the understanding of the other.Personally, I came to hip-hop as a young boy growing in Honolulu in the early 80s, so I am a product of the culture's global reach, and I document its global roots beginning in Jamaica and moving through to its role now as both a indispensable commodity for the multinational media corporations and a grassroots community movement that bridges people and places all over the map.Finally, I've tried to capture and celebrate the joy that this culture has given to me and to millions of others-not just through rap, but through all of the aesthetic forms hip-hop has moved through and transformed. All throughout the book, my generation's promethean creative powers are on full and glorious display.Hip-hop has grown from being a local culture to something bigger, something that frames the very way that we see and live in our world. So I wanted Can't Stop Won't Stop to be a history that also begins from the neighborhood level and expands into a generational worldview, with a lot of dope stuff to move to and think about along the way.Thanks for reading this and please do check out some of the other books I've mentioned above."},{"Title":"Can't Stop Won't Stop : A History of the Hip Hop Generation","review":"Any weaknesses in Jeff Chang's groundbreaking _Can't Stop Won't Stop_ come from what is also the book's lifeblood: an ambition to create a coherent disquisition of the braided threads of art-making, culture-making, commerce, exploitation, appropriation, political oppression, and resultant activism that characterize what has, over twenty years, become \\"hip hop\\" (a term itself which, in the book, casts a wide net over a wildly conflicted and contradictory territory of music, culture, techniques, and theoretical structures.)He's trying to do a hell of a lot. And the writing succeeds when he sticks to a specific story in a specific time: reggae in the 1970s; the birth of hip-hop in the Bronx; the rise and fall of the Source. His narratives are clear and exciting; just the very fact of this information being documented with such strength and legitimacy makes it exciting.However, the text starts to slip and slide when Chang tries to tell too big of a story all at once. As the book proceeds, it is dragged down by the accumulation of narratives he keeps trying to follow, threads he tries to tie up with generalizations; summary statements that lose power with each iteration.I feel like if the book had tried less to make all the points connect; presented a more consciously disconnected juxtaposition of these various stories--various chapters of the development of hip hop, even out of chronological order--if Chang had left it up to the reader to hear the echoes between his beautifully narrated case studies--it would have been a far stronger work.That being said--no one, to my knowledge, has attempted a project about hip-hop on such a grand scale. It's always difficult to be the first--Chang sets up a theoretical framework in whose wake many great books will follow.For a similarly exhilerating/groundbreaking work with similar problems, check out Judith Halberstam's terrific \\"Female Masculinity.\\""},{"Title":"Can't Stop Won't Stop : A History of the Hip Hop Generation","review":"As a deaf Asian-American, I didn't grow up in a house where music was a big priority. It was the purchase of the album \\"Dark Side of the Moon\\" that opened the floodgates for me and now I grasp not only the music, but the history behind the people and socio-auditory changes.I can't help but compare \\"Can't Stop, Won't Stop\\" to the recent movie \\"Cidade de Deus\\" about a young boy who manages to somewhat avoid the gangs, drugs and cyclical poverty of Brazil's slums. The movie's protagonist Rocket could be analogous to hip-hop itself, struggling to find an alternate path to the violence and ignorance brought on by apathetic governments, organizations and a few evil people in the right places. Chang gives us remarkably well-done portraits of the various social changes that combined to give us some of the most transcendent expressions of thoughts and feelings I've ever heard. The book is worth the time and money.The shortage of Tupac and Biggie material arises from the book's focus on the \\"original generation\\" itself, as the creators of the format got older and had to deal with not only a changed society, but also the question of \\"Where to go next?\\" Chang does point out the commercialization of hip-hop has had, on the whole, a mostly negative impact upon the validity and \\"goodness\\" of the music being made; that the industry executives have managed to create a system where decent beats, attractive musicians and shoddy lyrics are rewarded more often than the intelligent, expressive and fun block party spirit in the beginning.Read this book."},{"Title":"Can't Stop Won't Stop : A History of the Hip Hop Generation","review":"Jeff Chang has written a massive volume with lots of interesting information, much of it based on interviews with hip-hop's originators. The early part of the book, which focuses on Kool Herc, Afrika Bambaataa, and Grandmaster Flash, Melle Mel, and the Furious Five, provides a fascinating glimpse into how the music and hip-hop culture got started in New York. The book then moves to the west coast to chronicle the development of \\"gangsta rap.\\" However, this is where the book narrows its focus and loses its perspective.There is so much of an emphasis on the history of gang wars and the \\"right-wing\\" 1980s Reagonomics/social policy of the 1980s that it comes at the expense of properly placing the artists and their music in the context of broader musical, economic, and societal shifts. While the book claims to cover the period from the 1970s to 2001, it is strangely selective in the history of hip-hop's more recent years. While Public Enemy, NWA, Ice T, and Ice Cube rightly receive lots of attention, more recent artists such as Tupac and Biggie, no less newsworthy than their predecssors, seem to be mentioned only in passing. The accomplishments of Run-DMC and the Beastie Boys are glossed over. Naughty by Nature, Busta Rhymes, Eminem, and the FuGees are not mentioned at all; Suge Knight, Lauryn Hill, 2 Live Crew, the Wu-Tang Clan, A Tribe Called Quest, Puffy, Missy Elliot, Jill Scott, India.Arie and Meshell Ndegeocello are some of the artists/producers mentioned almost as an afterthought, many of them lumped together, towards the end. Many others are left out.The overemphasis in the book on the difficulties of living in the 'hood and the LA riots ultimately does a disservice to all the artists and their accomplishments. There is no discussion of hip-hop's global reach- i.e., DJ Krush, MC Solaar, Russel in \\"Gorillaz\\"- that positively illustrate just how far from the 'hood hip-hop artists have come and the economic power they hold in today's economy. Very little is written about how media-savvy individuals such as Puffy and Jay-Z have used the elements of hip-hop to build empires. In the many pages describing \\"youth oppression,\\" there is no comparison to the grunge movement in the 90s, no contrast about the survival of rap vs. grunge, no talk of rap's influence on artists like Kid Rock and Limp Bizkit, no discussion of artists like Britney Spears, Jennifer Lopez, and Gwen Stefani looking to \\"urban\\" music to broaden their appeal. There is very little devoted to the changes in technology that drove much of the development of both new wave and rap- synthesizers and samplers- and mass culture- MTV and the Internet. Discussion of these related topics would have brought the book into the present day, added a much-needed positive spin to this often deadly-serious book, and really showcased the magnitude of what the hip-hop generation has accomplished.

A must for inner city studies and understandings of mixed living in a complicated country where race is still an issue.

He writes with an amazing breadth that captures politics, sociology, history, economics, globalization, exploitation, capitalism, racism, media tricks, etc. and how they have all contributed to the formation of hip-hop and the resulting culture. As I came of age in the mid 90's I became transfixed with gangsta rap and inner city culture, I never realized how all the afore mentioned concepts made up an entire culture that connects with audiences all around the globe or the economics that helped regenerate a struggling economy and an evaporating job landscape. As the new century comes into full swing it is astounding to think of the power hip hop still holds and the mouths it feeds.As I dig deeper into the sociology of this last statement I can't help but think while hip hop has revived industries like music, fashion, and film and laced corporate pockets with green the conditions that breed hip hop still have not changed. The current Bush Administration is continuing where Reagan and his pops left off by gutting social programs and destroying education while offering hope through the army only to die for a country that doesn't give a damn about a better tomorrow only a richer, whiter one. Hip Hop heads are still seen as criminals in broader society, still harassed by police and still followed around the stores their culture helps feed.Perhaps Hip Hop can be the vehicle that delivers a unified front to reclaim this country from corporate interests and the carnivorous capitalist system. It has the power to reach audiences of every creed and the prophets to deliver the message.Jeff Chang is a prophet of history. Thanks for writing this book and teaching me about my past.

Not only does it include a full Medicine Buddha practice but the author incorporates a great many fine explanations for symbols, practices, ideas, etc. as well as enlightening Question and Answer sections with the chapters. The practices include the shortest of the three main practices. The other two are Sutra practices, but this one is a combination of Sutra and Tantra, so it is shorter. Also included (pages 100-101) are two even shorter (extremely short in truth) practices for when one cannot perform the full practice. In addition (pages 61-2), the author includes a specific, on-the-spot practice of Karma Chakme (author of the fabulous \\"Union of Mahamudra and Dzogchen\\" - see my list of that name) which reminds me of Pema Ch&ouml;dr&ouml;n's on-the-spot Tonglen practice. Indeed, Khenchen Thrangu Rinpoche addresses the relationship between Medicine Buddha practice and Tonglen on pages 123-4.His pithy and clarifying explanations include:p. 11: the 8 Medicine Buddhas including the main one (Menla)p. 11: supremely effective in the removal of illness; combination of tantra & sutra therefore \\"since it is connected with the sutras, it is acceptable to do the practice without the empowerment\\"pp. 24-5: impartiality 1st; & the 4 Immeasurables; apply to specific context of physical healingpp. 43-4: explains the meaning of the 8 major signs of a Buddha, 7 types of royaltyp. 47: Medicine Buddha mantra -Om Sarva Tathagata Abikekate Samaya Shriye Hung.p. 49: Reasons for offerings and the parts of the sadhanap. 63: the purpose of yidam (meditation entities) practicespp. 65-7: Name of the primary Medicine Buddha = Bhaishajyai Guru = teacher of medicine or Mengyi Lama or Menla for short; also, benefits for animals of this practice; can also use the Mani of Chenrezigpp. 105-117 [also see the Appendix on pages 179-82]: Medicine Buddha's 12 aspirationspp. 122-3: types of Bodhichitta: king, ferryman, shepherd and on practitioners being realisticpp. 127-133: 5 Buddha families & Mudras & offeringsp. 137: balancing practice with serving othersp. 152: Medicine Buddha practice can be freely taughtp. 159: \\"this practice is not really the worship of an external deity., It is primarily a way of gaining access to your won inherent or innate wisdom.\\"p. 160: the siddhis (psychic accomplishmentspp. 160-2: maras (obstacles)These are listed here because, unfortunately, there is no subject index in the book.The author is quite practical and realistic in a way intelligible to the Western practitioner:p. 49: \\"buddhas and bodhisattvas are not pleased by praise nor displeased by its absence. One performs the praises to remind oneself, the practitioner, of the qualities of the deities.\\"pp. 105-117 & 179-82 (Appendix): the 12 aspirations are more than healing; 3=prosperity; 7th=povertySince Thrangu Rinpoche asserts several times that these practices can be openly shared, here is the very practical Karma Chakme (or Chagme) practice from pages 61-2:\\"In his book \\"Mountain Dharma: Instructions for Retreat,\\" Karma Chakme Rinpoche recommends the following visualization for the actual alleviation of sickness. You can visualize yourself as the Medicine Buddha if you wish, but the main focus is to actually visualize a small form of the Medicine Buddha, no larger than four finger-widths in height, in the actual part of your body that is afflicted. So if it is an illness or pain in the head, visualize a small Medicine Buddha in the head; if it is in the hand, visualize a small Medicine Buddha in the hand...Visualize the Medicine Buddha in that place, and think that from this small but vivid form of the Medicine Buddha rays of light are emitted. These rays of light are not simply light, which is dry, but liquid light having a quality of ambrosia. This luminous ambrosia or liquid light actually cleanses and removes the sickness and pain-whatever it is. You can do this not only for yourself, by visualizing the Medicine Buddha in the appropriate part of your own body, but you can do it for others as well by visualizing the Medicine Buddha in the appropriate part of their body or bodies. The radiation of rays of light of ambrosia and so on is the same. This can be applied not only to physical sickness but to mental problems as well. If you want to get rid of a particular type of anxiety or stress or depression or fear or any other kind of unpleasant mental experience, you can visualize the Medicine Buddha seated above the top of your head and think in the same way as before that luminous ambrosia or liquid light emerges from his body, filling your body and cleansing you of any problem, whatever it is. You might think that all of this sounds a bit childish, but in fact, it actually works, and you will find that out if you try it.\\" In the spirit of scientific enquiry, I suggest you try it out empirically!"},{"Title":"Medicine Buddha Teachings","review":"Written by the tutor to H.

Wolpoff and Caspari's book is NOT one of these. The authors take pains to explain what multiregional evolution is NOT, namely, the multiple origin of humanity. Like just about everyone else, they contend that humans originated in Africa. However, they build a persuasive case that (a) there is no such species as Homo erectus, and (b) that the earliest Homo sapiens left Africa some two million years ago. Whether or not one agrees with this scenario, it makes interesting and informative reading, and I believe is a must for anyone interested in the evolution of humanity, for it provides an alternative to the now-popular view that &quot;modern&quot; humans, whatever that may mean, originated late, in Africa and &quot;replaced&quot; everyone else.&agrave;"},{"Title":"Race And Human Evolution: A Fatal Attraction","review":"This book accurately portrays the skeletal evidence for human origins, in the context of the Multi-regional theory of human evolution. In this respect it's typical Wolpoff & his usual high standard of excellence, \\"nuff said. What REALLY needs commentary is the major misconception several reviewer have posted. DNA data has NOT \\"blown skeletal studies out of the water\\". We now know that mtDNA AND Y-chromosome lineages ARE HIGHLY subject to natural selection, which means that selective processes CAN (& WILL) cause \\"lineage replacement\\" in populations. The multi-regional theory REQUIRES geneflow between regional populations, and even miniscule levels of geneflow will introduce \\"new\\" lineages, that can replace the earlier lineages in that population. Selective advantages of as little as hundredths of a percent, and \\"once in a century\\" geneflow between adjacent populations, WILL result in total worldwide replacement of lineages within a 100,000-150,000 year period WITHOUT significantly affecting the rest of the genepool. So yes, lineage studies DO \\"show\\" that we all share common mtDNA & Y-chromosome ancestors within the last 50-250,000 years (depending on which mutation rate estimate is used), but this actually FITS the predictions of the multi-regional model (for that matter, some mutation rate estimates give calculations that ALLOW descent from regional Homo erectus populations). And.... autosomal DNA studies REVEAL ancient regional population structuring for most genes that goes back as much as a million years, but more recent structuring for other genes, which is ALSO exactly what you'd expect under multi-regionalism's \\"geneflow & spread of advantageous genes\\" expectation.... but NOT what would be expected of a human population that recently spread out of Africa. So look at ALL the data INCLUDING BOTH the skeletal (which this book is excellent on) AND the DNA side of things (sadly, I've seen no single comprehensive reference on this aspect) before making up your mind. I suggest you read this book AND search pubmed for scientific papers covering the full spectrum of DNA study interpretations."},{"Title":"Race And Human Evolution: A Fatal Attraction","review":"The debate between multiregional evolution vs. the replacement model continues unabated, and naturally, not without certain biases muddling the understanding of the interested lay-reader. Wolpoff and Caspari do an excellent job of presenting the historical foundations for the intellectual biases AND the over-simplified misunderstandings of multiregional evolution perpetuated by the popular media which are responsible for the ongoing confusion regarding this debate. Human evolution is NOT a simple matter easily reduced to one or two easy-to-manage ideas. The replacement model is well addressed in the text and is shown to be easier to comprehend than the multiregional model, which explains the media's favoratism for the former. The technical information provided favoring both views is carefully presented and explained, and the reader is left with the task of making up his/her own mind. An approach of which I approve. Balancing this text with those of Dr. C. Stringer and Prof. Rushton (another review on this site) is recommended for even treatment. Were I teaching a course in paleoanthroplogy, I would certainly make Wolpoff &amp; Caspari's book required reading."},{"Title":"Race And Human Evolution: A Fatal Attraction","review":"I found the book extremly interesting and insightful. It is of interest that Wolpoff feels that anthropologists who use fossils which are categorized as Neandertal, might be a bit narrow, xenophobic, in their ideals. They use the European white as the standard. High eyebrow ridges are characteristics of some in the human family, whose skulls today might just as well be Neandertal.Another anthropology college textbook described Viking skeletons as being almost identical to Neandertals. The publication, The Origin of Life, quotes Wolpoff as writing, \\"Neandertals may have been a true human race,\\" from the American Journal of Physical Anthropology, \\"How Neandertals Inform Human Variation. 2009, p.91Darwin's Black Box: The Biochemical Challenge to Evolution"},{"Title":"Race And Human Evolution: A Fatal Attraction","review":"Wolpoff is one of the principal advocates of the Multiregionalist model of the origin of modern humans. It's hard for people to admit they are wrong when they have dedicated a lifetime to a certain point of view. The truth is that the genetic evidence simply does not support this model in it's strict or even midway view.We now have almost a complete genome of the Neanderthal. Based on genetic comparisons of the Neanderthal genome and the genome of modern Europeans, at best what multireigonlist can argue is replacement (from Africa) with minor hybridization. Even if modern Europeans have a stint of Neanderthal genes, over 90% of modern European genomes are inherited from African ancestors who replaced the Neanderthals almost entirely from genomic standpoint.The multi-regionalist view is incorrect. As an analogy, one could compare what happened demographically to the homo sapien population of the United States in regards to the Native American indigenous population in North America since the western European expansion beginning in the 17th century. The facts are that Europeans and Africans 'replaced' the population of Native Americans during the 17th, 18th, 19th and 20th century. As a result, at the middle of the 20th century over 90% of the genome of the population of the U.S. would consist of genes from people either of African or European descent. Yes, there was some intermixing but the replacement model would still be correct.Likewise, the Out of Africa theory is basically correct when it states that homo sapiens sapiens from Africa (Cro-Magnon) replaced the Neanderthals. If Wolpoff's hypothesis were applied to the analogy, then it would be correct to say that Europeans and Africans evolved into Native Americans. But that is ridiculous ! Even though Europeans and Africans may have interbred with Native Americans, keeping with the analogy, it would still be a better hypothesis to say that they 'replaced' the Native Americans which is exactly what the the Out of Africa theory does. This replacement is even more evident due to the fact that Neanderthals (unlike Native Americans) became completely extinct. If that is not replacement, I don't know what is.Both genetic evidence and dating of fossil evidence clearly show that Cro-Magnons and Neanderthal lived in Europe at the same time. Therefore, Neanderthals did not evolve into humans as Wolpoff's multiregional hypothesis states. The replacement theory is correct because it more closely matches the facts. All modern mankind is more similar to the Cro-Magnon. Cro-Magnon came Out of Africa. I would recommend reading Lone Survivor by Chris Stringer."},{"Title":"Race And Human Evolution: A Fatal Attraction","review":"I just finished reading Race and Human Evolution. There is a lot of food for thought within those pages and, overall, it is very well written. I must add, however, that some of their \\"scientific\\" views are based as much upon ideology as upon science. Though a breath of fresh air, this book is also a strict adherent, and proponent, of the leftist ideological edifice. If only Wolpoff and Caspari (who make a very nice looking couple, by the way), would free themselves from the shackles of leftist thought, they could reach new heights in the quest for human knowledge - though they would not be very popular amongst their colleagues and friends any more.The first half of the book deals with the history of Anthropology and I love the way they lead up to the theories of Weidenreich and flesh him out into a very likable and sympathetic character whose ideas were ahead of his time, even as they were misunderstood and misrepresented.Overall, this book is a worthy addition to my library and well worth the money."},{"Title":"Race And Human Evolution: A Fatal Attraction","review":"Major changes in scientific thinking are rarely embraced by those who have dedicated a lifetime to an opposing orthodoxy. Plate tectonics is an example - it became accepted because old geologists died! And so it's no surprise that Wolpoff doesn't accept a recent African origin.But we now have several mtDNA studies of Neanderthals, and this year the Planck Institute published a draft Neanderthal genome. So multi-regionalism (at least as far as Europe is concerned) is a dead duck. No doubt it will continue to have a dwindling following and ever more convoluted ways of shoe-horning the facts into this ill-fitting shoe will be conjectured, but as serious science it is already being wheeled into the morgue."},{"Title":"Race And Human Evolution: A Fatal Attraction","review":"This book is a rehash of previous statements and out-dated concepts. As one reviewer has already noted, the molecular data and its interpretation (both mtDNA and RNA) makes this book redundant. Also the discussion of the fossil evidence fails to examine issues of function and developmental processes, which can have a significant impact on morphological form. As such, their implied 'evolutionary trends' within and between hominin groups are just as likley the result of convergence - anatomical analogies (i.e., homoplasies)The dedication says it all:\\"To Franz Weidenreich.

You don't have to be a racing fan to enjoy this book; it is full of racing, but it is full of history and many Gilded Age politicos and capitalists wander through its pages. It covers the rise and fall of Sloan, who introduced the way we all have seen jockeys riding their mounts, forward on the saddles, almost hugging their necks. Before Sloan invented this position, all rode back in the saddle and upright. Sloan introduced the \\"forward seat,\\" and he won with it, causing a revolution in racing. Many didn't like the new style, but took to it when it won. Many didn't like Sloan. He became a crowd pleaser, and his dandified dress in miniature, his constantly smoking a cigar \\"as big as a policeman's club,\\" his inability to let others take the tab, and his eagerness with women made him a star of the sport.Sloan's success was not just due to his gimmick. He was a skilled jockey. He was known for quick starts and blazing finishes. His judgement of pace was unequalled. Horses that had not performed well would succeed under his control. They knew his voice; a trainer said, \\"When Sloan enters the paddock, horses that he has ridden recognize his voice and turn to look at him.\\"But Sloan made such a spectacle of himself that he was resented by some members of the British racing establishment, even though he had occasionally been tapped by the Prince of Wales to ride royal mounts. A minor betting incident, not a big deal at the time, led to his being exiled from the sport he had revolutionized. Sadly, his drinking and gambling ruined his two marriages and any business prospects, and he would up as a ticket taker at a race track in Tijuana.Dizikes's readable book is a beguiling history of racing as it used to be, illuminating a good deal about the history of racing, and the attempts to regulate it, and make it fair. It also is a little parable about what can happen to revolutionaries."},{"Title":"Yankee Doodle Dandy : The Life and Times of Tod Sloan","review":"A marvelous miniature, Yankee Doodle Dandy tells what at first blush is the story of Tod Sloan, an American jockey, who revolutionized horse racing by changing the way a jockey sat on the horse. (Prior to Sloan, riders sat comfortably on the horses back, ramrod straight. Sloan leaned forward over the horses withers, leaned over the horses neck.) His innovation initially met with jeers and scoffing from the traditional race crowd, but within less than 5 years, nearly every jockey had adopted the technique. There was no arguing with Sloan's success. Winning two, three, four and even five races at tracks featuring an average of seven races daily, Sloan's new technique, coupled with his remarkable sense of pace and often brilliant strategies, was unstoppable.By following Tod Sloan's career we are given a vivid tour of the U.S. and England in the latter 19th century, from the life of the lowliest stableboy, to glimpses of the English royalty. We also witness the last gasp of British &quot;imperialism&quot; in its Jockey Club barring Sloan from ever applying for his license again. His infraction, suspected gambling, had never been cause for such a stringent punishment before. But, as Dizikes points out, there had never been anyone quite like Sloan before either. A brash American sportsman, spendthrift, ladies man, vaudevillian (briefly), he was the first sports superstar.A short, masterful evocation of a uniquely American life, Yankee Doodle Dandy is a great ride!"},{"Title":"Owls (Animal Predators)","review":"For the animal/owl lover in your house, get this book.

It is lavishly illustrated with artwork and is an exhaustive reference source. The author states upfront that, for purposes of study, he considers any literature written before the time of Thomas Malory's LE MORTE D'ARTHUR to be fair game and part of &quot;authentic&quot; Arthurian lore. Anything after Malory is either a modernization or a retelling of the original legends. Therefore, references to works such as Tennyson's IDYLLS OF THE KING and White's ONCE AND FUTURE KING are omitted.This book is wonderful reference material. It alludes to many obscure source materials and attempts to explain the origin of many elements of the stories of Arthur and the Round Table. However, I would not recommend it for novice fans. Coghlan takes it for granted that most of the stories are familiar, and he spends most of his time explaining how the stories originated, how they were altered over time, and why inconsistencies exist. The format of the book makes it useful for looking up a particular name but not for browsing through a chronology of the tales.This book is for the scholars and historians, not necessarily the readers and dreamers."},{"Title":"The Illustrated Encyclopaedia of Arthurian Legends","review":"If you or someone you know is a student of Arthurian Legend, this makes a beautiful gift.

Lovers of the legend will treasure this book!"},{"Title":"The Illustrated Encyclopaedia of Arthurian Legends","review":"Ah, The Illustrated Encyclopaedia of Arthurian Legends: I was practically raised on this book! I have learned everything I know about Arthurian Legend with it. I have always loved it not only because I was able to study the literary aspects of Arthurian Legend, but also the historic background of the legends themselves. I understand it may seem a bit over people's heads at times (mainly because of its lack of detail on certain topics). Although, I am not sure it had much to do with the author. (Sometimes it is brief because there is not a lot of information available to us in some cases). I would agree that it is apparent in this book that his knowledge is extensive, and perhaps he does take some of it for granted. Personally, the only thing I can really complain about are his brief descriptions of some the alternate legends, as there was little mentioned as to WHY there were differing versions. I would have liked to have seen more on each subject in general in the book. However, so far I have not come across such a balanced book on Arthurian Legend: (not too hard a read, but yet not too basic). I would recommend this book to one who is getting started in the legends, as it is arranged in an easy elementary storybook fashion. I would also recommend, however, reading &quot;La Morte D'Arthur&quot; by Sir Thomas Mallory concurrently. &quot;The Encyclopaedia&quot; would be a great addition to any library of Arthurian Legends, and I think it's shame it is out of print."},{"Title":"The Illustrated Encyclopaedia of Arthurian Legends","review":"I am taking an Arthurian legends course this summer, so I'm using this as a companion for Le Morte 'd Arthur."},{"Title":"The Illustrated Encyclopaedia of Arthurian Legends","review":"Other reviews claimed that this Encyclopedia was scholarly and exhaustive, so I purchased it to aid in my research. Not only did it NOT include characters from the less popular/canonical texts, but it had entries that were missing information, had incorrect information, used spellings of names that I have never seen elsewhere without including their variant spellings, and didn't bother to say from which texts the characters it was describing came. The complete unreliability of the Encyclopedia was such that even if it did contain an entry for a character that I needed to look up, I would be hesitant to trust what it has to say.The Encyclopedia would be a great buy for someone who has a mild interest in Arthurian legend, but is useless as a tool for a scholar. Its beautiful illustrations and designs are a saving grace--it makes a good coffee table book, but if you are looking for a book that includes correct and thorough information, I would recommend Christopher Bruce's Arthurian Names Dictionary or Norris J.

Drawing upon her scholarship in 16th and 17th century poetry, Johnson writes a lucid and energetic verse noted for a unique musical form and literary vision that will fully engage and reward her reader's attention. Pater Noster: This garden is a betrayal. It has nothing/to do with me--the brooding columbine,/anemones measuring the wind, the rose/involved, roes interrupted//not in their browse through roes of indigo./Cardinals hinge on air, draw flight/in a thread of scarlet.

She speaks every sentence with knowledge, form, and creativity that brings life alive. We could all learn from her ability to view life through intensely descriptive lenses that help you value what's important."},{"Title":"Leviathan With a Hook: Poems","review":"Kimberly Johnson's book of poetry Leviathan with a Hook is a thoughtful pondering of natures elements both small and large. Its panoramic view ranges from the crawling insects, creeping in the mud, to grand cliffs and birds, clouds, oceans, and the infinity of sand. I loved how Johnson was capable of writing such descriptive locations with few words. In each poem I could imagine a place, a feeling, a life question, a temperature, the surrounding wildlife, the surrounding humans, etc. This is only because Johnson has left things up to the reader as far as interpretation is concerned - even the poetry can be concise and specific. I think that is the most respectful and useful literature to read. I found it both uplifting and mind-opening.I think Johnson purposefully separated this book into several sections. I could be missing something - but I equated them with first mud, second desert, third coastline. Insects are in there too - we mustn't forget the insects. The poems flow from one to the other without a hitch, which makes this book particularly satisfying to read. I though each poem was successful in conjuring memories in the reader. I kept saying to myself, I know exactly what she means. She is indeed observant - but in a way that we can all understand. Poetry is for understanding things we already know subconsciously. The things we should be laughing at, but we don't notice. The things we should notice, but never do. The things we once noticed, but forgot. I cherished the feeling of hunger for nature this poetry induced in me. Read out doors."},{"Title":"Leviathan With a Hook: Poems","review":"Kimberly Johnson's Leviathan With a Hook beautifully explores the use of language in describing the things around us. In \\"Conception\\", she describes the process of conception and birth using the letters of the alphabet to begin each successive stanza. Here is a taste of it: \\"Receptacle/Shell-shapes: ear, mouth, womb./Transparencies--umbilicus,eyelid./Capillaries thread like thin blue language.\\" Just like the process of a life being created can progress from A to Z, so can the process of creating a poem. Just like the act of conception can create new life, the process of piecing words together can create, or expose new meaning. Johnson uses creative, vivid language to endow her poetry with weight and personality. In describing dividing cells in \\"Mitosis\\": \\"Simple, supple, so elegant...they are selfless.\\" The language here gives a sense of smooth, effortless division and gives the poem a fluid feeling which matches the subject of cell division perfectly. Language is imperfect, however. The book's title is a Biblical reference in which the power of an incredibly ferocious beast is compared to God's power. However, the term leviathan does not adequately describe something that cannot be described. Johnson ultimately explores the concept that the ability of language is limited in describing the true meaning of things. In \\"The Heart of Light\\" she describes \\"that thunder is a counterfeit, a sign,/a poem of lightning, meager and infirm,/deficient as the name leviathan.\\" Poems, ultimately, are just a sign, or an attempt at representing the world around us, but are ultimately imperfect representations, just like she describes thunder as a counterfeit sign of lightning. Although she acknowledges the limitations of language, Kimberly Johnson still clearly has mastered the beautiful application of language in Leviathan With a Hook."},{"Title":"Leviathan With a Hook: Poems","review":"Definitely on my must read list for poetry lovers.

The summary on the back of the book is misleading claiming that Loye is going to give information on forecasting methods that will help many professionals predict the future.Loye covered a variety of topics. The reading was never boring, as it moved smoothly from anecdotes of historical figures who have accurately predicted the future, to an explanation on how predictions are affected by using the left and/or right hemispheres of the brain, and finally the psychological processes that we, as humans, use to arrive at certain predictions. The most interesting theory that Loye brought up was that dreams often foreshadow our futures.The biggest concern that I had was the looseness of terminology that Loye uses. The book claims to apply to forecasting, yet forecasting, being an informed decision that comes after examining multiple perspectives, is not described in Loye's work. What Loye depicts are predictions that come from mostly cognition, and less knowledge.I am inclined to recommend readers to take a look at this book. It is an enjoyable read that is brimming with intelligence. I just warn readers that if they are looking for a scientific approach to forecasting, you might want to look elsewhere."},{"Title":"The Adventure Starts Here ...the Novice Amateur Experience: A Beginners Guide to Competitive Showing","review":"I wish I could remember how I found this wonderful little &quot;easy reading&quot; book.

In the first part of this book, he provides vivid and interesting examples that reveal ways in which tacit assumptions and implicit patterns of culture can influence interviewers to make mistakes in their research techniques. What is particularly inspiring about this book, is that Briggs refuses to throw up his hands in despair about the validity of field research. He shows how understanding cultural dynamics associated with interviewing can provide useful ways to develop stronger interviews. In sum, the cultural diversity that he documents provides a stepping stone for learning about others rather than an obstacle that prevents one from researching other individuals, groups, and communities. This book is a good antidote to the practice of ethnographic navel gazing, and it should be useful to folklorists, anthropologists, sociologists, reporters, and anyone else who learns and practices interview techniques."},{"Title":"The Status Civilization","review":"I wish I could find more books by Robert Sheckley.&quot;The Status Civilization&quot; is one of those maddening littlepieces which reaches out and grabs your attention withthe sheer _audacity_ of scope and ideas, only to fallshort when it comes to delivering substance. Part of theproblem is that it's a very short book; I read it in anEnglish paperback as part of a two-novels-in-one, a la AceDouble.The story starts with a familiar premise : Earth, havingbecome an enlightened techno-utopia, no longer executesits criminals. Instead, such deviant elements are dumpedon the surface of a vaguely livable planet calledOmega. For good measure, the convicts' minds are wiped cleanof all past memories. Our protagonist is one of these convicts.He's been sent up for murder. Problem is, he doesn't want to believe it. Problem with that is that the memories leaking out from &quot;beneath the surface&quot; seem to indicate that he is.At the beginning, at least, he's got a few more importantthings to worry about, like surviving. See, Omega doesn't have nice Earth values concerning the sanctity of life. Instead, a citizen's status is dependent upon how many people he can kill...but only according to the rules.He narrowly escapes death, but only at the price of killingin self-defense. This touches off a round of self-doubt, but, at the same time, catapults him intoOmegan society as the proprietor of a poisioners' shop. This gives him time to become acquainted with some of the more quaint Omegan customs, like mandatory substance addiction and the worship of Evil. Later, he finds himself the unhappy subject of a Hunt, and an unwilling participant in In the absence of patriachal authority, our happy band of convicts have developed a uniquely maladaptive society - one in which death is celebrated above all else. No wonder the average lifespan is only three years.Eventually he uses his remaining morals to drag himself out of the muck and effect an escape. The Earth he finds is superfically a triumph of Utopian central planning : everyone has a job, everyone seems happy, crime and war are unknown, et. al. Robots cater to all humankind's needs. The worship of life and Good are central tenets of civilization. It is, oddly enough, a complete antithesis of Omega. Thepeople are SO open-hearted that they don't even mind hispresence, despite the fact that he sticks out like a sorethumb.Something is wrong. Very wrong. Naturally, finding thiswrong and curing it (and coincidentally coming to terms withthe split images of himself as killer/saviour) ties offthe novel.I say &quot;ties off&quot; instead of &quot;ends&quot;, because that's what itfeels like : a stopping point for a novel that could havegone on longer. By the end of the book, I had become attached to the nutty, schizoid worlds of Omega and Earth, and curious as to the motives of the robots who are (implicitly) controlling them both.Omegan life is downright entertaining; like a little boy poring through travel books crossed with the thrill of a police novel. Sheckley manages it all with a sort of deadpan/matter-of-fact narrative that manages to slip events past one so quickly that they're felt rather than seen.The sheer weight of ideas reminds me of Phillip K. Dick novels. Perhaps this one, like so many of his, was written under a short contract. How else could one get delightful scenes of cowering outside the door to Hell's Congregation in a blizzard, or the twisted dual religions of Evil and Good that dominate Omega and Earth? Make no mistake...Sheckley can more than hold his own in astonishment.I wanted more...but unless Hollywood picks up and films this one (not likely in the wake of Freejack's flop at the box office)it probably won't be forthcoming. If you can find this for a reasonable price (if you live in the UK, for instance, and have access to paperback reprints), give it a try. I'd be hesitant to pay great amounts for it used, unless I was more of a Sheckley fan...but it's books like this that keep me looking for more."},{"Title":"The Status Civilization","review":"The Status Civilization is an excellent tale that never gets old. Will Barrent is among a group of prisoners from Earth who have had their memories wiped and are left to live on the planet Omega. This is a planet ruled by criminals where you advance by being bad and devising clever ways to beat the law. One may recall the film Escape from New York where Manhattan Island is made a prison. This world is different in that there are class systems in this world (the highest appears to be Hadji) and there are actual laws that govern. One of the best ways to advance is to find ways to get around the law.Barrent is almost killed by a group of Hadjis but manages to outsmart them and this allows him to gain a \\"Free Man\\" status. Challenges are thrown at him that he keeps overcoming and slowly advances. He encounters an underground organiztion whose goal is to get back to Earth and reclaim their place there. Eventually Barrent will become the agent to execute their plan. When the reader finally learns what is going on back on Earth, it is not what you expect and like the Twilght Zone there is an ironic end to the tale.The book that I read also included Sheckley's Notions:Unlimited collection of short stories. These are each excellent twist ending tales that would be perfect for episodes of The Twilight Zone. From a tale with a creature that is similar to The Blob, to a planet with dangerous winds, a world inhabited by a lone Earthman that other Earth people think he is lying about his heritage. My favorite of these tales is called Double Indemnity where a time traveler attempts a new scheme at insurance fraud.Each tale is excellent and as good as any short science fiction tale being written today. If you can get your hands on a copy of this book, don't hesitate to get it! An extremely pleasant surprise that will not disappoint you!"},{"Title":"The Status Civilization","review":"Science fiction is often called the \\"literature of ideas\\" and this short novel exemplifies that concept. The idea in \\"The Status Civilization\\" is to strand an innocent man convicted of murder on a prison planet where all is topsy-turvy. The only rule of law is that all must break the law. If you don't break the law, you get into trouble. Murder is the highest ideal of the citizen. Drug addiction is mandatory. They have a church on this planet, but it worships \\"Evil\\", and yes, attendance is mandatory.The planet Omega is like a space-age Australia back when the British used that contintent to dump off their criminals and social malcontents. New arrivals are criminals joining fellow criminals who must now form their own society. But in this case, all have their memories erased before being stranded on Omega. They are given only one bit of self-knowledge: The crime they committed on Earth.The hero is Will Barrent, convicted of murder -- a murder he no longer remembers, of course. The problem is, he has the nagging feeling he is innocent, and seems to only want to be good and do good. But now he must try to fit in with an entire planet consisting of and run by other criminals.It's a terrific premise, and in the hands of one of the true masters of science fiction, this short novel becomes a marvelously entertaining read. Expect nothing but nonstop action, and little in the way of desciption of anything that does not move along the plot. For example, Sheckley wastes no time with describing scenary or filling out the details of the environment of an alien planet -- it's just bare bones movement of the protagonist doing this, and doing that, as he works his way through his terrible situation.In my personal pantheon of favorite science fiction gods, Robert Sheckley is among the top three. The primary reason is this: He is a master of a certain kind of cynical, dry and wry irony that is nothing less than hilarious. It's Sheckley's extremely unique STYLE that separates him from the run-of-the-mill sf writer.What really pushes this seemingly pulp yarn over the top to a solid 5-star book is the brilliant way it ends, revealing an unexpected depth of meaning and message. It's a sizzling commentary on post-modern society that cuts to the bone. Extraordinary."},{"Title":"The Status Civilization","review":"&quot;The Status Civilization&quot;, albeit a quick read, is highly entertaining as a satire and as a bit of science fiction. Scheckley's prose is terse and easy to read, the chapters well cut, and the stroyline quick moving that makes the book impossible to put down. The 150 pages disappear in a blink. The only part of the book that is laborious are the final few chapters, which act as a satire on modern living, and are a bit dense with criticism although tey do employ interesting satiric conventions. As a bit of dystopian/utopian literature, it is well worth reading, especially along side Kurt Vonnegut's &quot;Player Piano&quot;."},{"Title":"The Status Civilization","review":"A Marxist dogma, a part of the state religion of the Soviet Union, was that the future Communist society will experience the withering away of the state. There is a book from the 1970s called 1001 Soviet Political Joke; joke number 22 asks whether there will be a KGB under future Communism. The answer is no: citizens will arrest themselves for sedition. Sheckley was probably not aware of this, and hit upon the same idea independently: on a future peaceful Utopian Earth, people are brainwashed from the early childhood so that if they harbor criminal or seditious thoughts, they become amnesiac and in this state take the next spaceship to a prison planet, where life is living hell, and murder is the favorite sport. This novel follows one such man from his amnesiac awakening on a prison planet-bound spaceship to his discovery of the secret of peace on Earth."},{"Title":"The Status Civilization","review":"After reading Sheckley's short stories, this novel just seemed to drag on forever.

The formalised violence is regulated by a strict law where drug emporiums, poison and antidote sellers, assassin's guilds go to church to worship evil Dark. Everyone is obligated to attend sleep clinic and build up drug addiction. Will burrows into his almost-wiped memories with the help of outcasted mutants and finds certainty of being innocent. He meets underground movement: people who were sent there not for real crimes but for the offense of nonconformity on Earth. Will is sent to hijack Earth ship to return and organize resistance on Earth. He is faced with Utopia which as alienating as the Omega. No cash is needed, no police force, no military. Everything is run by androids and robots. And the identity of the person who framed him for murder turns out to be the final consequence of any world where order and conformity are valued above all else.Two (2) stars. Written in 1960 the social commentary has certain charm and style. The laws of the Omega keep the reader guessing what awaits in the next corner. The mirror, Earth, has lost touch with its technology and automated machines make wild comedy. The terse story in 140 pages leaves the characterization, moral laws and satire about social status in Omega limited and predictable. The super hero Will solves all puzzles in a whim and bulldozes forward. A fast-food adventure story."},{"Title":"Across a Wine-Dark Sea","review":"This is one of the most fascinating and original books I've read in a long, long time. And even though it wasn't heavy on the romance and was more plot than character driven (my usual preference) I literally could not put it down.Thalassa, born and raised as an Amazon warrior, is happy with her life. It isn't an easy one and her people are constantly at war with men but she is free. Fighting and protecting her sisters is what she lives for - until the day she is abducted by Dorian, King of the Merfolk, who sweeps her away to his world under the sea. She is furious and despises him immediately but tempers her rage when she realizes that her Goddess has ordained their match. Eventually this gentle God-like man with super human powers begins to tear down her defenses with kindness, fairness and patience and allows her to accept her fate and his love. But she never forgets her beloved Amazon sisters. And when she overhears that their lives are in danger she and Dorian risk everything to enter the battle.Filled with historical and fantasy details that I've never before read about, I learned so many amazing things about the strong but doomed ancient tribe of woman warriors known as the Amazons and the mythical Merfolk who created a peaceful life under the sea. Interspersed with the fantasy elements are rich historical details of daily life and survival in those brutal times where women were little more than slaves. There were several sub-plots and secondary characters that were all equally riveting and I couldn't turn the pages fast enough. This book is brutal and heartbreaking and filled with three-dimensional characters. It's not light and it's not funny and it's not my typical reading material but if you find it do not pass it by, it is a truly incredible book. An unforgettable one."},{"Title":"Across a Wine-Dark Sea","review":"Though I found this book in the romance section of the book store, it could easily have been listed as historical fiction. It is apparent from the beginning that the author has thoroughly researched the early Mediterranean cultures. Set in 1260 B.C., it is the story of Thalassa, a young Amazon warrior, and Dorian, King of the Merpeople. Ms. Bryan skillfully weaves historical facts with an imaginative, but convincing story of the Merpeople.Thalassa, a fiecely independent Amazon warrior, was chosen by the Elders to be the mate for Dorian. Set against the backdrop of the struggle between the Greeks and the Amazons the story tells of Thalassa's struggle to accept the role of mate to Dorian. At first she resists becoming a &quot;slavemate&quot; to Dorian. After spending time with Dorian and the Merpeople, she is able to appreciate the respect they have for all living things. She eventually is faced with the choice of a future with the kind and honorable Dorian or as an Amazon warrior.Across A Wine-Dark Sea is a well-written historical romance which I find thoroughly enjoyable - every time I read it."},{"Title":"Across a Wine-Dark Sea","review":"This story is listed under \\"romance novel\\" but there is surprisingly little romance involved with the story. The romantic aspect of the story is halting and feels a little artificial. The author even stops writing when the \\"happily ever after\\" part is about to begin. An odd choice, if you ask me. It's largely an artistic story about ancient Greeks, Amazons, and sea-dwelling humanoids. I'd probably label this under \\"drama\\" and \\"fiction\\" rather than romance, but it was an interesting read.Go for it!"},{"Title":"Across a Wine-Dark Sea","review":"This is one of much better storys that i have read in a long time. Filled with historical and fantasy details that I've only read before. The author has also clearly reasearched a lot about the early mediterranean cultures. You can see it from the beginning. Also a lot amazing things about the strong but doomed ancient tribe of woman warriors known as the Amazons and the mythical Merfolk who created a peaceful life under the sea. Interspersed with the fantasy elements are rich historical details of daily life and survival in those brutal times where women were little more than slaves. There were several subplots and secondary characters that were all equally riveting and I couldn't turn the pages fast enough.

Well worth rereading."},{"Title":"Across a Wine-Dark Sea","review":"After I read &quot;Beneath a sapphire sea&quot; I absolutely had to read the others in this unique series. However, This is certainly not up to &quot;Sapphire sea.&quot; The story-telling is flat and too informative for a romance. There is definitely not enough character development. Also, Ms. Bryan hasn't learned the basic idea of telling a story in this---Show, don't tell. I want to see the characters actions, not read pages and pages of boring thoughts on the same idea. However, The subject was interesting and unique, and the characters do grow on you."},{"Title":"The Casebook of a Working Occultist","review":"This is a very different occult book which is in two parts.The first part details Mrs St George's initiation into magic(k) and here experiences with the elemental initiations. She does not go into practical techniques but keeps a diary approach preserving her groups secrets.The second part which is by far the most interesing is a collection of cases which she investigated. If nothing else they are very readable and do contain lots of info on the sort of thing a practical occultism _may_ come across.The book itself is quite short but well written and can be read quite quickly."},{"Title":"Poisoning for Profit: The Mafia and Toxic Waste in America","review":"The two university professors who authored this book did a very credible job of researching the solid waste industry. They authors reveal the practices that resulted in toxic chemical wastes being spread over highways and natural areas to avoid the costs of reprocessing the wastes or of properly disposing of the wastes.The practices revealed in this book should be reviewed these many years later to see if there are any current waste disposal practices that cause a similar contamination of our environment.This book is a good model for the investigation of industrial practices.J"},{"Title":"Poisoning for Profit: The Mafia and Toxic Waste in America","review":"Book was suppose to be in very good condition, but was received in fair condition at best.

I purchased this as supplementary reading as 2009 marks Hadley's 350th anniversary. The text is wonderfully detailed giving specific references to families, locations, significant events, and day to day life. The narrative flows like a story, not a dry listing of facts. You get a real feel for the integration of religious, farming, industrial, social and human-scale events in the context of pre- and early industrial-age rural New England. Thanks to Google-Books and Amazon for making this rare work available. I am very pleased to be able to read and re-read this history."},{"Title":"History of Hadley: Including the early history of Hatfield, South Hadley, Amherst and Granby, Massachusetts","review":"The book was delivered in excellent condition, as described in the add.

It tells you the required climate and soil conditions, which trees and shrubs will grow in your area. It has a very detailed guide to pruning also. There are also some good suggestions for planning and designing your yard. I like how it refers to plants by the common names as well as the latin names; it makes it a lot easier to find what you're looking for. I'm no expert, but it seems pretty complete. It certainly covers all the trees and shrubs available at my local nurseries."},{"Title":"Complete Guide to Trees and Shrubs","review":"This is not quite what I had hoped for in a guide to identifying different types of trees and shrubs, but it is still a useful reference.

My son is learning alot from this book.I highly recommend it. :0"},{"Title":"The Sealed Magical Book Of Moses","review":"I had known someone who used to deal with the seals of Moses and became quite powerful with the power of these seals. He mentions one story of how he mentally 'willed' the tree in front of his home to be taken out and out of a blue sky, lightning struck and destroyed it! Unfortunately, the requirement to be pure in the soul as well as body was not met and he couldn't keep doing it anymore. He found it difficult to stay away from all sexual stimulations. I'm sure you could understand why as not even some priests couldn't stay away from it - those scandals with the priests in the news of sexual abuse and molesting people lol.After such a story from my friend, I became interested in how to do such things myself. He couldn't show me as he's far away and then fate hit me and I found this book! These seals work but you need to put time into meditation and remain pure of soul and body to do them. As with any kinds of magick, you have to be dedicated or the stuff will leave you.The book starts out with the 22 cards of the Major Arcana of the tarot and how it is connected with certain psalms of the Bible. Then, it goes onto the seals of Moses.When I first read the stuff about the three types of herbs needed, I wasn't too sure if I could get them to do the ritual. Sure the publishers have a kit but I asked them how much the kit costs and they said it was $20 - I don't think so !!!! Fortunately, I found a nice occult shop nearby and was able to get the required 3 herbs (Hyssop, Sacred Bark, Laurel). Of course, if you don't have any occult shops nearby, then you might as well dish out $20 for the kit if you want to do this.I'm an experienced magician and I've done all forms of advanced magick and this book is one of my highest rated books !Remember, the requirement to have a pure intent and pure of sexual stimulations is needed.Good luck !!"},{"Title":"The Sealed Magical Book Of Moses","review":"If your someone who dosen't want to perform witchcraft because of all the preperation and time,or you feel that it's against God then this book is for you. I have a very high regard for God but have always been tempted by other sorts of white magic.I was on a search to find out how I could perform magic for God and not some diety,god,or goddess I didn't know anything about or do endless magical preperations with items I couldn't obtain or would cost me a fortune to get and then I found William Oribello's books. They are very plain and simple and easy to perform.The publishers even include a kit for you. I have been researching different types of magic for 10 yrs. and this makes sense.All the other books I've read ask you to do outrageous things,purchase items that you have to bless before you even do your work the list goes on and on. So, if you need some extra money,a new love,or outlook on life and don't want to commit yourself to a coven to get it,Then this is recommended and if it does nothing for you the you can always return it."},{"Title":"The Sealed Magical Book Of Moses","review":"This is valuable information to have on hand and give you an insight as to the depth of what the organized religions won't tell you about. The power that Moses had, the ability to command things to happen like he did wasn't just a one way street, it was a two-way comunication and his egyptian knowledge of magick was transferred to the monotheistic belief system he helped to set up. Too bad, though, that the medallion is no longer available. Although, through my research, I have been able to decipher the proper name needed for on the medallion in the ancient alphabet and I will be creating a new medallion that will become available shortly for those that are interested."},{"Title":"The Sealed Magical Book Of Moses","review":"I bought this book in the Spring of 2010 - read it several times and while doing that went ahead and purchases the Key to the Tarot from A.E. Waite & a full deck of Coleman/Waite Tarot cards, And now as I pen down this Verdict its August 2011. I already had faith & power working for me because Im of a Jewish faith.Lets deal with the cards I fell for the supposed wonders that might come about if I did his assigned homework, yeah for awhile, but after reading Waites books and others I realize Oribello doesn't have the gift, his 22 letters and prescriptions are so way off the mark of the common road that I discarded his predictions and went with others I found to be more Authentic. The Seals work if you spend time & diligence with study,prayer,spiritual devotion and have a normal life style along with some common sense in every day efforts. Lastly the thing I did really stick to in Oribello's book, was his catchy mystery interpretation of what the life of Moses meant and the backside of the mountain and the burning bush. Thats it!! All the books on or about the seals from Moses are copies of copies,don't waste your money buying everyone of them that says Moses seals, but if you want two good books, in your Library get the one from Henri Gemache & Joseph H.Peterson . Good luck. hope that helped!"},{"Title":"The Sealed Magical Book Of Moses","review":"When I got this book I expected it to be more about 6th and 7th book of Moses, along the lines of the book edited by Joseph Peterson, which seems to be unsurpassed if you're looking for that kind of information.The bulk of the Sealed Magical Book of Moses revolves around preparing yourself to work with the seals from the 6th and 7th book of Moses, by meditating on the symbolism of the 22 cards of major arcana and the corresponding sections from the Psalm 119. Psalm 119 is divided into 22 section - each one belonging to one letter of the Hebrew alphabet, and each one endowed with meaning and associated with one of the cards from Tarot's major arcana. There are other books that deal with meditations and interpretations of the major arcana cards for those who want to get even deeper into it - books of the Golden Dawn Tarot series by Paul Foster Case, and others that relate to the study of Cabbala and the meaning and the power of the Hebrew letters.The information regarding actually working with the seals is minimal, and as such is available in just about any other book related to 6th and 7th book of moses - though here it is further simplified and for that reason it may appeal to those who prefer to keep things simple.While the author mentions how he likes to keep thing simple, and I personally do appreciate simplicity, he is also trying to by-pass the purification of one's mind, heart, and body which is customarily recommended in most esoteric traditions, and which I personally consider important, even when working with \\"good\\" magic. The more one works with \\"magic\\" or \\"prayer\\" or esoteric practices in any shape or form, as one's inner power increases, so everything within the individual becomes magnified and everything that is within the individual begins to manifest faster and faster and with greater power, and here is where those who do not take the time to regularly purify their minds and hearts sooner or later stumble or fall and get stuck. All the power is already within each individual and if one were looking for shortcuts, the the main shortcut would be by cleansing one's mind and heart and removing the inner obstacles to the \\"light and power\\" within. In that respect, I consider this book more of a good start, rather than the final word on working with the seals."},{"Title":"The Sealed Magical Book Of Moses","review":"I was very happy with the knowledge and insight I got from the book . One has to learn and master the five books of Moses from the Holy Bible to see God's precepts and commandments. Most important, one must obey the ten commandments and follow God's law in order to get the benefits of the Sealed Magical Book of Moses. The old book of testament shows one that God detest people who perform BLACK MAGIC. In fact, Deuteronomy 18:10 Deuteronomy 18:11, and Leviticus 19:31, Leviticus 19 :26 made it clear. Using the Sealed Magical Book of Moses however is different because the person is using the bible and psalm to seek answers. Again one has to follow his or her instinct when using that book. According to William Alexander Oribello Moses was a true initiate of God's wisdom, but those who opposed him which were the false magicians perverted the sacred science of magic just to satisfy their own selfish needs. The book specified that one can bring judgement to oneself if used to harm others. The book is to learn about the knowledge of God and help oneself but it is not to harm others."},{"Title":"The Sealed Magical Book Of Moses","review":"My fellow spiritual truth seekers, Amazon only sells the book but the kit you need to get from the publisher, Mr. Beckley. Interestingly enough, the kit alone is $25 + $5 shipping. The kit has all the three holy herbs needed, three white candles, Mr. Oribello's special Moses incense and lastly the Shemmah Medallion printed on gold parchment paper. The original metallic manufacturer of the Shemmah Medallion has gone out of business but you can take it yourself to a jewelry store and make it yourself with extra money. [...] The only last thing I would say about this book is that the seals printed on the pages are rather small and a bit difficult to see clearly sometimes but you can try finding better printed seals elsewhere. And as always, try not to abuse these spiritual blessings or karma will always find a way to kick you in the buttocks!
