I recommend this book to everyone."},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"Although I have read Frankenstein once before in high school, I was not mature or alert enough to realize what a gem I was reading. This novel, if you haven't yet learned, is nothing like the various incarnations of Frankenstein movies you may have run across over the years. None of these pop-culture references can prepare you for the monster within the novel. You will not find bolts in the monsters neck, nor will you find some illiterate creature. What you will find is an abundant amount of sadness and emotion.The story, which takes form in a frame narrative, Frankenstein is not actually told by Victor Frankenstein, or by his created monster, but rather a third party who is as interesting as the title character.When Victor's tale begins, we are introduced to a young man whose thirst for knowledge leads him to give life to biological inanimate objects. After a successful experiment where these objects are transformed into an eight-foot-tall creature, Victor allows his monster to escape his laboratory. It is important to note that, this is where most people I talk to feel a certain level of disgust for Victor. What follows can only be summed up as a cat and mouse game between the monster and Victor.One overlooked and important part of the novel is the amount of emotion that is involved in the story. Without ruining anything, I feel that this is easily the most interesting aspect within the story. As I mentioned before, this is not the illiterate monster that you may have been told about. When the monster first confronts Victor about life and human interactions, it is truly a remarkable moment in literature.There are many moral lessons to be learned from this novel, including the importance of compassion and empathy. Similarly, it can easily be identified as feminist literature, which teaches lessons in it self.I give this novel five out of five stars."},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"I was assigned this book for homework. It was an interesting read. Its not one of those \\"feel-good\\" books. Mary Shelley portrays the world-view of \\"The way you act, good or bad, is based on how you are treated by others.\\" According to Shelley, if you are rejected by the world, hated by others, and despised by your own creator, its \\"ok\\" to murder innocent people and hate those who are happy and have joy.

I began to feel sympathy for the monster and understood why he became so angry with his heartless creator, Frankenstein who abandoned him and left him on his own. The violent reactions the monster receives from the human characters in the story reflect a truth about human nature in that we are repulsed by ugly things whether people, animal, or things (like fecal matter). The human characters' negative reactions toward the lonely monster is a reflection of their own prejudice and true inner ugliness. Let's face it, if you are outwardly beautiful or pretty, you will be treated better than people who are average or unattractive. Mary Shelley's story defines this truth to its utmost extremity."},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"I was told to read this for a class, and I wasn't too enhusiastic, but I started to read it.

Writing of this time was not based on sex, or even drinking and drugs. Unlike many stories and movies created in the past thirty years, this plot makes sense without all the sex, drugs, and alcohol that is added to appeal the audience. Mary Wollstonecraft Shelly was only eighteen when she wrote this book! Anyone one who can create a book with all the emotions of a scientist and the horrid monster he created, definently deserves a five star review!"},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"The number of reviews for the printed versions of Frankenstein is overwhelming...read them to learn more about the story. My review is of the audio cassettes put out by Monterey Soundworks Audio Theatre series. I recently discovered these gems and they are AWESOME! You are treated to an extremely well written and beautifully performed dramatization of the novel. The acting and sound effects are utterly enthralling and succeed in sucking you right into the action. I am impressed with how they dealt with some of the possible auditory limitations inherent in this piece. For example, in the novel, Dr. Frankenstein works in his laboratory ALONE. Since their goal is to dramatize and not just read, how do they portray his actions to a listener without relying upon extensive monologue? They seamlessly enlarge the role of a minor character and the dialogue between him and the good doctor becomes the vehicle (and no, it's not Igor!). Also, Ms. Shelley never went into great detail on the science or methods of creating and re-animating the creature. This adaptation does a good job of filling in those details.This is a top notch production and I urge you to seek out this and Monterey's other titles if you can find them!(Frankenstein ISBN #1569945136) Great entertainment for the whole family, at home or in the car.

Enjoyed it very much."},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"After seeing at least five versions of this tale in film - one of my great childhood monster loves - I was happy to finally read the novel. As so often occurs with classics, I was as surprised as I was fascinated.For starters, the characters are far more subtle than any of the film versions: Victor F appears as a brooding and obsessed genius, but also as a great lover of life and nature. The monster, who is an articulate and literate creature who read Goethe, is even more interesting, from his hopeful beginning to his bitter reaction at rejection and his thirst for vengence. His eloquence was vivid and his pain horribly realistic.But the work is also fascinating as a window into the mind of the Romantics, who at once strove to reject the rationalism of the Enlightenment yet reflected it. The creature starts off empty and what it becomes is due entirely to his experience. Knowledge is not always good, etc.Finally, the themes are timeless and full of conflict: creativity giving birth to unimaginable destruction, tampering with nature as its necessities overwhelm even genius, and the like. THe book is a kaleidescope of philosophical reflection. The pain of the creator and the monster alike are inescapably linked like father and son.I did find the style of the book a bit difficult. It is full of florid rhetoric and lengthy circumlocutions, as the doctor and then the monster tell their stories in almost identical prose.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"I am an eighth grader that chose this novel to read for my English, it is one of the few books that I actually enjoyed, this book is a classic example of a horror tale, (it may not satisfy the horror book lover who reads Stephen King), it was one of the first books in the modern \\"robot\\" genre, a fictional autobiography of a man so obsessed with creating life, that without thinking of the consequences, he toils day and night wandering around graveyards, collecting material for his horrible deed and working in his lab, anxiously awaiting the completion of his horrible project and finally when it is completed.... O.K., I don't want to give away the whole story. I do want to say that this book lacks a great amount of detail as to how he was doing his horrible deed, but probably if it did, in Shelley's time, it wouldn't have been published. I also want to add that at times the book drags on as Frankenstein is telling about his remorse for the creation of his \\"wretched abomination\\", but not alot of times. I also want to add, for the ones of you reading this who saw the movie, that the book is totally in every way different than the movie, which drastically modified Frankenstein character, added some new ones (Igor) and changed the setting."},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"If you want to read Frankenstein as a classic horror story, you are missing Everything! Outwardly, especially due to the bastardization of the enigmatic and prophetic novel by cinema and mass media, people look at Frankenstein as a novel about a monster. End of story. But Shelley meant so very much more. Frankenstein is a desperate, angry, pleading outcry against industrialization and the destruction of humanity by moderization and advancement. The creature was Shelley's way of saying &quot;where are we going?&quot; &quot;what have we done to man when science takes precedence over forthought?&quot; This is also a new persceptive of man as the creation of God and banishment of Adam. Instead, in Shelley's world, man has grabbed at the reigns and assummed the role as creator and, as God, is horrified at his creation. Frankenstein acts without thought, then hastily casts off his creation as an abomination. And, the creature, like man's pursuit of divinty, ravenously pursues his creator. Shelley asks if this is the relationship of man and God. Have we been rejected? Cast aside as a hideous mistake? Are we relentlessly pursuing a creator that sees us as an abomination? If you want to peer into Shelley's philosophical soul, read Frankenstein. Write in the margins. Puzzle over the questions. Ask yourself where you stand after you see the vision of Shelley. Of course, if you want a monster on a rampage, rent the movie. The black and white versions the best."},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"A great book, it's amazing how a dream can create such an incredible story. When I say forget the movies, it's because in the movies, even the original one with Boris Karloff, there is many things that are not in the book. For example, in the book, there is no lightning revival of the body, there is no hunchback assistant, it doesn't take place in some mystical castle on the edge of a cliff, but in a small student apartment. And, in my opinion, that is what makes it a great book. Allow me to explain.First, since the story is told by Dr Frankenstein to his new friend, Robert Walton, and since he feels ashame of himself, Dr Frankenstein is not willing to reveal his secret to anyone, nor say how it happened, because he fears someone might repeat his experience. That gives Dr Frankenstein a humanity which he doesn't have in the movies. In the different films, he looks more like a crazy fanatic scientist than anything else.Second, the fact that there is no hunchback is good because otherwise that shows how alone he was, how desperate his quest was that he didn't want anyone else involved in it. Hhe purposely isolated himself so not to bring to many attention on his research.Third, you see that Dr Frankenstein is not a crazy scientist living in a desolated castle, but rather a young scientist still in university.Finally, one thing I liked as well is that the monster is not, as in the movies, a grunting 8 foot man with bolts sticking out of his neck who scares people off without any reason. The monster is an articulate men who reads, talks, writes english perfectly. You know why he hates humanity that much, because he's been treated so badly by everyone.All in all, a fantastic book, a great story."},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"Assuming that the people who are going to be interested in this book are going to be people who have seen the movie and want to compare it to the book, yes, the book is equally horrifying, and with no visual aid whatsoever (in the version that I read). This, to me, is a testament to Shelley's writing skill. Victor Frankenstein is portrayed not as a mad scientist but as an ambitious, emotional, lovesick, scholarly human being. The monster, too, is human. The best books are the ones that we can relate to, and we relate better to truly human characters. I actually felt more sorrow for the monster than I did for old Vic; I, too, have much love in my heart, but have said and done cruel things to people who have angered me, who have shunned me or wronged me. Human beings are capable of great good and great evil (since Eve ate from the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil) and if we are not loved, we become evil. I also empathized with Vic a little, though, for I know how it feels to accomplish/acquire something and find out later that I never really wanted it. I could empathize with both sides of the conflict, and it taught my pendulum-like ego that there are some things in life that we cannot control, and that no matter how successful we are, we need people. We have to care.All of this, combined with more-than-adequate imagery, combine to make this one of the most powerful books I've ever read."},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"This is a wonderful piece of literature, both moving and morally powerful. Frakenstein and his creation each moved me to sympathy and contempt, and I was left torn between caring for and loathing them at the same time. Without question this tale is worthy of its status as a classic, and is infinitely superior to the flat and superficial &quot;Dracula&quot;, a work it is often classified with, though I feel it is a far more meaningful work. If you haven't read &quot;Frankenstein&quot; you owe it to yourself to do so--you won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"Mary Shelley's classic book has often been regarded as the first science fiction novel. Brian Aldiss has referred to it as the first novel of the Scientific Revolution. It should be required reading of any college or college-bound student. The version I read was the original 1818 edition. In 1831, Mary Shelley made a number of changes (but, nothing of great import; for example, in the 1831 version Elizabeth is no longer Victor's cousin). I did read the author's new introduction to the 1831 edition however. This introduction is well done. In this novel, written in the epistolary form, a young (age 21) student at the University of Ingolstadt, Victor Frankenstein, discovers the method of imparting life to inanimate tissue. He uses his skills to construct a creature and to give it life. The creature's and Victor's lives are intertwined and the reader can detect much of Mary Shelley's early life as well. Her mother (i.e., her creator) died a few days after her birth. The female act of creation and its results is an aspect of this novel. Others have pointed out that this is a true female novel. Although, the monster &quot;inspires loathing&quot; in all who see him, I came to the conclusion that the real villian in this story was Victor Frankenstein. He allows his own creation to control him."},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"Shelly's Frankenstein is pretty well understood to be a flawed work, an amazing first attempt by a young author while also being a classic of literature. It is hard to say how I avoided reading it for so long but was surprised to find my friends negative attitudes on this book. Classics though must be read, so I devoured this over the course of a weekend and found the book quite enjoyable, however, at times I found some of its problems nearly overwhelming.The first problem Frankenstein has is that it is (as far as content goes) really a short story. I can't imagine it needing more than 60-100 pages, but Shelly inflates it to over 200, and for no discernable reason. The expanded length leads only to additional passages where Frankenstein himself is lying unconscious for months, or needless travelogue scenes which only serve to detract from the story. It might also be said that after 100 pages of melancholic whimperings from Frankenstein the reader has probably lost all sympathy toward the character. There are also certain plot elements that seem to repeat themselves a bit too often, but I the appeal of these elements will be based upon the reader.Ultimately, Frankenstien seems a great story that you occasionally feel compelled to skim through. There is a certain sloppiness (I am still not clear what happened to Edward--the only surviving Frankenstein, but I do know something about some of the townspeople mentioned in a letter which have NOTHING to do with the story), but when you put all that aside, the very heart of Frankenstein is an enjoyable read. The monster is a sympathetic one and I found myself glued to the pages as he first illustrated how he came to understand the world around him.Unlike Moby Dick which should never be abridged since so much of its irrelevance seems the primary point of the story (I often consider Ahab and the whale merely a sub-plot in Ishmael's life), Frankenstein could do with some good editing. Despite Frankenstein being a relatively short book to begin with, even 200+ pages feels a bit trying when all you are reading about is landscape and Frankenstein fainting."},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"Mary Shelly's 'Frankenstein' is a wonderfully horrifying look at one man's obsession and the evil that comes from it. Victor von Frankenstein, a young and ambitious scientist, discovers the secret of bestowing life on lifeless matter. After creating a hideously deformed being Frankenstein quits the experiment and leaves his 'monster' to his own devices. Months later Frankenstein pays the price as the 'monster' seeks it's revenge. Far from the Boris Karloff idea of Frankenstein's monster, Shelly's creature is one that invokes sympathy and pity as he is cast out from the human world and forced to endure existence without companionship. The basic theme of the work is also an important moral- that obsession, if unchecked, can only result in despair. Truly a great work and one that fans of horror have embraced for over one hundred years."},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"I enjoyed Frankestein, but I don't recommend the book for kids, unless they are really good readers. There are many words that are harder for kids to understand because it was written in old english. Frankestein was written very well even if it was a harder book. From the beginning to the end there was always some \\"action\\" or excitment going on. I don't want to discorage young readers from reading this book, but you'll understand it much better if you wait a couple of years to read it."},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"I found this book very interesting, considering the cultural clout attained by \\"Frankenstein\\" the monster. It was surprisingly not scary. There was very little descriptive gore. Some parts of it were actually bland and a little boring. The climax was obvious to the reader. I'm not sure if Mrs. Shelley meant for the reader to see what was going to happen to Dr. Frankenstein, or if she thought we'd be taken in as he was. I wasn't.The moral of the story has implications for the current push by some scientists to control the creation and termination of human life. I am glad that I had the chance to read this book. If it wasn't for the library book club doing a season on \\"Spooky Tales,\\" I would have never picked it up on my own."},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"In our modern day of of Judges legislatling their humanist agenda from the bench using society as lab for their social experiments and scientists playing God, this novel is more relevent today than it was the day Mary Shelley wrote it.A man creating life, what was once the domain reserved to women, what an idea. And certainly this novel shows consequences.Young Doctor Frankenstein in his vanity to create life andlearn new knowledge creates his being but fails to love it. Fails to provide for it. Fails to care for it.The conseqences are tragic. A tale of suffering and death caused upon innocent people as a consequence of one man's vanity."},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"This book is truly worthy of the term \\"classic\\". Mary Shelley began writing this novel at the young age of 18, yet managed to create a landmark work of fiction. The story is interwoven with ever-present social and ethical questions. What does it mean to be human? What are the consequences of using scientific technology to play the role of Creator? How far is too far when tampering with the order of the universe?Upon my first reading of this book I was pleasantly surprised to find that the creature is very intelligent and human-like, though grotesque in appearance. It is a shame that the Frankenstein creature is universally represented in the minds of the public as an oafish and very dimwitted monster with bolts in its neck and a green pallor. The true Frankenstein is far more intriguing. I love the parts of the book that are a first person narrative by the \\"creature\\".I highly recommend this book as it is an enjoyable piece of classic literature. If you are a fan of horror, read this for an understanding of the early roots of the genre that you so love, and that those roots actually formed intellectual arguments and contained actual substance. This book is a must read for the well rounded reader. In fact, had I graduated from high school and never read this book, I would begin to question the quality of my own education."},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"yes, yes, yes! This is what litterature is all about! Love, hate, life, death, good, evil.

And the language...shivers down my spine in excitement and joy! This book is the original story about the creation destroying the creator, and with that in mind the clice&eacute;s are non-existant.I urge, oh I urge, anybody with an interest in big litterature to read this masterpiece.

A scary, green, ugly monster that holds his hands up like in the maraca? Or is it a lonely and curious scientist that releases an alien creature into a society that kills and destroys? Mary Shelley named the ladder Frankenstein and she did so correctly.Who are the Frankenstein's in our society today, who are the enemies, who are the destroyers? The scary creatures of man or the quiet, good looking men who smile and fade away? This book is amazing because of the issues it presents by answering this question. This classic doesn't only use the language of the old British that sweep your tongue and give you the feeling of intellectual bliss, but it also poses a question that continues to be asked throughout the centuries. Who are the REAL Frankensteins?Mary Shelley knew her answer and gave evil a beautiful name that most have used and see each day. Evil is disguised in the finest clothing and the richest words, evil is not in the ugly, the uneducated, the unknown, it is in the men and women who question how to create. Curiosity of God's work, God's hands, God's power. At the end of this book you know where evil resides and who Frankenstein really is.

In the instance of Frankenstein's creation, the reader comes to realize that he is in fact very intelligent, and a genuinely kind-hearted being who is unfortunately forced to be cruel in order to survive.

This book is a literary masterpiece that sets a bar for terror that is yet to be surpassed.I was very impressed by the writing skill of Shelley. She does a terrific job telling this story, using three narrators that offer different points of view and voices.The monster is a character that elicited sympathy, respect, anger and hatred. He is intelligent and articulate in a way I did not expect. His ability to convey emotions and thoughts creates mixed emotions about him. Yet, because his hatred and anger prevail, these emotions prevailed in me too in my regards of him.Shelley shows the danger of allowing one's ambitions to overtake balance and reason. We see the character of Dr. Frankenstein forsake all to see this dream of creating life realized.

My teacher assigned this book for my english class and I assumed it to be exactly like all the other ones: boring, containing lots of big words, and having a bunch of quizzes over it. I do indeed have a test to look forward to, but the book was definitely not boring and although it had many &quot;big words&quot; they were not undecipherable. The plot is well developed and filled with interesting descriptions and events, however, she leaves many loose ends, but I don't want to spoil the story. Unlike the classic movie, Shelley describes Frankenstein's creature (no... Frankenstein is the SCIENTIST not the monster) as an intellectual, (how else could she use her fancy words...? ^_^) and as the story progresses, I winced at Frankenstein's stupidity. Towards the end, one finds it hard to decide which individual to pity, because both have suffered so much.

It took me a quarter of the book to finally get into Shelley's command and use of the native tongue, but from that point the reading sped up considerably. Yes, you will want to read this with a dictionary close at hand (thank you KINDLE for your fortuitous inclusion of an interactive, in-text dictionary feature).Frankenstein, and his Monster, are both used throughout the piece in ways that speak to the issues of creation, Creator, free will, and sovereignty.Inherent to the issue of \\"Monster's\\" path of death and destruction is the fact that Victor Frankenstein failed to, or was unwilling to, name his creation. Void of an identity, It was forced to spend its existence searching for an identity, as well as an acceptance from society.This is not your HORROR channel b/w movie adaptation. This s pure literature, filled with passion, with characters struggling with issues of existence that are paramount to ones survival in world in which they have been placed; love and hate, life and death, acceptance and rejection.While not a 'life changing' read in my opinion, it is a book with the power to cause one to evaluate one's life, and seek for a better, brighter tomorrow.Read the lines.

Great book! Can't get over it, Many Thanks for the Publishers for bringing back this timeless classic. 5 stars all the way."},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"This is a beautiful hardbound edition of a true and timeless classic of Western Literature. A story with great depth, it can be read on several levels: as a tale of horror bred by science, or, at a deeper symbolic level, as an indictment of God the Creator for his abandonment of the Human Race. What is the nature of consciousness, of self-awareness or of life itself? What is the Soul? Does it even exist? What is the Knowledge of Right and Wrong? These are all questions addressed, either directly or obliquely, in the text. I differ with the publisher only in its selection of the dust jacket illustration (bid deal, right?). This is a novel which must be read in the context of its time, the very early 19th century and the dawn of modern science (generation and application of electricity). The dust jacket illustration might lead a reader to assume a much later time. Also, contrary to the impression left by the picture, the story is not about goofy anatomical mistakes. It's not comical, and it's not a farce. The Creature does not have his \\"head on backwards\\" - in any sense of the word. He is born an outcast and learns to hate a Society which hates him merely on sight alone. I made a present of this volume to my niece, a high school student aspiring to a career in fiction, but I judiciously removed the absurd dust jacket before sending it. Great reasons for purchasing this edition are the inclusion of a scholarly introduction, along with a detailed chronology of the author's life bringing attention to other achievements in the literature of the time juxtaposed with contemporaneous world and political events. Burn the dust cover but buy the book. No one's perfect."},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"Everyone has heard of Frankenstein's monster... or at least the Hollywood version, with green skin, boxy head and bolts in his neck.But the original creature is quite different in Mary Shelley's \\"Frankenstein,\\" which starts off rather slow but builds into a tragic, darkly hypnotic tale about tampering in God's domain, and the terrible consequences that come from it. Also: if you create a new creature out of dead body parts, don't disown him or he'll kill your family.During a trip across the Arctic, a ship picks up a starved, half-frozen man named Victor Frankenstein. As he recovers, Frankenstein tells them his life story -- especially about how he became fascinated with science, and developed a process to reanimate dead tissue. Eventually he constructs a new creature out of dead body parts, and brings him to life.But while the creature is intelligent and articulate, he's also hideously ugly. Horrified that he's not beautiful, Frankenstein flees... and has a nervous breakdown. Wimp.But months later, the murder of his little brother brings Victor back to his home, where he figures out that the creature was involved. And to his horror, the creature now wants a mate. But the loathing between them -- caused by Frankenstein's disgust and the creature's increasing bitterness -- leads to even more tragedy...\\"Frankenstein\\" is one of those rare novels that is almost beyond classification -- it's gothic horror, it's sci-fi, it's a tragedy about scientific ambition that goes where it shouldn't go. Mary Shelley was only eighteen years old when she began writing this book, but she interwove religion, science and a fiercely intelligent knowledge of human nature into it.Her writing is a bit stuffy at times (\\"All praises bestowed on her I received as made to a possession of my own\\"), but that's because it was written in the early 1800s. Despite this, Shelley's writing skills shine in the more horrific moments of the story (\\"I saw the dull yellow eye of the creature open; it breathed hard, and a convulsive motion agitated its limbs\\"), and she imbues it with a sense of painful, grimy suspense.But the complicated characters of Victor and the creature are what really make the story work. Victor is actually a pretty horrible person -- while he's a tragic figure whose unnatural ambitions end up destroying his wife, brother and father, he's also incredibly cruel and callous to the creature because... he's ugly.The creature, on the other hand, instantly gets our sympathy. He's intelligent and childlike at first, but his ugliness causes everyone to immediately hate and fear him. When him becomes embittered and eventually murderous, you still feel sorry for him.Mary Shelley's \\"Frankenstein\\" is one of those few, rare horror books -- it adds a little more of that scientific gothic atmosphere to a classic tale of horror, slime and sorrow."},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"I bought this to help some of my high school students get through this rather difficult novel, which is a required reading.

Good character development and enjoyed the build to the end."},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"This truly is a classic tale of social insight, a story of one seeking acceptance and desiring companionship but being rejected and branded a monster. The thing that I liked most about this book is the fact that it's divided into two accounts, designed to view both sides of the story. The first part of the book \`Frankenstein' tells the story of the life of Victor Frankenstein, the creation of Monster Frankenstein and the death of his younger brother William. A servant \`Justine' has been put on trial for this murder, but Victor knows the identity of the true killer. Monster Frankenstein and Victor finally meet up and despite his desire to kill his creation, Victor is forced to listen to the monster's story, after being threatened.\`The Modern Prometheus' tells the story of the Monster Frankenstein, confused and unsure from the very first day of life, found himself hiding in the woods watching people and learning how to find food, create a fire and how to differentiate between the feelings of happiness and sadness. Watching a family in poverty taught Monster Frankenstein many things and he started chopping wood and shoveling snow for the family while they slept. His loneliness finally drove him to show himself to this family who ended up running away in fear. With a mixture of loneliness and anger, he seeks out his creator, finding his way to William where he decides to kidnap him for companionship and ends up accidentally strangling him.This is where the two stories meet and monster Frankenstein pleads with Victor saying he's \`a good creature turned bad by unforgiving humans who scoffed at friendship'. The monster pleads with Victor to make him a companion which he would take and never be heard from again. Victor reluctantly agrees but found it harder and harder to do, even though his family was in danger. Victor began to realize the female companion could wreck much havoc by giving birth to more monsters and refusing to be with the monster as a mate altogether.Monster Frankenstein swears revenge and goes about killing everyone close to Victor in attempt to show Victor what it feels like to be alone. As Frankenstein dies, the monster appears in his room and begs his dead body for forgiveness.In the end the story has no true villain or hero. Monster Frankenstein and Victor Frankenstein were both portrayed as hero and villain. The story also leaves you wondering on how you treat others, do our actions end up turning people into a \`monsters'? Overall this was a brilliant story, although the language was at times hard to understand, it is still worth the read."},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"it made me care about the outcome of the characters, fevv books do that."},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"This novel was an experience.

The standards of interesting writing may have changed in the last hundreds of years, but some writers and poets are skilled enough with language that their work still endures.

To say that it is about responsibility, scientific as well as parental, would be true but also misleading as to the true depth of the work. Like some greek tragedy, there are no truly evil characters in this story. Both Victor Frankenstein and his creation are the victims of their own personalities. Destiny or psychology? Ponder the creature's emotionally wrought story well, for it describes perfectly the psychology of a terrorist who is a human being with family, not some inhuman monster, who strikes out at those he perceives as uncaring to his real or imagined wrongs suffered at the hands of others. Many forget that this was a horror story. Though the creature started out innocent, in the last third of the novel it has matured into a destructive force. And what a force! It haunts Frankenstein like some demonic monkey on his back, stalking him and killing his loved ones while Frankenstein is unable to expose him to the world without admitting his complicity in the creature's existence, even if he were to be believed. At one point, he ends up in an insane asylum. The novel starts with Frankenstein's obsession to create life, and ends with his obsession to destroy what he has created. A timeless portrait of the human condition in all its wretchedness."},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"Okay, I can see the romanticism that is covered with this book but I cannot fidn the entertainment that is supposed to lie in every single book upon this earth.

The book was filled with constant tautology (constant repition of the same thing, just in different words) and filled with chapters that were utterly pointless. There is no horror to this story at all...It is about a living creature, shunned by society who eventually goes on the rampage. Gee, like that hasn't happened before.

Victor Frankenstein is a genius with great compassion for humans yet he is also mankind's worst enemy for creating a monster who can destroy them. He is both the villian and the hero, an aspect that is rarely seen. The monster is shrouded by mystery and pain. Being the embodiment of sorrow and human sufferring, he is an amazing symbol of human nature. Mary Shelley captures every emotion felt by her characters so accurately that you can feel the moster's anger and taste Frankenstein's revenge. This is a tremendous novel that reaches out to the reader in an infinite amount of ways.

Wait a minute! This is not the book I read. The image that our society has of Frankenstein is extremely twisted from Mary Shelley's original. I am not exactly sure if the ugly, horror image was the one that Shelley was attempting to achieve. However, she ended up creating a novel that dealt more with an individual struggle rather than a horror story. Victor Frankenstein, who is not the creature, but the creator, provides readers with many interesting perspectives about his thinking and motives. Mary Shelley has written an excellent novel for readers who want to analyze her work using various critical methods.I believe she has also written an excellent novel for readers who can stand an extremely slow pace. The story began and I felt like I was never going to reach the heart of the novel. However, once the reader moves through the introduction, Shelley does not stop giving you creative images and adventure. Overall, I believe the novel was a descent story for the basic, surface reader. In addition, I think that the psychoanalytic critics could have a field day with Mary Shelley's Frankenstein."},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"what up?, well i have read this book all i can say is this and that, the book is good though but there is a lot of lack of information"},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"This is not just a horror story, it is one of the most moving commentaries on humanity that I have ever read.

Classic in every respect and deserves a standing ovation when you are done reading."},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"I watched the movie with Helena Boham Carter first, and I thought it was a wonderful movie, so I decided to read the book. The book was a terrible book. I couldn't relate to any of the characters, except the creation. Everyone, except the creation, was so perfect! Elizabeth was Barbie incarnate! She was smart, talented, kind, loving, honest, loyal, beautiful (looked just like Barbie). Victor was the same, except he made something that wasn't beautiful. So an ugly thing crashes Victor's perfect world. Boo-hoo-hoo. The only thing that made sense in the story was the creation. The way he explained how he was so lonely, how if Victor made something, why would he want to make it suffer so. I felt so bad for the creation. Victor made absolutely no sense in why he wouldn't make a companion for the creation. He said something about evil, and how there would be more killing, but the creation explained to him, more than once, why he did what he did (the little boy, the friend, etc.) And he even warned Victor that there would be more destruction unless he had a companion. The ending was good, how the captain understood the monster. I felt contempt for the characters in the book. The creation was the only character who had any depth. Victor and Elizabeth and everyone else was so involved with their perfect, beautiful world that it was dumb. They were so flat, one dimensional characters. I know that Shelley wanted us to understand the monster, which I did (thus the 2 stars), but the rest of the characters were mindless. Real life isn't like Victor's world. Real life is like the Creation's world. Searching for something, searching for a part of you, searching for the meaning of why we were put on this earth because life is vicious and cruel. I would recommend reading this book only for the sake of the character of the Creation. It was such a small book, but I got so annoyed by the dumbo characters."},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"When I started reading Frankenstein I was a little bit bored, but I expected it to pick up since it is such a popular book. When I got about half way through the book I had gotten a little more into it, but I was still bored. The action scenes that it did have were good though, that is why I gave it three stars. Pretty much all of the parts when there wasn't anything going on but talking I was bored because they weren't talking excitingly. Another thing that I didn't like is that &quot;Frankenstein&quot; made out ot be a horror, but the demon only kills four people in the entire book. Also, when the demon did kill somebody they didn't describe it. It was just something like &quot;I heard screams and went into the room; there she laid dead,&quot; or something to that effect."},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"There's This-Will-Make-You-Stupider Bad, like a James Patterson novel, and then there's something like Mary Shelly's Frankenstein, elegantly written with themes worthy of your contemplation, yet still bad when you consider its preposterous events.* As one reviewer pointed out, the creature is created in less than a paragraph. And you're not even sure how it happened. I had to rewind because I thought I'd missed something, but no: one moment Victor is like, \\"I was reading books\\" and the next he's like, \\"I looked at my creation's black lips and I hated it!\\"* Victor freaks out and just leaves an 8-foot superbeing (that he hates) hanging out at his apartment. (He does this throughout the whole book, just leaving it at-large somewhere. He's justifiably deathly paranoid that the fiend might harm his family - it already killed his brother - but he goes to Scotland anyway to build a she-creature.) (And not just a long working-weekend either, but rather a months-long pleasure cruise around the British Isles. I don't get it.)* The creature went from hideous dumb clod to hideous Collin Firth in a matter of months via eavesdropping on some peasants. Fine. His erudite, eloquent narration is all sensitivity, even as he's describing (to Victor) how he strangled Victor's kid brother. Fine. Fine. Whatever. I guess I'm okay with it. Moving on....* Victor and the creature stalk each other with uncanny success everywhere on the European continent. And not just at each other's houses, but in the woods, on boats, in cabins, on mountains, on dog-sleds, across multiple terrains and during different weather systems. In a coup of because-I'm-the-author-and-I-said-so, Mary Shelly leads us to believe that the creature prepares for Victor a scavenger hunt across the North Pole, leaving taunting messages and even meals of dead hare to nourish Victor for their final showdown.I'll stop there. There's tons more crazy-unreal coincidences interwoven with breezy descriptions of incredible scenarios. I thought this was going to be literature on the order of Turn of the Screw or Poe, but no.

You find yourself looking ahead to see if any action or \\"horror\\" (since it is called a \\"horror story\\") is coming up. And why do they call it a \\"horror story\\"? The most horrific scenes in the book are when the monster kills somebody, and you could always see them coming from a mile away. One more reason I believe this book is worthy of a low rating is the unbelievable nature of the story. I know that it's a fictional story, but at least make the characters act somewhat realistic. For example, when Victor leaves his wife alone in bed on their honeymoon, it never even crosses his mind that the monster might kill her. Or the fact the monster has super human strength, speed, and quickness. How does a gathering of dead limbs and organs produce super human strength?I would not recommend this book to anyone under the age of 40. It's pace is way too slow for the modern worlds fast pace and it leaves you wondering, \\"Why didn't I just watch the movie\\"."},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"if you want to read this book, you will need knowledge of five words; reverence, countenence; ardour; odious; benevolence. sure, there are good points to be made in this book. Like, nature being all theraputic and how man can alienate himself from man. The abscure way that mary shelley brings these points across to the reader, is repetitive and inane. This book could easily be 50 pages long, it would be a great read on the crapper, but since it is not 50 pages, just read the cliffs notes, otherwise youre wasting your time. This book is totally sketch."},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"Mary Shelley wrote this book when she was 18 and it really shows. This was the one of the worst books I have ever read, seriously I would rather read the berstein bears. Mary Shelley uses a lot of fancy words and complicated sentence stucture but the book really doesn't say anything. There is no underlying message, it seems that she creates scenes to move her plot along, for instance the monster must learn how to talk and read so he camps out in someones shed and observes them for months without detection, it just so happens that there is a foreign woman at t the house learning how to speak French. What a coincidence. The plot is not justified, Victor hates the monster because .... I don't know he isn't the evil spawn of satan or anything, and then there is the monster drove to kill because he was lonely? Come on now. Shelley tries to reach emotional climaxes and moving passages but she didn't have anything to say. The book was boring, it had a bland and combined a very vague writing style full of tautology with not much content, and a &quot;sissy&quot; plot, not at all scary or even plausible"},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"Happily for movie-goers, Frankenstein movies resemble this book only slightly. The pathos (for the movie and the book) is launched when Victor Frankenstein, a young college student, creates a live monster from \\"dead parts.\\" However, I was surprised to find that Mary Shelley's novel provides no hint of how Victor, after much unexplained experimentation, \\"creates life\\" and animates a collection of bones and other unspecified ingredients. Further, she fails to explain how the monster is able to quickly and easily become a fluent speaker, reader, and writer with no instruction. She asks us to accept that the monster, at 8 feet tall, moves undetected, through much of Europe, for years. The plot is so obviously contrived that the novel fails the most basic test of fiction. Shelley did not move me to suspend disbelief.Furthermore, all of her characters speak in the same voice. Parents, children, Victor, the monster, and the narrator/ship captain all sound the same.Unfortunately, we are reminded repeatedly that Victor is very, very, very tortured and that the monster is very, very, very hideous and evil.I am sure that in her era, Shelly's style was more accepted, even expected. The overwrought melodrama, the endless agony, and illness and death resulting from torturous melancholia are all Victorian hallmarks. However, her failures as a writer of fiction made this a difficult, unrewarding read for me. I allow 3 stars for the dynasty of horror and comedic films that arose from her kernel of a good tale."},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"I knew little of the story when I picked up this book. In fact, I was one of those people who thought the monster's name was Frankenstein. Whoops...

I began about three weeks before school started, and it took me a week to get though, despite being a relatively short book. I literally almost fell asleep every ten pages. Mary Shelley almost as much in need of a good editor as friggin' Frank Norris with his stupid novel McTeague. She spend eons talking about how lovely the mountains are, then spends around five seconds explaining the birth of The Monster. This tendancy to skip over the exciting parts as though they were unimportant may have been intentional (that's what my humanites teacher tells me) but it still bored me. Also, I don't really care what the mountains looked like. Victor Frankenstein whines his way through the entire novel, which is really irritating because everything that happens to him is his own fault. When it comes to the development of The Monster, Mary Shelley seems to think that somehow, magically, The Monster knows way too much. Too many convient things happen. For example, he just happens to hang out behind a hut housing several very nice peasants, and they never notice? Yeah, right. Also, he just happens to find three very important and significant texts that have striking parallels to his own situation? Again, yeah right. It reached the point of ludicrocity. I sincerley did not enjoy this book, and though I know that it may partially be Percy Shelley's fault (evidently, he was her editor), and I know that Mary Shelley had many miscarriages and children's deaths and this book is about that and blah blah blah, I will never enjoy it."},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"This book had a really good idea for a story.

Yeah, he just walked in the local morgue and picked up the pieces he needed. Sure. Well if you have any thing that you need to get done DO IT BEFORE YOU READ THIS BOOK.

Sadly, I cannot say the same for Mary Shelley's Frankenstein.

For this 1818 novel introduces us to a surprisingly articulate monster--who is never named by his idealistic young creator. Its antique literary style offers a tale presented by three different first-person narrators. Letters (tales within a tale) are the inevitable legacy of suicide or premature death before the story is really over.In contrast, the basic theme appears remarkably modern, especially in the light of 21st century scientific debate over the inherent dangers of too much knowledge (as in Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde)or genetic tampering (The Island of Dr. Moreau). Man is simply not morally csapable to assume the role of creator. Lofty-minded but overwrought Victor Frankenstein conceives the blasphemous idea of creating a living being of gigantic stature. Despite his noble goal of benefitting mankind, the experiment goes grotesquely awry. The youthful natural scientist endures a few years of tortured, morbid existence, which swell to a crescendo of horror as a result of his cerebral &quot;Hybris.&quot;Frankenstein's obsession gradually dominates his life--spilling blood onto those around him, as the people dearest to him are viciously and deliberately murdered. Is there no way to stop the rampage of terror which he has inadvertantly unleashed upon a helpless, unsuspecting world? Linked inexorably by the bonds of unholy creation, both Victor and his monster live only for Revenge. But can either truly be said to be alive, if the other should perish? Are they not mutually dependent on each other to sustain the fires of the hunt? Despite uneven pacing, this thriller/chilller has captured the imagination of kids of all ages for almost two centuries. Bear in mind that Hollywood has transformed the original monster, spawning the idea that Frankenstein Is the monster!"},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"Forget the Frankenstein from the movies and come read the real story of a man, Dr. Victor Frankenstein, who is a brilliant scientist with an obsession: play to be God, creating a living human being all by himself. God punishes him: when the creature wakes up to life, he turns out to be a horrible monster. Frankenstein is terrified and rejects his creation.And here's where the Gothic tale becomes a true literary work of art. What follows is the tragedy of a creature created by the arrogance and ambition of one man, an ugly yet fully human being. The monster is not good nor bad: he's just plain human. What he needs is affection, love and understanding. But his ugliness and clumsiness provoke that no one is willing to approach him: he scares the hell out of everybody. First, he is sad; then, he is enraged. Here's where the real monster is created: by the hatred and frivolity of other humans.A true Gothic masterpiece, this novel is unforgettable for its message, its depth, and especially for its environment and mood. It is all dark, all cold, all terrifying and all moving. The true monsters are the others, not Frankenstein's creature. But his wanderings around the world are wonderful horror literature. Don't miss this great book written in one night by Mary Wollstonecraft, the young wife of poet Percy Shelley. It is the fortunate result of a bet made by several attendants to a vacation by a lake in Switzerland, Lord Byron included."},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"Mary Shelley's Frankenstein is a classic in the horror genre and to me it far outshines Broker's Dracula and his other novels which can sometimes appear like turn of the century pulp fiction horror. Shelley was a masterful writer who conveyed a powerful theme at the core of Frankenstein. It was the 19th century, the earlier half of the century. Shelley, the infamous poet Lord Byron and another writer were on vacation and living in a castle. They made up a bet. They were to write a work of horror and the writer whose book was the most frightening and intense and most successful was to receive honors by the group. Mary Shelley had a phantasmagorical nightmare which became the plot to Frankenstein. What a way to write a book. Since its publication, it has become an instant classic and attained popularity for years. Hollywood has made various movie versions. Kids still dress up as Frankie for Halloween. Mary Shelley wrote more than a horror piece that was meant to win a bet. Indeed it is intensely scary but its message is strong. In the 19th century it was a cautionary tale. Darwin's theory of evolution was out and man was accomodating themselves into a new, secular world full of inventions and scientific progress. Medicine became more advanced. Industry boomed with railroads, steamships, factories, and later in the 19th century- film, phonographs/record layers, telephones and electric lightbulbs. Shelley was urging people not to lose their faith in God as a creator and that to play God could spell disaster.Doctor Frankenstein represents the modern man, the atheist, the scientist, the new creator. It rings true today since we are so advanced in our science that we are able to produce new life both bacterial in form and human cloning. Dr. Frankenstein is a naive idealist. Initially, he believes that by creating this man from the cadavers of human beings, he will create the ideal man, free of evil and a figure of hope for mankind. Perhaps Dr. Frankenstein's mistake still applies to scientists today ? Will cloning humans turn out to be a huge disaster ? Will they be more monstrous than human. But it's interesting to note just how human the monster can be beneath his monstrous exterior. He feels human emotions like other people - love, hate, anger. This way, Shelley blurs the line between humanity and monstrosity. We are ourselves monsters because we continue to engage in war, build bigger weapons and believe we are indestructible in our technilogical progress to the extent we sometimes lose our soul. Frankenstein is just that a monster because essentially he is a human missing a soul. Each phrase, each description is poetic, vivid and powerful in is imagery and symbolism. This is the only true literary horror novel that one can make essays and master thesis on. No other work can do this. Perhaps only Anne Rice novels but for the most part, horror novels seem to lack the literary themes that this book contains. If you still haven't read it, and have seen the movies, don't expect it to be the same. This is on a class of its own. But most assuredly the book is better."},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"Mention the name \\"Frankenstein\\" and the first image to pop into people's minds is one of a big, dumb, green guy with bolts coming out of the sides of his neck. Anyone reading Mary Shelley's Frankenstein for the first time may be surprised to learn that in the novel the creature is neither inarticulate nor ignorant. He is the product of a zealous doctor's quest to take life and death into his own hands. The creature is shunned by all mankind, including the one person who should feel some compassion or responsibility for him, his creator, Dr. Frankenstein. All the creature ever wants is to be accepted by society and to find companionship. With an intellect superior to that of the average human being, he learns to speak and read. It isn't until after he understands that he is doomed to a life of rejection that he seeks revenge, turning violent and murderous. The underlying question of the novel is, who is the real monster here, the formidable creature or the creator who abandoned him?Through the creature's own words, we hear of his confused awakening and search for understanding. From the start he recognizes that his appearance is so horrifying as to repulse anyone who sees him. Fittingly, once he has taught himself how to speak and read, his first attempt at communication is with a blind man. When he realizes the futility of his search for a friend, he focuses his efforts on another objective - revenge upon the one who brought him into this cruel world. The creature sets out to make Frankenstein's life the same sort of hell as his own.The scientist Frankenstein goes to great lengths to complete his experiment, realizing too late that there are consequences for interfering with the laws of nature. He brings to life a most unnatural beast, and flees in horror from the being he has created. Feeling no responsibility to comfort the creature in any way, he instead wishes to completely abandon it and forget that it even exits, leaving it to struggle single-handedly in a world where it does not belong. Is it any wonder that his creation becomes slightly incensed at his abandonment and seeks to create for Frankenstein a life equal to his own in misery and isolation?Who deserves the label of \\"monster\\"? First-time readers of Shelley's novel may have a hard time accepting that the creature is not a purely evil or demonic being; contrary to popular belief, he does not just wake up and start strangling people. The creature in the novel has qualities we more easily identify with, such as the desire to be loved and accepted. On the other hand, Dr. Frankenstein's actions are questionable at times. Is the creature justified in his revenge? Or does Frankenstein get the bad end of the deal, his originally well-intentioned experiment gone sour? Either way, reading Mary W. Shelley's novel presents to us the viewpoint of a very different \\"monster\\" than we expect."},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"This is an immortal tale about hybris, love and hate, justice, racism and the responsibilities of scientists.Its fundamental question is: 'Had I the right to inflict this curse upon everlasting generations? ... future ages might curse me as their pest, whose selfishness had not hesitated to buy its own peace at the price, perhaps, of the existence of the whole human race.'The 'unhallowed arts' of Frankenstein produce a 'filthy mass that moved and talked', but it is nevertheless a human being with normal human aspirations: 'Everywhere I see bliss, from which I alone am irrevocably excluded. I was benevolent and good, misery made me a fiend. Make me happy, and I shall again be virtuous.'But, Frankenstein is a 'painted bird': 'Am I to be thought the only criminal, when all human kind sinned against me? I, the miserable and the abandoned, am an abortion, to be spurned at, and kicked, and trampled on.'His reaction is : 'If I cannot inspire love, I will cause fear.'Mary Shelley's vision of mankind is far from rosy: 'I heard of the division of property, of immense wealth and squalid poverty.' 'A man was considered, except in very rare circumstances, as a vagabond and a slave, doomed to waste his powers for the profits of the chosen few.' 'Was man yet so vicious and base? I could not conceive how one man could go forth to murder his fellow.'Her world is one of resentment, racism and jealousy: 'religion and wealth had been the cause of his condemnation.'But, 'how strange is that clinging love we have of life, even on the excess of misery.'Frankenstein is the scion of the evil principle, the invention of a man-scientist and a 'painted bird', who is therefore not accepted by the rest of the human race. His reaction is revenge.This is a great text by an 18 year old.As Oscar Wilde said in 'The Critic as Artist': 'For when a work is finished it has as it were, an independent life of its own, and may deliver a message far other than that which was put into its lips to say'.Some texts become even more important and luminous with time, like this masterpiece.A must read."},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"The plot and perhaps the character itself of Frankenstein has been manipulated and perhaps even corrupted by the passage of time. Few of those that dress as \\"Frankenstein\\" for Halloween know the true story behind the creature. This is unfortunate as Mary Shelley's classic is among the best books ever written. More than a monster story, it raises questions of morality and ethics.When Dr. Frankenstein sets to create the creature, it is to set his stamp on science. But in many respects, he took on the role of a deity by creating a new life. But that new life is neglected and shunned by his creator, causing him to reject his deity. As this morality play progresses, the frightening reign of terror begins. Dr. Frankenstein is faced with a moral dilemma that could halt the creature. He must weigh the risks of this dilemma against the benefits. Though quite predictable in terms of the plotting, Frankenstein set a standard in its time. The creature is cunning in the traps and scenarios it lays for his creator making the villain more frightening.Shelly's writing also causes the reader to feel sympathy for the creature. It is a struggle to maintain this feeling, but Shelley is able to meet this challenge. In this respect the daemon is less demonized."},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"I was quite surprised at how much depth was really in this book. I had ideas of Frankenstein's monster from the movies and society, but those pathetic interpretations do not capture the true, sorrowful nature of the \\"daemon.\\" I was genuinely moved by this tale: It is a story of light and dark; it is a story of gain and loss; it is a story of love and hate. When the creator becomes the hated, the created becomes the vengeful.I never expected this book to have such unique depth. Whatever you think you know about Frankenstein is just a poor transcription of this wonderful work by Mary Shelley."},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"People often group science fiction books or horror books into their own category, even though the great sci-fi / horror books explore the same themes that \\"non sci-fi and non-horror\\" books do. In navigating the human condition and making a commentary on it, books are either categorized as tragedies or comedies. This classic of literature is alternatively classified as a sci-fi book or horror book, when it is most definitively a tragedy.Set in 19th century Europe, the book tells the story of Victor Frankenstein, a young and upcoming scientist with great skills in the life sciences and a gifted engineer. Whilst his colleagues spend time enjoying the social life of Europe; Victor devours books and speculates on life itself. Soon he begins secret experimentations on life, and concludes that it is nothing more than organic material energized by electricity. He follows this be creating life, in the form of a human made from spare parts that he obtains from graverobbers and such. At the moment he brings his creation to life, both freak out and are separated.Frankenstein's creation, the monster, wanders the cities and countryside of Europe, trying to piece together his origin, his whereabouts, his identity, etc... All the while, his horrific looks, being made of human spare parts, makes him so ugly as to be unacceptable to society and he whiles his days in hiding. The experiences breaks his heart on an hourly basis. He realizes he can never be accepted into human society, so he contacts his maker and asks for a female mate. The maker accepts at first, but at the last moment, negates on his promise. And so starts the hatred between maker and master, for the monster is truly the master since he is not bound by human laws nor human relationships. The monster proceeds to kill all those loved by Victor Frankenstein. In turn, Victor begins a lifelong chase of the monster to kill it. The book ends on the decks of a ship in the northern seas with the monster getting his last laugh.Tragic in its ending, the book makes commentaries on multiple subjects. First, man should not play god. This is the obvious theme of this book. We cannot control our creations and should be more careful in what we create. This theme has since been echoed on the topics of nuclear weapons, automobiles, fire, and now nanotechnology. Second, this book firmly places itself on the nurture side of the nature - nurture debate. The monster is born innocent, and his sufferings at the hands of humans makes him into a true monster. Third, love makes the world go around. The monster ultimately does not want a home; awards, rank or title, social distinction, etc... He wants a wife. Could this theme be related to the author being a wife herself, and maybe the book somehow comments on her marriage? Not sure here.All in all this is a great book. It is a great story book, it is a great commentary on human society, and it is a wonderful examination on the needs of all humans. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"Frankenstein is one of the most beautifully written novels I've ever read. Besides its smooth style of writing, it has also enlightened me thourgh two major themes. The first is its revelation of indivudal's fragility compared to nature's unparalled power. The main character Frankenstein's desprate endeavor in creating a monster of perfection is equivalent to an attempt to completely control one's fate and get ride of nature's influence, which results in nature's retaliation as the monster slaughter all the people connected Frankensten. The second is the excitement and fear from solitude and loneliness. The former feeling exists before Frankenstein successful created the monster and the latter feeling arises after the experient is accomplished and done. These two extreme feelings shown in the book, coincide with our daily experience, showing how loneliness can help a person achieve the extraordinary and how it can make a person suffer from the unthinkable, the despairing, the worst."},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"This book is truly worthy of the term \\"classic\\". Mary Shelley began writing this novel at the young age of 18, yet managed to create a landmark work of fiction. The story is interwoven with ever-present social and ethical questions. What does it mean to be human? What are the consequences of using scientific technology to play the role of Creator? How far is too far when tampering with the order of the universe?Upon my first reading of this book I was pleasantly surprised to find that the creature is very intelligent and human-like, though grotesque in appearance. It is a shame that the Frankenstein creature is universally represented in the minds of the public as an oafish and very dimwitted monster with bolts in its neck and a green pallor. The true Frankenstein is far more intriguing. I love the parts of the book that are a first person narrative by the \\"creature\\".I highly recommend this book as it is an enjoyable piece of classic literature. If you are a fan of horror, read this for an understanding of the early roots of the genre that you so love, and that those roots actually formed intellectual arguments and contained actual substance. This book is a must read for the well rounded reader. In fact, had I graduated from high school and never read this book, I would begin to question the quality of my own education."},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"\\"Life, although it may only be an accumulation of anguish, is dear to me... I was benevolent and good; misery made me a fiend. Make me happy, and I shall again be virtuous.\\" This was said by none other than M. Frankenstein's monstrous creation. To me this quote sums up one of the most important themes in the book. This theme being that all life is very difficult to deal with, but we still strive to live even if times are very hard. It also throws up the question: Are we born pure and good? Because the monster says that when created he was all about being a good man, but now that he is miserable he is a bad person. Mary Shelley wrote this book on a dare from Lord Byron in 1816. This was supposed to be a ghost story, even thought to me it doesn't really seem like a ghost story, but more of a story about playing god, and about life's hardships. Two of her daughters died during infancy, only one son survived. Her husband drowned while sailing in 1822. Mary Shelley died at the age of 53 in 1851. As you can see her life was full of hardships, and loneliness. This makes a lot of sense because if you read Frankenstein you get a sense of horrid loneliness throughout the entire novel. Emotionally this book plays a toll on pity for M. Frankenstein as well as the monster. No one is happy for more than a page or two in this book, and during this rut of happiness they are constantly nagged by something in the back of their mind. It is a very good story and has a lot of very good points about life in it, but the book leaves you feeling...cold and alone."},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"Mary shelley's frankenstein, the famous novel by her, probably her best work despite her turbelous and personal history (she had a child out of wedlock and her relationships didnt last). the book was made into a slew of hollywood remakes from the earl 1930's version with boris karloff to the more modern one with kenneth brannagh (which is closer to the novel that previous movies).This is one amazing novel, it literally impacted many writers both male and female to come. even more amazing is that shelley was only 18yrs old when she wrote this novel. she truly was gifted and &quot;frankenstein&quot; despite it being one of her few great works still cemented for shelley as a great writer.I've been asked why i love this book and it's quite simple, shelley's takes an obscure plot, a man , victor frankenstein, a scientist using a dead cadaver to create life and bettering mankind creates a monster that terrorizes mankind. shelley thus takes this simple plot , and turns into a complex story with many different twists. beyond that, she uses this story to address some serious issues, all of which i will cover in this review: women's right, prejudice against those who are different from the rest of us, the battle of good vs. evil and of course do we have the right to sacrifice lives like Frankenstein does in the name of science?Shelley was ahead of the times she addressed many key issues that we have discussed even to to this day, so in effect I love her works because she was a visionary and to some extent almost a psychic predicting certain trends that would impact society as a whole for many years to come.:If you watched the old Universal 1930's version with Karloff you think you know what the book is about. Dr. Frankenstein creates a monster because he is mad and wants to rule the world. The monster is hideous and ugly and wants to kill everything. He does meets a blind man who seems to recognize the monster and little girl whom the monster kills after the girl scream. Everyone dies at the end. That's it.No that's not it, in fact it's hard to put in one paragraph why &quot;Frankenstein&quot; has become the timeless classic. In a couple of sentences, the novel brings many social messages into view and makes the audience through the character ponder these questions. By the end of the novel, some questions get answered, however some don't. Shelley leaves many parts of the novel open for interpretation (like Shakespeare did with his plays) so people could come with their own viewsThe novel showcases the fight of &quot;good vs. evil&quot;. But who is exactly evil, the intelligent but evil and unmoral Dr. Frankenstein or the hideous monster who has been scorned by society for his looks (like the Elephant Man).The novel showcases the question of &quot;creation&quot;, more specifically &quot;the creation and ending of life&quot;. Does Dr. Frankenstein have the right to do what he does with body parts in creating this being? Is Frankenstein's intention to create a serious of super beings to rule the world?Why doesn't Frankenstein come forward for being the one responsible for the monster, when several murders including his family members get murdered by the hands of the monster?As you can see Shelley's poses us with some serious questions some of which impact us as a society, questioning our morals? I loved this because questioning our morals nowadays seems to be at the bottom of our priorities (See Iraqi prison scandal).Some of the intriguing questions directed at us as potential scientists if we have the right to some extent go against God and create our own race of beings in our image? Who really is the monster here. Us or the monster?"},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"Victor Frankenstein's creation had murdered members of his family and strangled to death his fiance on their wedding night fulfilling his threat to \\"be with you on your wedding night\\" and warned Victor, \\"You are my creator but I am your master.\\" As Victor centered his life around creating the monster, he would later center it around hunting down and killing his creation. This manhunt would expend Victor's life and prove his efforts futile to catch an untouchable and nameless monster. This novel is full of enduring themes of ambition, friendship, and the conflict between the two, psychology, oppression and rebellion, the dangers of scientific and intellectual advancement, and societal injustice. The writing itself isn't great but it's the story and the themes that make this a great classic.Shelley wrote this book influenced by the period of time in which she lived, the Romantic Period. This was the response to the previous time, the Age of Enlightenment. In the Enlightened Age, reasoning was deemed of utmost importance and people thought that there were natural laws and that reason plus these natural laws would equal progress. By progress, they meant not only advancement, but unlimited advancement, that society would continue to move closer and closer to perfection. In Frankenstein, we see the result of so much logic and reason- the creation of a monster. In the story there seems to be no natural laws governing the world. The Romantic Period accounted for emotion like reasoning and logic cannot. The monster as the center of the novel shows us as his direst need a companion, as does Frankenstein himself.When I think of what natural laws would govern the world, Justice comes to mind as the most important. Throughout this whole story, justice is so dearly lacking. Injustice leads to more injustice. The monster is born into unforgiving circumstances that were not his fault. His creator rejects him immediately. Throughout his life, the monster found himself rejected by everyone for the repulsive looks his creator gave him. The monster even suffered rejection of the impoverished family he ardently and sacrificially helped. When he saved a girl from drowning, her father shot him. The monster yearned desperately for a mate of his kind, which Victor denied him for fear the two would breed an entire race of fiends or that she, too would reject him and there would be two fiends. Decide this debate between the monster and Victor for yourself. Even if Victor was right to deny him a mate, it was still an injustice for the monster. After all, the monster could not help the disadvantages he was born into and he strove mightily to be virtuous. He exercised his will and responsibility strongly, but to no avail. The poor thing begs for just one friend and he is denied this. The innocent Justine (a play on the word \\"Justice\\") is executed for the monster's crime; the monster eventually slays several innocent people he doesn't even know. Injustice is what moves the plot of Frankenstein.Shelley's novel disputes the importance and promise of natural laws, reasoning, and the idea of progress. It introduces emotion and intuition. Frankenstein studied laboriously but failed because he left the monster emotionally neglected and rejected. When Victor first learns of the murder of an innocent member of his family, he intuitively knows it was the doing of the monster- he offers no reasoning or deduction as to how he knows. The monster hounds Victor and seems to supernatually know where he is at all times.One of the many interpretations of Frankenstein is that it was a product of the Romantic Period, which was a response to the Age of Enlightenment. My own evaluation of reasoning vs emotion is that our logic must be in control of us always but that emotions are a part of us too and must be satisfied."},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"I adored Mary Shelley's portrayal of the characters. Victor Frankenstein is a talent with great compassion for humans yet he is also mankind's worst enemy for creating a monster who can destroy them. Frankenstein is a man who made up his mind to make a human, but in the first case, could not assume responsibility. The same is true for when he tried to make the monster a mate, but he realized this and could not go ahead with it. He is both the villain and the hero, an aspect that is rarely seen.However, The monster is shrouded by mystery and pain. Being the embodiment of sorrow and human sufferings, he is still an amazing symbol of human nature. Mary Shelley captured every emotion felt by her characters so accurately that I could even feel the monster's fury.I especially like the way that the plot unravelled and jumped from place to place. It did not get confusing either. It was quite easy to follow. The characters were well drawn and in everything that they did, their motives were clearly known to the reader. None of the characters did anything that seemed out of mind. There were parts of the book that were a little drawn out and sluggish, but it always picked right back up again. Mary Shelley presents an issue that is very applicable right now. Is it morally right to play God and attempt to create life? Obviously, Shelley's opinion is that it can only lead to disaster."},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"Short Summary: Victor Frankenstein is young, intelligent, and quite full of himself. He discovers through his studies the methods of creating life, and does so. The creature he creates is of enormous size and strength and is hideous to behold. Terrified of what he has made, he flees, leaving the creature to fend for itself.I just finished re-reading this book, it has been over 10 years since I read it the last time. My memory of the book was a tremendous feeling of sadness and compassion for the creature that Frankenstein created. In this re-reading I was shocked at the change in my feelings toward the characters. Though everything seemed the same it evoked an entirely different set of emotions in me. After doing a bit of poking about the internet I discovered that there are two versions of the story that Shelley wrote, one the first one, which is the one I just read, is much harsher, the creature is much less amiable, and Victor is much less forgivable. The second version she wrote, which I understand was written about 10-15 years later, evokes more sympathy for Victor and his creation.Both are almost identical, starting with the gentleman on the ship in the Northern Ice who meets Victor. Victor relates his tale to the young seamen, this tale often becomes a tale within a tale within a tale as we shift points of view, always related to the young sailor through the stories of Victor. As I read this book I found myself thinking that this may be one of the few books that manages to encompass all 5 versions of Conflict, Man vs Man, Man vs Self, Man vs Nature, and Man vs God. Shelley's prose can at times be difficult, not to read, but to focus on because of the style and time frame it was written in. It is very easy to find yourself skimming, which you do not want to do.The story is one of love and loss, creation and our relationship with our creator, the faults of man attempting to become God, and the cruelty that lies with our society to that which we perceive as ugly, frightening or hideous. When Victory abandons the monster he leaves him to learn of the cruelty of our society and to react to it as inappropriately as he does. This tale is NOT what you watched on TV, it is not found in the movie you watched. This is a story that can only be found in this book.Did I love it? Not really, in the version I just read, Victor is a whiner, who considers himself a genius though he stands aside while his family and friends are killed. The monster, though more understandable, is also a contemptible character as he murders one after the other with little to no remorse. Yes it is well written and filled with interesting comparisons, warnings, and meaning... but as for a fun filled entertaining read, the characters were a bit to whiny and non-committal for me to really have anyone to root for. Still, they were full characters, completely rounded and interesting even though they were pathetic. The story is so filled with meaning that you could discuss it for days. And the concept of the feminine in this book is very interesting to read... I recommend this book, but I won't say that it ranks above Dracula in my mind."},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"Every year, millions children all around the United States dress up for Halloween, and many dress up as the malevolent Frankenstein's monster. But is Frankenstein's monster really evil? In today's society, it seems clear cut that someone who rips the heart out of an innocent person must be evil. However, this simply reflects our inability to look at such an event from a non-anthropocentric point of view. From the perspective of the monster, he only wanted revenge against a world that turned its back on him. Shelly does an excellent job of bringing you into all the pain and misery that the creature suffered ever since Victor Frankenstein created him. And as for his creator, Victor Frankenstein, was he good or evil? This ambitious young scientist wanted to play the role of God, however in his intellectual quest for understanding the nature of life, he managed to destroy everything he loved. This nicely illustrated the ethical dilemma that arises when the forces of nature are tampered with.Frankenstein is a great read. For those who may be put off by the publication date of 1818, stick with it because the book is well worthwhile. It's much different than the popular conception of the story, which is not surprising, considering the way it has wended its way through popular culture for almost two centuries. Shelley pulls off quite a feat with this book, and rightly deserves the fame it has brought to her. Her attention to detail is magnificent, and her imagery was fantastic. The action scenes were extremely suspenseful, and they forced you to read on in order to see what happened next. Anyone in the mood for romance, suspense, agony, and action would truly love this book."},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"I picked up Frankenstein as sort of a &quot;project&quot; read... I felt like it was such a &quot;classic&quot; that I ought to understand it more than the pop-culture monster image.I was surprised to find a book that holds its own extremely well some 100 years later. The message of scientific experiment for curiosity's sake is a profound one, especially in this age of nuclear experimentation, biological warfare and the like. It is also compelling as a story in and of itself.Although I was well-aware that the Boris Karloff image was a far cry from Mary Shelly's novel, I was still surprised to find such full character development and strong motivation. Despite the fact that this was her first effort, and based upon a whimsical challenge to write a &quot;ghost story&quot;, it is compelling and well written. If you haven't read this book, don't be put off by it's age. It is exceptional."},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"Have always adored this classic, since first reading it during my younger years.

It's not as if the original Frankenstein is so hard to understand, as are some \\"classics\\" such as Paradise Lost. It's an easy read and full of poetic imagery. I do not recommend this version. I see no point to it.

It is an intriguing and dramatic story of the Frankenstein monster that Hollywood has yet to match. Shelley's portrayal of Victor, the tortures he experiences and the impact his creation has on his life is well described throughout the book. The effects he must face from playing god were valuable lessons then and have modern applications as well. In the middle, the story does slow in pace, but the realizations presented add significant substance to the plot and outcome. Well worth the read..."},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"I admit that this novel holds a special position in English literature and rightly so, but it was not as good as I had hoped. When the monster finally speaks in the story I swear his \\"voice\\" sounded just like his creator's. How could two characters from vastly different life circumstances sound indistinguishable? One was an adult born in to an educated well to do family and the other was recently and suddenly \\"awakened\\" to live in the woods as a hiddeous outcast. The monster taught himself to read Paradise Lost? Seriously? Actually that was the major flaw in the book. All the characters seemed to be interchangeable even though they should have totally different personalities.Another thing I didn't care for was the use of multiple narrators in the story. I know this was common practice in literature of the time, but not to this extent. The main narrator of the novel is telling a story to his sister about the story Frankenstein told him about his monster's story that he heard about the exploits of the family in the cottage. What is that like 5th person narration? I think this distances reader from what should be a very intense and personal story.I don't want to dismiss the contribution this has made to literature and popculture I just think that the story of how Mary Shelley wrote the story is much more interesting than the actual story Frankenstein."},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"Thanks to a string of Hollywood's idiotic executives focused on cheap thrills, decades of bonehead movies have used Frankenstein in their title, but have kept nothing of the original story. As a result, readers that grab this title seeking a horror story (gory or not) stand to be disappointed. Mary Shelley's story, which must be read in full appreciation of the style and sensibilities of the 19th century, is actually the sad story of a creature rejected by its creator. Love and love denied, revenge and forgiveness, rejection and acceptance, right and wrong - and how human judgment is tainted by appearances. In a century where image is all and beauty is mistaken for intelligence, Frankenstein's story is all too contemporary."},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"Written in the early 19th century, Frankenstein is a novel that is fairly easy to read and find entertainment value in even by today's standards. The rich language and Shelley's authorial style create an environment that allows the reader to totally submerse themselves into Victor's world.The story itself is presented as a story within a story within a story (an sometimes even a level or two deeper than that) as a ship captain named Walton writes letters to his sister in England about his voyage across the top of the world and the strange tale of the man (Victor Frankenstein) that he encounters there. It is Victor's story that occupies most of the novel, and though most modern readers are aware of the Hollywood version of the famous Frankenstein monster, those unfamiliar with the actual novel version are in for a great surprise in the way that the creature is depicted in the novel. Hollywood has taken so many liberties with this tale and the depictions of the characters that reading the original is almost like opening one's mind to entirely new material. Shelley presents us with an incredibly thought provoking and fleshed out tale requiring the reader to put some serious thought into the morality of intense scientific research in the area of the creation of life.With this novel, Shelley opened the door to the later development of the Science Fiction genre. In a move that is almost pure genius, Shelley avoids the need for the reader to have to suspend belief in the scientific method used to create another living being from dead tissue by allowing Victor to keep his methods undisclosed for fear that another scientist will follow his direction and make the same mistakes that he did in creating his monster.All in all a very good novel!"},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"I think I bought my copy of Frankenstein when I was a Sophomore in High School. Pretty sad that it took me until now to finally get around to reading it (I won't tell you how many years it's been *grin*).Based on my experiences with the multiple Frankenstein movies as well as appearances in cartoons like Scooby Doo and parody's like Young Frankenstein, I thought I had a pretty good feel for exactly what I could expect from the novel. I was rather surprised with the widespread differences I encountered. Looking back on my experience with Victorian literature in general and the Gothic literature of the era in particular, I should have expected what I found, but I had let myself be tainted by the mass media translation of Frankenstein.Now that I've sufficiently digressed, let me just say that even though the novel was different than I expected, I was far from disappointed by it. I expected a terrifying horror novel filled with invigorating suspense, perilous adventure and chaotic frenzy filled action. What I got was a slower paced exploration of the soul of man, the virtues and vices of science, passion, compassion and revenge.Initially I was very confused as the first many letters (the book had a LOT of 'correspondence' sections) had nothing to do with Frankenstein, his family or his creation. Instead, I found myself growing attached to a lonely adventure seeker sailing to the far ends of the world in search of something to ignite and maintain his passion. When our good Dr. Frankenstein does enter the story, we then get his very detailed narration of his life from childhood to present.The novel is laid out with a narrative structure intended to be highly conversational either through letters or through the orally delivered story of the narrator to the listener (who then transcribes it for us, the reader). However, the language used seemed overly detailed and pretentious for a simple conversation, even from a speaker as highly educated as Victor Frankenstein. It had all the flowery and ornate elements of Victorian prose, which feels natural as far as writing goes, but whenever I was reminded that nearly the entire narrative was to have been spoken, I was taken somewhat aback.The book portrayed very well the details of the exultation and triumph felt by Victor throughout his studies and his discovery of a method to create life. His educational cycle was interesting in terms of his relation with his father and his professors. When the realization of his action finally came about, Victor's agony, fear and despair were equally well realized.I kept waiting for the mob with torches and pitchforks to appear, led by Victor once he recovered from his initial shock. Instead, the arc of the story presented itself to me and I felt compassion for the poor hated creature even before the novel presented him again for our sympathies. I was certain that Frankenstein had falsely judged the fiend and that we would surely get a type of morality text casting a spotlight on society and our lack of compassion for those less fortunate for whatever reason.My next surprise came when Frankenstein came face-to-face with his creation and had a lengthy conversation. I never expected an articulate monster, but what I had was a self-educated creature who had a huge wealth of knowledge at his disposal. At that point, it was very clear that his only disadvantage was his ghastly appearance and we were obviously supposed to feel sympathy towards him. Even when his crimes were laid bare, it was a struggle to completely condemn him.In addition to the commentary on human compassion, I enjoyed the dynamic between creator and creation. Looking at Victor as a god-like person provided an intriguing perspective. As the creator, what should his responsibilities be to his creation? What should his involvement be? I didn't necessarily go down a religious path with my thoughts, but I was curious about the concept of the creator as a provider of compassion, mercy and forgiveness.Instead, Victor looks \\"to the good of humanity\\" and rejects his own creation. The result of which spirals into disaster and makes for a fun-filled ride filled with some degree of the action and suspense that I was expecting from the book (still no villagers with pitchforks, sorry). When the novel finally drew near to its conclusion, I was a little confused as to how it was going to wrap itself up.The ending was actually strangely satisfying. As it unfolded, we once again gain some compassion for the creature and in a sense look upon Victor as a type of monster. As with anything dealing with humanity, it's not that simple. For Victor was acting in the best interests of the greater good as he perceived them and his logic was sound. Thus, as the novel ends, we can't fully condemn either creator or creation. At the same time, we can't wholly condone the actions of either.Which is why I was surprised that the ending satisfied me...because it left things unsettled and confused. But after all, that's the way humanity is...a teetering house of cards, balanced precariously on a precipice, just waiting for something to turn emotions and values to chaos.Overall, I really enjoyed Frankenstein and my only regret is that it took me so long to finally get around to it.4 out of 5 stars****"},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"I think everyone should read this book just to get acquainted with the real Frankenstein. The creature is interesting, intelligent, emotional, angry and confused. This is nothing like what we see in popular culture. The story is fascinating, especially in the parts where Frankenstein himself is the narrator. We get to see humans from another perspective. The story is well written and leaves the reader with a lot of questions about murder, humanity and friendship."},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"I began reading this version of the book along with an audio book and realized that it had altered and missing passages.

It is the 1818 version, which I like better in a lot of ways, but may not be the same as your school's library if that is a concern. I like the three volumes and fewer hints \\"you will laugh at my allusion\\" (1832) in the 1818 verses some of the over editing in the 1832.

There you are, engrossed in the monster's struggle for love, acceptance, and identity, and then Shelly stitches on an extra appendage--kinda like Victor Frankenstein sewing a hand or foot onto the monster's back--a convoluted back story of how Felix, one of the cottagers, saves and elopes with Safie, a Turkish-Arabian love interest. Chapter 14 does absolutely nothing for the story, save provide a means for the creature's learning to speak and read. (In one movie version, Branagh's, the cottagers are simply teaching their own children to read and write, which further strikes at the core of the monster's suffering. I disliked the movie, though.) Chapter 14, I can't stand it! It could have and should have been reworked, but it wasn't.

I count myself in with the legions of dumb Americans who thought they knew the Frankenstein story. Hollywood dumbs us down again, but even Young Frankenstein is a classic.This is a horror story mixed into an extensive travelogue from Geneva to Scottland.In my mind, there is a chicken versus the egg question about who created who weaved in and out of the story. It also made me think that the monster was the Dr.'s punishment for self-absorbtion and the desire to play god (maybe I shouldn't clone myself). Towards the end, I had a hard time deciding which character was more wretched - the monster for being given life or the doctor who was having his life taken away.Mary Shelly did an excellent job conveying the humanism of despair between all of the characters that I think is missing in a lot of horror books. Her prose make it a nice time piece as well as nice overall canvas. One aspect missing, although I suppose it was either because of the lack of medical knowledge or to keep in the avoidance of gore with the rest of the book, was how the parts of the monster were gathered and how they were put together.It is always better to read the book than see the movie, but in this case, since they are so different, you should do yourself a favor and know what the author really wrote."},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"I have seen so many Frankenstein movies. As a result I expected this book to be like them. It wasn't. The monster wanted what everyone wants: to be loved, to be needed, to be appreciated, to be accepted. Frankenstein created the monster and abandoned him. It was the abandonment that started Frankenstein's creation on the road to monsterhood. The cottagers' rejection of him was the final touch that created the monster. After that he lashed out. He tormented Frankenstein as he himself was tormented. Who really was the monster Frankenstein or his creation? Everytime I here the term Frankenstein's monster I have a very different connotation of it than I did before."},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"Mary Shelley's Frankenstein is a classic book. Everyone knows the story line-well at least what they've seen in the movies (which is actually pretty different from the book). A man creates a \\"monster\\" who is evil. The most interesting aspect of this book in my opinion is the monster's true personality. In contrast to the common view of the monster as a cold-blooded killer, he is really compassionate and intelligent, but because he is never accepted in society because of his horrid appearence, his loneliness causes him to go on a killing spree to get revenge against his creator for bringing him into such a cruel world.

It was not at all what I had expected based on my exposure to Frankenstein movies and tales. This story is quite different in many ways that make it more appealing to the reader.The tale involves a monster that is truly hideous in form but reveals a conflicted mind and heart. Shelley effectively causes the reader to have mixed feelings about this creature that wields destruction while confessing its own misery and affection for humanity.She also conveys the dangers of a person pursuing his or her ambition at the cost of other values such as relationships and peace.The novel is told in an innovative fashion. Shelley uses three different narrators to tell the story. This creates some variety in the point of view and in the voice of the narrator.This book is very compelling, but at times I had to put it down due to the tragedy of it. The whole time you know where its events are leading and a part of you wants to go there and another part wants to avoid it--like watching Titanic, you know it is going to sink but you still hold out some hope it won't and you try to avoid its definitive demise.I think this is a horror story that has yet to be surpassed in literature. I really felt for the characters, including the monster. I was completely entertained by the skillful writing."},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"The novel Frankenstein by Mary Shelley starts off very uninteresting. In the beginning, a man writes letters to his sister in England but the story soon begins to pick up. Don&#65533;t be discouraged when you read the first page or two. Give it a chance you will learn to love this story.This novel is definitely not the same as the black and white movies you may have seen. Mary Shelley shows a whole new side to the monster in her novel. There are many conflicts and themes in this story. There is love, hate, and the most obvious rage. This is a classic story of a gothic monster gone mad and even though it was written well over 100 years ago it can still scare the pants off of people today.This book touches on the main problem in society, acceptance. There are so many people out there who will change their look, their attitude and their entire lifestyle just to be accepted. This relates to me because I am now in high school and I have observed people who will do anything to be accepted. In my opinion it is ok to want to be accepted but when a person is willing to harm themselves, just to have more friends, that is not ok with me. Mary Shelley shows us the reality of life in this wonderfully touching story."},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"As with many of the other reviews for this novel, I too was surprised to find that the original character bore little resemblance to the movie representation. This monster was not actually called Frankenstein, it was not slow and lumbering, it was not stupid or incapable of speech. While the literary critics have been historically slow to warm to this novel, it is a work of substantive quality and structure. It also conveys a powerful message about good versus evil, vanity, and personal responsibility. This novel is really, in a lot of ways, more than a horror story, its about how people view themselves and those around them. There is much debate (in literary circles) around whether or not Mary Shelley actually wrote the novel of her own accord or whether she had a good deal of help. I would suggest the paucity of anything else even remotely in the class of Frankenstein would lead one to certain suspicions."},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"I studied this book, &quot;Frankenstein&quot;, in my 12th Grade English Literature class. There are some slow parts, but overall an adventure to read. Victor Frankenstein's family at the beginning, his &quot;nervous fevers&quot;, how he created the monster and became obsessed with his work, his marriage to his cousin, Elizabeth, etc...it's all there, but the reader such as myself has more sympathy for the monster than Frankenstein himself because of the monster's longing for love. It's a good book for students and anyone who enjoys tragedies (it doesn't really seem to be like a horror story though)."},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"Yeah, I don't have to say anything about this book because it has already been said.

Oh, Frankenstein is not the monster, he is the creator. The monster is not an oaf either. He picked up an entire language in a year or something. Sharp dude...or dudes.

Personally when I started reading this I hoped for a scary book that infered on human behavior. What I got was a drawn of boring story set in 4 parts.The beginning is somewhat interesting and delves on Frankenstein the scientist learning about life and developing the monster. This part has a somewhat boring start, but once he starts making it it goes faster. Then once hes done with this the monster is made..... and it slows down to a miserable pace.From here it will have short spurts of something exciting, like for seven pages, then it goes into a fifty page boring streak, prattling on about details you don't care about. If it wants to emphasize that Frankenstein is lonely, it takes 25 pages of examples when five would be sufficient. From about the time Frankensteins monster is born you want it to die and let the story be over with because it is so boring. Not to mention predictable. I could predict the deaths of some of the people fifty pages away! Let me just say leave this book on the shelf and don't start to read it. You'll hate the book, and yet you'll probably make yourself finish it just because you started it. At least thats the way it was with me."},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"Shelley's \\"Frankenstein\\" is quite a departure when compared to the films based upon the book. The essence of the novel centers on the horrors experienced by Dr. Frankenstein after he disobeys the natural order of things by creating his \\"monster\\". Frankenstein recoils in horror at what he has created, and it is his own personal hell that the reader experiences, rather than the terror of the creature himself.Her use of atmosphere is astounding. I could feel the cold forest in which the creature dwells, smell the fresh cut firewood, and picture the cabin in the woods where the creature learns his lessons in humanity. While Frankenstein chases the monster through the Arctic chill, I felt almost physically cold. You can breathe the scent of the pine trees surrounding Frankenstein's residence as well.Beyond the excellent descriptions of places and things, Shelley has gifts when it comes to relating suspenseful horror through the eyes of the monster as well as Frankenstein. The doctor comes across like a desperate, oppressed soul, fleeing from his own creation. The creature is equally desperate in his longing for revenge and his unattainable quest to find peace with the world which rejects him.The story seems to be missing passages and missing information, or at least it reads in parts as if certain scenes were rushed. The creation of the monster is a good example of this, as we follow Frankenstein through his first days in the university until his much-later monster creation, all in the course of a few pages (interestingly, Shelly downplays the part about reanimating corpses, although it is clear that this is how Frankenstein did it). Immediately thereafter, Frankenstein is horrified by what he has done, and his descent into madness over the course of many months is condensed into a few sentences.Shelley, for some reason, has Frankenstein marry his adopted sister, Elizabeth. The book explains that Elizabeth and Victor treat each other as \\"cousins\\" growing up, and just for added confusion Shelley adds another adopted brother named William. I'm not clear on whether Shelley was going for an \\"incest\\" angle or not (probably not, considering the time this was written), but I couldn't help but crack a smile over the excessive cousin-adoptions-sibling-marriage thing. The storyline involving adoption after adoption seems unnecessary to say the least.Many scenes in which Frankenstein relates the bone-chilling inner torment of having been responsible for the monster who wreaks havoc are over the top and approach camp comedy. As many times as Victor cries out that he is responsible for the death and destruction around him, then backtracks without an explanation for his behavior, you'd think someone in his circle would ask him what the heck he's talking about. This never happens, although Frankenstein is somehow able to convince his family that an innocent has been accused of murder, without giving any real explanation as to why he believes it's a frame-job. This is unintentional comedy at its finest. We also have the bizarre coincidence of the monster finding a bag of books lying in the road, which lead to his very educated and worldly (yet still grotesque and probably smelly) appearance during his first confrontation with the doctor.Shelley also makes the mistake of using first person narrative for THREE different characters in the book. There were times where I wasn't sure who was speaking, in fact it took a page or two before I understood that it was the monster who was speaking in chapter 11. Maybe I was reading too fast, but the awkwardness of having three first-person narratives caught me off guard.Well, I sure did a lot of complaining about a book that earned 4 stars from me. Considering Shelley wrote \\"Frankenstein\\" when she was 19 years old in a world where women's education wasn't exactly common, this is high art. For all its flaws, \\"Frankenstein\\" was a pleasure to read for the creepy atmosphere and riveting suspense. I didn't know what to expect from the story from page to page, and Shelley paints an exceptionally clear picture of the madness surrounding the life of Frankenstein. This reader no longer has any questions regarding why this book has been popular for 180+ years; read it and you'll understand too."},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"I read Franenstein for a Senior English class in High School. To be honest, i wasn't personally expecting much from this book. I thought it would be a plain horror story. I had in my head a story that was simply about a monster killing people. After reading this book i realized that I was wrong! This book brought out many emotions within me. I found it very insubstantial that Victor had even created a monster. There is much more to this book than that fact. It was difficult to not feel pitty for both Victor and his monster. I would, and already have, recommended this book to a range of readers."},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"It is amazing that Mary Shelley was a teenager when she wrote this novel. Unfortunately, the amazement ends there. This book was based on a wonderful concept. An intelligent man creates a human-like being to compensate for his lost loves, only to watch his creature destroy more of his loved ones. Sounds catchy, ironic, and scary!! Sadly enough, each of these exciting points in the novel are only brushed upon. No detail is given to the audience regarding the actual creation of the monster. A plethora of pages are even donated to Frankensteins reaction to his creation. At this point, I checked to make sure I hadn't accidentally stuck ten pages together from the gum I was twirling in my fingers!As in all critism, good points should be expressed. I thoroughly enjoyed the monster's account of his adventures. These chapters were described wonderfully, allowing readers to feel the monster's pain. That's right, I felt badly for this destructive creature. It did not even matter that the monster's learned speech that was so fluent and intelligent was learned in the timespan of only a year or so. Dr. Frankenstein created quite an intelligent monster aparently.Perhaps if I hadn't anticipated a horrific story about a briliant scientist with messy hair chanting &quot;He's alive! He's alive!&quot; over a gigantic creature, I would have enjoyed this book more. Instead, I read a novel that would be appropriate for a segment on Saturday morning cartoons."},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"The idea of the book was very intelligent and interesting, dealing with rights and wrongs, accomplisments, actions and there consequences. But the book, to me, was written poorly. When reading the novel, my mind always wandered becasue of the dragging on of events. It used difficult language, uncommon words, and was saturated with too many words. The 160 page novel could have easily been shrinked down into an 100 page story. It was repititive in its ideas and difficult to concentrate on. It's not the worst book I've read for school, but I would definelty not read this book in my leisure time."},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"the book explains the story in such a slow way it makes the reader go to sleep while reading! i didn't believe that was possible until i read the book. it is so difficult to understand. the theme is good but it has bad wording. the creature starts out knowing no english. all the sudden he knows big words that english scholars can't even understand. this book puts the &quot;BAD&quot; in &quot;horrible&quot;. i know that doesn't makes sense but neither does the book."},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"even though i do not read a lot of books, this one started out extremely difficult for me. as i continued to read it, it became very interesting and exciting. the &quot;old english&quot; style of talking is what threw me the hardest loop.

Mary Shelley's only book was a great success and is full of suspense and insanity. Although it may be a great story, it is not for readers who want an action-packed, fast-paced book.

I feel contemptuous of Victor and extremely pitious of the monster. Poor soul, abhorred by all, including God (as Victor is his God). Some major themes in this book are Divine Nature, Passive weak women, and perhaps abortion. I see why it's a classic."},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"Having to read Frankenstein for my Freshman Honors Eng. Class, I thought it would be much more boring than it really is. The writings before the novel are splendid. As a novel,Frankenstein is an excellent book, not a Clancy, but detailed enough for me. Shelley's work on the novel is phenomonal.The novel starts out with a man by the name of Robert Walton writing letters to his dearest. Soon enough, Frankenstein is rescued in an ice flow. Soon after Frankenstein is rescued, he comes to tell his tale.I rate this book 4 stars."},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"It's surprising how little this grim, melodramatic novel has in common with many of the horror movies it inspired. The theory that it's a warning of science and technology going awry is, I think, an overstatement of its prophetic capacity. Mary Shelley's novel does not appear to have much of an interest in science per se, and is less about creation than it is about the relationship between the creator and the created.The novel's structure is indirect for reasons that become apparent at its end. An English sea captain named Walton is writing letters to his sister, telling her about a man his ship has rescued from an abandoned ice floe on a polar expedition. The man's name is Victor Frankenstein, and he commences to tell Walton his Long Story...Intensely interested in science as a boy growing up in Geneva, Victor fulfilled his studies at a university and hoped to make some earth-shattering scientific breakthrough. He decides that a fascinating project would be to find a way to re-animate the dead. Collecting body parts from charnel houses and assembling them into a gigantic golem, he manages to bring this thing to life (refusing to disclose the scientific method). Fearful and regretful of the powerful outcome of his experiment, he is relieved when the monster walks mutely and mindlessly out of his apartment, never to return. Oddly enough, over the next two years, he is not concerned with where the monster has gone or what it is doing.When his youngest brother, William, is murdered, Victor suspects his monster; vacationing in the Alps a few months later, he comes across the monster, who not only has learned to talk but has become quite eloquent. The monster tells Victor that his many efforts to befriend people and enter into society have been spurned due to his frightening appearance, and his resulting loneliness and anger incited him to kill. He insists that Victor, as his creator, has an obligation to provide him with a female companion, and demands that he make one for him. However, Victor is unwilling to add to the population of violent creatures, and the monster takes his revenge out on even more of Victor's loved ones. Distraught to the point of insanity, Victor turns vigilante and pursues the monster all over the world, swearing to destroy it once and for all.\\"Frankenstein\\" is an allegorical tale of creation and examines a creator's responsibility and accountability for his creation's deeds or misdeeds. In this regard, Victor is essentially an irresponsible creator. He is not concerned with his monster's whereabouts until after one of his siblings is murdered; he could have taken responsibility for his creature immediately upon creation, but shortsightedly chose not to. The monster, on the other hand, was essentially a good creature until human society made him miserable and vengeful; in terms of his emotions, his intelligence, and his vindictiveness, he's ironically the most \\"human\\" character in the novel. Both man and monster are culpable, but the former is less excusable."},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"When being told I was to read Frankenstein for a college fiction class, I was not exactly thrilled. I knew what Frankenstein was about, or so I thought. Although many movies have been made about Frankenstein, none compare to Mary Shelley's novel. Shelley captures human emotion like no movie can. The expression of anger, sorrow, and helplessness of the monster created cannot be seen in such movies. Shelley's novel ties a completely fictional idea to real life in which everyone can relate. There are many things that can be taken away from this novel aside from the whole &quot;man creating monster&quot; idea. For a look at real human emotion, this is a great read."},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"This was the first time that I actually read Frankenstein only to find out the movies of Frankenstein were all fake. If you think the book is like the movie forget about it, it's a completely different story. I did not think that I would enjoy this book the way that I did.The book starts out very boring and I did not really get into it until I was half way. I really liked the way Frankenstein was so human and at the same time such a horrible monster. The science behind it was a little too unrealistic for me at the beginning but the purpose of Frankenstein himself made that change. Science did not just give him life but also features that are scary to look at, this is the part where if you like horror, you will appreciate Frankenstein's features and appearance.Fiction is definitely a big part of this book and I personally don't like fiction but still enjoyed it. The book was nothing like I expected from the understanding that I had of what was Frankenstein. This not only introduced me to the real meanings behind the book and about the time that it was written but also about how much it explains about our societies today in one way or another.I recommend this book for those who think Frankenstein is just another fictional monster because they will have a better if not a completely different story and understanding of Frankenstein and how and why he was introduced in this world."},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"Mary Shelley's Frankenstein was a fascinating book about a boy name Victor who was extremely interested in the field of science. He began studying all the natural sciences, hoping that he could discover how to overcome death and decay. He began working nights and days putting together parts of cadavers finally accumulating enough parts. With all these parts he created a gigantic creature, a creature who ended up being the cause of Victor's misery and eventually leading to his death. As you read the book you begin feeling for these characters. She had a wonderful way of describing all the details and everything, that you felt as if you were there and not just reading a book. The story also has a lot of deep meaning behind it, which dealt with Mary Shelly's real life. Altogether the book was a book that all readers should read. It is the type of book that makes reading fun and enjoyable."},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"I really enjoyed this reading although it was nothing like I had expected. I was waiting for the bolt of lightning and then this horrible creature to appear just like in the movies. I felt it was time consuming to read and at times hard to comprehend. For example many people in my class did not understand how the &quot;monster&quot; could so easily learned to read and speak. I felt at first the pace was rather slow but as the reader reached the climax of the story it became rather interesting. I, myself, was very intrigued by this point in the book and found I could not put the reading down. If I could have changed anything about this book I would have wanted Victor to tell others about his creation. After reading this story I really questioned if the \\"monster\\" was really so horrible. I feel the \\"monster\\" started off with good intentions but when he realized that his own creator wanted nothing to do with him he felt lost and alone. Was the &quot;monster&quot; really asking Victor for too much? All he wanted was a friend, someone to talk to and be with but no. Its just like Shelley asked at the beginning who's fault is it the \\"monster\\" or his creator? He, the \\"monster\\", was different and everyone fears different and has a hard time excepting different so he was perceived as an outcast. This often happens in society. Over all I feel this was a great book. It kept my attention for the most part and kept me wanting more."},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"Mary Shelley's charactorization was... lacking. None of the charactors had their own &quot;voice&quot;. This actually made it confusing to follow at times, as the protaganist, his love, and his creation all have sections where they are telling the narative... and it is often difficult to tell who is talking!While I'm glad I read the original, I probably will not re-read it."},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"Frankenstein is one of those books that makes the reader wonder how the author could have ever made this up. As a sophmore in highschool I was required to read it in for my English 2 class. I glanced through it at first and thought it to be quite verbose and overly detailed. My assumptions were wrong. When I actually got into the book I began to really enjoy it. I realized that the many details help you visualize what is going on more. Mary Shelly creates a very imaginitive and creative plot about a man who tampers with the laws of nature. She combines science and fantasy to create one of the greatest novels of all time. So if you have the patience to read this somtimes slow but fabulous book, I definately recommend you do so."},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"I decided to read Frankenstein over the Christmas holidays and like all other folk who love reading, I just couldn't put it down. How amazing, unfair and so different from today that a woman so young could undergo so much heartbreak. For me it is essential to know the context the author was living in so as to appreciate the book. She lost her mother, three children, a husband and she herself only lived to fifty-three. It must have been easy for her to imagine Frankenstein's suffering when the Creature took his loved ones. Geneva is a spooky place in Winter with all those &quot;angoissants&quot; mountains. I'm not surprised her own life and the geographical location provided her with inspiration, all at the age of nineteen!

I recommend this book to anyone with a good inagination and a passion for excitement."},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"Mary Shelley had an excellent idea when she wrote this book, however, she had a poor execution of it. This book is uneven, boring, wordy, and Mary Shelley is unable to express simple emotions like sorrow and pain in words. While this novel is generally thought-provoking, it could have been much, much better. Although it may have been a breakthrough at the time, today it simply fades into the background."},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"In &quot;Frankenstein&quot; Mary Shelly has created not only one of the most enduring of Gothic stories, but also a uniquely feminine tale of the horror of childbirth and its attendent responsibilities.While the later film versions of the story have tended to couch the telling of this story in terms of scientific over-reaching and the hubris of man who aspires to the powers of God, the original novel actually contains very little of this theme, with the famous creation scene actually occuring in one terse paragraph. There are no spark shedding electrodes or arcing bolts of electricity in Shelly's original story, only the birth of the creature, and Frankenstein's rejection of his monsterous offspring.It's hard to read &quot;Frankenstein&quot; without recognizing it's author as a young woman who had suffered at least one miscarriage. The entire work, although written from a masculine perspective, and set in a world of masculine domination, consistently deals with themes of parental abandonment and responsibiltity. The sin of Frankenstein in Shelly's original work is not his aspiration to godlike power over life and death, but his refusal to regard his artifical progeny with the nurturing and unconditional love any parent owes to his or her child.For fans both of later cinematic retellings of this story, as well as fans of the Gothic novel and those interested in reading a true nightmare myth of feminine construction, &quot;Frankenstein&quot; is a true classic that cannot be reccommended highly enough."},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"Another school assignment. I can't see why they bother. &quot;Frankenstein&quot; is a passable book: it has a plot; it has characters which aren't quite engaging as a whole, but some of them manage well enough. The thing is, there isn't much to find in this novel besides story. However, there's some. The real horror is not the monster, but the failings of humankind, and to a lesser extent the price science exacts upon nature, and ultimately the price nature exacts upon the idiots who went too far.Victor Frankenstein is such an idiot. A little too passionate (a little too like Mary Shelley's husband Percy Bysshe Shelley), he isolates himself from the people that love him, obsesses over chemistry and natural philosophy, and creates a monster from scraps of bodies recovered from charnel houses. Victor's philophobic. He ends up, one way or another, killing those that love him; because he cannot give his own creation the love and kindness it needs. Here is where Mary Shelley succeeds: she makes it clear all the while that he is a human; and because the story is narrated by him you get some sort of a glimpse into the way he was thinking. And he didn't think too differently from the average person you might meet on the street. That's scary.However, the characters are so dull that I didn't care when they were killed. Shelley does things so amazingly lame: oh no! he/she's dead, Victor laments, Victor doesn't get sense knocked into him. Count the deaths. Then look over what you've read. You will realize you saw each of them coming. And not just because you've heard a lot about this book in the first place.Yes, there's a lot of the author in here. And there's even some of her husband, the infamous Percy. The appearance of the word &quot;endeavor&quot; every other page was, I think, part of his attempt to make &quot;Frankenstein&quot; more worthy of the Romantics of the time. It was written by his 19 year old wife, whose vocabulary was apparently not so extensive as his own, so he looked on it as his duty to poke around with the manuscript. Oh, if only he'd buggered off!Teachers stumbling upon this review: please, please, make your students read stuff like &quot;Paradise Lost&quot; (a building block of Mary Shelley's and mentioned in the novel) by John Milton, much more interesting stuff. Slap before them a summary of this novel. They'll get it. Allow them to read this thing on their own time if ever they so wish. &quot;Frankenstein&quot; was praised by Sir Walter Scott: how &quot;deep&quot; can it be?"},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"&quot;Frankenstein&quot; is a typical novel from the romantic period. The story is based on the conflict of a scientist with the results of his work. But Frankenstein is far more than that: It is the story of two individuals (Frankenstein and his &quot;monster&quot;) and their acceptance and behavior in society, and of course, the novel contains a lot of latent psychological information (what would Freud have said about that?). However, it is typical for the age of romanticism that the feelings and thoughts of the individuum are at the center of the plot (see e.g. the works by Byron or by the German authors Eichendorff and Novalis). This holds as well for the music composed during that time (Schubert, Schumann, Chopin, ...). Mary Shelley describes in great detail the innermost feelings of Frankenstein and his &quot;wretch&quot; and how they changed from one minute to the other, and what made them change their moods, and why and how, and who was around etc. This actually - because presented through the entire book - makes the reading of the highly interesting story rather tedious. Story: 5 stars, Fun: 1 star"},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"Victor grew up reading the works of Paracelsus, Agrippa, and Albertus Magnus, the alchemists of the time. Toss in a little natural philosophy (sciences) and you have the making of a monster. Or at least a being that after being spurned for looking ugly becomes ugly. So for revenge the creature decides unless Victor makes another (female this time) creature, that Victor will also suffer the loss of friends and relatives. What is victor to do? Bow to the wishes and needs of his creation? Or challenge it to the death? What would you do?Although the concept of the monster is good, and the conflicts of the story well thought out, Shelly suffers from the writing style of the time. Many people do not finish the book as the language is stilted and verbose for example when was the last time you said, \\"Little did I then expect the calamity that was in a few moments to overwhelm me and extinguish in horror and despair all fear of ignominy of death.\\"Much of the book seems like travel log filler. More time describing the surroundings of Europe than the reason for traveling or just traveling. Many writers use traveling to reflect time passing or the character growing in stature or knowledge. In this story they just travel a lot.This book is definitely worth plodding through for moviegoers. The record needs to be set strait. First shock is that the creator is named Victor Frankenstein; the creature is just \\"monster\\" not Frankenstein. And it is Victor that is backwards which added in him doing the impossible by not knowing any better. The monster is well read in \\"Sorrows of a Young Werther,\\" \\"Paradise Lost,\\" and Plutarch's \\"Lives.\\" The debate (mixed with a few murders) rages on as to whether the monster was doing evil because of his nature or because he was spurned?The Thirteenth Floor"},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"In Mary Shelley's novel, there are various statements about the use of science. The field of eugenics is brought into question. The issue of cloning is brought into perspective way before its time. Shelley's novel is prophetic in so many ways for revealing the debates and scientific issues of contemporary times. From the recent FDA consideration of livestock cloning to genetically engineered crops, these controversial issues have been compared to Frankenstein science. Other past scientific innovations such as the use of pesticides like DDT have led to failure and proved dangerous for human civilization. These too were once compared to Frankenstein science, yet humankind persisted on using these chemicals, all for reasons of convenience and capital ambition on the part of corporations involved. We may see Shelley's Frankenstein as the first great scientific warning to humans in an industrial world. It may also be seen as the beginning of environmental awareness. This awareness concerns humans within their own environments such as parent/child relationships and childhood influences, as well as human impact on nature."},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"Unfortunately, the idea of what Frankenstein is about has been heartily ruined by it being adopted by the schlock film industry in the 20th century. This, the real thing, is much more amazing than any movie. When the book was published, it was also somewhat of a milestone in the history of women's writing as Shelley used a male pseudonym but when the novel became extremely popular, the truth came out and many realised that, hey, women CAN write just as well as men! The writing is at times difficult but not overly so.What I remember most from reading it is a deep sense of philosophical despair that the book conveys. Unlike most film versions, the book is based on the idea of the suffering creation and works like Milton's Paradise Lost. The creature is created and then abandonned to fate, unable to be a part of society due to its physical ugliness. Eventually, it becomes a fiend after a heap of misfortunes and psychological torture. In what I think is some of the best horror writing ever, Shelley brilliantly describes the psychological mindgames between Frankenstein and the monster. However, mixed in with the evil caused and suffered is a sense of solidarity - the monster is inflicted with a profound pain and is a philosopher as much as a murderer.The book also deals with movements like Romanticism and the Scientific Revolution and their relationship. Thus, Frankenstein's scientific obsessions are portrayed as unhealthy in terms of not being accompanied by a sense of emotional context.There is an absolute heap of other symbolism in the book but even from the basic text, there are so many ideas and emotions being presented to the reader that this deserves to be hailed as one of the great world classics."},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"I have read the Lord of the Rings, Harry Potter, the Hobbit, the Silmarillian, Star Wars books, Treasure Island, and much much more.

Mary and her husband, poet Percy Shelley, poet Lord Byron, and The Vampyre writer John William Polidori (oh, to keep such literary company...) challenged each other to write a horror story. The young Mary had travelled extensively in Geneva, Switzerland and that is where much of the story is based.The novel is written in the Gothic and Romantic style of its era, yet it can also lay claim as one of the first truly science fiction novels. In classically written Gothic/Romantic tales, detailed character ponderings combine with vivid landscape descriptions to constitute lengthy sentence structure and a major portion of the story:\\"I feel exquisite pleasure in dwelling on the recollections of childhood, before misfortune had tainted my mind and changed its bright visions of extensive usefulness into gloomy and narrow reflections upon self. Besides, in drawing the picture of my early days, I also record those events which led, by insensible steps, to my after tale of misery, for when I would account to myself for the birth of that passion which afterwards ruled my destiny I find it arise, like a mountain river, from ignoble and almost forgotten sources; but, swelling as it proceeded, it became the torrent which, in its course, has swept away all my hopes and joys.\\"The main character, Victor Frankenstein is a young man obsessed with knowledge and the determination to create a more perfect human being. After two years of pilfering body parts, he assembles his creature. On a dark rainy night (this is a Gothic tale, after all) his scientific experiment is nearly complete and he uses his instruments (Hollywood utilized lightning bolts) to bring the creature to life.As the creature comes to life, Frankenstein realizes too late what he has done:\\"How can I describe my emotions at this catastrophe, or how delineate the wretch whom with such infinite pains and care I had endeavoured to form? His limbs were in proportion, and I had selected his features as beautiful. Beautiful! Great God! His yellow skin scarcely covered the work of muscles and arteries beneath; his hair was of a lustrous black, and flowing, his teeth of a pearly whiteness, but these luxuriances only formed a more horrid contrast with his watery eyes, that seemed almost of the same colour as the dun-white sockets in which they were set, his shriveled complexion and straight black lips.\\"Poor Victor is so stricken with horror that he runs out of his laboratory to his bedchamber, leaving the monster to escape and wander the countryside. Meanwhile, the exhausted young scientist descends into a wretched succession of nightmarish dreams while pondering \\"a thing such as even Dante could not have conceived.\\"Since Hollywood has already spoiled the story by having the name \\"Frankenstein\\" come to mean the monster itself, and revealing to the general public that the monster goes on a killing rampage (excepting Abbot and Costello's version), I feel it is safe to tell you that much is true to the original story. However, lest you think that modern science, with eugenics and cloning, can improve on Victor's design, I suggest you read the novel to discover the ramifications of such experiments.A clue to the moral of the tale is that Shelley aptly subtitled her story\\"Or the Modern Prometheus\\" after the Greek mythological character who created an alternate man, but was then lashed to a rock to have his liver daily pecked at by an eagle as punishment."},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"Reason for Reading: I intend to read the upcoming non-fiction title \\"The Lady and Her Monsters\\" which is about the writing and background of the creation of the novel \\"Frankenstein\\" so I thought it would be best if I re-read the book to better appreciate the former.I am a huge Frankenstein fan! I first watched the Boris Karloff movie as a young child and have since seen it dozens of times. I've seen all the MGM sequels and have a deluxe DVD edition with commentaries, etc. I've also seen many, many different remakes, pastiches and parodies of the movie as well as reading Frankenstein themed retellings, comics and pastiches. I have read this, the original book, once before when I was quite young. It was one of the first books I took out of the library when I obtained an adult library card with special permission of my father at 12 or 13. (You had to be 14, or in highschool, to get one at the time). Needless to say at this point in time 30 years later, the movie version, specifically the James Whale (Boris Karloff) version is the one that I think of when I think of the Frankenstein story.When I went into reading this book I knew that it was a totally different story than what my mind recalls from the movies but I also remembered that it started in the Arctic with the monster relating his story to Frankenstein. So from this I was totally blown away with how incredibly different the actual story is to the conceived modern notion of the tale. The book is told in narrative form from three different points of view and is a story within a story within a story. Starting off with a mariner writing home letters to his sister as he starts an Arctic expedition and then becomes stuck in ice he recounts his tale and his meeting of Victor Frankenstein who stumbles upon them near death in his mad chase of his creature. Then Walton, the mariner, recounts the tale that Frankenstein relates to him of his life. The awful, hideous story of his wretched life. Halfway through this recounting Frankenstein stops to relate the story the creature pauses to tell him of his life story since he woke from the \\"spark of life\\" and wandered into the world on his own. Then it goes back to Frankenstein's narrative and finally ends again with Walton's letters. This way we get both Frankenstein and the creature's tales from their own mouths, in their own words as they were related to the person they spoke to.Neither Frankenstein or the creature are sympathetic which I found surprising, as in the movie I am deeply sympathetic to Karloff's monster. But in the novel, he is a vile, wicked, murdering beast who at first thinks he has human compassion but quickly is turned from having any and easily finds violence and revenge better to his suiting when he is not treated fairly by others. Frankenstein himself is simply mad, the quintessential mad scientist. Obsessed with his creation he thinks of nothing else, working in solitude day and night until he completes his reanimation of life. Upon first glimpse of this \\"life\\" he is so horrified that he runs from it and from this point on he becomes obsessed with finding it and destroying it, however the monster has developed his own lust for destroying Frankenstein and sets out to destroy him also, not bodily but in mind and soul by killing all who mean anything to him.A frightening tale that shows the futility and madness at playing God with science, even though the book mentions very little about religion. This edition I read from \\"The Whole Story\\" edition is a wonderful annotated edition which really brings the classics to life. The annotations don't particularly help explain the story any better, though there are some pictures and definitions of some items and devices one may not be familiar with. The main purpose of these annotations is to set one geographically and historically within the place and era that the book was written. Profusely illustrated with etchings and paintings of place names mentioned in the story one becomes immersed in the scenery and in this book particularly the Gothic feel comes to life. Historically we see the prisons of the time period, meet the Romantic poets and artists who shaped the life of the author and the mood which carried over into this novel. I really enjoy and recommend this edition, have several others in the series and would pick up any others I found, but unfortunately they are out of print at this time."},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"Great book.

I picked this book up to look for answers on the questions of identity and wasn't disappointed.Very interesting and definitely worth a read at least to understand the monster's perspective. And if you think its 19th century origin might be a turn off for our present generation of readers, well you will be surprised.For Mary Shelley knew how to keep up the excitement and of course the gothic appeal will have the 21st century reader turning pages with delight! :)Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"After reading this, I realized I am Frankenstein's monster. Just kidding. The language can be hard to comprehend at times, sometimes because it is truly incoherent or stilted. It wasn't scary. Even so, there are far passages that read so well they are like smelling a fragrant flower, the descriptions so clear and detailed yet eloquently stated. However, it's hard to rate this book above three stars because near the end I really had a hard time following it. It seemed the monster had died. Frankenstein came upon a sledge and his nemesis was dead, or so it said. Following that, the plot became nebulous and the passages were so exasperating I skipped many paragraphs until the point where Dr. Frankenstein had died, not the monster. Then I had...the rest of the story. But on the plus side, the plot was not predictable. With so many pluses, and so many minuses, I rate this story three stars.Perhaps one day we will be able to use DNA material to recreate a Neanderthal, creating a true to life Frankenstenian monster.My edition was close to the original, if not the original text, the cover differing from that depicted here."},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"Far from the caricatured, cartoonish Frankenstein that appears every Halloween, Mary Shelley's monster is a creature of refined human feelings, longing for love and acceptance, who turns to murder only after being repeatedly rejected by every human he encounters because of his hideous appearance. It is his creator who is truly despicable because he regards his own creature as a demon and an enemy, never once admitting or accepting his own guilt for rejecting the creature who needed love and acceptance from him most of all.Shelley's classic leaves plenty of room for speculation -- just what message was she trying to send, what allegory was she trying to make, etc.? However, one can set all these aside as I did, and simply enjoy this as a well-written book. It is old-fashioned in style and language, but that makes it even more obvious what a truly phenomenal and ground-breaking book this must have been at the time it was published.George Guidall's narration is excellent and adds much to this classic novel."},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"The opening words of Frankenstein by Mary Shelley tell us that we're in for a great ride. And a great ride it is indeed. Filled with lust, confusion, anger, vengeance, pain, death, and most importantly, life, Frankenstein is a work of art that has enthralled readers for almost two centuries, since its publishing date in the year 1818.At the beginning of our story, we're introduced to Robert Walton through his letters to his sister, Margaret Saville. We learn that he is about to embark on a journey that will take him to the top of the world, the northern pole. He excitedly describes the stages he progresses through as he prepares for his trek, but with one complaint. Robert Walton yearns for a friend to share his travels, excitement, and passion for knowledge with.Not too many pages later, we encounter a strange man who joins Walton on his ship near the north pole. This stranger proves to be a friend to Walton, but not quite the friend he was originally yearning for. When the stranger learns of Walton's desire to explore and gain large amounts of knowledge possessed by few others, he tells us his story in an attempt to dissuade Walton from continuing his voyage. The stranger tells us of his life as Victor Frankenstein, creator of the most horrendous monster ever to disgrace the whole of earth with his presence.I thoroughly enjoyed this tale written by Mary Shelley.

Of course I have seen the movie. This book is nothing like the movie. After I understood that it was written during the Romanticism period than it was actually a pleasure to read. At nineteen, how old Mary Shelley was when she wrote Frankenstein, she wrote an amazing and deeply profound story of a being that is looking for what everyone of us look for: the comfort of companionship and love of another. Human beings are meant to be in relationships of one kind or another. Mary Shelley also does an admirable job showing the anguish of Victor. You see the love,support, and concern of his family. It was thought-provoking and poignant. I found myself hoping the being would find what he so desperately craved. i felt his frustration at such an injustice, as he saw it. If you have seen the movie I strongly recommend Frankenstein. I promise, you won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"Their product description was spot on.

He wants to be helpful, ably drives a dogsled, and smarts at rejection. He's not the Frankenstein of the movies. Shelley uses a \\"story-within-a-story\\" technique for sharing her tale: A sea captain tells his wife precisely what Dr. Frankenstein has told him, and the good doctor's narrative is littered with quotes from letters, stories from friends, and even a long monologue from the monster himself.Two hundred years ago, this story may have \\"caused one's blood to congeal in terror its premeditated course through one's very veins,\\" but now it seems pretty un-horrific."},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"I am very pleased with my purchase.

It is good to see that it is now available on the newest technology that has come out lately. This is a story that really deals with the humanity in us all. When we are faced with something different our reactions are not always notable. There is a battle in this book that starts at the beginning and weaves it's way through to the end. There are so many different aspects of the human nature in this book and it spells out just how cruel we all can be at times. The atmosphere in this book will stick with you for some time after you turn off the lights.Being out on the ice of the attic sea is not a place where you would think a story like this would start, but it leads right into the story better and sets the tone of the book right away. The tortured sole that was placed in the creation was surprising human and seemed to have more feel for the human condition then any other character in the book. The interactions of everyone in the book is true to how we act even in the modern times.The story is so known but there is nothing like reading it on a dark rainy afternoon."},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"I liked it but it was difficult to read on the train.Maybe I should have read it in a place where I could be able to really absorb the material.It was drawn out."},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"Victor grew up reading the works of Paracelsus, Agrippa, and Albertus Magnus, the alchemists of the time. Toss in a little natural philosophy (sciences) and you have the making of a monster. Or at least a being that after being spurned for looking ugly becomes ugly. So for revenge the creature decides unless Victor makes another (female this time) creature, that Victor will also suffer the loss of friends and relatives. What is victor to do? Bow to the wishes and needs of his creation? Or challenge it to the death? What would you do?Although the concept of the monster is good, and the conflicts of the story well thought out, Shelly suffers from the writing style of the time. Many people do not finish the book as the language is stilted and verbose for example when was the last time you said, \\"Little did I then expect the calamity that was in a few moments to overwhelm me and extinguish in horror and despair all fear of ignominy of death.\\"Much of the book seems like travel log filler. More time describing the surroundings of Europe than the reason for traveling or just traveling. Many writers use traveling to reflect time passing or the character growing in stature or knowledge. In this story they just travel a lot.This book is definitely worth plodding through for moviegoers. The record needs to be set strait. First shock is that the creator is named Victor Frankenstein; the creature is just \\"monster\\" not Frankenstein. And it is Victor that is backwards which added in him doing the impossible by not knowing any better.

There are many words that are harder for kids to understand because it was written in old english. Frankestein was written very well even if it was a harder book. From the beginning to the end there was always some \\"action\\" or excitment going on. I don't want to discorage young readers from reading this book, but you'll understand it much better if you wait a couple of years to read it."},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"Reading Frankenstein and thinking it would be like the movies in Hollywood is totally wrong. When reading Frankenstein in the beginning it is somewhat slow but turns gruesome. People get killed even in their innocents. The monster is truly evil, not nice. Middle of the book becomes interesting but you feel sorrow and some sympathy for the monster. In the end the monster himself reveals the complete truth of what he is. This may sound like a book report but feelings cannot capture the feeling that erupts inside during the novel.If you look at the novel from a critique point of view it is a horror but still spellbinding. The story is not just simple and scary but helps you understand the nature of emotions and the beast inside our hearts. Love and wanting of acceptance is an emotion that is not understood easily but this book uncovers the secrecy on how one is wanting to be accepted in society.For the people who like books of horror but no meaning this book is okay. People who want a true classic but be mystified by a monster that is untaimable this is an excellent book. If you are looking for a sweet feminine or just a normal novel this might not fit you. This novel in my opinion is a true classic and you can tie it to todays world easily even though this was written over 100 years ago."},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"In an age where scientific knowledge is rapidly expanding, Mary Shelley's \\"Frankenstein\\" is especially important. Science warrants both caution and careful use of conscience from those who unlock its secrets; for what is labeled \\"progress\\" can unexpectedly backfire and cause harm.Early in the novel, Victor Frankenstein reveals his deep desire to acquire knowledge of science. The young man proudly proclaims that he will achieve \\"far more\\" than anyone else ever has and that he would \\"pioneer\\" new ways to \\"unfold to the world the deepest mysteries of creation.\\" He diligently carries out his operation without carefully considering the consequences of his actions. For Victor, completing the task takes priority over worrying about the possible consequences.One can easily draw a direct connection to our own world. Genetic researchers are often faced with ethical dilemmas in which others accuse them of \\"playing God.\\" Perhaps the day isn't too far off where one will be able to order not only clothes but also kids from catalogs. Nike kids would be better athletes and Calvin Klein could sell children that would blossom into beautiful models.Today it is just as important for scientists to proceed with both caution and conscience. If, like Victor, they work only to achieve a goal at any cost, it is very possible that the holocaust of the new millennium won't be as visible to the public because the weak, the handicapped, the diseased, and any so-called \\"undesirables\\" will be silently discarded before they ever have any kind of a chance.Should be required reading for high school and above."},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"This is the true and orginal Frankenstein story. My high school teacher recommended this book to me and I am grateful she did. This book is packed with suspense as well as horror. You will be drawn into this book and will feel like you are actually living in Frankenstein's world. Mary Shelley is a great writer and everyone should read this classic."},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"Frankenstein---The word conjures up an image of a gigantic monster out to demolish mankind and everything attributed to it,an ogre created by man bent on dissolving his maker in utter misery. \\"Frankenstein\\" has travelled over the ages to become synonymous with destrution,blood,murder,havoc,fear and everything and anything that's even remotely associated with evil. \\"Frankenstein\\" has become a cliche.And that's exactly where the greatness of the authoress Mary Shelley rests. The plot in the novel is simple enough---a young ardent man steeply soaked in \\"natural philosophy\\" creates a monster with his genius,regrets his doing,asunders it and then suffers the agony of his own architect---but the classic proportions of the tale are vividly accounted in the entwining philosophies,morals,allusions and allegories that it invokes to. It's indeed a wonder that Shelley could've exploited an innovative, simple idea to garb it into a massively broad saga at the tender age of 19,but then again, that's what you call greatness. Take Mozart for inatance. He was composing symphonies and sonatas when he was barely six!Mary Shelley's \\"Frankenstein\\" begins when a friendless, doughty and resiliently ambitious seafarer Robert Walton saves a strange man from the brink of death amidst a sea of ice whose first words are:\\"Before I come on board your vessel, will you have the kindness to inform me whither you are bound?\\" This is Frankenstein, Victor Frankenstein and the whole novel revolves around him and the monster he had created. Walton writes to his sister Margaret in England about the fall of Frankenstein from greatness and as the tale unfolds from the man of science's own shivering lips, we've taken on a ride on a wave that flatters to deceives.Victor Frankenstein is a young Swiss who leaves his hometown Geneva to pursue natural philosophy at the University of Ingolstadt. His knowledge of Cornelius Agrappa, Alberta Magnus and Paracelus pushes him towards a realm beyond the confined boundaries of chemistry and two years of dedication and devotion and Professor M.Walton's \\"words of fate,enounced to destroy\\" him and he reaps a result of magnanimous proportions. He creates \\"the daemon\\", his \\"own vampire, my(his) own spirit let loose from the grave, and forced to destroy all that was dear to men\\", a monster whose gigantic stature,ugly features,hoarse voice and crude appearance repugnates its maker and Frankenstein denounces him. And denounces his fortune,career, family,peace of mind and charm of life.For the monster,unbaptized and solitary,comes back again and again to haunt the Swiss. It first kills his youngest brother William,then transfigures into the cause of the doom of the innocent Justine Moritz who's falsely charged with the child's murder;the ogre puts Frankenstein's childhood friend Henry Clerval to death,mortifies his father to his death-bed,destroys the life of his love Elizabeth on their wedding night,allures his creator to death's dwelling and ultimately drags himself to te inevitable end.The plot then is as plain as white paper,as ever so slightly whispered earlier, but that the scope of discussion of characters and events is as extensive as the horizon is illustriously brought to the picture as we explore the landscape of \\"Frankenstein\\". The reader cannot help but sympathise both with the creator and his creation---one repenting his \\"unhllowed arts\\" for being \\"not in deed,but in effect\\" the curse and murderer of one's family,and by extent,mankind;the other willing to harmonise oneself into the fabrication of society when one's physical features are not withstanding. The notion of Frankenstein an ignorant and languid person pets is that of a hideous fiend mustered from animation pictures and cartoons but the essence of it transcends much farther from this simple and debvastating prejudice.The theme of the novel,that of man inviting his own destruction and being chased by his own myriad forces of vices,is disturbing enough and the sophistication even more muddling. Frankenstein is a distorted harmless young man who realises his blunder when it's too late. A man shadowed by a curse he himself has raised and who loses one beloved after another is always going to transpire confusement and indecision and so does he who actually makes the novel happen. He seeks revenge but knows not how,he is compassionate towards his \\"fiend enemy\\" but refuses to show it. The reader embarks on his queerness not to fulfill his promise and manufacture female partner for his creation. Frankenstein reasons with himself that two fiends would be one too many for the world to endure and their posterity could aspire to evilry. But was he right to believe what Brutus did of Caesar in William Shakespeare's \\"Julius Caesar\\"? That \\"He would be crown'd:/How that might change his nature, there's the question.....Fashion it thus:that what he is,augmenter,/Would run to these and these extremities? That he should kill his own child and \\"sport thus with life\\"?And indeed was Frankenstein's monster as terrible and catastrophic as he deciphered him to be? In the struggle of this fiend to congregate his being with men and their ways,we find an underlying sense of pathos and self-consciouness expressed bluntly and confusedly. At one moment, the colossal beast stoops down to piti and submission:\\"Was I then a monster,a blot upon the earth,from which all men fled, and whom all men disowned?\\" On another occasion,he tranmutes into a figure of abhorrence and disastrous:\\"You are my creator, but I am your master;obey\\". This juggling of self-assertion and self-submission makes the giant a confused,complex individual as well as a victim of circumstances since his motives are misconstrued. The cruel end of his strangely pleasant relationship with the cottagers and the rustic soughting \\"to destroy the saviour of his child\\" provide testimonies. The reader discerns his parallel with Shylock in Shakespeare's \\"The Merchant of Venice\\",whose tale too is a tragedy of circumstancs, the awkwardness and hardships of a Bohemian surviving on the fringes of human attachment.The similarities between the Creator and the Creation are in abundance and are stark. Both are equally anguished---the Creator rueing His germ of an idea to build anything so splendourly ugly and the Creation questioning his independence and the Creator's need to make him. This is the allegory,or if you will,the theme of of Shelley's darkly eerie narrative. The invokation to the first-person narrative,the plethora of similes and metaphors,the lofty diction and the intricacy of language augment to the authoress's aim to portray the dark shades of life on a more gentle and lighter backdrop. In Frankenstein's pursuit of his monster,the authoress alludes to man's constant hunt of vice in his own self,in the fiend's direct conveyance of his mortal,spiritual and moral wounds,Shelley reveals the hopelessness of the socially deprived;in the end, she hungs upon the wall the conclusion that all such chases ollide with. Herman Melville's classic \\"Moby Dick\\" ran on a similar line and it,like \\"Frankenstein\\",is a tour de force. First publisher in 1818 and set against the era of the eighteenth century, Mary Shelley's intuitive idea dressed in wondrous clothes sparkling with divine metaphysics and resonding portayal of life,truth and futility sustains a powerful impact on us even long after w've closed the book and started chasing our own Frankenstein's monster."},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"I thought this would be a lurid gothic work of sensationalism, but it is actually a sensitive and touching story of alienation and the ambiguity of creating human life. Victor Frankenstein has the ultimate case of post-partum depression, recoiling instantly from his creation as an abominatin, and then spending the rest of the novel oscillating between hatred of it, and a sense of guilty responsibility for it. The story glosses over the movie-fodder details (for instance, casually noting that Victor has discovered the secret of bestowing life on inanimate material, but never really addressing that issue or narrative) and instead is a wholly psychological novel, and a very fine and sensitive one."},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"Victor grew up reading the works of Paracelsus, Agrippa, and Albertus Magnus, the alchemists of the time.

Rather than the cheesy, plodding monster that is out to destroy everyone, the actual Frankenstein is an intelligent creation of his creator, Victor Frankenstein (the monster himself actually has no name). The monster yearns for acceptance and companionship, but when he is constantly turned away, scorned, and chased, he decides to destory everything his creator holds dear. In this way, Frankenstein chases the monster to the ends of the earth (literally). A gripping, touching (sometimes) and thrilling book so completely different from any of the movie versions that you won't understand how Hollywood got the cheesy plots from this book.

It's also not exactly science fiction since the details of the monster's creation are left out..However, this book is still clearly a classic. It's amazing to think it was written 200 years ago by a 19-year-old woman. The themes are as fresh today as they must have been novel when the book was written.The primary theme, in my opinion, is whether the monster is to be considered a human. This topic is seen in the debate over cloning. Secondly, Shelley puts forth the notion that the monster is inherently kind &amp; caring but is driven to evil by society's obsession with outward appearance.I agree with other reviewers who say that information is left out. I was puzzled as to how the monster learned to speak so well in such a short amount of time. The issues of food &amp; clothing are also in question. However, looking at the larger themes involved, these details are minimal and do not detract from the story.."},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"Well, this book wasn't really what I expected.

It follows the ambitious Victor Frankenstein who has set out to do the impossible: resurrect the dead. Victor is so swept up in his ambitions that he fails to acknowledge any of the consequences of following his dream -- that is until it is to late. Despite its great plot, Frankenstein is great for another reason as well: its timelessness. Many of the ethical questions regarding the limits of technology that Shelley pursues in Frankenstein are relevant today with the advent of cloning and genetic engineering."},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"This book was not all THAT great. I found it rather boring most of the story because Dr. Frankenstein and the wretch talk on for, what seems like ages, when they could 'sum it up' in about one paragraph. The theme is great, but it was a long book for what Mary Shelley is portraying. I recommend seeing the movie, as the lighting up scene in the movie is MUCH better then the one in the book. The book stated something of this sort: And then he was alive. Nope, no lightning, no of those 'shreeky funny squealing noises' evil doctors make. In fact, Dr. Frankenstein wasn't that evil at all. I don't recommened reading this book on your own free leisure time unless you enjoy reading classic books. I think this book is classic because they made a good movie out of it. If you have read this book: you cannot learn the whole english language in TWO YEARS! Another thing that bugged me was the fact that some of the stuff in it was so surreal.

But may I remind the reader that Mary Shelley has made an incredible leap into the future of science to bring her audience what may have been (at the time) a procedure for bringing dead tissue to life. It may seem fantastic, but Shelley's creative talents have intrigued readers for decades. The most ingenius aspect of the novel is not in its style, but the ideology. Shelley has injected her tale of horror with a dose of social commentary that holds true throughout the ages, teaching a valuable lesson about judgment of character. Especially poignant today, Shelley has also given an eerily foreshadowed warning to us about the possible dangers in genetic engineering."},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"I read this book almost entirely in one sitting.

Mary had quite the imagination! The novel did not disappoint me whatsoever. I found it to be a great read and overall one of those stories that you just can't instantly judge as which character is the antagonist or the protagonist. The novel makes you think deeply about both Victor and the monster he created. It's the splitting image of a gothic novel and indeed just as scary and amazingly thought up as can get. To imagine one man creating his own human is an idea that is mad as well as amazing to think even of.The story starts off where a ship up North finds a man and takes him up on their ship, and the leader listens to the story the man tells in agony and woe. It's of Victor as when he was younger, and happy and fascinated in an idea he conjured, of creating his own human. But only discord happens afterwards, and Victor realizes he must destroy his creation before the whole human race is in danger. But alas, the monster has a negotiation, and Victor must decide if he will uptake it for the sake of his family and the rest of the world's safety.This is a story that will leave you thinking deeply and possibly shedding a tear. It's up to the the reader nonetheless, to wonder if they dare read such a chilling tale."},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"Rereading this work one wonders is it silly or not, and if it is not silly, why couldn't Mary Shelley have repeated her achievement. She lived a long life, enjoying fame as Shelley's widow.The work is seemingly as marvellous as ever. The wild story is perfectly balanced by the writing done in the classical style of the times. Frankenstein is, of course, a variant of the Prometheus myth. Both Byron and Shelley were working on the myth in their poetic careers when this novel was composed, rather as a lark.Mary Shelley describes Scotland and Switzerland, places of particular and significant happiness to her. Victor Frankenstein discovers he has the power of bestowing animation. He beholds the monster he created on a day in November.Victor learns from his father of the death of his younger brother William. Returning to his father's house, he discovers that a girl, Justine Moritz, is suspected of having committed the murderous deed. Victor puts forth the claim that Justine is innocent. Poor Justine is convicted and seeking absolution at the point of her execution, she makes a false confession. Victor feels that he is really the murderer. His visage shows despair, subject to detection by his cousin Elizabeth.Victor finds the demon at Mount Blanc. The monster reminds him that he is his creation. The monster recounts to Victor his adventures in voyeurism. He surreptitiously assisted the cottagers upon whom he spied. He gathered wood for them. From them he became aware of language and began to note their poverty. The monster educated himself by means of the works of Goethe, Plutarch and Milton. By showing himself, the monster caused the family to depart.He wants Victor to produce a female. Victor fears the disappointed fiend, but finds he cannot overcome his repugnance to make a mate for the creature. He is also faced with the duty and desire to wed his cousin, but he is conscious of the threat of death to his bride should he wed. Victor undergoes the death of his friend Clerval and imprisonment in Ireland. His fiendish adversary pursues him to the end. The finale is operatic. The doubling effect throughout the novel is masterly."},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"Mary Shelley's &quot;Frankenstein&quot; is at once firmly in the tradition of the Gothic genre that was so popular in the eighteenth century and one of the first of the science fiction genre that was to become so important in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. It remains one of the defining works of both genres. The mad scientist, tampering with Nature with disastrous results, has become a stock character of SciFi/horror. As for the Monster itself, only Dracula rivals him as a horror icon. So the novel is important for its place in literary history, but does it still stand up on its own merits as an individual work?The first thing to say is that it is not the story you know from the Hollywood versions. The scientist is called Frankenstein and he created a man; the similarity ends there. All the details are different. The novel is a strange, obsessive tale, complex in structure and rich in psychological symbolism. The real, underlying themes are incest, sibling rivalry and the self-destructive power of guilt. I will refrain from further comment on the story itself, because you are better coming to it fresh and letting it unfold. In that respect, the Bantam Classic edition has an excellent introduction by Diane Johnson which however, is full of spoilers. Read it after the novel itself. Johnson's interpretation is along psychoanalytic lines which I normally find unconvincing but in this case I think are right on the mark.The author's style is always competent, often elegent, but never sublime. She is not the poet of the family. We are offered lengthy word-portraits of Alpine landscapes that are clearly intended to transport the readers but in fact leave them prosaicly in place.Not in the first rank of literature therefore, but so strikingly imaginative and replete with such memorable imagery that it is still worth reading."},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"I ask if Mary Shelley's Frankenstein is really all its cracked up to be. For generations, this book has been rated as one of the greatest horror stories of all time. I can understand at the time this was written it horrified many people, but did it really stand the test of time?My main problem with the book was the lack of information. So many things were left out, especially the details on how The Creature was actually created. The general writing style that Mary Shelley used when writing this book is very weak, and isnt supported enough by actual fact to make it beleivable. It seems that on many occasions, she avoids getting into details about things she knows nothing about, and just assumes the reader will accept this. I needed more than just excuses to keep me wanting to read on.This isnt my only complaint, we reach other voids as well. When The Creature is drifting around for months on end, he suspicously, and coincidentally, finds cloaths, food, and fire out of nowhere. These coincidences not only distract, but confuse the reader at times. It sometimes provokes the idea that maybe Mary Shelley herself doesnt know what to do, which ultimatelly supports my argument on her weak writing style.I was gravely dissapointed in this book after I finished it, and was left wanting much, much more out of it. It could have been much better. It could have been a satire on human life, or given a much deeper question on what is it to be human, or to be God, or what it means to be given life, or a soul. These were the questions I was asking throughout my read, and these are the questions that were never answered sufficiently enough.I read this book to get a taste of the classics, and what a good horror story might be like...if you want to read a horror classic, read The Exorcist, or Bram Stoker's Dracula...I always liked Lagosi more than Karloff anyways."},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"God almighty. This book was a struggle. At points, i was halfway into it, but unfortunately, Shelley always said, &quot;No, stay an armlength away from me.&quot; I think the main thing i hated about it was how Victor was always saying, &quot;Oh, and my heart was always troubled. The monster led me to my self-destruction and doom.&quot; Shelley wrote this so the readers might sympathise with his plight, yet she should've paid attention to the saying, &quot;Show, Don't Tell.&quot; And the constant &quot;Words cannot describe the sorrow i felt,&quot; really did bug me as well. If you're published, that is, slap-bang in the middle of an industry based around words, you SHOULD be able to describe stuff, else you shouldn't be in the business.

It's repetitive, rambling and very often, boring. The term \\"miserable wretch\\" can be found practically every two pages, Shelley likes to have her characters write marathon-length letters to each other and the good Dr. Frankenstein has a tendency to go staring at mountains for chapters at a time. If you can ignore all these imperfections, Frankenstein truly is a rare gem indeed. It has withstood the test of time by infecting many-a-generation with the vision of a solitary, man-made creature and his tortured creator. More movies and books have been created around Shelley's idea's than I have fingers. A tour down a local CVS during Halloween will yield you with at least five different \\"Frankenstein\\" costumes to pick from. Frankenstein is a part of our culture. Media and commercialism aside, Frankenstein also has a lot to say about our science as well. I honestly can't think of any other fiction book that expressed the same concern for the state of bio-technology and ethics than this novel. Worried about test-tube babies? Human testing? Cloning? This book has it all. And to add more icing to the cake, this book was one of the first to worry about it. Sure, the text might be unrefined. But the idea itself is worth the 233 pages, and enough to make me give this book a 3.5 on the rating scale.. Read this book when you have the spare time, you'll be pleasantly surprised!"},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"Frankenstein's a classic, and I'm sure that most of you reading this will have either read it or at least heard it discussed. Shelley's novel is very interesting both from a historical perspective and in how it approaches the horror genre. Frankenstein is a book, however, not an interesting piece of memorabilia, and my high expectations while reading it were not so much matched as smashed to pieces.When compared to other classic horror authors, Shelley's outlook is interesting in that it seems to be one profoundly antithetical to horror. Shelley's world is a fascinating place passionately described. Landscapes, waterways, and glaciers are all rendered vivid at the stroke of her pen, and there is a vastness to her settings - to the waters which, at one point, bear her protagonist haplessly away from his destination or from the freezing arctic where both the tale's frame and conclusion takes place. All that might be superficially relatable to the feeling of the world as a dangerous place that one gets with many horror authors, but while Shelley's world is a dangerous place, it's never a frightening one. That's not to say that Shelley does not attempt to invoke fear, mind you, but her fear comes entirely from what's known to man, from what man creates. The natural world here is, at times, both invigorating setting and potentially lethal setback, but it is never the enemy itself, and there is never the claustrophobic feeling that Shelley's world is populated by the unknown. Her horror comes purely from man, a horror that is frightening precisely because it comes from man.Shelley is, in many ways, the exact opposite of Lovecraft (who tackled similar themes in Herbert West - Reanaimator). Lovecraft took a resolutely rational approach to portraying the irrational, an atheist evoking towering monstrosities to show just how empty our world really is. Shelley, on the other hand, takes an irrational route to portraying the rational. Shelley's writing isn't precisely spiritual, but she does constantly invoke the supernatural with regards to chance, motivation, and the outcome of events (\\"It was a strong effort of the spirit of good; but it was ineffectual. Destiny was too potent, and her immutable laws had decreed my utter destruction.\\" (p. 23)), all the while making her monster strictly scientific and rational in nature, albeit impossible by any natural laws. The romanticism of the text - the feeling that the world is something vast and wondrous all around us to be felt and experienced - shifts for the chapters that the monster narrates. The monster is scientific in his outlook, piecing together our world from observation and trial and error. There is a lot of stumbling around in these sections, and the outcome of the monster's tale is rather obvious, but these sections are still by far the most powerful of the book.Everyone knows the basic story of Frankenstein, I think: Victor Frankenstein makes a monster from dead flesh, and the monster's not the nicest of fellows, though one must admit that it's rage is somewhat justifiable. The key flaw in Frankenstein is the near total lack of tension, caused both by wordiness and a horrendously loose plot. Shelley's prose is very much driven by the character's emotional state. Her writing latches onto an event and circles around and around on it, pontificating at such length on the most minute matters that it soon manages to loop around entirely and contradict itself. On page 141, we learn that: \\"As the period fixed for our marriage drew nearer, whether from cowardice or a prophetic feeling, I felt my heart sink within me.\\" Then, on the very next page: \\"Indeed, as the period [of our marriage] approached, the threat appeared more as a delusion, not to be regarded as worthy to disturb my peace, while the happiness I hoped for in my marriage wore a greater appearance of certainty.\\" (p. 142) Both being terrified and undisturbed, now that's a feat of cognitive dissonance, Victor.As for the actual plotting, one would be able to reach roughly a hundred of this book's hundred and sixty-seven pages and assume it had nothing whatsoever to do with any monster. In the author's reprinted foreword, we learn that Shelley intended Frankenstein to be a short story but was persuaded to make it a novel. The signs of filler are everywhere; the book is an exercise in the most lax plotting, and bloat practically bursts forth from its seemingly slight page count.The novel's frame story is a man exploring the arctic who stumbles upon Victor in pursuit of his monster. Those opening pages are told through letters from the man to his sister. But here's the catch: Frankenstein is not spotted until page eight, and his story does not begin for several more pages. The opening scenes of the story are spent setting up the frame character who is almost wholly irrelevant to the novel. It's a slight matter, admittedly, but it's a sign of the excess to come.Frankenstein is ashamed of his creation and does his best to try and put it out of sight and out of mind. That's totally fine. It's believable and shows every scene of leading to personal struggle and all that. But it's taken to absurd lengths. Frankenstein flees his apartment when he creates the monster, and then proceeds to do nothing about it. It only really becomes important again when he's about to lead a friend into his abode: \\"I dreaded to behold this monster; but I feared still more that Henry should see him.\\" (p. 38) Bringing dead tissue to murderous and horrible life is upsetting, sure, but if our friends saw it'd just be too much! Read a bit too fast and you might be left with the impression that Frankenstein isn't worried so much about breaking all natural and moral laws but rather the playboys he might've left in plain sight.Perhaps I should give Victor a bit more leeway, though. After all, he'd just been subjected to a rather bad shock. Shortly after, he comes down with a debilitating fever, and maybe we should excuse him for his actions. In fact, the book seems to be looking up. He's heading back, and it seems that something terrible has happened n his absence. If this was the only instance of bizarre nonchalance, it'd almost not be worth mentioning. But it is, of course, not the only instance. Far from it. Frankenstein is a master of fretting. He has perfected the art of completely ignoring the monstrosity he's created for pages on end while he does absolutely nothing, all the while thinking about how he must hurry to resolve the situation before it rends him and all he loves limb from limb.The worst example of this comes when Victor takes a multi-month sightseeing tour of the United Kingdom. This section is infuriating. Perpetually horrified, Frankenstein takes the time out of his busy schedule to visit tourist attraction after tourist attraction. These are, every one of them, described. Not in terms of the plot, or even in terms of how the character feels about them. Nope. We just get to have brief history lessons: \\"We passed a considerable period at Oxford, rambling among its environs, and endeavoring to identify every spot which might relate to the most animating epoch of English history. Our little voyages of discovery were often prolonged by the successive objects that presented themselves. We visited the tomb of the illustrious Hampden...\\" (p. 117) It goes on like that. For pages.Sadly, when Frankenstein does come around to the point, it's not much better. Now, there are effective sections. The problem is that they're few and far apart. The majority of the books climactic scenes drown whatever genuine emotion there was to be found in torrents of melodrama, obscuring tragedy with phrases like: \\"The human frame could no longer support the agonies that I endured\\" (p. 129). The core of the novel is never described to the reader. Any chance of us developing our own terror of the monster is smothered by Victor's awe inspiring gushing.The issue is not truly the scenes of action themselves but rather Frankenstein's general personality. He responds to every event with rapture or terror; he is incapable of concluding the simplest sentence without an emotional exclamation point, a habit that's rendered even more grating when coupled with his indecisiveness. When first confronted by the monster's demands, he says: \\"'I do refuse it [...] and no torture shall ever extort a consent from me.'\\" (p. 104) Then, after a single page, he admits: \\"I was moved. I shuddered when I thought of the possible consequences of my consent, but I felt that there was some justice in his argument.\\" (p. 105) The end result of such effusive dialogue is a thundering hesitancy, a narrative filled with grand declarations that, ultimately, amounts to nothing at all.If Frankenstein had been written last year, I would have declared it turgid and sworn never to read the author again. As it's a classic, however, my disappointment's mixed with incredulity. Frankenstein is not bereft of virtues. The premise is excellent, but it's horribly executed. The monster's perspective was interesting, but it's highly digressive (even if less so than the main narrative). And so on. Frankenstein may be worth reading for its historical value, but, as a novel, I found its every page miserable.[Note: all page numbers from the Dover Thrift Edition]"},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"I've seen other people who have rated this book well, but cannot understand where they see the ingenious in this book. Personally when I started reading this I hoped for a scary book that infered on human behavior. What I got was a drawn of boring story set in 4 parts.The beginning is somewhat interesting and delves on Frankenstein the scientist learning about life and developing the monster. This part has a somewhat boring start, but once he starts making it it goes faster. Then once hes done with this the monster is made..... and it slows down to a miserable pace.From here it will have short spurts of something exciting, like for seven pages, then it goes into a fifty page boring streak, prattling on about details you don't care about. If it wants to emphasize that Frankenstein is lonely, it takes 25 pages of examples when five would be sufficient. From about the time Frankensteins monster is born you want it to die and let the story be over with because it is so boring. Not to mention predictable. I could predict the deaths of some of the people fifty pages away! Let me just say leave this book on the shelf and don't start to read it. You'll hate the book, and yet you'll probably make yourself finish it just because you started it.

With all th enew science fiction and horror novels of the time, the theme seems somewhat generic, and the philosophic ideas presented about man are nice, but the story seems to be put together hastily and without much consideration for details. For example, one second, Frankenstein (the creator of the monster) is studying chemistry at a university, the next thing we know, he has the ability to &quot;bestow life on an inatimate object!&quot; Where did that come from? Can we be any more random? Such a complex story should have been longer than 206 pages; perhaps a trilogy would have been more effective.

He is totally clueless regarding the people around him. Everything revolves only and always around him. Despite being allegedly brilliant, he has the critical thinking skills of a newt.This book is, in a way, a good example of the evils of racism, but I doubt that Shelly or most of her readers understood it that way. Basically, Frankenstein's monster was deemed wicked and depraved merely because he was deformed and ugly, not because of any inherent character flaws. In fact, during the book, we learn that he was amazingly intelligent and sensitive. He went off the rails, so to speak, only after constantly enduring deprivation and scorn inflicted upon him merely because of how he looked. Yeah, if you throw enough brickbats at a person, eventually they might retaliate. Big surprise. So, in Shelly's distorted world view, one's throwing the brickbats at creatures whose only sin is ugliness, isn't depraved, but if the receiver of the undeserved brickbats retaliates in any way, then that retaliation confirms depravity? Clearly, Shelly had a very undeveloped mind.Do yourself a favor and don't bother with this book. It really and truly is atrocious. In addition to a story that makes no rational sense, the book is backed with tedious page after tedious page of the typically horrid 19th century gratuitous glorification of nature and of excessive maudlin brooding on one's emotional state.

While not as engaging Dracula, the story does have an element found in Stoker's novel and most 19th century horror literature; a certain mix of roles where humans are the monsters and monsters are victims. An ambiguity of wrong and right, good and evil, the inevitable climax between those forces and a moral and lesson that is hard won and forever lifechanging for the characters and the readers.

The book was long & at times very boring."},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"Once upon a time, I had to read Frankenstein in high school, and I certainly wasn't a fan. The language was difficult, the story lengthy, and I just didn't see the point. Truth be told, I don't think I even read the whole thing, but I honestly can't remember anymore. The only part of the story I did remember, which is why I wonder if I read it in its entirety, was the monster trying to talk to the family he liked, and them reacting very badly to him.Recently, I read A.E. Rought's Broken, which is a spinoff of Frankenstein, and I decided that I really needed to sit down and read Frankenstein in order to make a decent comparison of the two novels. So I did. And you know what? I really liked it. Yes, the language in the beginning is difficult, and that makes it feel more lengthy than it really is, but it's a great story, and I found that if I could get past the more boring epistolary beginning of the novel, to the part where Frankenstein begins his tale, it was actually quite interesting. As I read, I found myself really getting into the story, and the questions of humanity versus science piqued my interest in a way it never has before. I kept changing allegiances, yelling at Victor, then yelling at the monster. In truth, Victor shouldn't have played with life, but the monster should have started killing, either. The monster is livid for being abandoned, but in reality, Victor ran out of the room in fear, and the monster left of his own volition prior to Victor's return. So, the idea of abandonment, in my opinion, is a bit weak. I'd run if I was scared, too. But Victor came back. Yet, then again, if someone went yelling and screaming out of a room that I was in, would I wait around for them to come back? Nope, I'd get out too. So, I completely understand why the monster left. This back and forth debate I found myself having was actually a lot of fun, but it didn't stop there. Once the murders begin, I found myself hating the monster, and then hating Victor and humanity when the monster explained his tale. I originally thought Victor should have made a companion for the monster, but then again, Victor's fears of a female monster choosing her own path and running rampant was a good point. And this leaves me with the question of who is truly at fault? Victor, for creating the monster, or the monster for using fear and anger prior to attempts at civil conversation?Shelley has some amazing points that she brings up within this classic novel, and I completely understand why it would have invoked fear in the hearts of her readers in the 1800s, as well cause great debates. I also think it's pretty cool that now, fifteen years later, I can go back to a classic I \\"hated\\" and find it all together riveting. Is it because my mind has matured over the last decade, or is it because no one is forcing me to read it?

So I open to the first page......Ummm...okay...so, there's some guy writing letters. Should get to the good stuff anytime soon.The book was a slow read from the get-go. By the time Frankenstein had created the Monster I was forcing myself to read this book because I HAD to read it.

I read Dracula earlier this year and it wasn't at all what I thought. Frankenstein, similarly, had very little to do with the films. While there are vague connections, the blind man, the murders and executions, the book was significantly different. First of all, this is a Victorian novel. The prose style is refined and sophisticated. Frankenstein is French living in the Swiss Alps. He is also a young college student when he creates the monster. He neither creates a bride for the monster nor does he celebrate his achievement of animating dead tissue. No castle in Bavaria nor lightning nor creepy assistant. Just a romantic young scholar obsessed with the secrets of nature.The book has a comic edge. The monster, rejected by his maker, goes off to live in a village where he hides and simply observes peasants living. He learns to speak by listening to them. He also learns human kindness and dignity. When he reveals himself and is rejected by them, he seeks out his maker and tells his tale. Somehow, he speaks better than Frankenstein. The dialogue Shelly gives the monster would be a stretch for a character purported to have doctoral level studies in the liberal arts. He is so sophisticated that he recognized man's search for meaning and the significance of a mate and asks Frankenstein to create him a mate. To the extend that the monster's dialogue is comical, this book is something of a real, vintage Price and Prejudice and Zombies, though unintentional.I wouldn't give the book away, but the story begins and ends in the Arctic - not the mountains of Eastern Europe. And the scenes take us from Geneva to Ireland to Arctic Russia and beyond. Nicely written, though dated in it's Victorian style, and a fast, fun, creepy Halloween read."},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"its a good product but if you want an edited version find it somewhere else. it even has a book with it."},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"I picked this up because it was free and I have not read it in years so I thought it would be a good choice to learn to navigate with on my K2. I tried differnt methods but I really enjoyed readimg along with TTS. Beacuse the language is dated ( though in a good way ) it can make it a little tiring in places. With the TTS on I sailed through this book and loved it."},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"The Frankenstein monster is truly one of the most tragic characters in classic literature. He is obviously quite brilliant, having learned to speak (rather eloquently, I might add), and to read simply by secretly watching others. He's sensitive, kind, and appreciative of nature's beauty-all of the most admirable characteristics of a wonderful soul. And yet, he is vilified by all who come in contact with him because of his physical repulsiveness.His longing for love, especially from Victor, was so painful that it became difficult for me to read. I kept hoping he'd find someone to show him the littlest bit of kindness. His turn to violence is entirely understandable, and Victor's irresponsibility toward his creation is despicable. Victor, who is outwardly handsome but cowardly and cruel, is the story's true monster.In addition to writing a captivating story, Shelley raises many social issues that are still relevant today, nearly 200 years later, and the book provides a superb argument against *ever* cloning a human being.(Note: I have the edition with the marvelous woodcut illustrations by Barry Moser and the Joyce Carol Oates afterword - superb!)"},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"I think if this book were published today it would not have been the success it was. Not only because of the overly ornate prose (no doubt placed in the book by Mary's husband, Percy)but because it has some problems. First, the \\"creation\\" of the monster is done almost out of hand without true explanation (justified by saying it's a secret) or even any real description of how it was done. In little more than a couple of paragraphs, the monster is made. Second, the monster turns out to be able to speak like a Shakespearian actor after roaming alone and hiding for his whole existence. Where did he learn to speak like an Eton grad? No real explantion. (This absurdity is so obvious that the movie industry, upon which the Frankenstein reputation truly rests, made the monster a grunting being, the right thing to do). Third, a large part of the book is spent describing the towns, the cities, etc. that Frankenstein visits while taking a year-long trip before his wedding to Elizabeth. It was like reading a travel magazine.The tale is less a tale about science gone wrong, then a tale about revenge and lonliless. The created monster could just have easily been a child (illegimate child?) of Frankenstein and, if hating his father (instead of creator) done the same things. In fact, the creation aspect, the most famous aspect of the tale, seems to have been just tossed in for dramatic effect, almost as an after thought."},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"An incredible book that I only wish I had read earlier in my life. Once I started the book I had difficulty putting it back down except to do the things that I was obliged to do. I loved the book completely, but I am still after finishing it unsure what my thoughts and feelings are towards Victor Frakenstein or his monster. I want to feel compassion for the monster in his only desire for love and to not be alone but at the same time I fear that if I had met him in the city that I would scream in fear and desire to kill him myself. As far as Victor, he is someone who at times I felt sorry for and other times I wanted to hate him more so than the monster for his crazy ambitions to do such a thing and then to abhor and desire the death of his creation. A great book that I would recommend to anyone."},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"This novel is probably one of the top twenty of all time for the grace of the writing, the vividness of the monster and the plot development. I think I read a reviewer write that you should watch the movie instead of reading this book, or as a supplement to a movie. That is a horrendous statement because Frankenstein has just about everything that a book has to offer. This would basically be like telling people to never read anything but poorly written instruction manuals.First of all I love the way that Dr. Frankenstein is developed. He is known to the author first as a dedicated learner, and we all know that man, but then he is known as a person that knows a woman, since his story also tells us about her. So his character is already defined psychologically (and what other way could there be in a book because physical description of people only go so far in a book) in terms of a woman and his creation Frankenstein. It makes me want to scribble some love notes on Mary Shelley's grave.Frankenstein himself is another extremely well defined character, and the whole story breathes life into him. It is pure beauty, since he is not defined in terms of some properties alone, but what dominates is what the others have seen, and that's what he becomes. The shading of characters, and the unwinding stack of letters, and the sequence of events make this book pure candy for the soul.If this book were a three-star book why would Frankenstein be a household name so many years later? Also just for the sake of it, this book is not so reproducible as the Dracula story which abounds in bookstores today like no other myth. Frankenstein is more of a psychological character made by the entirety of the novel and whole, described mostly just as \\"hideous\\", whereas Dracula is defined by others in terms of all sorts of cool properties. Modern vampire books make him out as like some sort of mr. potatohead. Frankenstein is the more tragic villain I would say, and more simply defined villain. Dracula is kind of a hysterical villain, with his lusts and pluggable physical properties that accomodate his lusts for darkness with his lists of charms and aversions. In fact many others want to be Dracula, and there is envy of Dracula, but Frankenstein is categorically repulsed as an abomination, and as a creation not of god, but he was born in the book, whereas Dracula has unexplained and freakish dispositions. It's interesting now though that Frankenstein should grow in cultural relevance in relation to Dracula who was born out of slavic legends I think, with all of science's creations, but the Dracula franchise sells more for some reason. Perhaps it's a more optimistic view of the future, an evolved human with cool sunglasses, sexually rapacious appetites and gadgets, rather than an abomination of scientific creation."},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"For those who only think of movie images when they recall Frankenstein, this book will serve as a pleasant and refreshing experience. The gothic undertones lend authenticity to this beautiful story. When I first began to read this book, I was expecting horror and terrifying elements that may have inspired authors like Stephen King. However, I was amazed at just how beautifully deep and inspiring the book actually was.There is no need for me to rehash the plot because others who have reviewed have done this, but they failed to mention just how many levels there are to this book. The whole story is based on relationships; those between creator and creature, man and nature, science and morality, familial relationships, etc. It is full of concepts such as existentialism, religion, philosophy, family, society (and the shallow, narrow-mindedness of society), and so on. For such a short work, it really covers a large range of human experience.This is probably my favorite book. It left me feeling hopeful and inspired and I recommend it to just about anyone."},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"On my recent travels, I finished reading Mary Shelley's Frankenstein.Written in the Gothic style, it's also written as one would tell a ghost story: minimalist in its descriptions of setting, focusing on character and action more than anything else. It's written in the first person, with varying narrators allowing for varied points of view. Despite the threadbare descriptions of setting, Shelley does a good job of conveying with those few words key aspects of the setting, giving her story great atmosphere.Gothic stories always are high on emotion, and not high on reasoning thought, and this is no exception. I am still left wondering how folks can consider this a work of science fiction. It is more fantasy than science fiction: man takes on the role of God, man's creation, like God's, goes awry, and the pair are locked in a monumental struggle. Fantasy's themes often go to the nature of characters trying to choose between right and wrong, while science fiction's themes go towards the consequences of technology and science, without the necessity of morality, and Frankenstein tends towards fantasy under that line of thinking...hence, the alternate title, \\"The Modern Prometheus\\".All in all, an entertaining, and quick read."},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"In Mary Shelley's novel, there are various statements about the use of science. The field of eugenics is brought into question. The issue of cloning is brought into perspective way before its time. Shelley's novel is prophetic in so many ways for revealing the debates and scientific issues of contemporary times. From the recent FDA consideration of livestock cloning to genetically engineered crops, these controversial issues have been compared to Frankenstein science. Other past scientific innovations such as the use of pesticides like DDT have led to failure and proved dangerous for human civilization. These too were once compared to Frankenstein science, yet humankind persisted on using these chemicals, all for reasons of convenience and capital ambition on the part of corporations involved. We may see Shelley's Frankenstein as the first great scientific warning to humans in an industrial world. It may also be seen as the beginning of environmental awareness. This awareness concerns humans within their own environments such as parent/child relationships and childhood influences, as well as human impact on nature."},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"I love this book! Frankenstein is created, and born into a world that cannot accept him. It is intelligently written, dark, and quick to read. Feeling compassion towards Frankenstein is a strange feeling...."},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"Mary Shelley writes in the vernacular of the time in which she lived--verbose and overblown. This romantic language in no way detracts from the fact that Frankenstein is a masterpiece.The monster Frankenstein has created is constantly referred to as a \\"daemon (sic\\" and a fiend. Yet this monster excites our sympathies because of his abject need for affection and acceptance. At the end he calls himself an \\"abortion.\\"The novel Frankenstein can be interpreted as a morality tale warning against hubris and overweening pride in one's own powers of intellect and invention. Frankenstein is obsessed with creating life. He finds out that once he has accomplished this deed, that life which he created is forever his master. The creature Frankenstein has created makes Frankenstein his slave.Without regarding this novel as a morality tale and taking into account the gothic nature of this writing, one can also sympathize with the feelings of rejection, loss, love and affection demonstrated throughout the book by all of the characters.Ultimately, I found Mary Shelley's Frankenstein worthwhile because the novel helped me realize just what it is to be human."},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"This book was so close to being the best horror novel ever written. It just lacked a couple of things. The most important being a good description of what the monster looked like, granted it was fun to make up the image yourself. One of the reasons why I personally think it is a bit on the short side and does lack some description is that it was written for a friendly writing contest by Mary Shelly, her husband and some friends. However anyone who considers themselves well read even if they are not a fan of horror should read this book. It is very good and at only just over 200 pgs (most editions) it is not a time consuming book."},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"Forget the horror themes. This book is timeless for all cultures because it forces us to ask the big questions: What is our responsibility as a creator? What is God's responsibility as a creator? What is God's realm? What is Man's realm? If God is us, and we are God - are we evolving or are we going where we shouldn't go? Are there ways that society should/shouldn't use or ignore their knowledge? What do we do when our technology surpasses our humanity? How should humanity proceed with technology? Are we ready to know what we know?The intrigue is endless, and can be revisited with new groups for discussions over and over."},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"Robert Walton, an explorer trying to discover a Polar Passage, sights a strange, giant creature among the icy environs. Shortly thereafter, he encounters a man on a sleigh, of ill health, who calls himself Victor Frankenstein. He is chasing after that creature, his own monstrous creation, who he created in an obsessive desire for knowledge and power, only to find himself haunted and distressed at every turn by his creature--whose only desire is for companionship, respect, and love from his creator, who hates him, and society, which abhors him. Frankenstein retells his story to Walton, interspersed with the creature's own eloquent thoughts about how he became a murdering wretch. The two of them are bound by destiny to end their lives in misery and shame.I don't know which Hollywood screenwriter turned a multilayered, profound piece of literature such as Shelley's Frankenstein into cheap horror schlock, but anyone who is only familiar with the Halloween caricature is in for a surprise. Frankenstein is immensely readable (compare this to Percy Shelley's \\"Prometheus Unbound,\\" which covers some common ground, and see the difference), but there are some genuine wrestlings about why men seek after knowledge, and the ways in which that pursuit can have unintended consequences. There are cogent allusions to the Bible, the myth of Prometheus, and Paradise Lost, reflecting the way in which Frankenstein's Faustian quest becomes a degraded recaptulation of God's creation of man and the rebellion of Satan. Plus, there are moving and eloquent entreaties from the creature himself, whose descent from goodness to coldblooded vengeance is detailed in a startingly believable, psychologically plausible manner. Nor does Shelley's work merely echo stereotypical Romantic themes such as the innocence of man before society and the oppression of social mores--while those elements are present, Shelley's narrative brings up numerous ambiguities in those ideas (some of which were heavily promoted by her famous husband). So there's little surprise that this text is assigned in most English departments and classes on Romantic literature--this is, its popular reputation aside, a genuine work of Literature, capital L with all its hoity-toity implications. There's too much richness here that Hollywood has put aside in its filmed versions, and it would be a great shame if most people aren't aware of just where those visions came from."},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"This book is a great read. The main character is not the monster, but the scientist Victor Frankenstein who creates him. The story is told from his point of view, and reads wonderfully. It's a bit like a journal, beginning with a line something like 'I was born in..', and truly can be called a 'story'. It is not what I expected, not as scary as I thought it would be, and the monster is very different to the typical image most people have of him. Although, however, the author leaves a lot about his features to the imagination. The story takes place in Switzerland, England, the Arctic, and other places around Europe. Mary Shelley paints a beautiful canvas through her descriptions of mountains, rivers, the sky and sea, the sun and the moon, castles, towns and villages, relating human emotions to them. In different parts of the story, both Victor and the monster spend days and weeks in isolation to dwell on their troubles. Nature plays a role and has an effect on their thoughts and emotions. The monster often sees the sun, the shade of the trees, and songs of the birds as his only companions.The monster torments Victor by murdering those close to him. The author leaves you to decide on these events, and sometimes you sympathise with the monster, sometimes you cannot accept any excuse for his misdeeds. The victims are as innocent as can be and poor Victor has to bear so much grief, but the monster is alone and repulsed by the whole of mankind. Both creator and creation suffer. I won't dwell on the themes of these points as I'm sure other reviewers can do better, I'll just say the book is wonderful. Read it if you like good stories with a nice unhurried pace, and if you don't mind getting a little depressed. And, even if you do mind, read it anyway, it's such a short book."},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"There is obviously something unique about a text that has survived within the canon for so many years, is continually taught to students in secondary schools and universities, and is read for entertainment by numerous people every year. Moreover, there are even fewer texts that have generated such a legacy of being retold, replicated, and borrowed from throughout their histories. One of these grand texts is Mary Shelley's Frankenstein. Though one may never have read the novel or be able to recognize the author's name, it would be difficult to find a person who is not familiar with the title. Frankenstein has evolved since its creation into one of the greatest fright stories ever and the monster has become one of epic proportion. But, the story, in actuality, is quite different from its many replications floating around Hollywood or even those of oral tradition. Likewise, the effect this novel has on the reader may be quite unlike what one initially presumes. This was my case in reading the infamous tale for the first time this year.To begin, the language of Frankenstein, or The Modern Prometheus, is, like many novels of its time, challenging. This should not, however, be considered a hindering aspect of the novel. Actually, the language of the narrative aids in the reading for Shelley uses the text as a tool to present an argument. The formality of the language is necessary in order to articulate such a position while demanding attention from the reader to evaluate that posture. Along with this, there are several instances that illustrate the desired position of the author. Without the elevated language, these small details would certainly be lost or overlooked. Through such clarity, one is forced to accept the seriousness of the ideas presented within the text, which are often disregarded in modern film or oral interpretations.Another particularly impressive aspect of Frankenstein is the development of the story in entirety; it is here that Shelley's genius is obvious. First, the tale is appropriately established within a darkened atmosphere; this created world places the reader in the proper frame of mind to begin such a tale while allowing the author to skip over mundane details that would obstruct from the reader's enjoyment. Throughout the novel, one can depend on Shelley to move the reader through the plot by her creation of the atmosphere. Second, as the story focuses around the nature of the human, Shelley develops her protagonist accordingly and with eloquence. The author does an outstanding job of balancing grandness with reality. Dr. Victor Frankenstein is a man who is greater than life while epitomizing all human beings. That is, he is a genuinely good man who makes a grand mistake. Throughout the story, one is able to relate to the doctor as a fictional character and as a representative figure of all humankind.Finally, the action of the story is probably the best known aspect of the tale and is much deserving of that recognition. The plot shares many of the characteristics discussed regarding the development of the protagonist. While the action is something grand, it is created in a way that seems applicable to all human experiences. On the other hand, it is for this reason that the actual plot seems less important than the underlying presuppositions which Shelley is presenting through her narrative. That is, there are certain universal truths that ought not be violated. There is an ultimate good within the world that is both universal and eternal and the violation of this will always lead to the destruction of the person. Obviously, there is a deep religiosity flowing throughout Shelley's narrative.In short, all the elements of Mary Shelley's Frankenstein illustrate reasons that explain the success of the tale. Shelley seems to have hit a vein in the imagination of all humankind. Not only is Frankenstein a fantastic and entertaining story, it is a grand piece of literature dealing with questions of eternal proportion. While the modern interpretations will focus on the science of creating a monster, do not be surprised when questions of even greater importance are brought to light in the reading."},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"Overall, this book was great. It's the type of thriller that would scare you, had we not been desensitized as a society by gore and guts on TV and in movies. Its not the Frankenstein you see in the media like Eddie Munster with the things sticking out of his neck and the lightning storm and the mad scientist creating the monster. It is a genuine, old-fashioned horror story. The best part is, Shelley does not give you a detailed description of the creation of her imagination. She lets each person's imagination create its own \\"monster.\\" You can make it as scary or as innocent as you want. That's the beauty of what Shelley does in this novel. You can read into the scenes and story as a whole as much as you want to. You can also argue that the book is not a horror story at all. There are many different points of view concerning the intent of the novel. How it is interpreted is left entirely up to each individual reader. The only downfall I found in the novel was the pace that it held throughout the story. I had to adjust my thinking towards the time at which it was written. It does not have the speed that a modern novel has and you have to adjust somewhat to get through the slower parts. As a whole, I highly recommend this classic for anyone who enjoys letting his or her imagination create the story."},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"As most of my reading is, I was forced to read Frankenstein for school, and was tested on its content with a test.

Like many idealists, he is willing to go to great lengths to realize his dream.Unfortunately, and again like many idealists, he forgets that, being human, he too has a dark side, and unless one comes to terms with it, it's liable to show up right in one's face one day...Some of the most moving passages herein come from the &quot;monster,&quot; who is poignantly eloquent about how he feels about being lonely and homeless and abandoned by his creator. Even so, Victor will not hear him, and therein begins the tragedy--for what we will not hear will raise its voice until we're forced to.&quot;You seek for knowledge and wisdom, as I once did; and I ardently hope that the gratification of your wishes may not be a serpent to sting you, as mine has been. I do not know that the relation of my disasters will be useful to you; yet, when I reflect that you are pursuing the same course, exposing yourself to the same dangers which have rendered me what I am, I imagine that you may deduce an apt moral from my tale; one that may direct you if you succeed in your understanding, and console you in case of failure.&quot; -- V. Frankenstein"},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"I wonder whether Shelley intended the pallid ineffectual women of Frankenstein to be irony? Showing how men expect women to be mirrors of their narcaccistic selves. Point made, but I personally am not amused. However, this book is wonderful in providing an in-depth analysis of Shelley's own emotions. She had an illigetimate marriage and illigetimate children while living in an unforgiving society. When going out in public she felt ostrasized, like a monster perhaps. Aha! The idea for Frankenstein was born out of her own isolation. Victor repulses me with his weak excuses and selfishness when it came down to saving Justine. Throughout the entire novel there is an obsession with the class system and beauty. The characters that aren't wealthy and of a privileged birth are less worthy as human beings. Elizabeth was adopted because of her beauty alone; the other peasant children were ignored. I suppose this book reflected the concerns of the nineteenth century almost perfectly"},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"Mary Shelley's &quot;Frankenstein&quot; has the odd honour of having an unnamed monster which gets confused with the protagonist (afterall everyone calls the monster FRANKENSTEIN when he is unnamed), but the merging of identities and names is at the heart of this classic. Questions about creation, the limits of human knowledge and actions are explored, as well as what is human and what is not. Shelley's protagonist Frankenstein slowly reveals the harsh and cruel side of himself as the novel progresses, while the monster he creates takes on more human traits expressed in his guilt at the murder of the child, and his desire for a companion to ease his lonely days. At the end of the novel, it appears that the roles have reversed. Frankenstein's personality takes on a more &quot;monstrous&quot; aspect while the monster gradually attains the readers' sympathy. The monster and the human therefore switch positions and we have to question and relook what we define as &quot;human&quot; or otherwise. The story on intertwined fates and dependence reaches a tragic end as the release for both monster and creator is possible only through death."},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"I can't believe this young girl could have come up with such a story.

Price is good. very useful.Good brand, it is not fake.Thanks a lot."},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"If your only notion of Frankenstein is born of the dreadful Hollywood movies, and you like to read classic literature, you owe it to yourself to invest a week in the Mary Shelley novel. My own perspective was changed immensely upon reading the book. Forget the cartoonish, non-speaking, non-thinking, malevolent, bolts-in-the-neck Boris Karloff. The creature given life by Victor Frankenstein was capable of emotion, wonderment, communication, and great feats of reasoning. You might even say that at least potentially, he was a beautiful creation. It's only after suffering countless rejections from his creator that the creature chooses evil, and then only to punish the doctor's rejections.Frankenstein is famous for a good many \\"lessons\\" offered by Shelley, including the dangers of playing God and the fear of scientific pursuits. I managed to ignore these undertones and found myself absorbed by the human side of the story. If Shelley did propose an underlying message, it wasn't overt or preachy. In all fairness, however, ours is a different time than that of the author's, so I probably shouldn't measure her intentions by today's sensibilities. I'm sure that 200 years ago there did exist for many people a fear of electricity and other advancements of science. Perhaps, the \\"moral of the story\\" was much more pronounced at the time of the book's publication.Regardless of warnings or prophecies of our own self-inflicted demise, Frankenstein is a moving story about obsession, power, fear, abandonment, and consequences. It's a literary treasure.+++++++On a side note, the best movie adaption of Frankenstein came from Hallmark films, of all places. Yes, Hallmark. Somehow or other, the sappy cable network managed to create a very good, if not perfect rendition of this classic story, and it's available for sale on Amazon. It stars Luke Goss as the monster and has terrific performances from William Hurt and Donald Sutherland, among others. The film is very accurate in its adaptation, more so than any of the \\"classic\\" monster movies."},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"But the original version is very difficult to find, so almost any one you buy will be the revised version.First time reading this book, and I was utterly enthralled, very hard to put down. It is simply beautifully written, with masterfully crafted sentences and evoking imagery. Truly stunning in that respect. Jane Austen was writing at the same time, and her style is similar. But the story couldn't possibly be more different.As I was reading this novel, I was pretty much flabbergasted at how a teenage girl could come up with something so wildly morbid and (apparently) original, but some research afterwards dispelled the mystery a bit. Frankenstein came about as a result of a group of young friends stuck inside on a rainy holiday in Geneva discussing all the possibilities stemming from a new &#34;science&#34; called galvinism. Could you actually bring someone back to life with electricity? Could you imbue life into something lifeless? Apparently talk got dark and morbid, and a contest arose to see which of them could write the best horror story. Kids haven't changed a bit in 200 years.Young Mary took this contest seriously, and set about writing Frankenstein (with, some scholars think, significant help from Percy). Knowing the background, the story makes sense, and as a writer myself I can see how it could easily have almost written itself.All that said, I really think Frankenstein is a must-read, if only to read one of the most beaufiully written works of literature I've ever come across, and to see the remarkable transformation of the &#34;monster&#34; from a new life full of hope and wonder and innocence, into the murderous, vengeful being he becomes (through almost no fault of his own).I have to take off a star, though, for some flimsy characterization, mainly of Elizabeth, and Victor's (Mary's) complete abandonment of a minor character at the end which didn't make a bit of sense to me. Also, to make this story believable, the &#34;monster&#34; should have spoken with a different voice, rather than the highly educated, erudite way he actually did speak.But considering the magnitude of this novel, those are really minor issues. Read it as a stunning piece of literature, and a window into the culture and thinking of young people at the time.

What a powerful yet dark masterpiece from a young woman."},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"This classic horror tale has, a bit surprisingly, its greatest horrors as horrors of the mind. To be sure, there are some horrible events, but the most severe horrors are those that transpire within the minds of Victor Frankenstein, and again surprisingly, to his creation, also referred to as his monster or daemon. The story is well known. An excited young Frankenstein believes he has deduced the means to create life. Shelley is mercifully scant with the details of his collecting parts and induing (a word Shelley likes and uses more than once) life. The tale is told by a sea captain in the Arctic Ocean, recorded as Frankenstein told it to him. As a young man, Frankenstein himself has a sharp mind and a positive spirit, and a family that's brought him up in a serene Geneva environment. The gist of the story is the excitement leading to Frankenstein's creation, and the sequelae of that action. The creation is not initially a brute. An intrinsic part of the story is how he becomes one. Influencing that transition strongly is the effect of rejection and isolation based only on external appearance. Also intrinsic is the effect this creation has on its creator. Both Frankenstein and the monster face issues of sanity, both of them losing it to one degree or another as the book progresses. The details are yours to read. The writing is lovely and clear to the modern reader. Issues involved in the story include the causes and effects of being socially isolated, the responsibilities a creator has to his creation and society, particularly when those responsibilities conflict, and to what degree one is bound by one's commitment in the face of uncertainty about it. In some ways, the relationship between Frankenstein and his creation changes over time, becoming almost synergistic or symbiotic. Well sequenced, clearly told, and provoking strong emotion in the reader to go with strong emotion in the characters, most often Frankenstein, but also the monster. Brilliant and worthy of its status as a classic."},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"Very good book, gave me a clear understanding of the movie I feared so much as a child.

You would think he'd have enough balls to not run away from what he created because it was a bit ugly. I guess he donated those to his creature.I'm glad I read this book because it is something I should have read when I was younger but I didn't care for how Frankenstein behaved in the story. For such a brilliant mind he sure acted like an idiot throughout the story which I believe makes him more responsible for the deaths of his family and friends than his creation."},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"This was a very thought provoking book--precisely the kind of book that I enjoy.

It was chosen by our book club, and I was really hesitant to read it, but I have to say I really enjoyed it and couldn't wait to read each chapter."},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"Another book assigned for my pre-1900 novels class that I came away absolutely loving. This book is nothing like what you've likely conjured in your mind from various sources over the years. This isn't horror in the sense that it's scary; it's horror in the classic idea that the events described are horrifying.It begins in epistolary form, with a ship's captain writing home to family before he stumbles upon Victor Frankenstein amongst the arctic ice. The captain eventually convinces the doctor to share his story, which becomes the novel. The monster is beautifully written, truly heartbreaking. In the interest of full disclosure, I was immediately drawn into the myriad Paradise Lost references, since that is one of my all-time favorites.I recommend this for fans of Gothic horror novels or those just curious to check out the first one. No language or sexuality, and the violence/gruesome elements are mostly glossed over."},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"It was the discovery of Frankenstein that prompted meFrankenstein's Daemonto write a sequel to this revered classic. What revelations blossomed when I read the book. Who knew the monster could communicate so eloquently. Like many, my acquaintance with Victor Frankenstein's creation came from Hollywood. Mary Shelley's novel is far removed from those onscreen versions. Many books have been written on Frankenstein: its themes, its place in literature in the broad historical perspective. Literary commentary on Frankenstein seems to be born daily. I had somehow escaped the required reading of Frankenstein in my high school and college days and my sympathy for the monster was rather muted based on film. However, Shelley's novel gripped me from the beginning. Despite what may be taught in literature classes across the world, a few points about the novel struck me. Readers must remember that Shelley wrote the book based on a kind of parlor game. Was it a mark of her genius that she was able to abstract her concepts from essentially a \\"waking dream?\\" The themes gathered in this book, for the time, are truly remarkable. Also, who is the villian here, if one is needed at all? If there is one, the answer is not clear cut. You must read the novel yourself to make the determination. While Karloff elicites a bumbling sympathy for his monster, Shelley crafts a complex creature who feels pain acutely - so acutely that he displays a wide range of human characteristics. He is, after all, a thinking, feeling creation. Love, sympathy, betrayal, murder,and gothic elements that veer into melodrama populate Shelley's novel. However, it is a great work and one, perhaps, that does not need a sequel - unless the desire to learn the monster's fate is too strong."},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"Early into Frankenstein, I might have given it 3 stars because of its old-fashioned language and letter-writing format. I was not interested in Walton's whining to his sister Margaret about loneliness and friendship. And I found this part of Shelley's writing stiff and uninteresting.That all changed once Walton rescued Victor Frankenstein from the icy sea near the North Pole. Frankenstein's story is great on a couple levels. First, the thriller element still has its appeal. You are fascinated that Victor has created life and you wonder at the consequences. You are sympathetic to the monster's plight, being alone in the world, considered grotesque by all those who see him. You want Felix, Agatha and their father to accept him. You want him to have a companion. And you are shocked at his murderous way of dealing with his loneliness.The overlying themes of love, friendship, loneliness and loss enrich this story and the question of whether Frankenstein has the right to create life makes you think about the larger responsibilities of man to his fellow man. Frankenstein pays dearly when he destroys the monster's female counterpart. The monster's shocking reaction and Frankenstein's horror, his mental collapses and the race against time make this story a true thriller.The story within a story within a story, etc. is an interesting structure, and not too hard to follow. This style and the letter-writing format are the only things that make Frankenstein seem less modern, but they are minor points.Note: I read the free Kindle version and I have seen a lot of debate over which version is the one to read. Shelley published then later edited and republished a second version. I believe the free one is the first edition. No complaints or criticisms. It was free and I enjoyed it!"},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"The classic original story by the original author. Read the book that inspired so many other writers and film makers. It still holds the attention even after all these years."},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"I began reading Mary Shelley's Frankenstein ill-informed of the story of this classic novel. My conception of it as a pioneer of science fiction was the chief attraction of the book to me. I didn't even think of it as a horror story before my reading. Perhaps this is partly due to the popular imagery of \`Frankenstein' the monster as square-faced with deep sunken eyes, a figure which doesn't look particularly terrifying to me. On this account, I was rather taken back by surprise to find that in reality, the book is an immensely dark, depressing and tragic tale of broken dreams, misunderstanding, unfulfilled desire of love, revenge and murder. In the end, everyone in the story is a loser.The chain of tragic events started with Victor Frankenstein's daring and ambitious experiment to create life in the form of a human-like creature. Unfortunately, the good intention in the pursuit of science was not accompanied by careful anticipation of the consequences, and the young scientist was absolutely unprepared psychologically for the outcome of his endeavor. This led him to abandon his creation on the night of its awakening. The creature, with features hideous and detestable beyond description, possessed superhuman agility and endurance. It turned out to be extremely intelligent, gaining knowledge and learning the human language. It was capable of eloquent speech with the power to persuade others to sympathy. The creature was also overly emotional. Initially having a benevolent heart, all its actions were motivated by a desire of love, companionship and acceptance. However, its rejection by humans due to misunderstanding and its physical appearance led it to plunge into what would be the darkest of human nature --- selfishness, malice, and wish to deprive others of happiness simply as a revenge for the lack of happiness of one's own.The tale of Frankenstein is truly a classic horror story. It tells of the horrendous effect of the lack of love. It portrays the evils of a depraved mind. The reader is left either chilling in despair, or pondering how a tiny bit of love and compassion towards the unlovable might have changed the course of the story."},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"On writing this review, I had to remind myself this novel is 200 hundred years old and likely the first of its kind, and therefore as original as a novel can ever be. Today's horror writers would not get away with the long narratives, wordy dialogue and second (and third) accounts told through various people.But none of this really mattered. The rich and dense writing style did not get in the way of the story, which drew me in from the first. Poor Frankenstein is doomed the moment he creates the monster and immediately regrets doing so. I had to smile to myself when Frankenstein returns to see the monster gone. 'Thank heavens,' he thinks, 'my troubles are over!' As if! The monster denied a companion or of humanity returns to pick off Frankenstein's loved ones. I felt sorry for the monster that bore no resemblance to the Hollywoodized clich&eacute; we imagine. A creepy and dark tale; horror fans who omit this book from their reading list are missing out."},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"Should I review a classic? Really, what's the point? This book is historic and mandatory reading for many high schools and a true insight into the European era it was written (1818). Language, thoughts, opinions, attitudes, social classes, locations - it's all there. It's like a time machine and that aspect of the book is fasinating. Then there's the classic elements...This is true gothic horror. It's not blood and guts and \\"shoot'em up\\" that is all too necessary to hold an audiences' attention in today's world. \\"Frankenstein\\" is psychological terror in the same vein as \\"what's hiding around the corner.\\" We follow Victor's inner thoughts and paranoia as he sinks deeper and deeper into depression, fear and finally resolve that he must kill the monster he created or die trying.As someone who was an avid reader in high school - but not the mandatory assignments, (my personal classics are more modern works) - it is quite a few years after my graduation. I picked up \\"Frankenstein\\" because it is my son's mandatory summer reader. Once I started, I couldn't put it down.But again - reviewing a classic? Okay - some may find this a lame excuse, but I only rated it 4 out of 5 stars because of my upbringing in the modern \\"shoot'em up\\" world. The meanings were all there for me - man vs God, man vs woman, etc... But there were too many coincidences within the story that made me shake my head in disbelief. Europe is a continent and not someone's neighborhood where even then it would be difficult to find someone hiding from you. But if you can shut down your reasoning and throw disbelief to the howling wind, \\"Frankenstein\\" has the fear factor to keep you awake and wondering at night who or what could be lurking around your neighborhood.One final note: For any high schooler thinking about skipping this mandatory reading assignment and watching the movie instead, just plan on testing for a GED after you wise up. The Boris Karloff version sticks to the book about as closely as the Abbott and Costello film. In fact, check out Gene Wilder in \\"Young Frankenstein\\" and write your report on that one. At least your teacher will have a few laughs grading your paper!"},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"OK -So you might have had to read this in high school.You might have skipped this in high school.You might BE in high school.Do yourself a favor and READ this novel.Mary Wollenstonecraft Shelley's masterpieceis worth a second read.

After years of only knowing the movies, this was a real pleasure. And I highly recommend following it up with Fred Saberhagen's \\"The Frankenstein Papers\\". A treat to follow this with.The Frankenstein Papers"},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"I was subjected to mostly Shakespeare in high school thanks to the personal tastes of teachers who didn't follow a more traditional reading list curriculum, so, sadly here I am reading Frankenstein for the first time at the age of 36.All of my previous knowledge of Shelley's book comes from the 1931 classic film starring Boris Karloff as the monster, a movie which I must admit I've never seen. But thanks to the monster's constant use in pop culture and other reference in society, like everything else we are subjected to on a regular basis, the image became an icon which became embedded in our brains as knowledge - knowledge I was completely wrong about!This is the perfect example of Hollywood taking a book, keeping its concept in a sense, and changing everything else. For example, Victor is not really a mad scientist living in some German castle high on a cliff using all kinds of bizarre machinery to give life to a body he stitched together from body parts that his assistant Igor picked up in some prison cemetery. Nope! Not it at all really. We don't even have the classic torch wielding mob scene in the end.Instead, Victor is a smart student who becomes interested in medical science while at university and discovers how to give life to that which is dead. He does steal body parts from crypts and such, but that's it. No castle. No glamorous laboratory. No Igor. Shelley doesn't even really go into the details about the creation of the monster itself. The monster just wakes up one day and Victor is immediately disgusted by what he's done.Six years pass before Victor even encounters the monster again, when Victor's young brother is killed and a beloved guardian is accused. Here, we meet a very intellectual monster who tells Victor the story of how he has been observing a poor family living in a cabin in the woods and has been learning by their everyday actions. The monster rattles on for a good fifty or so pages about everything he has seen and experienced. No one-worded \\"Massster!\\" mumbles for him! But it is from the monster's point of view that we really begin to see the intention of the classic story.This is a book about human suffering and acceptance. It is about our need in society to fit in and to have friends and companions like us and who do not judge us. Frankenstein has been called the first \\"science fiction\\" book, and while it lacks certain dark elements that might attract today's readers, it's still a good solid Victorian novel with underlying themes of the human condition.I'm glad I spent time with Shelley at this age; I certainly appreciate it more than I probably would have twenty years ago."},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"A great read - I really enjoyed it.

AND I'M NO PRUDE!"},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"There isn't much I could say about Frankenstein that other reviewers haven't covered better and more thoroughly than I could, but here's one small fact: this book was first published in 1818, and it has NEVER GONE OUT OF PRINT.So for almost 200 years, people have been eating up this story: we read it when the Miss Bennets and Mister Darcys of the world were lighting up high society, and when Oliver Twist was asking for seconds, and when Holmes and Watson were hot on the case. We read it when Marlow was tracking down Kurtz in the dark jungle, and when Gatsby was courting Daisy, and when the Snopeses were taking over Yoknapatawpha County. This book has survived the Industrial Revolution, Queen Victoria, two world wars, the Great Depression, the atomic bomb, hippies, civil rights, Watergate, and 9/11, and WE ARE STILL READING IT.So why is that, especially when (as another reviewer observed) this isn't even an especially \\"scary\\" story?Here is one idea. When you think about it, every discovery since Galileo has undermined our previously-held concept of man at the center of the universe: we have been made to understand that our planet is not the center of the solar system, much less the galaxy, and that we have risen from apes instead of descending from heaven, and that our thoughts and personalities are largely authored not by our souls or natures but only by a series of complex chemical reactions. Every one of those has been an enormously hard thing for us as a species to come to grips with, and Frankenstein seems to foreshadow quite a bit of it: if a thing made from dead flesh and given life by chemical manipulation could be not only physically but morally and intellectually superior to us, then what place of pride will be left for us as a species?THAT is a scary thought, and no mistake. Still, I like to think that we will be able to do a better job than Dr. F. As you read, you might notice that he sets the bar pretty low."},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"I'd never read Frankenstein before, and I enjoyed it. The language is a bit obtuse, which sometimes was charming and sometimes annoying. The pace seemed a bit uneven to my modern sensibilities, with some sections waxing lyrical about things philosophical and other sections led by action. On balance, though, Shelley put in quite a lot more philosophy than action.I read the free Public Domain Kindle edition, and the layout left a lot to be desired. The sad thing is, there are literally dozens of editions of this book on Amazon, and most of them are IDENTICAL to the Public Domain one. Don't waste your money! Check the samples before you buy, or just overlook the flaws of the free edition and enjoy the book."},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"I'm not going to try and write a review for a classic and notable novel such as this. Much has already been written by people far more capable of appreciating and responding to the work than I am. I will simply add my two cents:This book, wonderful and important as it is, can be a taxing read, especially in the world of short-attention spans and \\"show-don't-tell\\" novels that we consume today. It is largely an exploration of enlightenment ideas, particularly with regard to the changing relationship between man, God, and nature. For that reason this novel will certainly remain necessary in any humanities study which tries to understand the rise of the modern era.I found this particular version (the Barnes and Noble Classics edition) to be very useful in that it provided introductory material and segments from essays. As well, it contains some good questions for pondering and a list of other materials for further reading.I'm glad that I worked my way through the book (and I stress that it did require effort), it is one of those works that \\"everybody talks about but nobody reads\\", but I am also glad to be done with it. I'm sure that the challenges encountered, which are central to the human condition, will come back to mind again and again."},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"I bought and read this version(version #2) of Frankenstein first, then went on to read the original version Mary Shelley wrote, before she made changes to the story years later. (Oxford World's Classics is the original version, or any version with the inclusion \\"a Modern Prometheus\\" in the title. This Barnes and Noble Classics version is the later changed version.) I was glad I read both, and in that order, because when I read the original version (which was by far my favorite), my appreciation for the brilliant nuggets I found had been edited out in version #2 was heightened. I wish I had checked this version out from the library, and bought the original version.The thoughts and motives of the characters in the version #2 suffer from the incongruity of the later changes to the story, while in the original version they flow with more clarity. Some wonderful food for thought permeates the reflections of the characters in the original version, that is left out in the later.As for the story itself, it was a great book club pick! Nothing puts me off more than the \\"horror\\" genre... or the versions of this story depicted in the movies. But I found this to be totally different from what I expected, written with a reflective and thoughtful voice, packed with fascinating themes to think about. Some people say the writing style is difficult, but I didn't find it hard to read. I found it rather enjoyable for its intelligent, almost poetic (some would say stuffy) way of putting things, without being too much work to understand in the context of the story (but that will vary from person to person depending on your taste.) Mary Shelley was clearly an intelligent and well-read person, and that is reflected in this story. I love that it spurred me to learn more about other writings and ideas that were referenced in this work, and the philosophical ideas and discussions that circled in her group, that are still relevant today, and which they tied into similar threads of thought ranging from Greek mythology to Milton's Paradise Lost (which I was unfamiliar with until I read this book.) A few minutes spent on wikipedia learning about Prometheus, Milton's Satan, or reading in an introduction about Mary Shelley's life and circle of friends and family and their part in the romantic movement, really enrich the reading of this book. It is a book you can get something from with just a casual reading, but can really find some good stuff if you feel like diving in deeper."},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"Not much to say... it's Frankenstein.

Having read Mary Shelley's classic for a British Literature class, I feel that it is a shame that the majority of the population has a misrepresentation of Frankenstein.Prometheus is a figure in Greek mythology who stole fire from the gods and gave it to man, and was punished by Zeus for it. Victor Frankenstein is quite young when he goes abroad to study and becomes obsessed with the occult side of science, ambitiously desiring to overcome death. Victor also desires to have a race worship him as creator, and in his ambition he feverishly toils, robbing graves and laboratories to build his monstrous creation, which he fashions to be beautiful. Upon completing his work, the fever that has led Victor on immediatly flees, and he sees his work as a monster, and runs terrified from it. This creature is infinitely more terrifying and horrible than the one described by popular culture--\\"...I had selected his features as beautiful. Beautiful!--Great God! His yellow skin scarcely covered the work of muscles and arteries beneath; his hair was of a lustrous black, and flowing; his teeth of a pearly whiteness; but these luxuriances only formed a more horried contrast with his watery eyes, that seemed almost of the same colour as the dun white sockets in which they were set, his shrivelled complexion, and straight black lips.\\"Frankenstein abandons his monster, and returns home, tortured by what he has created. After several misfortunes befall Frankenstein, he again meets the creature, who, we learn, has become eloquent and learned, but, scorned by every human, has become bitter and vengeful toward Frankenstein. He appeals to Frankenstein to make him a companion, or he will destroy Frankenstein and those he loves.The rest of the novel follows Victor as he struggles with this decision, and as more misfortunes befall him.Different types of readers will find sympathy with different characters. I myself found little sympathy for Frankenstein; his selfish ambition and ensuing cowardice and rationalization render him utterly pathetic in my mind. There is some ambiguity as to whether the creature is simply a misunderstood being, or whether he really is a malicious devil as our somewhat unreliable narrator tells us. What a reader chooses to believe will determine the themes that reader derives from the novel.Frankenstein could be seen as a charge against vain amibtion, or it could be seen as an account of man's inability to act as God. I myself felt that Mary Shelley was perhaps questioning God's relationship to man, a plausible explanation considering that Mary Shelley's husband was Percy Shelley, who got kicked out of Oxford for distributing an atheist pamphlet. What, exactly, is a creator's responsibility to his work? To whom do the boundaries of ethics apply? Who is the real monster, Frankenstein's creature or people who unfeelingly reject him? These are only a slice of the themes that intersect Shelley's novel, which is much more than a campy horror story. Frankenstein is a solid read that should not be overlooked by the modern reader, for it contains messages relevant to to us."},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"This book goes beyond a \\"classic\\".

Walton, written to his sister. Walton's passion for exploration is explained and his quest for companionship detailed. Then, while his ship is trapped in the northern ice, he spots a creature crossing the ice. Following the creature is a weakened man in a broken sledge. Upon rescuing the man, Walton meets Victor Frankenstein, and so begins his tale.We learn of Frankenstein's family background, upbringing in Geneva, early education and fascination with the nature of the world. Upon entering university, he expands his knowledge of physical science and chemistry. It is there that he begins construction of a being that he plans to bring to life. Through Frankenstein's narrative, we begin to see his descent into an obsessive madness, more manic than maniacal, a bi-polar disorder of the nth degree.The assembly and bringing to life are kept vague, probably because Shelley herself lacked the scientific knowledge, but cleverly veiled by Frankenstein's own admission, lest another try to duplicate his work.Dr. Frankenstein succeeds, and when the creature awakens, Frankenstein is so repulsed that he abandons the creature and flees his laboratory. He has a breakdown, and only the arrival of his best friend, Henry Clerval, brings him back to health.What follows is Victor Frankenstein's demise through the machinations of the being he created.I love Mary Shelley's language, so evocative of the time, full of color, passion and darkness. The voices are very distinct, and we get to hear the creature's story of what happened when he was thrust into the world, cast away by the hand that created him. The creature is far from the dull movie versions, in fact he is quite intelligent, mastering language by observing a family as he hides in a hovel next to their home, discovering the joys of music, and reading the work of John Milton.But, he is alone and an outcast, and implores Dr. F to create a mate for him. The Dr. denies him this request, taking a moral high road lest he should unleash a family of demons upon the world.There is so much to enjoy here, from the lush detail of the travels of both the Dr. and the creature. The range of emotions displayed by both make each sympathetic and pathetic at various stages. There is also the strong message about violating the natural order and trying to play God. One must be ready to face the consequences. This is a powerful story."},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"If you like horror, you owe it to yourself to read this book from the beginnings of the genre. You will enjoy seeing the themes in Frankenstein repeated in other horror novels that you will read in the future. The book and the movie have essentially nothing in common, so assume that you do not know the story yet if you have only seen the movie.If you do not like horror, you probably won't like the book very much at all.The story opens in the frozen Arctic wastes during an sea-going expedition to find a passage through the ice to the East. Aboard the ship after a strange meeting, Frankenstein tells his story. As a young man he wanted to make a splash in the sciences, and invented a way to create life. Having done so, he became estranged from his new being with significant consequences for Frankenstein and his creation. The two interact closely throughout the book, like twin brothers in one sense and like Creator and creation in another sense.This book presents significant challenges to the reader. Like many books that relate to scientific or quasi-scientific topics from long ago, Frankenstein seems highly outmoded to the modern reader. In the era of psychological knowledge, the development of moods and character in the book will also seem primitive to many. A further drawback is that this novel takes a long time to develop each of its points (even after the eventual action is totally foreshadowed in unmistakeable terms), so patience is required as layer after layer of atmosphere and thought are applied to create a complex, composite picture. Finally, the structure of the novel is unusual, with layers of narration applied to layers of narration, creating a feeling of looking at never-ending mirror images.So, you may ask, why should someone read Frankenstein? My personal feeling is that there are two timelessly rewarding aspects to the book that well reward the reader (despite the drawbacks described above). Either is sufficient to please you. First, the book raises wonderful ethical issues about the responsibilities of science and the scientist towards the results of scientific endeavors. These issues are as up-to-date now as they were when the book was written. Those who developed atomic weapons and biotechnology tools appear to have given little more thought to what comes next than Frankenstein did toward his creation. Second, the moods that are built up in the reader by the book are extremely vivid and powerful. The artistry of this book can serve as a guide for novelists for centuries to come, in showing how much the reader can be deeply engaged by the circumstances of the characters.Why, then, did I grade the book at three stars instead of five? Few will fail to be annoyed by the scientific awkwardness of the story, and that is a definite drawback. Also, only the most dedicated students of style will avoid feeling like the book moves and develops its story too slowly. Less is more in novels. In this case, more is less.I cannot help but comment that this book is perhaps the finest example of appearances being deceiving that exists in literature. The Hunchback of Notre Dame is a close competitor in this regard, but that fine work definite has to fall behind Frankenstein. In this book, beings of physical beauty act in inhumane, ugly ways. Beings of great ugliness act in beautiful ways. The same being may act in both ways, in different circumstances. Looks are deceiving, and our perceptions are flawed even when our attention is fixed. If the characters could have overcome this form of stalled thinking, the horror would have been averted. So the lesson is that the misperceptions we aim at others rebound (like a reflection in a mirror) right back onto us.If you have not yet read Paradise Lost, Frankenstein is a good excuse to read that poem. The development of the story in Frankenstein assumes a knowledge of that story about Satan leading a rebellion against God and being dispossessed into Hell.After you have had a chance to absorb and appreciate the nice issues this book raises, ask yourself where you in your life are acting without sufficiently considering the implications of your actions. Then, commence to examine those potential consequences. You should be able to create more good results in this way, and take more comfort in what you are doing. Both will be excellent rewards for your introspection."},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"Before reading this book, I thought I had a fairly good understanding of what it was about (which is primarily why I was hesitant to actually read it). A mad scientist somehow created a monster in his lab. The monster, commonly (however, incorrectly) referrred to as Frankenstein, had green skin, was about seven feet tall, had bolts in his neck etc. And I recalled something about him being pursued through the streets by an angry fire-wielding mob.What surprised me most about this book is how little of what I had always heard about it was actually true. The monster that most people refer to as Frankenstein actually has no name. He was created by a man whose last name is Frankenstein. There is a brief description of him, but no mentioning of neck bolts or green skin. Furthermore, there is no scene where a mob of people chases after him with fire. This was not, as I had previously been lead to believe, a horror novel. It is, rather, a book dealing with the themes of love, desire, acceptance, ignorance, resentment and revenge.The following is a brief summary of the plot, so if you don't want to know what this is about I would advise you to not read this portion of my review: Frankenstein (the scientist, not monster) is a man deeply interested in science. One day he discovers how to give life to inanimate objects, and decides to assemble a being from various body parts. When he imparts this creature with life he is horrified at what he has created and flees. It isn't long before the \\"monster\\" learns that all people are horrified and appalled by his existence, and is driven to live in the woods. He ends up living outside of a family's home where he is able to observe them through a window. Through his observation, he is able to learn to speak and read perfect English. He feels a love for this family who are completely oblivious to his existence and feels a deep desire to establish a relationship with them. When he finally gets up the courage to meet them, they are of course terrified of him and drive him away. Sometime after this, the monster, devastated by humanity's unwillinglness to accept him and filled with resentment towards his maker who has forsaken him, decides to lash otu in revenge toward Frankenstein. He systematically kills off Frankenstein's family one by one. It then becomes Frankenstein's only goal in life to eradicate the menace he created.This book is surprising in that it didn't really seem like a horror novel at all. Sure, the monster is composed of the body parts of corpses, but he is very much a human character, complete with a full spectrum of emotions. He desires love and companionship from human beings just like we all do, but he is denied this. This is a sad story, but not at all scary. The writing style is very unique in that it is extremely non-descriptive. In a way, I think that is a good thing. I've read far too many books that are too long-winded. This book is concise and to the point. The author did not use twenty pages to describe the look of the monster's left toenail. With so little detail, this book does require a little imagination but there's nothing wrong with that. Overall, it's a decent read but doesn't seem to have held up too well over time. I imagine that when this book was released it actually was considered scary, but in 2004 it really isn't. So if it's a horror novel you're looking for, I suggest looking elsewhere. But if you're interested in a book that explores the desire/need for acceptance and companionship and what happens when it is denied, this is a pretty good choice. Score: 7/10"},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"Frankenstein is part of our literary heritage. Halloween would not be complete without images of a large green monster wearing bolts in his neck. However, the origins of this monster conceal a horror far greater than the character popular culture has embraced.For me, it is not the actions of the monstrous laboratory experiment that frighten me, but the act of the monster's creation itself. Mary Shelley created a novel that places the act of creation into the hands of one man, an idea which eliminates the necessity of the female sex. Technology has usurped the need for male-female partnership. What a horrific idea!Dr. Victor Frankenstein was terrified of female power. His feelings of torment concerning his fiancee, including a particularly unsettling dream passage concerning her, led him to strip the female sex of child-bearing responsibility. If a single man can create another man then natural laws no longer apply, the male and female of a species no longer live in symbiosis.This is the fantastic premise behind this classic horror novel. Some of the writing is crude; one instance in particular is when the monster teaches himself to read after conveniently finding a satchel of books by the side of the road. This is an example of the inexperience Shelley had as a writer; however such breaks in the story are minimal and should not overly detract from the reader's enjoyment. This is a wonderful book."},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"After years of watching movies about Frankenstein I finally read the original book (published in 1818) by Mary Shelley.Wow, is it ever different from the movies.For starters Victor Von Frankenstein worked alone. He didn't have a lisping hunchback by the name of Igor helping him out. He worked in solitary while he was a student at the University of Ingolstadt.Secondly, there was no thunderstorm and no electrodes the night that he gave his creature life. There was no bolt of lighting. And although Victor Von Frankenstein keeps very mum about the methods that he used to animate dead flesh, he does make some cryptic allusions to an elixir of life.Thirdly there was no crowd scene where hordes of peasants storm the castle, brandishing pitchforks and torches.In addition Mary Shelley's creature itself is different in appearance from the creature in the movies. Mary Shelley's creature is eight feet tall, has long dark hair and moves much faster and much more nimble than any human. This is a HUGE contrast from the slow moving and awkward creature that they show in the movies.Perhaps the fifth thing that I noticed was that the creature (who calls himself Adam) learns how to speak and read and write (in French) and becomes very articulate. After he learns how to read he finds a number of books written in French (Paradise Lost by John Milton, a volume of Plutarch's Lives and the Sorrows of Young Werter by Johann Wolfgang von Goethe) and he reads them again and again.After all this perhaps what struck me about the book is how the relationship between Victor Von Frankenstein and his creation are similar to the relationship between an absentee father and his abandoned child. Victor is repulsed by the physical appearance of the creature he created and runs from the room as soon as it rises up off the table. The creature wanders out of Victor's home and Victor neither knows nor cares if it survived.Not having any parents to guide \\"Adam\\" in his development he is left to fend for himself. Because of his hideous appearance, humans throw stones at him and chase him whenever he appears in public, he is thus forced to hide in the woods and live alone.\\"Adam\\" learns how to speak French by watching a family that live in a hovel near the edge of the woods and listening to their conversations. He grows to love this family and hopes someday to gain their acceptance. He goes into the forest to gather wood for them that they can use for their fireplace and leaves it at their front door. He works to improve his language skills so that he may better communicate with them when he finally meets them in person.But when he finally (after months of preparation) works up the courage, it all goes wrong. The French Family takes one look at him and decides because he is ugly that he MUST be a threat and they chase him out of their hovel.This of course makes him more and more bitter and makes him even less trusting of humans.Eventually he learns who gave him life and where his \\"Father\\" lives.Of course the reunion between abandoned child and absentee father is not good."},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"The book, written by Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley, the young wife of the poet Percy Bysshe Shelley, is incredibly different from the movies made over a century later. The writing style is typically old-fashioned but tends to be a bit over-burdened at times which is why I give it 4-stars instead of 5, but the story is heart-breaking.Young Victor Frankenstein is a son of privilege. He has a loving father, two charming brothers, and a beautiful cousin that the family hopes he will one day marry. While studying medicine, Victor becomes obsessed with the concept of creating life and he begins a series of experiments which result in his creation of a \\"monster\\" but the minute the monster comes to life Victor is horrified and repulsed by his creation and promptly rejects it. He casts his creation out in to the world with no preparation for life whatsoever and tries to distance himself as far as possible from what he has brought into being. This, of course, does not work.Victor returns to his studies and to his life but, soon after he finishes his studies, he is called home because his younger brother has been murdered and the foster child his father raised, a lovely but fragile young woman, has been accused and is about to stand trial. Victor hurries home but to no avail. Justine is convicted of murdering the son of the family that raised her and is hanged. Victor, of course, knows she could not have done this and suspects it is the work of his own creation. He sets off into the snow-bound secrets of the Alps and there is met by his creation who tells him his tale.His is an incredibly sad story. The monster, cast out into the world knows nothing -- he cannot speak or communicate, he does not know how to care for himself, he is utterly alone in the world with no skills at all. The only thing he knows is that he is much bigger and more powerful than other men and that his appearance terrifies them. He eventually finds himself in proximity to a family -- a blind old man and his two grandchildren who care for him. By living hidden but close to them and eavesdropping on their life, the monster learns to speak and also learns about the world. He is the most pitiful of beings, leading a lonely, hidden life. He tries to help the family he lives near by gathering firewood he leaves outside their door along with nuts and berries but he is completely alone. When ultimately he tries to contact the family he is met with hatred, fear and terror and runs away again.The monster begs Victor to make him a companion. He cannot bear being alone in the world and promises that, if only Victor will create a partner for him, he will go as far away a possible and that they will never be seen again. Victor agrees and goes to an island in the Orkneys with the intention of creating an \\"Eve\\" for his \\"Adam\\" but is so repulsed by the process, even though he did it once before, that he gathers up his work and deposits it in a lake. The monster, who has followed him, observes this and begins a series of murders out of rage.This is an incredibly sad story. Victor comes across as an obnoxious, spoiled, insensitive brat who is constantly falling into illness because of his own rash and imprudent behavior. And the monster is the saddest of creations -- alone with nothing in the world to support himself except his incredible strength. By the end of the story one cannot help but ask \\"who is the real monster here?\\" The answer is pretty apparent."},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"Readers will be surprised to read this nineteenth century \\"horror story,\\" because the English woman Mary W. Shelley (1797-1851) did not write this book as it is shown in the many motion pictures that were made of it. She published this gothic tale, which many scholars see as the earliest version of a science fiction novel when she was only 21. Scholars think that she wrote it as an attack against the emerging industrial revolution, but perhaps, as we will see, it is more than that. The story is written in the delightful style of its time, like the mystery tale of the Englishman Wilke Collins, which was serialized in 1859-1860 and published in 1860, The Woman in White, which some scholars say is the first detective story, while others give the honor to Edgar Allan Poe (1809-1849).Mary Shelley became the wife of the famous poet Percy Shelley after writing her novel. She subtitled it The Modern Prometheus. According to some but not all Greek myths, Prometheus was a giant who created people and latter brought them fire. It appears that the Prometheus in the tale is the creator Frankenstein, who was not a giant in height, but in intellect. Most people consider Prometheus a hero, but not Shelley. She thought of fire as being bad because it caused people to kill and eat animals and gave people more implements with which to wage war and murder people. Frankenstein tells the story to a man who saved him while he is pursuing the man he created. He warns the man not to pursue scientific goals that will harm humanity.The Shelley story is about an educated man of science who was born in Switzerland and educated in a German university, who is interested in helping people. Everyone who meets him likes him. He comes from an educated amicable family who love him, and he loves them. He searches for an answer to what is life. He wonders if he can create life, and succeeds in doing so. He creates an eight-foot man, who is never named in the novel. He is repulsed by the man he creates and thinks of him as a monster as soon as the man is alive. All people who later see his creation are also repulsed and this causes the man to hide and live alone and it accounts for the profound loneliness that the man feels. His creator becomes depressed at what he has done, rushes away from his lab, and is sick in bed for four months. He is Frankenstein. The unnamed man he created leaves.Frankenstein returns home from Germany and discovers that someone killed his younger brother. He is convinced that the man he created did it, and pursues him to kill him. He meets his creation and is unable to harm him because the man is larger and stronger than he. His creation tells Frankenstein that he killed his brother by mistake. The boy saw him, was disgusted at seeing him, and started shouting. All he did was place his hand over the boy's mouth. He tells how he has been traveling about for more than a year, found that every human despises him, and has become very lonely. He begs Frankenstein to make him a female companion because he, like the biblical Adam, can't live alone. Frankenstein agrees.However, when he finishes making the female he becomes frightened that two monsters, as he thinks of them, could harm mankind. So he destroys the female. The man he created is enraged and vows vengeance against Frankenstein for destroying his life.What happens to Frankenstein and the man he created, I will leave for readers to read and enjoy. Will the creation carry out his threat? If yes, how? Which of the two will outlive the other? What will the survivor do? Is it right to call Frankenstein's creation a monster because of the way he looks? Readers may also want to ask themselves: is Mary Shelly's pessimistic approach to scientific advances justified?Perhaps there is another interpretation of the story. It may be an examination with comments upon the creation of man. The first biblical creation Adam is unnamed, like Frankenstein's creation. Although most people think his name is Adam, the Hebrew word adam actually means \\"human.\\" There is an ancient Jewish legend that when God decided to create this adam, the angels objected that people were not sufficiently good. This parallels the rejection of Frankenstein's creation by society. Like Frankenstein's creation, the adam was also lonely and wants a companion. Today, many people, like Frankenstein's creation feel alienated and lonely, and live a life without meaning. This is something to think about."},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"I think that &quot;Frankenstein&quot; is worthy reading material at nearly any level. Besides a short portion in the middle of the story, this book stays rather interesting throughout. I especially enjoyed the character Victor. His emotions, thoughts, and reactions to his creation are convincingly real. Also, I liked the fact this book did tend to keep the reader a little chilled and anxious. I feel that this book is appropriate for high school or college courses and is surely a great leisurely read."},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"The book Frankenstein was a pretty good read. There were many twists and turns in the plot I didn't expect. Although it is considered a horror book, there are some slow parts that you just have to get through before the attention-grabbing moments. The wording could be confusing at times which would spoil the horror effect on me. Many times I would get so frustrated with Victor for his negligence of the monster and his threats. However, overall the book was good and interesting and at times a little bit creepy."},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"Wow. How did I reach the age of 43 without realising \\"Frankenstein\\" is so much more than a one-dimensional horror story about a blockheaded monster with bolts in his neck? The \\"fiend\\" reads poetry, longs for companionship, admires kindness and gentleness. Is he evil, or just lonely and misunderstood? Either way, I wouldn't want to meet him on a dark night."},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"Mary Shelley's FRANKENSTEIN is as relevant today as it was during its initial publication in 1818. The story, butchered by Hollywood renditions, chronicles a young doctor Frankenstein who discovers how to reanimate life. He attempts to create the perfect being: tall, athletic, and free from disease. Instead, when the being comes to life, the result is hideous and grotesque. The doctor flees his lab and his creation only to find his life haunted by his rejected creation. Modern retellings of this story hold that the monster (who is often inappropriately called \\"Frankenstein\\",) is a lumbering idiot who is afraid of fire. These versions focus on the horror of the monster. The 1818 version of Frankenstein's creation is a smart, nimble creature who has become a wretch after finding rejection at every corner of the world.Shelley's original narrative focuses on the horror of being rejected or cast out of the world. The book often references and evokes Milton's PARADISE LOST, and for good reason. There are similar themes at work here -- similar ideas about creation, rejection, and the yearning to find meaning in our lives.The Kindle edition is a pretty good public domain copy. The formatting is great. There's two introductions: one from Wendy Steiner, and another from the author herself. There are a few instances in which letters and characters did not translate correctly to the electronic edition (some ol's that format as d's, etc). Other than a few instances of this, this version is very readable and contains few errors.I'd recommend this book to anyone who has even a cursory interest in FRANKENSTEIN -- the tale told here is infinitely more interesting and fascinating than the monsters of Hollywood. Because FRANKENSTEIN is available through the public domain, Amazon is offering this eBook for free. It's easier to access this great book now than it ever has been before. What are you waiting for?"},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"Amazed after finally reading this story how little the movies take from it. The Amazon reviews are spot on, I got used to the characters rambling across the lands and figured that Shelley was just trying to beef up her word count with a few entries from her travel blog. And it's true there are no details going from Frankenstein the student to Frankenstein the mad scientist to - oh look, he created a monster. You have to pull it out from between the lines of about half a page. It was why I finally read the book, I wanted to see how she brought the monster to life, but, there's nothing. Frankenstein just goes collecting bits and pieces and presto-chango, a freak is born. But, the good news is, this monster's got a lot more going on than the movie versions. He seems much more hideous looking, which I think is cool. He has Spiderman abilities to move thousands of miles and track Victor on all his many ramblings. This monster is a thoughtful, conflicted man with a plan. He just needs a good woman to set him straight."},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"Well...it's the complete story with a background story on the author but I honest think it's not worth the money.

I used to get up early just to go get the paper and see which movie was showing that Saturday. It was usually either a Godzilla movie or a Bela Lugosi-era monster movie. So my first experience with Frankenstein was the 1931 film version and Herman Munster. Needless to say, the original version was quite a bit different. Frankenstein was the creator, not the monster (although he more often goes by Victor). No stunted, criminal brain is involved. In fact, he is highly intelligent. I will leave it to the reader to decide for herself whether he is innately malevolent or a blank slate shaped by his early experiences, but I depart from many in thinking the former.Shelley's prose is often very powerful. There are shades of Dostoevsky in Crime and Punishment. Shelley makes extensive use of symbolism--breaking ice, the escape from science into nature, Frankenstein's relation with his monster analogized to God's relationship with man. It doesn't have much of the suspense modern horror so heavily relies upon. It's the kind of book that should make you think long and hard, and much of what you should think long and hard about is not entirely pleasant.Shelley does sometimes writes in convoluted sentences: \\"She was tranquil, yet her tranquility [sic] was evidently constrained; and as her confusion had before been adduced as a proof of her guilt, she worked up her mind to an appearance of courage.\\" But that's par for the course with Victorian writing.I read the Kindle version of Frankenstein offered free through Amazon. I noticed few, if any, errors. This version contains Shelley's 1831 edits (e.g., Elizabeth is a Milanese orphan)."},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"This was a great book about everything from politics and society to scientific experimentation, and even about love.

With this desire, he is internally forced to create a monstrous being. The continuous need for knowledge can be considered dangerous, as it can result to the destruction of the life of Victor, the creator. Robert Walton himself learned how destructive the desire for knowledge can be after seeing what it had done to Victor first hand.This literary work of art, however, also portrays some aspects of human nature, the want to be accepted into society. The monster wasn't really bad, nor was he good. He was simply a human being with a unique appearance that needed affection, love, and acceptance. His unique appearance, however, scared away everyone that he meets, which will eventually enrage him because he feels he is not loved.This book is truly a great book that touches on the subjects of acceptance. To not judge people based on how they look. Everyone needs someone who can love and understand them. Without these things, it will cause someone to rage quit life."},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"Frankenstein; or The Modern Prometheus, first published in 1818, is well-deserved classic of science fiction and horror. Mary Shelley's work, much like the similarly influential Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde by Robert Louis Stevenson (see my review of that here on Amazon for more on that tale), has almost been forgotten in its original form, as so many adaptations - most quite different from the original - have been produced in the nearly two centuries since it first appeared.The story begins with an introductory framing narrative by Robert Walton, an arctic explorer who catches a glimpse of a giant person traveling through the ice shortly before rescuing a stranded traveler who turns out to be Victor Frankenstein.Frankentein, a young Swiss student of chemistry and natural philosophy, relates his tale to Walton, who then records it in letters to his sister in England. Frankenstein describes how he created artificial life, only to be repulsed by the hideousness of the new being. Frankenstein abandons the creature, which then disappears.However, some time later, the creature begins taking revenge for his abandonment and misery upon Frankenstein's loved ones. Eventually tracking his creation down, the being tells Frankenstein his own tale of how he has attempted to befriend humans, only to be hated and driven away each time. The creature extracts a promise from Frankenstein to create a mate for him, after which the pair will disappear.Frankenstein begins to work on another creature, but eventually decides that he cannot create another monster and destroys his work. This prompts the creature to continue his campaign of revenge upon Frankenstein, eventually leading to the chase into the arctic. At this point, Walton resumes the narration and describes the final climax of the relationship between Frankenstein and his creation.The central theme of the story is the creation of life and the responsibility of the creator to his creation, as framed by the now-classic science fiction device of the artificial creation of life. Frankenstein, though the main character, could hardly be described as a hero in this narrative with his abandonment of the creature and self-centered actions, and the creature manages to illicit both sympathy from his lonely misery and horror with the lengths to which he will go to enact his revenge. Shelley does a fine job of taking the reader between these contradictions.I listened to the audio version read by Ralph Cosham, a favorite narrator of mine, and can certainly recommend Cosham's reading of the tale. Cosham's readings of the classics are always well done.Shelley's language will sound archaic to modern readers. However, if you can manage to get past that or you actually enjoy that style, Frankenstein is well worth reading. It has earned its place in popular culture and as a foundational tale in both the science fiction and horror genres. Do yourself a favor, and read the original Frankenstein. You'll find a lot more than the grunting, shambling monster of the movies. Shelley's creation is as alive, powerful, and intelligent as Frankenstein's."},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"The book was fair, but the story seemed far-fetched from what would really happen....

When asked about it, long after I stopped carrying about the novel with too many complexities for even a bright 14 year old to understand, I would simply say \\"I know that Mary Shelley is [radical feminist] Mary Wollstonecraft's daughter, but you would never know it from Frankenstein.\\"I reread the novel for my Goth Lit class freshman year of college when I was better able to understand the intricacies of the text. For the first time, I did see saw Mary Wollstonecraft's daughter. Numerous reviewers before me have expounded upon the \\"Man trying to usurp God with Reckless Science\\" themes of the novel, concentrating on the Reckless Science (so like what we see paralleled today) while ignoring the phallo-centric characteristics of the science that Victor Frankenstein practices.The man's science relentlessly pursues and forcibly unveils a decidedly feminine and reluctant Nature, and manages to bypass the feminine entirely with the creation of monster that came simply from the work of a man. Frankenstein houses a genuine fear of female sexuality (just looks at the dream he has following his monster's creation, in which his beloved, while in his embrace, becomes the corpse of his dead mother).I know my argument might seem shoddy here, but Hindle (the editor) puts together a wonderful introduction that, among other things, connects Frankenstein's science to his maleness.The are many editions of Frankenstein. I feel that this one stands out because of its fine scholarship."},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"As far as I have gotten in the book it is a good piece of Literature.

He loved even more trying to figure out how life was brought into people and how it was taken out. Finally after two years of college he finds out how. In finding out how he made the worst mistake in the history of mankind.Once he figured out how to put life into something he was dying to try it. He stole body parts from cemeteries and created a creature. The creature was a monstrous wretched creature. Right when it came alive it ran away. When people saw it they gasped.

A must read."},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"As a high school student in an honors lit class we had to read this book as a required reading. I was expecting it to be cheesy (sort of like those movies and for it to have a very simple plot line), well I was wrong. Mary Shelly was only around 19 when she wrote this story and it was for a contest. I wonder if she even realized how amazing Frankenstine actually is!The story takes you on a nearly suspenseful journey that will have you questioning your true feeling on what is called the &quot;monster&quot;. Sometimes Frankenstine's monster seems to be good with true feelings and well, other times the &quot;monster&quot; becomes the source of disaster for everything he holds dear. During the story the inventor also makes a woman &quot;monster&quot; for his somewhat demented invention but all is not well and the woman's pieces are scattered throughout the ocean. This is when the wrath of the &quot;monster&quot; is felt and the &quot;monster&quot; runs then off to cause disaster. From then on Frankenstine trys to stop his invention before it's too late (and this is when the beginning of the story picks up---you will understand what I'm saying if you read the book :)The story is excellent and there is not a boring part in it! Shelly builds up the suspence slowly and torments the readers with a veriety of conflicting emotions. It is the basis of todays horror, mystery, and thrillers. It is a must read for ANYONE who enjoys a GREAT book----read it and I promise you will NOT forget it!"},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"I read this for 11th grade english and was not thrilled with having to read it because I wanted more Shakespeare. However I did read this book and was struck at how many themes in it were applicable to the moral battles being fought today. Stem-cell research, cloning, designer babies, etc... All of this was being touched on by an author who couldn't ever dream how true her prose might ring. My experience with this book may be distorted because when you read a book with a guide (such as a teacher) your opinions become mingled with your teachers. The character of Victor is fascinating but he is one that you will hurt deeply for. He does so many things that will repulse you and he takes so little responsibilities for his creation and the consquences that will spring from it. Read it and soak up the story."},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"I read a condensed kiddies version of this when I was 8. I liked it better because it got to the point right away and lacked the increasingly dull indulgence in using zillions of paragraphs to describe things that don't really have anything to do with the story. It comes as a rather large surprise that this book is held in such high literary regard. Perhaps back in 18-something it may have been scary but by modern literary standards I'm afraid to say that Frankenstein is gibberish.Perhaps this stems from the fact that Mary Shelley just wrote this for a laugh. She, Lord Byron and another pal were on Holiday in Switzerland and had a competition on who could write the scariest story. Shelly instantly came up with this, which is probably why it seems so uninspired, unfocused and meandering. Granted, the subtext is interesting enough, even to this day, but that's not what the book is about.Shelley does go on a bit. Far, far too much time is wasted on set-up and over-description (her love of the Swiss countryside is evident in the dozens of pointless paragraphs describing the landscape) when it should really just be getting to the point. And then when the point finally arrives...it's underwritten. It feels like the book is nothing but filler. I mean when the monster/beast/wretch/daemon/creature is being created Shelly hardly writes anything. Where did Frankenstein get the parts? How did he put it all together? How did he actually bring it to life? She doesn't even have a full or half-full description of what the monster looked like. This could have been interesting in a macabre way but it's ignored.And what's the deal with the monster going from not being able to speak or understand language to talking like some sort of Oxford professor within a few months? It's so far-fetched and hard to swallow. Tho there is sympathy to be had for the monster and doubt whenever Frankenstein badmouths him.Another problem is the actual storytelling. The narration shifts 5 times in the course of this book and it becomes most annoying. I suppose this benefits the views of 3 different people but when they conflict in no way or contribute to the story what's the point? Frankenstein should have had tighter editing? For what it is it's a decent tragedy but NOT horror of any kind."},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"This particular edition uses the wrong text -- the bowdlerized 1831 text,rather than the original 1818 text. Most Frankenstein editions do in fact use the 1831 text, which was the only one available for 143 years. Then in 1974 James Rieger, in his _Frankenstein or, The Modern Prometheus: The 1818 Text_ (Chicago), compellingly made the case that the 1818 text is superior, in terms of both ideas and language. Almost all scholars of English Romanticism were convinced by Rieger, and now prefer the 1818 text.Frankenstein really is a great work, containing profound symbolism, disturbing ideas, unforgettable images, and some of the most beautiful prose in the English language. However, to appreciate these fully, it's necessary to have the best text. Fortunately, several editions of the 1818 Frankenstein are now available, edited by J. Paul Hunter (Norton), James Rieger (Chicago), Susan J. Wolfson (Longman), and D.L. Macdonald & Kathleen Scherf (Broadview).The masterpiece, Frankenstein, was really written by Percy Bysshe Shelley, one of the greatest poets in the English language.

I realized that I had never put my opinion out there for non-subscribers. So, here's a little of what I said for the blog.I love horror fiction, especially classic horror fiction. I love female authors. I love people who are unconventional and who color outside the lines, as Shelley did simply by writing this novel. I should love this book.I don't.Let me clarify a point right up front: I was not expecting this book to be anything like any of the many film representations of the story. I remember that much from college. I knew up front that this book would not be anything like the movies (although had it been like \\"Young Frankenstein\\" I'd have married this book).What I was expecting was a thrilling horror novel with most of the suspense being internal in Victor Frankenstein. What I got was a snooze-fest. The novel is presented in epistle form, and I typically love epistles (there's a phrase you don't hear every day). \\"The Color Purple\\" is one such example. Frankenstein is not. The \\"internal suspense\\" in this novel is really more Dr. Frankenstein being a whiny little girl. He spends all of his time lamenting his mistakes but not doing anything about them until you are about 80% through the novel.I'm not saying that I hated the entire book. I just hated the first 40%. That first 40% consists of the exposition, which is ridiculously long, and Dr. Frankenstein relating his story to the letter writer. This is really dry because, as I stated before, Frankenstein is a whiny little girl. At the 40% point, the novel picks up. It actually becomes entertaining. \\"Did Dr. Frankenstein stop whining?\\" you ask. Nope. This is when the Creature speaks (that's right, in the book, the Creature speaks). From the moment that the Creature speaks (quite eloquently I might add) until he stops telling his tale, the book is absolutely riveting. I call him the Creature because in the novel he is never named and whether or not he is actually a monster is for the reader to decide. That's actually one of the themes of the book. I won't reveal whether or not I think that he's a monster. I'll let you decide that for yourself, should you choose to read it.Just be prepared to be bored for somewhere around 1120 locations.

I didn't think anything could be worse then Kafka's \\"The Metamorphosis\\". Seems I'm never too old to be wrong. This time, I don't have the excuse that I was forced to read this for high school lit. class. Oh no, this time I read this of my own volition and for fun. Yeah, fun. Kinda like sticking bamboo shoots between my fingernails type of fun. Watching paint dry fun. Going to an Air Supply concert fun.OK, to be fair, I need to tell you what I liked about this....Well, Mary Shelley was a teen when she wrote this. Color me impressed. At 19 I was just looking for my next college boyfriend, not penning the great English classic. Kudos to Mary for that.Otherwise, I can't think of anything to admire in this book, apart from the fact that it's the only book in my reading history where I actually noted EVERY SINGLE PAGE NUMBER and mentally counted down the time I'd be finished.Why did I persist, you may ask? Well, at the point where the pain became mind numbing, I decided to channel my inner John McCain and just survive the torture. Figured it would make me a better, stronger reader. Might even make me enjoy a re-read of Breaking Dawn....(well, no it wouldn't, but you get the idea).Frankenstein is a classic alright. A classic melodrama. Complete with a wimpy, vaporish, trembling prima donna main character and a pseudo monster whose only sin is being uglier then Bernie Madoff in cell block D. After the upteenth tremble/jerk/gasp/faint/start from our mad scientist Victor Frankenstein, I could only sign in relief that he wasn't a Rabbi about to perform a bris circumcism - oy vey!Were we supposed to be outraged at the monster's killing spree? By the books end, I was merely miffed that the creature murdered the wrong Frankenstein sibling. He would have saved himself a good deal of traveling (and saved me a good deal of suffering) had he snuffed out his \\"maker\\" before he could high-tail it out of the \\"birthing room\\".I'm sure that the fans of this book will say that I didn't understand the deeper, symbolic nuances of this book, and I'm sure that they are right. At this point in my life, all I know is what I like and don't like in a book, and as far as I'm concerned, this book is unadulterated, mind-numbing crap. But that's just me. Your mileage will vary!In conclusion, despite what I've written, I am glad I read this. I've been looking for a better punishment for my 14-soon-to-be-15 year old, and now I can easily say, when she gets sassy and goes all teenage-postal, that she is grounded for a week AND must read and write a report on Shelley's Frankenstein.....that ought to keep her on the straight and narrow until she leaves for college!"},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"This is one book that you shouldn't even spend the light of day to even read.

As demonstrated in this thick collection, he could also open up with blazing machine guns and giant amoebic monstrosities. DON'T DREAM collects all of his short fiction that can be considered as horror or fantasy together with a series of prose poems, a youthful essay on horror in literature, and a engrossing essay by the editior on the prolonged litigation for the control of Arkham House, Publishers after the death of Wandrei's partner August Derleth. Excellent art by Rodger Gerberding highlights the stories. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Don't Dream: The Collected Horror and Fantasy Fiction of Donald Wandrei","review":"Yes, Donald Wandrei was a member of the notorious &quot;Lovecraft Circle&quot;, but herein you will find no Great Cthulus, slime dripping Byakhees, or worm-eaten copies of De Vermiis Mysteriis, for this collection consists largely of sci-fi stories that rely heavily upon pseudo-science, physical revulsion, and violence for their effect, hence most could be called &quot;horror&quot; stories. There are few tales of the genuine supernatural here, &quot;The Chuckler&quot;, &quot;The Lady in Gray&quot;, &quot;Don't Dream&quot;, and the &quot;Painted Mirror&quot; being the only stories in this thick compendium with authentic occult overtones. Indeed, although Wandrei admired Lovecraft, he doesn't seem to have been influenced much by him in terms of style or device; Wandrei clearly owes much to writers like H.G. Wells, H. Rider Haggard, and Edgar Rice Burroughs for his sci-fi yarns, and his language is surprisingly contemporary. Nearly all of Wandrei's &quot;fantasy fiction&quot; consists of his dream stories and prose poems, all of which are markedly different in feel from his sci-fi efforts. They are true ravings from a fevered mind and smack of the genuine, illogical stuff of nightmare...little if any plot, but striking and atmospheric images and sensations with an ever present feeling of dread in the backdrop. Wandrei captures the feeling of a dream much better than Dunsany or Lovecraft, but his forays into the Dreamlands are brief excursions, not well-plotted epics in the tradtion of the other two authors.Highlights of this collection include the action-adventure/murder mystery/sci-fi tale &quot;Giant-Plasm&quot; (the give away title being the only drawback), the genuinely creepy &quot;Treemen of M'Bwa&quot;, the disorienting man-to-animal soul transference of &quot;The Witch Makers&quot;, the graphic and ultraviolent yarns &quot;The Monster From Nowhere&quot; (a metallic alien rips peoples heads off) and &quot;The Destroying Horde&quot; (flesh absorbing ancestors of the &quot;The Blob&quot; terrorize St.Paul), the awesome little tale &quot;The Eye and the Finger&quot;, and the gruesome, Stephen King-esque &quot;It Will Grow on You&quot;. A few of the stories simply do not work (these include the dreadfully hokey &quot;A Scientist Divides&quot; and the corny &quot;When The Fire Creatures Came&quot;), but thankfully these duds are the exception. On a similar note, much of Wandrei's earlier &quot;prose poetry&quot; is too brief and undeveloped to be very enjoyable...it only tantalizes you with a taste of a fuller nightmare vision that never seems to materialize, while Wandrei attempts to see just how freaky he can get with words reminds one of Clark Ashton Smith (who DW also, not at all surprisingly, greatly admired).All fans of 30s pulp fiction should own this book, it is a rare gem: a compilation of classic, ground-breaking sci-fi stories. Sure, there are some stinkers in the list, but the good stories predominate, for Wandrei was a writer of startling originality. But Lovecraft junkies beware...if you buy this book anticipating more uninspired Cthulhu Mythos stories (ala August Derleth), you'll be disappointed, for the only two stories that resemble anything written by Lovecraft are &quot;The Shadow of a Nightmare&quot; (nine pages) and &quot;The Chuckler in the Tomb&quot; (a cop tracks down a grave robber who turns out to be something other than human...four pages)."},{"Title":"Don't Dream: The Collected Horror and Fantasy Fiction of Donald Wandrei","review":"Here we have a book and an author that have positive and negative points. Donald Wandrei, of Arkham House fame was not a very good writer. His two best works, in my opinion, were &quot;THE WEB OF EASTER ISLAND&quot; and &quot;THE BLINDING SHADOWS&quot;. But for the most part, he was almost a hack-writer, putting forth a production not always very exceptional. This book is quite an example of that. An anthology comprised of mostly low-grade stories. We wouldn't give it 3 stars but for the fact that Wandrei was an important figure in Lovecraftiana and in the growth of Arkham House and every Lovecraft Addict should know about him. Also, Fedogan &amp; Bremer always do an excellent work on their products and this is definitely the case.

It presents all the necessary basics of the subject with a straightforward, practical approach couch in somewhat casual language.A solid foundation in the topic is therefore provided, with numerous examples to reinforce the concepts and provide practice. However, apart from a more than usually well-constructed approach, there this book has no outstanding feature that shows it to be far superior to others of its ilk.Physically, the book is not inordinately think, nor is it poorly produced. In fact, although it has the rather old-fashioned two-colour layout, the print is clear, and the book, on the whole, is well made.On the whole, then, whilst not a particularly inspiring textbook, it nevertheless provides a good basis for the subject, and has a lot going for it. As an introductory text, it is not particularly interesting, but readily fulfils its aims in terms of teaching the subject matter."},{"Title":"The Essential Mediterranean : How Regional Cooks Transform Key Ingredients into the World's Favorite Cuisines","review":"Nancy Harmon Jenkins clearly belongs to the elite cadre of culinary writers who interpret Mediterranean cuisine for us. Foremost among these are Elizabeth David, Claudia Roden, Paula Wolfert, and Clifford Wright. And that doesn't include the many writers specializing in particular countries, such as Penelope Casas on Spain, Diane Kochilas on Greece, and Patricia Wells on France.Each of these writers gives us a slightly different perspective on the same subject, so they rarely overlap in their general essays on the Mediterranean. Roden is the historian, Wolfert is the ethnologist, and Wright is the taxonomist. Jenkins' role seems to be the dietitian and synthesist, explaining what it is that makes Mediterranean cuisine distinctive and, in other works, what makes it as healthy as it appears in demographic studies of peoples and diets.Of all the works I have read by these authors, this book is the most interesting to people interested in history and current events, but with only an average interest in cooking. The primary object of the book is to identify those foodstuffs that are central to the Mediterranean diet, and how they achieved that status. The main characters in this story are salt, olives, wheat and its products, wine and vinegar, legumes, peppers (chiles), tomatoes, pork, seafood, and milk (giving cheese and yogurt).The first item, salt, may seem unexciting since every culture has used and valued salt. But, salt has played a larger role in Mediterranean history than in other cultures because the Mediterranean Sea happens to be a lot saltier than the broader \`seven seas'. This means that it is a lot easier to harvest sea salt, which means that salt preserved foods become much more common. A perfect example of how simple things can make enormous differences.Olives and olive oil are a no-brainer and anyone who has read at any length on Mediterranean food will not find a lot of new information here. The chapter on wheat was a major surprise on at least two counts. The first was biological. I knew there was a significant difference between durum wheat and other wheats, but I had no idea the difference was at such a deep genetic level and that durum wheat represents less than 10% of world wheat crops. The second surprise was historical. I am well aware of the difference between soft and hard pastas from the north and south of Italy respectively, but I had no idea that hard pasta (macaroni) was almost entirely limited in its production and distribution to southern Italy until after the end of World War II. This makes it clear that as important as bread is today as a Mediterranean starch, it once was much more important in Italy.Almost every chapter had its little surprises. While I was skimming my way through the chapter on Old World beans, I was surprised by the discovery that there is a significant genetically based allergy to fava beans and that none other than Pythagoras banned their consumption. This may only be exciting to an avid reader of history and philosophy, but it certainly puts a new twist on how I think about fava beans the next time Mario Batali breaks them out on \`Molto Mario'.The list goes on. This book clearly fills a void in food writing by clearly defining a subject people often talk about without being really clear about their subject. As a result of the nutritional findings cited earlier, it becomes pretty important to know what it is that makes all those southern Italians so healthy.One concern is that most of the book deals with Italy, southern France, and Spain. The author even concedes this point at the beginning, with the totally understandable statement that she is dealing with what she knows. On the other side of the coin, the range of the author's sources is very broad, including source material from many historical documents on peasant life in the Mediterranean in the last thousand years.In addition to the essays on foodstuffs, the book offers recipes featuring each item. All are worthy, but the real value to the book is in the essays. That being said, I was really disappointed to find that although the book had a very good bibliography, there were references to authorities' names with no mention of them in the bibliography. The chapter on legumes for example refers to the anthropologist Sidney Mintz, yet no work by Mr. (Dr.?) Mintz appears in the bibliography. Not good reflections on Harper Collins' copy editors.This is a small annoyance. Overall, the book gives a fresh, insightful view of Mediterranean cuisine. Almost all the recipes are classics, with relatively simple, straightforward instructions. Maybe not as authentic as Paula Wolfert, but definitely more authentic than Good Housekeeping.Highly recommended for any foodie or even for History buffs."},{"Title":"The Essential Mediterranean : How Regional Cooks Transform Key Ingredients into the World's Favorite Cuisines","review":"I have a book on Moroccan cooking by Paula Wolfert and a book on Syrian cooking, and both are daunting to me because of the techniques and equipment required.

Hopefully, this one was written earlier than W.TX Sunrise, and Bagdon has changed personally.Anyway, I honestly can't say much about the actaul text as i don't think I finished the first chapter. It might be OK for someone.If it weren't a $5 book, I would have sent it back to Amazon. It is not worth donating to anyone, so I will probably throw it away.The 4 books in the West Texas Sunrise, however were quick, fun and adventurous. Each one is less than 300 pages.

So much poetry today is bland, plain vanilla, like art that people walk by quickly in a museum to get to the gift shop or say they've been there. Blanco is anything but. Directions to the Beach, if anything, is even more fiery than his first volume, the award-winning City of a Hundred Fires. Blanco takes us everywhere--we are on a journey: through the Straits of Messina, to Paris, New York, Miami. We meet lovers (here you will find a series of \\"for\\" poems like no others--for M.C., C.S.B., B.L), friends, family members (my favorites: Abuelo and Abuela). Here are the things and stuff of poetry--a world like no other. America: give us a poetry that speaks to our finest sensibilities; that tells the truth about family, love, loss, beauty and joy. Give us the sensuous detail. Give us all of this in language (or rather languages--for what are our languages if not English and Spanish?). The leavened bread; the deep red wine.Seek no further. Here it is."},{"Title":"Directions to the Beach of the Dead (Camino del Sol)","review":"Richard Blanco's Directions to the Beach of the Dead carries a moving recommendation on its cover from Sandra Cisneros, who writes of \\"feeling\\" that she \\"was trespassing on the intimate correspondence between a lover and a beloved.\\" She also describes her desire \\"to be the receiver of such exquisite letters.\\" Blanco's poetry inspires \\"intimate\\" and \\"personal\\" reactions. Students, who have studied his first book, City of a Hundred Fires (1997), speak to its \\"beauty\\" and \\"courage\\" and one student writes of a \\"personal engagement\\" with \\"people and places I've never met and never known.\\" It is tempting then, as Sandra Cisneros does, to imagine ourselves \\"listening in\\" while Blanco engages his intimate other, but it is equally tempting to see ourselves as the receiver or even the sender of these letters. We find ourselves as active players within his poetry, imaginatively engaging the characters and places. In this sense then, Blanco's poetry is about engagement but also about absence; he creates a vulnerability in his writings within the strength and vitality of a language that is animate and alive. Blanco's work presents a curious paradox then: It possesses both a vulnerability and a strength, simultaneously open and exposed to emotional need and offering access to a force capable of coming to terms with such longing.The volume's opening section offers glimpses into Blanco's travels in Rome, Venice, Barcelona, France, and Guatemala and Brazil. The collection's title poem instructs the reader on how to reach the \\"Beach of the Dead\\": \\"Go to Europe, go to Spain, in Barcelona, walk/under centuries hanging from the iron lamps\\" (ll 1-2). The poet then offers more personal suggestions for the journey: \\"Pull out your map, follow/the town's names lettered straight out to into the sea/ . . . you'll ask yourself: Should I live here? Could I live here? Don't answer\\" (ll. 20-21 & 27-28 [author's italics]). Arriving at the beach, the poet tells us to \\"take your sandals off, . . . take off your clothes,/lie between the sun and the earth, fall asleep\\" (ll. 44 & 46-47). The writer gives you his confidence, trusts you with the secret of how to arrive at the \\"Beach of the Dead.\\" His trust gives us, his reader and companion, the confidence to cast aside our inhibitions, our guards against intimacy, and lie naked, as he has done, on the beach. The poem then is our journey through the underworld with Blanco, standing as a type of Dante's Virgil, guiding us through our realization of our vulnerability, our mortality, and our potential for re-animation in the minds of those travelers who come after us. The \\"iron lamps\\" that marked the initial stages of our journey can then stand as symbols both for \\"centuries\\" of longing and of light, of the imaginative illumination necessary to see ourselves as part of a long march of pilgrims to the \\"beach of the dead\\" and to its attendant realizations.Blanco's poetic persona follows in a long line of travelers and allegorical journeys. Like the stories in ancient texts of the mysterious and mystical journeys of St Brendan or of Odysseus, Blanco's poet guide takes us from place to place, offering insights not only into the local geography but also making a connection between the landscape and the spiritual potential to which the landscape grants us access. In Central America, Blanco's poet finds himself, in \\"Winter of Volcanoes: Guatemala,\\" \\"terrified\\" that he, might \\"let\\" himself \\"be seduced by the pure, living heart/of the raw earth\\" (25 & 26-27). In the moment of seduction there lies a tension between retaining an individual consciousness while, simultaneously, longing for total absorption within our fascinations, our seductions, our sensual pleasures. There lies, within the volcano and within the poet's temptation, a desire to become one with the forces of creation but also a desire for self-realization and self-consciousness; Blanco's poet-traveler \\"spelled out\\" his \\"name with/freshly minted stones\\" he \\"laid down to claim I was here\\" (ll.17-18 [author's italics]). The poet finds in the landscape the meeting place between mortality and immortality, an association that very place also carried for the writers of the ancient epic, the Papol Vuh.The poet/traveler also explores landscapes specific to Blanco's past, using a film projector as a \\"a tiny, black time-machine\\" (l. 1) that \\"opens a hole in the living room wall like a portal/into lives I never knew, years I don't remember living\\" (ll. 3-4). In the recollections of various memories his family, Blanco, specifically recalls seeing his father, who \\"speaks into the camera,/but the film is silent, cloud shadows darken over /his dark lips, a voice I can't hear forever\\" (ll. 23-25). Blanco considers his father in other poems in the collection: In \\"What's Love Got to Do?\\" (a narrative prose poem) he waits for his father to \\"say something\\" that communicates deep meaning to his son, while sharing a drive to work with his father. His father tells his son stories of listening and dancing to Tina Turner's music when he was in Cuba. The poet recalls how his father \\"embarrassed\\" him \\"with his singing all summer, that summer before his throat smelled, before the weekly visits to Dr. Morad, before the Mitomycin and Hail Marys failed, before he'd never sing again. That summer when all I managed to ay was \\" Yeah, I love Tina too.\\" Blanco recalls his father's inability to speak and, even before his father's cancer, of how they were unable to communicate through speech. There is an absence in these poems, an emptiness that the poet fills with longing and with love. His father anticipates their eventual contact in \\"Papa's Bridge,\\" telling Blanco, from a bed in a hospital as his son \\"took his hand\\" (l. 33), that \\"You'll know how to build bridges like that someday\\" (l. 35 [author's italics]). Returning from memory into present recollection, Blanco crosses the bridge that was visible from his father's hospital bed, \\"spanning/the silent distance between us with the memory/ of a father and son holding hands, secretly in love\\" (ll. 36-38). Blanco's love communicates his longing for his father, recreates the love through imaginative recollection, recalls the pain of absence and the trauma of separation.The cover of Blanco's Directions to the Beach of the Dead includes, in addition to Sandra Cisneros' remarks, an intriguing photo by Carlos Betancourt. A man lies face down on a beach, partially covered by sand. Markings and stones cover his naked torso (lines and characters in deep-blue-black, figures in bright red and pale-but-vibrant blue), suggesting a protective covering of spells and magic against naked exposure to the elements or even to a readers intrusive gaze. The figure in the photo though invites us in even as he shields himself from our encroachment. The man in the picture (Blanco himself is the model) is alive and strong but also vulnerable, like the poetry in the volume, offering self up for sacrifice but also for the potential of imaginative unity and transformation.Bernard McKenna, PhDAssoc.

I highly recommend this series to anyone who enjoys a great story."},{"Title":"Raven's Shadow (The Raven Duology, Book 1)","review":"I am always skeptical about reading a fantasy author that is new to me.

The characters are rich and I find myself wondering what happens to them after the end of the story. The villans are just that and there is some suspense and some action. Perhaps the best recommendation for any book is that I would read a sequel if there were one."},{"Title":"Raven's Shadow (The Raven Duology, Book 1)","review":"Thoroughly enjoyed this book. Would recommend this to anyone who loves this genre. Wish there was more in the series."},{"Title":"Raven's Shadow (The Raven Duology, Book 1)","review":"Yes it was.I ate all the way through the Mercy series and decided to try out some of Briggs' older high fantasy work. I was iffy on the endeavor, but about 50 pages into Raven's Shadow, I had already decided to buy Raven's Strike. By the end of Raven's Shadow, I'd also bought Hob's Bargain and Dragon Bones.Everything I enjoy about Briggs' writing is present in this earlier work. Her characters are very enjoyable. Her world construction (probably the most concerning aspect of anything high fantasy) was stable. Most notably the pacing makes the book impossible to put down until it's completed.If I read Raven's Shadow without having read anything else by Briggs, I would still have found it a very enjoyable book that merited purchasing the sequel. Having read her more recent work though, it was very fun to contrast how she has improved since 2004."},{"Title":"Raven's Shadow (The Raven Duology, Book 1)","review":"I thought this story was very well-written and entertaining. There were some fun twists and turns and the story moved at a good pace. I thought it didn't leave any huge plot holes at all, but you could tell there was a sequel (or sequels) coming. If you didn't want to read any additional books though (which I generally don't like to do) you wouldn't feel ripped off or left with characters hanging from a cliff or anything like that. I only gave it four stars because while the main two characters (Tier and Serraph) were well-developed, the rest of the characters were less developed. Also, I wanted to know more about the magic and the characters' abilities in using it. I think that may be one thing that evolves in the sequels. Overall though I enjoyed this book and didn't want to put it down."},{"Title":"Raven's Shadow (The Raven Duology, Book 1)","review":"**Spoiler Alert!** If you plan on reading the book, do not continue reading this review. ... Okay, but don't say I didn't warn you.After ten years of battle and war, Tier is finally on his way home. Coming to a village a few days from home, thoughts of a warm meal and comfortable bed are waylaid when he passes a pyre on fire - with a dead Traveler in the center of the blaze. Thoughts of leaving are reinforced when he walks into the local inn only to come upon the \\"trial\\" of the dead traveler's sixteen year-old sister, Seraph, also a Traveler, a Raven of the Clan of Isolda the Silent. He feels her magic stirring when she becomes furious, for the innkeeper believes she cannot pay the outrage sum against her. She is now being sold to whomsoever will pay the wage. Tier comes to her rescue, and they quickly leave the village. But the nobleman who had intended on buying Seraph for himself has every intention of taking her back... And loses.Tier has every intention of helping her find her another Traveler family, bought plans are waylaid again when he gets home to find his mother abed and sick. He has the bakery to run, even though his sister and brother-in-law had been doing just fine. He's asked to stay a few weeks at least, so spend time with his mother before her passing, but the more time he spends at home, the more he wants to get out. Restless after so many years of battle, the thought of a monotonous life is too much to bear. And he comes to Seraph's rescue once again. After yet more harrassement from Tier's sister, Seraph's anger gets the better of her and unleashes a wave of destruction in the front room of the bakery, breaking everything. Once they were married, he buys a plot of land believed to be of little value, and becomes a farmer.Twenty years and three children later, Seraph is happy, even though the guilt of eschewing her people's responsibility ways on her, even through her little family's having rough times. Tier has gone on another winter's hunting trip, and he's late in returning home. When a hunter arrives, bringing news that he believes Tier to be dead, Seraph is getting the feeling that something is most definitely not right. Now she must tell her children what exactly they are. There are 5 Orders of the Travelers; her children were all born into different Orders. Something that had never before happened.Unearthing the bones, Seraph is sure that the bones do not belong to her husband. Another Raven, Hennea, finds them and explains what she believes is happening. Rinnie, her youngest child and only daughter, gets kidnapped, and all four: Seraph, her son's Jes and Lehr and Raven Hennea, discover where she is and get her back, leaving her with Tier's sister. Seraph believes that Tier has been kidnapped much for the same reason: for his magic. While Tier wasn't born of the Order, he is a Bard: he can keep people calm with his voice, he can absolve an argument, and his songs can create pictures with his words. Travelers are dying. The Masters of the Secret Path are stealing magic with every intention of unleashing the Stalker. And as a Raven of the Order, Seraph cannot let that happen.Patricia Briggs is a Master Story-teller. She weaves a suspenseful mystery plot with excellent characters, great action scenes, and feelings. You can feel the inner battles of the main characters, from Seraph and Tier to Lehr and especially Jes. Every word pops the picture in your mind and you can swear you're right along with each character, seeing what they see, feeling what they feel. What I also really liked wsa the ending of the book. Even though this is the first book in her Raven duology, it doesn't leave this huge cliffhanger ending. While the book can be read as a stand-alone, only a couple of the plot lines are left unresolved, which does leave you wondering, but not frustrated. If you like fantasy novels, you will definitely like this one."},{"Title":"Raven's Shadow (The Raven Duology, Book 1)","review":"This series is the reason why Briggs is one of my favorite authors. Original, engrossing storyline with strong, likeable characters. It loosely puts me in mind of those fairy tales like 'East of the Sun, West of the Moon' where it is the heroine who has to struggle to get the Prince out of danger. That said, the hero is no coward, rather, the heroine is just that powerful and the situation they face is that overwhelming. Also, as a team, they are clearly stronger for their different strengths which balance each other.To lightly recap the premise: The Travelers are a nomadic folk wandering around in gypsy-like tribes. They have very distinctive light hair and features and are known - and feared and hated - for their magic. These structured magic powers (represented by a bird for each type of power) has a purpose: to protect the world from an ancient evil. The Traveler heroine, Seraph, is a sorcerer aka Raven. Initially, the story starts with her being rescued by Tier, a retired soldier on his way home. She recognizes that he has magic - that of a bard aka Owl which she has never seen in a non-Traveler before. This sets the story for them becoming an unusual 'mixed' couple raising a family of magically gifted children. As Seraph notes in the story, the gods give these gifts where they are needed and a situation needing this much magic cannot be good.While there is a fair amount of action (magic, fighting, traveling), the story is mostly about the development of the characters and the exploration of the mystery of the Traveler's current difficult outcast life, their purpose, and ultimately, their origins as Seraph and family set out to save the world."},{"Title":"Raven's Shadow (The Raven Duology, Book 1)","review":"I just finished reading this today; I started it a couple of days ago and couldn't put it down. Briggs has created a wonderful world peopled with well-rounded, absorbing and resourceful characters, who are believable without being overpowered. She has developed a very believable and detailed backstory for her world, but manages to skillfully work it into her narrative without \\"info-dumping.\\" Even though there are scenes of characters explaining things to other characters, I never got the feeling the plot was being slowed down or derailed. Through strong descriptive skills, she manages to bring a feeling of mystery and magic to her world. I *loved* that the protagonists were a married couple with some history to them and a real depth of emotion, instead of the far-too-common teenager-with-sword of a hundred derivative \\"Hero's Journey\\"-type stories. Tier's winning over the Passerines was well-done, as was Seraph's gaining control of the Renegade Traveler clan. Briggs also has a strong sense of what does *not* need to be shown in a novel to keep the narrative moving, often skipping briskly over scenes of characters filling each other in on things that the reader already knows and moving on to new plot material.I did have a few issues with the book, though these were minor. I thought Rederni felt like a much more fleshed-out location than the imperial palace, although that may have been because we saw the palace mostly through Tier's eyes and he spent much of that a prisoner. I would have liked to be shown how Seraph managed to get into the chambers of the Secret Path; it felt a little too convenient that she just managed to show up there at close to the right time. In the same vein, I would have liked to see more of Seraph's travels with the Traveler clan after she won them to her cause. There were a few other minor quibbles, but nothing to interfere seriously with my enjoyment of a solid read."},{"Title":"Raven's Shadow (The Raven Duology, Book 1)","review":"I was pleasantly surprised to find a new twist on a Fantasy novel. In this series, all the members of a family actually work together and each has individual gifts that blend together beautifully in their efforts to save mankind.Kudos to Briggs for bringing us a tale of a family united!"},{"Title":"Raven's Shadow (The Raven Duology, Book 1)","review":"Seraph is a young girl and traveller, a mage with strong magic powers. However travellers are hated, her brother is burned in a pyre and Seraph herself almost sold as a slave.

To keep her Tier offers to marry. Seraph agrees. Twenty years of happy married life passes by; then suddenly Seraph is told that Tier was killed in an accident. Seraph uses magic to find that this is untrue and that Tier is imprisoned in the king's palace. My husband has done nothing wrong, Injustice!! Seraph with her three children sets off to save her husband.I love this book because of the love shown between husband, wife and children. I particularly liked the part where husband and wife finally rejoin.I wanted to tell you that I love you; says Seraph.Did I have to get myself kidnapped and taken to jail in order to get you to say you loved me? Well it's worth it. Says Tier.Seraph cries.The story is laced with such heartwarming episodes. In the story it turnes out that the king is innocent and Seraph ends up battling the evil sorcerer magician who is caretaker to the king. But this is just the backdrop; this is really a story of familly love between Tier, Seraph and the three children. The writer Patricia Briggs has a special tallent for creating strong willed endearing female characters who are totally believable. Seraph is such a character. I thing all readers will enjoy this story."},{"Title":"Raven's Shadow (The Raven Duology, Book 1)","review":"I'm always searching for new (to me) fantasy writers and happened upon Raven's Shadow. I read the first page and decided to buy it.And proceeded to rip through the story in about a week.Ms. Briggs starts her tale with Tier, a battle-weary soldier wanting to get as far away from his present life back to his family. Although it will probably mean working at a job he doesn't particularly like, he figures the time spent away from the killing fields will give him a chance to reconnect with his family and decide what he wants to do with the rest of his life.He comes to a village and decides to retire for the night - except that there's a pyre in the village square. A Traveler - basically, a mage that wanders about dealing with demons unleashed hundreds of years before - is being burned, but Tier decides not to get involved.Yet. He enters the tavern, and this is where we meet the heroine of the story, Seraph. She's 16, and the tavern owner is having her auctioned to the highest bidder. Tier knows that Travelers are mistrusted and are being routinely killed, but he can't take this; he tops a lord's bid, the idea being to set her free once he has her outside the town.As the Travelers continue to be decimated, a dark religion is rising, looking upon the Travelers orders (which distinguishes what mages can and cannot do) as gods to be worshipped. Seraph must come to terms with her Traveler background in order to help quash this \\"religion.\\"Although there were a couple of passages that were info-dumpy, I like the story and the characters; no one is perfect, yet they have human foibles.Another plus: No cliffhanger! The major problems in this book are wrapped up at the end, with a tendril let loose that will no doubt continue into the next book.What set this apart for me from a lot of what's out there is the writing style (nothing herky-jerky or stilted), the likable characters, and the interesting way magic is used (not to mention the \\"hierarchy\\" of the Travelers). Very enjoyable - and I look forward to picking up the second book in this duology!"},{"Title":"Raven's Shadow (The Raven Duology, Book 1)","review":"Very good story.

In this tale that must be the beginning book of several--please, I hope there's more!, Briggs creates a cast of characters rich and multi dimensional. There's not a wasted word, and I find myself wishing it were 2-3 times longer! The beauty of her characterizations is almost haunting; the way Seraph moves through emotions created by her violent past, her culture, and her role as a mom--every scene she's in is full and interesting, with expected and unexpected comments, feelings, and reactions. Just glorious. And each of the characters is built and related in a similar fashion. Not simple, but unbelievably readable. A book to be read again and again.

It is a different place to start a story and I loved it more with every page. Wonderful, and character interaction was good as well. Try this book! If you want something more modern fantasy go with Mercy."},{"Title":"Raven's Shadow (The Raven Duology, Book 1)","review":"This is the first book in the Raven Duology by Patricia Briggs. It was an okay book. I liked the world and the magic system but thought that the pacing throughout the book was a bit erratic. I have also read Briggs Mercy Thompson series (which I thought was okay, but lacking in character development); this series is much different from the Mercy Thompson series. This series is written in a more traditional fantasy style, with less humor, and a slower pace.Seraph is the last of her Traveler Clan. She thinks her and her husband have settled down for a life of farming when they find out a greater evil is targeting both the Travelers and the land as a whole. Seraph and her family are drawn into the very conflict that Seraph tried to avoid when she was younger.The first part of this book was really slow for me. I had to really, really push through it. I tried to be patient and remember that sometimes good fantasies take a while to set up. It doesn't help that I recently readWarbreaker (Sci Fi Essential Books)which was an amazing book. A lot of time was spent dealing with the past when Seraph met her husband, and I really thought this probably wasn't needed and made the story take a lot longer than necessary to get going.Once the story did get going though I really enjoyed some of the other characters; mainly Teir, Jes, and the Emperor. The plot was well done and the end of the book was action packed and fast-paced. I never did care much about Seraph. I was also disappointed that Seraph's younger daughter (the weather witch) was left at home; she was a great character and she got shuffled out of the story.The magic system was very interesting as was the structure of the clans. If the second book keeps up the pace of the last third of the first book; then the second book will be a great book. I would buy both books at once if I was going to read this series. Although the first book concludes a major plot point there are many loose ends left hanging that have yet to be wrapped up. Also keep in mind these books are very different from the Mercy Thompson series both in character-type and writing style.Personally I likedThe Tower of Ravens (Rhiannon's Ride, Book 1)andWarbreaker (Sci Fi Essential Books)much better than this book when it comes to your traditional fantasy type of book."},{"Title":"Raven's Shadow (The Raven Duology, Book 1)","review":"I really enjoyed reading this book.

But she doesn't stop with this, she moves 20 years ahead to engage his children in the reaping of a crop that was sewn one night in a town he stopped at on his way home-- a town where a girl saw her brother burned at the stake and found her own life in danger because of the power she held."},{"Title":"Raven's Shadow (The Raven Duology, Book 1)","review":"Buuuuut, it was probably my least favorite series of hers to date.

The series is not groundbreaking, the magic system does get a little incosistant at times, and the ending could be paced a little longer. But with that being said, it is really a great tale and well worth the buy. I walk away from every one of Patricia's novels satisfied and laughing to myself about ever listening to critics who whine that the story is not totally new. Come on.. its fantasy.. lighten up."},{"Title":"Raven's Shadow (The Raven Duology, Book 1)","review":"Only odd thing is the book covers are differnt, not that it changes the story or anything but I wish Amazon would keep upto date with products. I actually like the new cover more. I won't go into many spoilers but it has a differnt formes of magic that many people never really have experamented with."},{"Title":"Raven's Shadow (The Raven Duology, Book 1)","review":"If you're looking to pass the time, this is a decent enough read. Good plot, well rounded characters. It lacks the piz-zazz that other series offer (like George R Martin, Vance, Jacqueline Carey, and others) but it is certainly worth the time and money to read this series."},{"Title":"Raven's Shadow (The Raven Duology, Book 1)","review":"This was fun to read, so much so that I am getting the next one in the series! I like all of this author's work. She seems very able to make different believable alternate realities and different characters for each one. This is a completely different world than any of the other books I have read from her so far.The characters are interesting and you grow to understand them and like them (OK there are a few you get to not like much as well!)as the book progresses. There is some romance, life and death threats, battles, magic and adventures all in one book.Yes, it is a series - at least 2 books that I know of anyway - however the first book is one complete story in itself. She doesn't leave you totally hanging in the middle of some crisis or battle. There is an end. Yep, you know something else is coming along in the next book, but it is not done in a way that is incredibly frustrating like so many other stories are that end the book in the middle of the story! My feeling is I read for enjoyment and I don't want to feel frustrated when I get to the 'end' because of some marketing ploy. So I was VERY happy with this book, which you can set down when you are done and feel satisfied. Of course it also leaves you feeling curious about what will happen to them next as well! That is why I am ordering the next book."},{"Title":"Raven's Shadow (The Raven Duology, Book 1)","review":"I started reading this book while waiting for the new addition to the Alpha Omega series came out. I fell in love with these characters and the world she created. Very well thought out, easy to read and follow, and simply compelling to read.If you like her other stories, then you will like this one as well!I could go into the details of the book, but someone else who reviewed already did that."},{"Title":"Raven's Shadow (The Raven Duology, Book 1)","review":"After ten years of war, battle-weary Tier is on his journey home and stops at a village for the night. Thoughts of a dry bed and some warm food are quickly wiped from his mind as he sees a dead Traveling man burning in a pyre in the center of town. With his natural charisma and talent for sway he saves the dead Traveler's younger sister and takes her to his home village with him. Out of convenience and a need to once again save the girl after her use of magic strikes fear and anger throughout his home village, Tier marries the Traveler and begins a new life as ex-soldier, farmer, husband, and father.Twenty years after solsenti Tier saved and married Sereph, Raven of the Clan of Isolda the Silent, she is now a farmer's wife and the mother of three Ordered children. When a huntsman comes to inform her that her husband died while on a trapping venture, Sereph and her children go seeking his body, but instead find themselves wrapped up in a plot more evil than they knew existed. Although Tier is alive, he has been captured by solsenti wizards intent on stealing Traveler's magic and using it to bring back to life the evil Stalker. To save the lives of her husband and the clans of Traveler's she has forsaken, Sereph and her children must fight the shadowed wizards and hopefully bring peace to the blighted Shadowlands.This is a great story with lots of magic and action. If you've read any of Patricia Briggs other stories, you already know she's a great writer. And \\"Raven's Shadow\\" is another example of just how well Briggs can tell a tale. The characters are interesting and believable, and I can't wait for future stories with the children so we can see them come into their magic fully. If you like fantasy adventure stories, you won't want to miss this one."},{"Title":"Raven's Shadow (The Raven Duology, Book 1)","review":"I had never read anything by Patricia Briggs before, but the cover and the summary looked interesting enough to give it a shot. I wasn't disappointed. It was an interesting, inventive novel with intriguing characters, and I went through it quite quickly. Not because it lacked substance, but because I didn't want to put it down.The magical aspect was covered very creatively. There are essentially six &quot;orders&quot; of magicians, and each type is linked to a different bird. The Raven of the title is the classic Mage, the order represented by Seraph, the protagonist, a strong woman whose Traveler blood ensures that she's hated by the general populace.At the very beginning of the story, her brother is killed because he's a Traveler, and she's rescued from joining him on the funeral pyre by Tier, who is not a traveler, but is revealed to be a Bard, linked to the Owl, and so is blessed with charisma and musical talent unmatched. They are married, largely to save each other from unwelcome fates, and not out of love. They're mostly strangers when they wed.Twenty years pass (which was a little disappointing; I would have liked to see more of Seraph and Tier's marriage), and the two of them have three children. Each of the children is given to an Order, which is extremely unusual. Jes, the oldest, is a Guardian, an Eagle, and sworn to protect anyone he loves at virtually any cost. He is, however, given shape-shifting abilities to help him with this. Lehr, the middle child, is a Hunter, a Falcon, and his powers are exactly what you would expect from a hunter. Rinnie has the gifts of the Weather-Witch, the Cormorant, and has power over the weather.While trapping one winter, Tier mysteriously disappears. He doesn't come back with the spring as expected, and there are signs of foul play. The entire village believes him to be dead, but Seraph uses her long-unused powers to discover that he is still alive. With the help of Hennae, a slightly mysterious Raven that approaches with a timely warning, and her children, Seraph sets out to rescue her husband from an evil fate.In the meantime, Tier discovers himself in a prison cell, while his powers have been taken away from him. Bound by magic in a way that renders him unable to get help or to tell anyone about his situation, he is eventually allowed to wander freely... uncovering a sinister plot against the realm and even the Emperor himself.There was a lot of exposition involved in this story, but it was done in such a way that it remained interesting anyway. The amount of world-building that was required, combined with an open ending promises a sequel that I can only hope comes soon. I'll definitely be picking it up when it comes out."},{"Title":"Raven's Shadow (The Raven Duology, Book 1)","review":"Usually I don't pick up an author's later books, since usually they seem to decline in writing ability. I picked it up, however, since it sounded intriguing. After a few months of sitting on my shelf, I finally began to read it, and had it finished within the next day.What a nice break in the cliche fantasy out there. Of course there was romance (I wouldn't read it if it wasn't), but it had a different feel than other stories. The main character get married, even though they aren't really in love, and grow on each other. Usually in a situation like this, the two will spite each other, then fall in love. That's not the case here; they have an understanding with each other, almost a friendship. It makes the scenario almost plausible.The characters have wonderful and believable personalities, once again making them more understandable. I love a fantasy book that relates to my emotions on a normal level, simply because they're so hard to find. The plot is exciting, with lulls in just the right places, and an ending that granted, makes me ask for more, but I could put it down and be happy with no sequel (I can't stand ambiguous endings). I really grew on the characters, so I was hoping that she'd continue with them, but that doesn't seem to be her style.All in all, a great read for a fantasy lover, especially if you aren't ready to pick up a new series yet.EDIT* Just found out there will be a sequel to this! I wasn't expecting this, so maybe thats why I'm so excited. It's called Raven's Strike, and it comes out July 26th, 2005 straight into paperback. Thought I'd let you know ;)"},{"Title":"Raven's Shadow (The Raven Duology, Book 1)","review":"This book is set in a universe filled with magic, where magic is (like Mideaval Europe) mainly mistrusted and magicians often killed by mistrustful villagers. The beginning of the book introduces two main characters (soldier Tier & mage Seraph), neither of whom wants to spend their life doing what their societies think they should. Rejecting what they are supposed to do with their lives, they marry and attempt to spend the rest of their lives as simple farmers. Well, fate has other plans in store.This is an ejoyable book. There is a bit of a glitch (writing wise) in the middle, where the the book changes focus and hops around several new characters' point of view for awhile. Still, the overall book hangs together and the primary characters' plots come to a satisfactory conclusion."},{"Title":"Raven's Shadow (The Raven Duology, Book 1)","review":"Briggs has managed to produce another intriguing novel with well developed characters. After ten years of fighting in the war, Tier is on his way home. He snuck away at the tender age of sixteen and is unsure of his welcome at the bakery. In a small down along the way he comes across a Traveler being burned on a pier. Upon entering the local tavern, he observes a second traveler about to be sold or burn and decides to step in and save the young life. He places himself as the young girl's protector even against his own family who do not welcome her with open arms. And this is where Briggs earns her four stars instead of five. She skips twenty years in the future. She literally gets you deeply interested in the lives of young Tier and Sereph and then moves them on to an old married couple with teenage children. I would have loved reading more about how they fall in love. What they had to endure in a world that would look upon the mixed marriage with disappoval. Briggs does include a few flashbacks to their early marriage. The story of the two teenage sons and one daughter is also wonderful. They are interesting and unique characters; so the book is enjoyable regardless. I think you would find it well worth your time."},{"Title":"Raven's Shadow (The Raven Duology, Book 1)","review":"Ravens Shadow, Patricia Briggs, Ace Books New YorkBook Review\\"Do you believe in magic?\\" I did after I read Ravens Shadow by Patricia Briggs. This book is about a soldier named Tier who is returning from the war and meets a traveler named Seraph. Tier and Seraph travel back to Redern Tier's hometown. Tier is welcomed there but Seraph is not. So to save Seraph from being executed, Tier makes the decision to marry Seraph. They start a farm a couple minutes away from Redern and raise a family there. They have three children Jes, Lehr, and Rinnie. One winter Tier goes trapping and gets kidnapped along the way. Seraph eventually finds out and must go to Taela, the capital city, to rescue Tier and save her family. Along the way Seraph meets many friends including Phoran the 27th, the clan of Rongier the Librarian, and Hennea a sole traveler such as Seraph is. This book is full of wonderful adventures, lots of magic, and many climaxes.There are many characters in this book. Seraph is a traveler, a person who travels and protects non travelers from danger. She is the sole survivor from her traveler clan of Isolda the Silent. She is a raven, which is an order of traveler status that makes her a traveler wizard. She is very stubborn, headstrong, and intelligent, all which help her on her journey to rescue Tier. Seraph is important to this story because she adds a lot of excitement, fun, and her own taste of magic. Tier is also an order bearer, though he is not a traveler. Tier is an owl also known as a bard. He is very good with people and is a good singer. Tier is also very intelligent but is calm and patient unlike Seraph. He is important to this story because although he is held hostage he plays a big role. Both of these characters are believable because I can relate to them in some way or another.This book is definitely fantasy because of all the magic and types of creatures in it. I would recommend this book to Middle through High schoolers. I would rate this book a 9 out of 10. I would rate it this because it has lots of magic and exciting battles in it. This book will keep you reading because it is bubbling with interest all the way to the top. Patricia Briggs came up with many new twists and turns throughout the book so that your attention will surely be held, mine was. If you read this book I will guarantee it will make you believe in magic too."},{"Title":"Raven's Shadow (The Raven Duology, Book 1)","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this book, until I got to the end. This is apparently the first volume in a multi-book story. The author left a major plot element unresolved at the end. I wouldn't have minded this if the book had had some sort of warning on the cover, such as &quot;Book 1 of the Shadowed Lands series&quot;. I dropped my rating by a star because of this lack of information.Other than the unresolved plot element, I found this book to be very readable and engrossing. I highly recommend it, though with the caveat that it's not the complete story."},{"Title":"Raven's Shadow (The Raven Duology, Book 1)","review":"Bottom Line: Try before you buyI've read all of the book in the Mercy series by Briggs. So, I ordered this book, along with Briggs 'Steal the Dragon' because I figure you find an author you like, order their other works...can't go wrong, right?Wrong. I found the quality of writing and quality of story somewhat lacking in this series, compared directly to the Mercy series.It's hard, if not impossible to read several books by the same author and not compare them to each other.I also found the lack of depth to the foundation of the magic (the explanation of magic, background, etc.) as it relates to the story, well...basic. I wanted to be blown away by this other world the author created, intrigued by the magic, wowed by the variety of characters. And everything seemed, just okay.I'd recommend the Mercy series by the same author much more than this book.Or if you want fantasy adventure, The Blade Itself, Winterbirth, Boderlands series by Lorna Freeman, Cal Leandros series by Rob Thurman."},{"Title":"Raven's Shadow (The Raven Duology, Book 1)","review":"After nine years of fighting the Shadowed, a powerful wizard and his armies, Tier is coming home. When he stays at an inn he saves the life of a Traveler, a powerful mage in a land that hates people who use magic. When they arrive at his village, he marries the mage Seraph and they start out their married life farming a piece of land nobody else would touch. They have three children all of whom have different Talents and they are relatively happy until Tier doesn't return home after a season of trapping.The leaders of the village tell her Tier is dead but when she and her children investigate the remains, they are magically able to ascertain that the burned body is not Seraph's husband. After fighting a priest and her brother in law who is Shadowed, she learns that her husband was taken to the Emperor's palace in Taela by the Secret Path, a shadow organization of second and third sons who strip the powers of the Talented and use it for their own purposes. Seraph, with the help of other Travelers intends to free her husband but when she arrives at the palace, Tier informs her they must break the power of the Secret Path in order to save the Empire from their behind the scenes rule.Patricia Briggs is a talented storyteller who enchants her audience with a spellbinding tale. The people who are shadowed are open to the Stalker, an evil entity created by the wizards of Colossae. The few wizards who survived the destruction of the city, a necessary actin needed to bind the Stalker so he won't destroy the human race are sent out into the world as Travelers to fight the evil entities that the Stalker leaks into the world. Saraph, who for two decades, led a normal life, realizes she must fight the Shadowed that is loose in the world in order to avoid another war. This courageous character is only one of the reason's Raven's Shadow is going on this reviewer's keeper shelf.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Raven's Shadow (The Raven Duology, Book 1)","review":"The tone, the plot, the charcters, the setting...all orginal as far in as I can see. The characters, the most important element in a story, besides originality, are so well developed, and I cried with them, laughed with them, and loved them. The tale was enchanting and different, and even though it isn't a masterpiece, probably like 4.5 stars, its good enough to be a must read by anyone who likes magic and animals, heroes, and unique places and scenes, and love stories... read this book, it's where you'll find it all. (Recomended to all shapeshifting animal lovers with a flare for meeting gentlemanlike characters.)I am now looking forward to all of Briggs' novels, and hope that after you read Raven's Shadow (a truly marevlous work) you will too!"},{"Title":"Raven's Shadow (The Raven Duology, Book 1)","review":"This book was so gripping and I couldn't put it down!

My intrigued kicked into high gear almost exactly at halfway through the book, then went into overdrive shortly thereafter. I really enjoyed the story, but it pales in comparison to Briggs' Mercy and Anna-Charles books. I'm wondering if it's because the wolf stuff is written in first person, and Raven's Shadow and Hob's Bargain are written in 3rd?Oh well, I'll ponder this as I read another Briggs novel in anticipation of Bone Crossed."},{"Title":"Raven's Shadow (The Raven Duology, Book 1)","review":"Although I haven't finished reading the novel I think I can venture an opinion.Raven's shadow was suggested to me by Amazon and since it got such good reviews I bought it. This is the first time I read a book by Patricia Briggs.I have to say that I am a bit disappointed.The story is rather simple. Instead of a complex weave with many layers and colours like is case for example with George RR Martin or Steven Erikson, one is presented with a rather simplistic picture in few colours, if you catch my drift :)The story is interesting and the author is innovative and original, unquestionably an impressive storyteller. Unfortunately, that's not enough for me. I want more. I want some real craftmanship when it comes to writing, I want a gripping story with fascinating characters, I want to wonder about their destinies and care what happens to them. This is not the case with Brigg's book. I never had any difficulty in putting it down and it wouldn't bother me in the least to let it keep for a long time before picking it up again. I do want to know how the story ends but if I lost the book and couldn't find out it wouldn't be a big loss.She has a way with creating interesting characters but I feel they could be more fully fleshed out.Someone mentioned in another review an age group this book was appropriate for and that got me thinking. I think that's a good point; this book would perhaps fit best for younger audiences. As such, it deserves more than the 3 stars.I'm not sure I'll read more books by Briggs, not unless the writing has changed quite a bit and grown more mature and complex.So, all in all, Raven's Shadow is an ok read but nothing more. Nothing memorable and not a page-turner."},{"Title":"Raven's Shadow (The Raven Duology, Book 1)","review":"A strong young Traveler is rescued from her life of duty and obligation by a handsome young man with no magic.

The foreword is by Ellis Peters, who discusses how she created the Cadfael character.Many of these stories were written specifically for this volume. Unfortunately, quite a few of these stories aren't very good. Often, the historical setting has nothing to do with the mystery, and is just used to set up the MacGuffin. Furthermore, the majority of these stories are not ones where the reader can follow along and guess at the culprit. Rather, it seems that many authors were more interested in thinking of ridiculous scenarios, which their protagonists would then explain.There is a great proliferation here of authors using both other authors' characters and real historical figures. Poe's Dupin and Doyle's Holmes appear here in stories from other authors, and other detectives include Leonardo da Vinci, Poe himself, and William Shakespeare.There are a couple of good stories here, and some good authors, but a great many of the stories in this volume aren't particularly interesting. I suppose they can't all be Cadfael."},{"Title":"The Mammoth Book of NEW Historical Whodunits","review":"For history buffs this is a well researched book of short stories.

Partially it was that many of the stories were closer to horror than whodunits. Partially it was because many of the stories featured real historical characters, which I dislike. I've liked enough of Ashley's work that I won't quit reading because of this one, but I'm glad this wasn't the first collection of his that I read."},{"Title":"The Mammoth Book of NEW Historical Whodunits","review":"The Mammoth Book of Historical WhodunitsUsed book but in excellent shape.

She consults on the case of Shirley Foster, an art teacher at the University of Georgia in Athens, who has been missing for four years, and very quickly guides the authorities to a grave site on the Foster family's property. After Lindsay helps identify the remains as Foster's, she believes her part in the case is over, but events prove otherwise. In the meantime, her brother Sinjin appears for a visit, bringing some crates that had been stored on the archeologist grandfather's property. Filled with Native American artifacts of mysterious provenance, the crates also yield a skeleton wearing a shirt and tie. Could Lindsay's grandfather have been involved in both artifact smuggling and murder? When the artifacts disappear, the puzzle deepens. In Connor's latest multifaceted tale, the plot is serpentine, the solution ingenious, the academic poli! ! tics vicious, and Lindsay is appealing. Although the dialogue occasionally is stilted and transitions are sometimes abrupt, this entertaining mystery is as chock-full of engrossing anthropological and archeological detail as a newly discovered burial mound. Publishers Weekly (June 22, 1998)"},{"Title":"Dressed to Die: A Lindsay Chamberlain Novel (Lindsay Chamberlain Mysteries)","review":"This is the third in the Lindsay Chamberlain series, and it's a good one. These books are very well-written indeed. Connor's characters are real, and she keeps the tension going right up until the end. Plus we always hear fascinating anthropological lore. The puzzles are hard to figure out as well. I was kept in suspense as to the identity of the murderer right up until the end. Lindsay is a very likeable and human protagonist. She has human foibles and human insecurities, but she is also intelligent and not afraid to stand up for herself. In this book Lindsay is tracking what appears to be about three or four different storylines, and she realizes that she is being set up to take the fall for at least one of them. When artifacts disappear from her floor, she realizes that someone is trying to fit her up for it. And people keep dying (both in the past and present). She needs to figure out everything quickly. I really am enjoying this series."},{"Title":"Cacas: The Encyclopedia of Poo","review":"This is certainly a coffee table book that will break the ice and get people talking, but perhaps not the best thing to read while eating chocolate bon-bons, fudge, or dark stew.While it calls itself an encyclopedia, this is far from accurate. My high rating is for the superb studio photography and detail for each sample... but it loses a couple of stars on a number of fronts. The only readers of this book will be people, but people poo is hardly covered in detail. Why not a number of shots of different colors, shapes and sizes, describing what causes the various colors in each sample?Then, on common pets such as cats and dogs, why not a variety there, to help diagnose illness?It would seem that the authors could not decide whether this would be a commentary, a compendium or a comedy. The &quot;s-word&quot; and other colorful metaphors are used profusely for the sake of shock value, rather than for informative purposes. It's shocking to see such a nicely prepared volume with what appears to be such unprofessional language. It's not funny enough to be funny and not serious enough to be taken seriously.It is interesting to see droppings from giraffes, monkeys, etc., but some of the animals mentioned are animals I have never heard of - and no picture of the animal itself is displayed.This unusually themed book had a lot more potential than was reached by the authors. This is NOT a book for children, due to the comments in the book, but for kids who can't read, it might be a hoot at story time.For the aspiring yet-to-be-published writer, this will certainly be an inspiration - if this poo can be published, than the world is your oyster."},{"Title":"Cacas: The Encyclopedia of Poo","review":"Colors Magazine and Toscani (formerly of Colors) have always been infamous for brewing trouble via their editorial content.

But if you actually take the time to read the stories about &quot;poo&quot; from around the world you begin to find some really interesting content. In fact, the stories are what saves the book from being a cheap visual prank on the viewers eyes.I also like the fact that each photograph of &quot;poo&quot; is labelled with the animal it came from (including humans).If you can stomach such a book, I think it's a subject worthy of reading and digesting."},{"Title":"Cacas: The Encyclopedia of Poo","review":"Everything you ever wanted NOT to know. Actually not quite true because it is rather thin on the medical side of poo (illnesses and hospitals etc) and maybe that's a good thing too. Produced by the folks from \`Colors' magazine (The United Colors of Benetton) this nicely designed book is full of one paragraph items, written in a straightforward style and thankfully avoiding any euphemisms. The editors must have wondered how on earth they were going to illustrate it? The neat solution was to get photographer Marirosa Ballo to train his lens on sixty-seven samples of animal droppings, reproduced here as cut-outs on the white page, nicely done too. Needless to say they vary enormously depending on the animals diet and lifestyle.This quirky title is another addition to my (slowly) expanding shelf of bizarre books, it already has \`A Handbook on Hanging' by Charles Duff (London 1928) \`Frog Raising for Pleasure and Profit' by Albert Broel (New Orleans 1937) and \`Car Crashes' by Mell Kilpatrick (Koln 2000) this last book is from the same publisher as 'Cacas'."},{"Title":"Cacas: The Encyclopedia of Poo","review":"When I received this book as part of a Christmas gift, I had to wonder what the sender was trying to say to me.

The last borrower didn't return it. Despite my hopes that it would be available on CD, I am still so pleased with the quality of the stories and the talents of both writers and readers that I will find a way to listen. These are 8 more stories from the Texas Bound series (I confess to liking the first collection best), and the stories are of the higest quality, although some are a bit less light hearted, grittier than the first series. They are true pictures of Texans, even though some stories take place elsewhere. No matter the situation or location, the essential nature of the Texan comes through over everything else. You might be surprised to learn who some of these Texans are. Overall, this is an excellent collection, and since it is short stories, one may listen to it on the way to work without being left hanging pulling into the parking garage. The entire collection of books and tapes is an essential addition to anyone's library, Texan or not, if one claims to have any literary discrimination at all. Or just if you like a well-written story.

Though I think it's the Fifth in the actually series over all. After having read PROMISED TO A SHEIK I am now very anxious to read the rest.The story of the invisible twin taking the place of the more popular and outgoing twin may be one I have seen over and over in Romances but it takes a nice twist in this story as she actually marries the man before telling him who she is. None of this is a surprise if you read the back cover. Two twins with the same first name of Elizabeth have been writing to Sheik Omar. When Fiona gets bored, as she has a tendency to do, Cara, the shy invisible twin, takes over the letter writing. In the process pours her heart and soul out to a man that she is highly infatuate led with and has been since the cotillion several years before. So begins the courtship of Cara and Omar. Only the problem occurs when Omar arrives to propose to Cara.This is a sweet and tender story that I thoroughly enjoyed. Not only will I be reading the rest of the Lone Star series but I hope to grab some of this authors other works.Side note if you intend to read only this book there are several references to characters that flow through out the series. Having read the last book first I knew the characters but I felt those who had not read the series might find it a little jarring in the mist of Cara and Omar's story."},{"Title":"Promised To A Sheik (Lone Star Country Club (Unnumbered))","review":"Enjoyable reading... and very much linked to the series (Lone Star Country Club)."},{"Title":"Promised To A Sheik (Lone Star Country Club (Unnumbered))","review":"I'm into sheik romances right now.

What I didn't expect was the soap opera stories that are inserted with this story. Thankfully, they are at various ends of chapters and can be skipped over without losing the story of Omar and Cara in anyway. But, if you like the soap opera thing, then please read on!

It was packed with very interesting information and pictures. The author did a great job in putting this book together. I thought that the information in this book was accurate when compared to the information from other books I've read, such as Luftwaffe Fighter Aces by Mike Spick and Jagdgeschwader 26: Top Guns of the Luftwaffe by Donald Caldwell. I enjoy the entire series of Luftwaffe at War books to which this book belongs. I own 7 of the 10 and find them all equally informative. This book points out details in the aircraft and gives information on the pilots who flew them. However this book does use terms that a person, who has not read books peviously about the Luftwaffe, would not completely understand. I would strongly encourage anyone who is interested in History, aircraft, or the Luftwaffe to purchase and/or read this outstanding book."},{"Title":"The talking T.

Fans of P.J. Farmer are familiar with his fascinating attempts to meld canonical fantasy/horror figures with a more current perspective, while throwing in kinky sex and a strong sci-fi overlay. This is a &quot;textbook&quot; example. The protagonist is Harold Childe, a private detective in what appears to be 1980's Los Angeles. He doesn't know it, but &quot;Childe Harold&quot; is the re-incarnation of Geoge Gordon, Lord Byron, the sexually irrepressible English Romantic poet. The book opens with Harold and a high-ranking LAPD official watching a film that has been sent to them; the film depicts, in horrifying detail, the mutilation/murder of a buddy of Harold's. The victim is tied down, an attractive young woman fellates him, and then she slips in a razor-sharp metal mothpiece and bites off the victim's penis, while a male accomplice clad in a Dracula costume looks on. (This scene, redolent of every male's castration nightmares, horrified me as an adolescent; but Farmer, because of his innate skill as a writer, manages to bring it off in a way that is not ludicrous or hackneyed, but rather, for lack of a better term, &quot;gripping&quot; despite its horrific nature.) From there, the story follows Harold's attempts to discover who or what murdered his friend. In the process, Harold encounters a variety of sleazy Hollywood creatures who are not what they seem, including a slutty actress who has a creature living inside her vagina, and that creature turns out to be the re-incarnation of the medieval French general and sadist, Gilles de Railles. (Weird??? Hell, yeah!) Eventually, Harold discovers that this motley gallery of semi-human monsters have extra-terestrial origins, like himself, and that he is the &quot;Captain&quot; for whom they have long waited , to lead them back to their origin in the stars. I've given away entirely too much, but what I found compelling about this book was that Farmer takes a subject matter that lends itself to absurdity and parody, but creates something strong and distinctive, through his own inimitable dark word-craft. Not what you'd necessarily expect from the author of the &quot;Riverworld&quot; series, but certainly intriguing."},{"Title":"The Image of the Beast (An Exorcism: Ritual I)","review":"This is, without a doubt, the strangest book I've ever read. Having written the above, I feel compelled to add that &quot;strange&quot; is a criminal understatement and that no amount of extreme adjectives can do justice to this book. The copy I have is coupled with &quot;Blown,&quot; the completion of the story begun with &quot;Image of the Beast.&quot; I made the mistake of reading this when I was sick a few years back, unable to do anything, feeling as though I was on my deathbed, and soon feared that this hellish, disturbing, nightmare-inducing, stomach-turning THING was the last thing I would ever read. I think it actually made me sicker.Don't take all of the above as a dismissal, though. I've never taken the time to really pick apart the mechanism that makes this book run (I don't have that strong of a stomach), but there is something underneath all the horror and sex and violence that just pulls you along. Farmer takes the sexual themes of some of his earlier works and goes waaaaaaay over the top with them. It really messes with you in a number of different ways.Fans of the Riverworld series and some of Farmer's other novels should be warned about this book before reading it. Although it has a number of elements that are representative of some of his major themes, it is like nothing else he has ever written. Nothing can prepare you for reading this, and once you've read it, you'll never be able to forget it."},{"Title":"The Image of the Beast (An Exorcism: Ritual I)","review":"I am an avid sci fi reader who only occasionally takes the plunge to read in the horror genre. While I loved Farmer's Riverworld, I went on to read Image Of the Beast - only to discover a demented twisted world which even 20 years later is still the subject of my occasional nightmare. I have never read or seen anything half as horribly stomach-turning as this story and am continually surprised it has not been made into a horror movie yet. For those who seek horror filled stories, I'm sure you will enjoy this. But take warning! This is not for the meek of heart."},{"Title":"The Image of the Beast (An Exorcism: Ritual I)","review":"Though I read the 1979 Playboy Press edition of IMAGE OF THE BEAST, which was merged with its sequel BLOWN, and though I published my review for it on its page, I am also publishing my review here on the pages for the newer 2007 edition. I believe there is no change in the story's text. The Book Description for the 2007 edition says that BLOWN is included. The 2007 edition has only 255 pages, compared to 336 in the 1979 edition, but the 2007 paperback has bigger dimensions. If you have the 2007 edition, check the last sentence (it will not spoil the story). If it reads, \\"Could Dr. Jekyll get rid of Mr. Hyde?\\", then you do have the full story, including both IMAGE OF THE BEAST and BLOWN.IMAGE OF THE BEAST (merged in this volume with its sequel BLOWN) is a blend of horror and science fiction. Be advised that the explicit sex will cause some readers to consider the book pornographic. To an extent, the explicitness is necessary for the author to generate appropriate atmosphere. But, as fond as I am of Philip Jos&eacute; Farmer, he goes beyond that here, an excess that proves boring. Only intermittently, however; so I lower my rating by only one star.If you skim through the sex (or if you don't mind it), the plot is absorbing and the pace moves forward briskly. In Los Angeles in the 1970s, the hero Herald Childe is with a group of policemen as they view a home video of a sexy, very bloody, and very unusual homicide. Childe is a private detective, and the victim is his partner. Because the L.A. basin is beset with successive disasters of smog and flood, and because evidence is so scanty, manpower shortage compels the police department to allow Childe to investigate the murder on his own.He encounters werewolves, a vampire, and other weird creatures. But if you are a science fiction fan who has no taste for horror, be patient. Eventually the story moves toward science fiction. That is, a sort of schlocky science fiction, closer to Edgar Rice Burroughs than Arthur C. Clarke.Forrest J Ackerman, a real-life person, plays a supporting role in the story. So much so that I suppose Farmer knew him well enough to avoid any civil litigation. Check out Ackerman's biography at the Internet's Wikipedia. Though IMAGE OF THE BEAST gives us a good number of other colorful characters, none are given in depth. This was typical of Farmer, who wrote short novels with the flair of a master of pulp fiction."},{"Title":"The Image of the Beast (An Exorcism: Ritual I)","review":"It is good to know it is possible to be surprised by Philip Jose Farmer."},{"Title":"The Image of the Beast (An Exorcism: Ritual I)","review":"Farmer had two mixed genre pornographic novels that I'm aware of. &quot;A Feast Unknown&quot; pitted Doc Savage against Tarzan in a mildly pornographic fight to the death. &quot;Image of the Beast,&quot; with its title from the Book of Revelation, is a nicely pornographic gothic novel with an interweaving of bad science-fiction overtones. &quot;Blown,&quot; the sequel, rather ruins the effect of the main novel, actually. Farmer's imagination ruins his art in the sequel. I've known several people who found the more sadistic scenes in &quot;Image&quot; to be arousing."},{"Title":"This Meager Nature: Landscape and National Identity in Imperial Russia","review":"Ely's elegant prose drew this reader, who knows little of Russia, into a new landscape and illuminated the ways it was seen (and not seen) by its nineteenth century inhabitants. Although I was familiar with references to the Russian landscape in literature, I knew nothing of the Russian landscape painters of the nineteenth century. Ely introduces this fascinating subject and guides one through the work of such painters as Shishkin and Vasil'ev (with fine illustrations) to an appreciation of the way they saw and painted their native land. He then links this to a developing sense of national identity in the Russia of this period.I was particularly interested in what this suggests about the role of a nation's landscape in its national myth, in the role it plays as a source of common pride in one's country and the ways we choose to portray specific features of our landscape to ourselves.A good read from start to finish."},{"Title":"Enchiridion (Dover Thrift Editions)","review":"When I was in fifth grade after a difficult day of injustice and strife, my father gave me the Enchiridion to read.

The Enchiridion, for me at least, helped unlock parts of the gospel of Christ that I was stumbling over, and I finally started to let go of the past. The Enchiridion helped me live and implement Christian beliefs at a more practical level.The Enchiridion, and at least 3 of its translations, including this one (year 1888), are old enough to be in the public domain.

Essentially, I expected something along the lines of Marcus Aurelius and the general Stoic flavor: sustine et abstine (yes, I know these are Epictetus's own words), a dry and dispassionate \\"faith\\", constant struggle with passions etc. But, the overall impression is quite different from the expected: Epictetus's worldview seems to be a rather disjointed \\"unity\\" of at least two visions of the life and nature. One is \\"Stoic by the book\\" mindset: apathia, commiseration, general humanism and cosmopolitanism, heroic struggle with baser aspects of the self and similar stuff. But, it seems to me that virtually all scholars have overlooked another, actually dominant strain: the monotheistic mysticism similar to the vision of the Corpus Hermeticum. Ecstatic utterences of Epictetus, his fiery devotion to God, his deep conviction that immortal part of anyone's being will after death enjoy the company of the Good that is God; daimon or genius (Guardian spirit)- not unlike Upanishadic Atman or Hermetic Nous, the vision of the world like banquet or festival- all this points to, one might call it, \\"optimistic Gnosis\\". In short, I have found that the most powerful part of Epictetus work bears more similarity with sayings of Christian and Sufi mystics, or the Hermetic-Gnostic exuberant call \\"Ye are gods\\" - than with dry Seneca's admonitions or frequently cold wisdom of Marcus Aurelius. Probably it depends on one's temperament which face of Janus-like Epictetus will appear to be his true stance: the quintessentially Stoic sober and humane ethicist or the intoxicated, almost Upanishadic mystic who rapturously affirms both God and world. Since we are, willy-nilly, eclectics by temperament and general disposition, I suspect that Epictetus had been one of us- swinging between \\"yea\\" and \\"nay\\" to our earthly Odyssey."},{"Title":"Enchiridion (Dover Thrift Editions)","review":"I Didn't know what to expect with this volume, but this edition was a little too bare bones.

Excellent review of the work and the author."},{"Title":"Enchiridion (Dover Thrift Editions)","review":"Epictetus's &quot;Enchiridion&quot; (&quot;The Manual&quot;) is a book about living as a stoic. This book was used as a manual for Roman Centurions and has influenced the lives of many ancient and modern people. It teaches you to deal with hardships and the dissappointments that one encounters in daily life. The stoic philosophy from the Enchiridion helped people like VADM James Stockdale deal with years of captivity in a North Vietnamese prison camp. Basically, the idea behind stoicism is that people can achieve virtue and excellence by concentrating their efforts on what they can control and being indifferent to what they cannot. Unlike Epicurianism, stoicism holds that people are supremely reasonable and that happiness is the result of virtue, honor and conformity to the way of the world. This philosophy was respected by early Christians, and emperors like Marcus Aurelius (The old king in the movie &quot;Gladiator&quot; and a stoic philosopher himself). The translation by George Long is second to none. This book is a valuble handbook for life in modern times and with only 43 pages, it is densely packed with simple ideas for being a better person. I have read it over a dozen times and each time I learn something else about myself and about life. It is a particularly valuble philosophy for members of the military because it explains how to gain control despite overwhelming odds and lack of personal authority.

While this is somewhat true, it is a blindered view of what a Stoic aspires to. Epictetus was a freed slave, apparently born sometime during the middle of the first century. He became the leading teacher of Stoicism and an immense [though indirect] influence upon the emperor Marcus Aurelius, the closest the world has ever come to having a &quot;philosopher-king.&quot; The Enchiridion is a &quot;digest,&quot; a sampling of the heart of Epictetus' teaching, which must not be thought of as Epictetus' own ideas, but rather as his embodiment and distillation of the &quot;truths&quot; of Stoicism as brought forward over several centuries to his day. His aim was to live a life, and to teach his students to live a life, of calm and peace and happiness, in which outward events, no matter how hideous, cannot disturb. In this, he was similar to the Buddha, teaching his students to rise toward nirvana. The basic principle of Stoic philosophy, as maintained by Epictetus, was simple: we, as human beings, control only our responses to what happens around us: we cannot control events; we cannot make others do what we wish; we cannot even control whether we get sick or not: we CAN control how we react toward events, and it is toward this that we should direct our efforts. The Enchiridion is a wonderful book, a soothing balm, a great place to begin: read it slowly; think about how its teachings can be applied to your daily situation; then strive to apply them. When you feel that you have a good grasp of the Enchiridion, THEN go on to the Discourses. Stoicism is not a matter of learning &quot;doctrines&quot; or &quot;dogmas&quot;: it is a matter of bringing your spirit into line--a goal to strive toward, without ever truly reaching it. The Buddha believed that all life is suffering, and that we must learn how to transcend that suffering. Epictetus' view of the world is more positive: life contains both good and bad, but we must learn how to control our reactions to both. His teachings are a manual for the striver"},{"Title":"Enchiridion (Dover Thrift Editions)","review":"Epictetus concerned himself with finding the satisfying life - not the happiest or richest, but the life filled with treasures that can never be taken away. His disciple, Arrian, collected his wisdom, and distilled it down into this booklet of aphorisms.The essence is simple: \\"No man is free who is not master of himself.\\" In part, that is because the self is all anyone can truly own. Everything else is under the control of others, of the state, or finally of the gods. Happiness based on what can be taken away is a flimsy sort of thing, and fighting the will of the gods is futile.Still, this isn't about ascetic self-denial. There are pleasures to be had in the world. If there is wine, enjoy it, remembering that excess is hardly enjoyable. Enjoy the loves in your life, without becoming slave to them. He also recommends reticence in most matters, since so few are under one's control, and since foolishness is easier to speak than wisdom. These thoughts are as effective in today's life as they were two thousand years ago.//wiredweird"},{"Title":"Enchiridion (Dover Thrift Editions)","review":"The Enchiridion is the bridge between the old radical schools of Stoicism in the tradition of Zeno of Citium which taught to deny desire and defeat emotion to achieve 'eudaimonia' (excellence in temper) and the late era Stoicism which teaches us not to defeat emotion and desire but simply not to let it dominate prudent judgments, decisions and actions.Epictetus' Stoic philosophy is a practical philosophy for life that focuses on understanding what causes us grief in our life and then detaching ourselves from that grief; removing from our lives unnecesary pains. The Enchiridion offers insightful and straightforward wisdom on how to endure misfortune by developing character and apatheia (clear judgment) by training ourselves in the Socratic lifestyle. The four cardinal virtues of such a lifestyle are sophrosyne (temperance/self-control), dikaiosyne (justice/righteousness/honesty/authenticity), sophia (prudence/wisdom), and andreia (fortitude/courage). When we dedicate our lives in the pursuit of virtue and not in the pursuit of gratifying our emotions, not only do we fulfill our duty within nature in achieving harmony amidst the community and earth but we also find how meaningless a good deal of the constant bickering, drama, dishonesty and insincerity of the mob really is.A Stoic philosopher removes himself from addictions, a life centered around sex, inauthenticity, falsity, selfishness and actions which would unbalance the natural order or damage the community. At the heart of the Epictetus' philosophy is a sort of civic virtue that transcends nations and borders:\\"If what philosophers say of the kinship of God and Men be true, what remains for men to do but as Socrates did:--never, when asked one's country, to answer, 'I am an Athenian or a Corinthian,' but 'I am a citizen of the world.'\\"A Stoic looks beyond silly and proud displays of nationalism and instead accepts everyone for what they are, while striving to attain righteousness within himself. Stoics were the first philosophers to detest slavery. For Epictetus slavery is a thing which only occurs in the mind, when we allow ourselves to become a slave mentally. In fact all misfortunes are illusory things which only become misfortunate when we define them as being such. The core of the Stoic philosophy of the Enchiridion is realizing that nothing bad can happen to us, that we have no control over external things, and can only be concerned with controlling our own actions, decisions and judgments.If we are not in control ourselves, we are a slave. For Epictetus, who was a slave before being a Roman-era Socrates, slavery is a mindset. We can maintain our diginity, charm, cheerfulness and character in the face of any disaster. He offers a interesting proposition: surely we would be angered if someone tried to control our body like a puppet, so why do we so easily hand our mind over to others when we are angered, in love or jealous? For Epictetus everything must be accounted for - and there is no physical circumstance, including death, which is unfortunate. In this we see a sort of proto-nihilism in the vein of Heraclitus - who was a heavy influence on the Stoics. Although Epictetus and the later Marcus Aurelius acknowledge a inpersonal divine force and logic manifesting itself behind all things (the Logos), they never presume that God has any influence in the roll of events and for all intents and purposes, suggest living as if this matter before us, shifting every constantly, is the only consideration. This nihilistic view which is within the Enchiridion is perfectly summed up in Marcus Aurelius' Meditations:\\"Like seeing roasted meat and other dishes in front of you and suddenly realizing: This is a dead fish. A dead bird. A dead pig. Or that this noble vintage is grape juice., and the purple robes are sheep wool dyed with shellfish blood. Or making love - something rubbing against your penis, a brief seizure and a little cloudy liquid.Perceptions like that - latching onto things and piercing through them, so we see what they really are. That's what we need to do all the time - all through our lives when things lay claim to our trust- to lay them bare and see how pointless they are, to strip away the legend that encrusts them.\\"When we understand the innate nature of things, which is nihilism (without any innate meaning), we can begin to avoid having our mind disturbed when they are changed or destroyed, for change is the only persistent nature of existence. How can we be disturbed when our favorite jug is destroyed, Epictetus proposes, if it is simply a piece of clay that we had no control over in the first place? We have control over nothing external, even our own bodies and immediate possessions. We only have control over our judgments, actions, decisions and how we decide to temper our lives with reason and logic. Agony occurs when we attempt to control what is not within our power to control (anything external to the mind) or when we expect external things to act in certain ways. We can only expect ourselves to act in a certain fashion.Epictetus even says that we should not be disturbed when our wife or child dies - the person hasn't died, just the body, something we have no true control over. We have to evaluate why exactly we are being disturbed: because we will miss what they brought to our lives OR because they have gone to glory? The former is a greedy and irrational judgment, the latter should bring us no disturbance, but only joy, in the passing of the body and its rejoining of nature. How are we to ever presuppose what happens after death? For a Stoic this is entirely unimportant, the only thing that matters is a nihilistic philosophy of realism, attending to the matter at hand, as virtously as possible, as well as possible, and leaving the rest up to Fate, blaming no one, forever remaining generous of character, valuing friendship and maintaining our charm, charisma and apatheia (clear judgment) in the face of great disaster and misfortune.Before this review is concluded I will showcase one quote that I believe is the quintessence of the Enchiridon and all Stoic philosophy. What Epictetus is about to say is also the quintessence of a Socratic life - one based on actions, not pretention and not words:\\"Never call yourself a philosopher, nor talk a great deal among the unlearned about theorems, but act conformably to them. Thus, at an entertainment, don't talk how persons ought to eat, but eat as you ought. For remember that in this manner Socrates also universally avoided all ostentation. And when persons came to him and desired to be recommended by him to philosophers, he took and recommended them, so well did he bear being overlooked. So that if ever any talk should happen among the unlearned concerning philosophic theorems, be you, for the most part, silent. For there is great danger in immediately throwing out what you have not digested. And, if anyone tells you that you know nothing, and you are not nettled at it, then you may be sure that you have begun your business. For sheep don't throw up the grass to show the shepherds how much they have eaten; but, inwardly digesting their food, they outwardly produce wool and milk. Thus, therefore, do you likewise not show theorems to the unlearned, but the actions produced by them after they have been digested.\\"- Epictetus"},{"Title":"Enchiridion (Dover Thrift Editions)","review":"this is a book that should be on everyone's nightstand. it offers clear perspectives on how to live. by releasing yourself of what you cannot control; by controlling that which is in your power, you will lead a happy live. this book is so simple in scope and so powerful in nature you will wonder why you didn't think of it yourself and thank epictetus.I am so glad that this work has survived for 2,000 years. read it and you will understand it also.this book is a must have. read it and live it."},{"Title":"Enchiridion (Dover Thrift Editions)","review":"Epictetus EnchiridionA great little book (Enchiridion means \\"handbook\\") that can be read in an hour or so-and that was precisely what Epictetus or the compiler, his student Arrian, intended. Epictetus, possibly the clearest of Stoic philosophers, provides a remarkable system of \\"dos and don'ts\\" for the seeker of wisdom. His ideas go well beyond Stoicism--I myself have heard management consultants quote his most significant idea: we should pursue things within our power and shun what is not within our power:\\"In our power are opinion, movement toward a thing, desire, aversion (turning from a thing); and in a word, what are our own acts; not in our power are the body, property, reputation, offices (magisterial power), and in a word, whatever are not our own acts.\\"If you pursue things not in your power, \\"you will be hindered, you will lament, you will be disturbed, you will blame both gods and men.\\"Doesn't that about sum up most of the world's ills? The rest of the handbook provides the details about how to carry out this most important Stoic dictum.Epictetus was a freed Roman slave born A.D. 55 in Phrygia, the Asian part of today's Turkey. With all philosophers (can't have those!) he was banned from Rome in 89 by Domitian and established his own school in Nicopolis in Greece. His student, Arrian, compiled two works, Discourses, which seems to record Epictetus' conversations with students, and this much shorter Enchiridion, or handbook, which is a kind of boiling down of the broader philosophy into principles for living.If the translation seems somewhat quaint, it's because it is. This is the mid-19th Century translation of George Long. It would have been nice of the publisher, Prometheus Books, to tell us what language Enchiridion was translated FROM. The original was written in Koine, Greek, the same language as the New Testament. Different from Classical Greek, this was the Lingua Franca of the Eastern Roman Empire."},{"Title":"Enchiridion (Dover Thrift Editions)","review":"For a small book, \\"Enchiridion\\" packs a huge punch.The trappings of life may have changed immensely since Epictetus's time, but human nature remains essentialy the same. We still all too frequently get worked up over things we cannot control, or throw our hands in the air and refuse to make changes which are plainly within our ability. This book, then, reminds us of the futility of those behaviors and the necessity, instead, for some clear-eyed realizations.Its lessons are simple but effective: some things are within our control, and some things aren't. It is foolish to get worked up over things which aren't in our control. Usually we aren't disturbed by events, but by our opinion of those events.Taken together, these and other simple lessons offer a path to serenity and peace of mind at odds with, but far more pleasant than, the myriad anxieties of modern life. As a Christian, I found it perfectly complemented Jesus' Sermon on the Mount teachings about avoiding worry and retaliation. (I happened to read it while going through a career transition, and what could have been a turbulent and traumatic experience instead went rather smoothly, without the bitterness and hard feelings one might have expected.) Still, I think people from all belief systems will find themselves richly rewarded by its teachings.This particular translation has its merits and quirks. Personally, I liked the rather brief introduction and the relative paucity of supplementary materials. Great books should stand or fall on their own merits, rather than on the blovating opinions of modern-day commentators. On the other hand, I didn't enjoy the translator's parenthetical explanations of words and phrases peppered throughout the text. They disrupted the flow of the reading and weren't always terribly necessary.Still, I can't complain, for this book appeared at exactly the right time in my life, and it came with the exact advice I needed.

I believe the lessons contained in this book take moments to learn and understand, but require a lifetime to master. I highly recommend this powerful book to anyone interested in seeing how the thoughts of one of mankind's greatest philosophers apply to life today.\\"Enchiridion\\" is organized into 52 descriptive paragraphs (chapters) that are considered the highlights of Epictetus' documented philosophical teachings. Each paragraph presented common life situations and describes how one should think and act about them.The opening lesson introduced the practice of recognizing those things in life that are and are not in our power. Those things in our power, described as, \\"such great things... through which alone happiness and freedom are secured,...\\" are our own acts, like opinion, desire, moving towards and turning from a thing. Those things not in our power, described as being slavish, subject to restraint, and in the power of others, are our bodies, property, reputation, and jobs or careers. This lesson concluded with focusing on those things within our power, and not being concerned about what is not in our power.The other great comforting lesson for me was, \\"Remember that thou art an actor in a play of such a kind as the teacher (author) may choose; if short, of a short one; if long, of a long one: if he wishes you to act the part of a poor man, see that you act the part naturally; if the part of a lame man, of a magistrate, of a private person, (do the same). For this is your duty, to act well the part that is given to you; but to select the part, belongs to another.\\"The pages of this thin book are pregnant with meaning, insights, and wisdom, and I believe it is a very positive influence in my life."},{"Title":"Enchiridion (Dover Thrift Editions)","review":"In this brief work of Stoic philosphy, Epictetus offers up good advice that's as relevant for the contemporary reader as it was for the ancient Roman.A lot of what is covered here may strike one as obvious: Don't dwell on what isn't in your power to change, and don't neglect what is; Consider the consequences of potential actions; Don't let verbal abuse get you down; Speak only when you have something to say, and when you are fairly certain that you know what you are talking about.On the other hand, some of the wise opinions expressed are either rarely a part of contemporary discourse, or are unfashionable and contradict today's commonly held beliefs. For example, Epictetus stresses taking responsibility for one's own actions and refraining from blaming one's problems on external causes. While I agree to a certain extant that many personal problems are exacerbated by societal pressures, straight-talking wisdom such as that in this book (along with the fact that an ability to apprehend non-physical social control mechanisms implies at least some independence from them) reminds us that, ultimately, we are masters of our own destinies in more ways than we often realize. This assertion is reinforced by urging the reader to accept those things which are inevitable without pointlessly judging whether they are good or bad. This may strike some readers as fatalistic acceptance of the status quo, but I think Epictetus makes it abundantly clear that we should carefully consider whether or not something is within our power and vigorously seize upon it if it is.Moderation and a measure of detachment where it is advantageous are other themes. Epictetus advises simplicity in living and avoidance of ambition to the superficial, especially at the expense of what truly makes life worthwhile: Timely advice for our greedy, plastic, pre-fab culture.While there are culturally specific curiosities here and there, this book is surprisingly relevant throughout. The fact that this volume is short and to the point should make it easy to fit into any busy schedule. In today's climate of whiny victimhood and a herd mentality across the political spectrum, it's more important than ever to cultivate an independent mind that can cut through the mind-numbing Spectacle and &quot;lay hold of the thing by that handle by which it can be borne.&quot;"},{"Title":"Enchiridion (Dover Thrift Editions)","review":"This edition by Long (one of the worst translators of ancient texts) is rendered in clumsy, graceless, sometimes bewildering English.

This isn't really a book that reads like a philosophy book, it is a series of thoughts about life and how to live it as set down by the ancient thinker Enchiridion.Enchiridion was an obvious genious and some of his thoughts may be a bit hard to follow, but his insights are timeless and the presentation of the stoic way of thinking is well done. Of course, Enchiridion does not say \\"Here is stoic philosophy in a nutshell...\\" but by carefully following his thought processes through the clips of thought presented in this short work one can grasp how a stoic must approach life.A good read.AD2"},{"Title":"Enchiridion (Dover Thrift Editions)","review":"This loosely organised treatise, supplemented with related fragments will serve those who approach in the spirit of virtue. Being ethics, it is not speculative, and is in keeping with the Stoic's emphasis on perfecting the individual through an adherence to principles demonstrated by Nature.This school of thought sees Nature as universally benificent, if one can but accept the notion that injury, famine, disase, war and natural calamities are distributed indifferently amongst men. These phemomena are all in the nature of things, that is, they are a pre-ordained script destined to repeat themselves throughout the countless cylcles of history. Events witnessed on Earth are mirrored on a universal scale. It is a universe by design, the handiwork of an omniscient force; by definition a good universe.Distinguishing between external and internal phenomena, man need only exercise his free-will upon matters which are within his control,-things of the spirit, rather than the medium of brute matter upon which is visited the aforementioned calamities. Because Nature is spirit and man is a creation of Nature, man has spirit in him. It is man's purpose to work towards a state of total spriitual being, a release from the corporeal world which is only fully realised upon death,-a dissolution of the body into its elemental parts and a freeing-up of the soul. While various Stoics and opposing schools differ in their theories of what becomes of the spirit after death(annihilation, transmigration, reabsorption by the world-soul, or an immortal individual consciousness in union with the world-soul), the guiding tenet of Epictetus and Stoicism as a rule is that what cannot be known should be of no concern to us. The same principle applies to action. All action is to be directed upon the internal; hence the common theme of asceticism pervading ethical philosophy up to the Enlightenment. What at face value appears to be a comprising fascination with bodily manipulation is merely an attempt to widen the avenue of intelligence between man's reason and that portion of the Universal Soul that is in him; simplify by reducing ennui. So while Epictetus can equate God/World-Soul/Truth/Beauty/Virtue, virtue also functions as a protocol for the man who would seek Virtue itself, the end being happiness.Many of the maxims contained in the Enchiridion are familiar to the modern reader as having passed through the countless guises of wits and wise-men throughout the ages, not to mention the homely common sense socialization of family, church and school. But Epictetus extolls a system of restraint and conduct the likes of which have not enjoyed popularity in the Unites States since the puritans. The difference lies in the Stoic pursuit of happines which brings the individual into harmony with God. To a Stoic, unity with the deity is analagous to serving or glorifying God. A puritan would consider it heretical to place the cart before the horse so to speak, having man's happiness antecendent to God's glory. Herein lies the difference between philosophy and religion. Works like the Enchiridion find their best use as springboards, motivators of minds preconditioned to seek that which the mass of men no longer do. Even so, such books do not supply the missing link between matter and spirit, that mystical jumping-off point where one's discipline finally yields -up the world in an entirely new hue. No system can guarantee happiness, nor can strength of will be accounted for in each reader. The Enchiridion is a guide to the right application of will. Compared with twenty-first century regimens aimed at personal power and financial gain it needs seem naive."},{"Title":"Enchiridion (Dover Thrift Editions)","review":"I grew up reading lots of Paul in the new testament, he always talked about having joy and acceptance in any circumstance due to a faith in Jesus.

This handbook of Epicteus is a short collection of some of his saying collected after his death. This edition appears to be collected from a public domain translation and it suffers a little from the sentence structure. I'd recommend the Hackett edition (under the title of Handbook of Epictetus), but this cheap edition does have the benefit of 150ish additional fragments, so perhaps both editions should be purchased.Long translation of #8 (Dover edition):\\"Seek not that the things which happen as you wish; but wish the things which happen to be as they are, and you will have a tranquil flow of life.\\"compared with the White translation Hackett edition):\\"Do not seek to have events happen as you want them to, but instead want them to happen as they do happen, and your life will go well\\""},{"Title":"Enchiridion (Dover Thrift Editions)","review":"I'm glad I got The Enchiridion [Illustrated] (translation by Elizabeth Carter), since the Prometheus edition appears a bit confusing at times due to Long's 19th century style.

Seems like a good translation,not choppy, easy to read. The binding is holding up fine."},{"Title":"Enchiridion (Dover Thrift Editions)","review":"Epictetus, despite being born a slave in Greece, went on to become an influential philosopher of ancient Rome. Today he is considered one of the foremost thinkers of the Stoic school of thought. His teachings were oral; he wrote no books himself. In AD 108, however, a student of his, Arrian, transcribed and collected his lectures into a multi-volume work known as the Discourses. About two decades later, shortly before the death of Epictetus, Arrian compiled another, briefer work know as the Enchiridion (a.k.a. Manual or Handbook), the purpose of which was an attempt to popularize Epictetus's teachings and gain a wider audience for Stoic thought.The Enchiridion is divided into 52 chapters or sections, most of which are less than a page long. Some are little more than aphorisms. Each section is filled with helpful pearls of wisdom applicable to facing the trials of everyday life. Stoicism advocates living one's life in accordance with nature. The only things we really have control of in life are our judgments, opinions, and desires. All else is beyond our control, and handed to us by the universe. The key to tranquility and happiness is to resign ourselves to fate and form our opinions such that we cease desiring or fearing those things which are beyond our control. It is in man's nature to be a rational animal, and it is only by using our faculty of reason that we can live up to our potential as human beings and live a life free of anger, fear, grief, frustration, and shame. The Enchiridion essentially offers a code of conduct which, when practiced, can allow us to live such a life. Modern readers can still find much use for the ethical code of living that Epictetus prescribed almost two millennia ago.As good as the Enchiridion is, it is by no means a substitute for reading the Discourses, which are the truly authoritative compendium of Epictetus's thought. The Enchiridion can be useful to two main types of readers. The first type is the reader who is curious about Stoicism, but not ready to invest the time and energy into tackling the Discourses. For this reader, the Enchiridion offers an accessible introduction to Stoic concepts. The brevity of the Enchiridion, however, requires a much more dogmatic tone--\\"You must do this. You must not do that.\\"--that may be off-putting to the newcomer. It lacks the nuance and detail that the Discourses provide in explaining these lofty goals and instructing the student in how to achieve them.The second type of reader for whom the Enchiridion will prove useful is one who has already read the Discourses. For this reader, the Enchiridion serves as a cheat sheet or crib notes to the Discourses' complicated contents. Each brief passage serves as a reminder of the lessons that were more fully covered in the more extensive work. The Enchiridion serves as an inspirational text for the disciple of reason, a simplified encapsulation of Stoic thought that can easily and frequently be consulted for ethical guidance.Regardless of your reasons for approaching the Enchiridion, you really can't go wrong in reading this brief but powerful work. For a minimal investment of your time, it just might change your life."},{"Title":"Enchiridion (Dover Thrift Editions)","review":"Not bad, Not bad....But this edition uses the word 'power' instead of 'control'.the translation in general is a bit uneccesarily convoluted and not accurate compared to other versions ive read."},{"Title":"Enchiridion (Dover Thrift Editions)","review":"It is no wonder that this book survived almost 2K years and is still being read today.

After attaining his freedom, Epictetus spent his entire career teaching philosophy and advising a daily regimen of self-examination.

In youth, it is too easy to rush through without digesting the deeper meaning (and thereby escaping much pain and wasted effort.) Here, in this slim volume is the core of Epictetus' immortal teachings, his Discourses may expand upon them, but all the essentials are outlined here.Some people dismiss these teachings as pessimistic. After all, the central message here is to learn to differentiate between what you can change and what you cannot. Most modernists will instead tell you to dream big and never say die. Then again, such critics existed in Epictetus' own day, for we are told that you can either be a philosopher or a procurator, but you cannot truly be both.Personally, I see nothing defeatist in the philosophy expressed here. At its deepest level we are being told that the ultimate goal is to make our will and God's will as one. You see, in spite of the admonition in the publisher's note that the God of the Philosopher's and the God of Judeo-Christian theology are two unrelated things, the truth is that they both touch upon the pre-existing ultimate realty of the Divine One in their own ways. The Stoic desire to conform to Nature is the perennial spiritual ideal to unite with the One and the Good. Far from being a defeat, this is the highest possible victory in life for Christian and/or Philosopher.This excellent, unabridged little Dover volume is probably the one that Epictetus would recommend. In fact, you might also want to purchase the Dover edition of MEDITATIONS by Marcus Aurelius for they are in the same spirit and make a natural set.

Which is OK for me, but might not serve the same purpose for everyone that it did for me. As for the book itself, I do not prefer this particular translation. While I believe it sticks closer to Greek original, it is sometimes hard to follow. In addition, it does not contain much additional information on phylosophy of the age or comments to the text. All in all I believe this version to be better suited for a serious phylosophy student than general public."},{"Title":"Enchiridion (Dover Thrift Editions)","review":"Possibly the most famous Stoic Philosopher is Marcus Aurelius, whose \\"Meditations\\" was written, not to be read as a philosophic treatise, but rather as a personal journal, complete with seemingly random entries and no apparent structure. Moreover, it is clear from his \\"Meditations\\" that Marcus Aurelius was greatly influenced by the teachings of Epictetus. In fact, according to Aulus Gellius, Herodes Atticus (who was Marcus Aurelius' teacher at the time) told Marcus Aurelius that Epictetus was the greatest of all the Stoic philosophers, which is quite convenient for us since most of the writings of earilier Stoics (such as Zeno of Citium, Cleanthes and Chrysippus) have been lost, probably in the burning of the Library of Alexandria.Epictetus, like Socrates, apparently never wrote anything himself; however, his students took very good notes. One student by the name of Flavius Arrian may be responsible for the composition of eight volumes, titled \\"The Discourses of Epictetus,\\" of which four volumes still survive. Arrian served under Emperor Hadrian who initially choose Atticus to be Marcus Aurelius' teacher. Arrian also wrote another text, titled \\"The Encheiridion of Epictetus\\" (or \\"Handbook\\" or \\"Manual\\"), which also survives and appears to be an abstract of his \\"Discourses\\". Throughout the second century, Epictetus was regarded as the greatest of the Stoic philosophers, and became even more popular than Plato. Stoicism nevertheless lost favor in the middle ages and was not revived until 1584 when Justus Lipsius published his \\"De Constantia\\".I would highly recommend the writings of Epictetus to anyone interested in Stoic Philosophy, or anyone at all for that matter. Epictetus should make for an excellent introduction to Stoic Philosophy, and the \\"Encheiridion\\" is an excellent introduction to Epictetus. I prefer Nicholas P. White's translation of \\"The Encheiridion of Epictetus\\" over the other translations that I have read. Oldfather's translation (Loeb Classical Library) is also very good."},{"Title":"Enchiridion (Dover Thrift Editions)","review":"This edition costs only two dollars but contains wisdon that is priceless.

However, when you use it, you might experience a build up of sexual energy that needs to be circulated through your body. If you do not circulate the energy in the correct way, you can end up with Qi Gong psychosis, a.k.a Kundalini syndrome. This involves hallucinations and all kinds of unpleasant psychological side-effects. This is a real danger and it it has happened to people using the technique described in this book. I would avoid this book altogether and instead get Chia's _Awakening Healing Energy Through Tao_. _Awakening Healing Energy Through Tao_ will give you the general techniques for circulating energy in much greater detail and help to open the energy paths before you unleash the built-up sexual energy. (I'm puzzled as to why Mr. Chia published _Multi-orgasmic man_ with inadequate detail for circulating sexual energy, because he is quite explicit about the dangers in _Awaken Healing Energy Through the Tao_.) When you are ready for it, get Chia's _Taoist Secretes of Love_, which provides much more detail than _Multi-orgasmic Man_.

If you are a perfectly healthy man then there should NOT be any problem. But if you have already got tuberculosis in the past or other bacterial disease then by stopping yourself from ejaculating you are forcing the bacteria from urine to the epididymis which has almost NO blood circulation and consequently NO defence. So if you get a harmless infection on your epididymis after practicing the finger lock, go straight to see your urologist and ask him about genital tuberculosis or syphilis infection.

Good bless!"},{"Title":"The Multi-Orgasmic Man: Sexual Secrets Every Man Should Know","review":"I bought this book after reading Caroline Rey say male orgasm is inferior to female multiple orgasms in \\"The Mammoth Book of Love and Sensuality\\". \\"The Multi-Orgasmic Man\\" has similiar views, and says that ejaculation is a pitiful 5-second experience that leaves a man feeling exhausted. The book claims it will teach a man how to have multiple orgasms without ejaculation. It claims that these techniques come from the East. Please keep in mind that China has a population of over a billion people, and India also has a population of over a billion people. So, it is clearly a myth that Eastern men withhold ejaculation. I practiced the techniques in this book for six months. The stamina techniques were effective for me, but I never experienced multiple orgasms. I've come to learn that once is enough. If it's not broke, why fix it? There's nothing wrong with the male orgasm. If the male orgasm is only 5 seconds, that's long enough. If men can only have one orgasm at a time, that's okay. Even that exhaustion a man feels after coming is not a bad thing, it relieves his stress and relaxes him. I do not feel male orgasm is inferior to female multiple orgasms, I feel it is only different. Yes, men need to be aware of women's needs. But nobody should be so cruel to a man. The best advice I've heard to satisfy a woman, is to start by giving her a good massage. A woman's body is errogenous and deserves to be stimulated. Then stimulate her clitoris and g-spot with your hands and mouth. It takes the average woman a half hour to begin having her multiple orgasms. So, if you are uncertain about your stamina, spend more time stimulating her with your hands and mouth. It is important for a woman to tell a man what she needs. The ancient Greeks felt it was a woman's fault for her sexual frustration if she did not tell her man what she needed. After a woman is satisfied it is time to focus on his needs. Most men want to recieve oral sex. Most men would also enjoy to recieve a good massage. A man's body is also errogenous, and deserves to be stimulated.

I began reading this book hoping to leanr many exciting and tantalizing tips on hoe to be a better lover and instead I found many derogatory and extremely demaning remarks about women. Can't men have enough self confidence to write about sex and not criticize and belittle women. An example: on page 113 in the Chapter entitled: \\"Becoming an Orgasmic Couple\\" it says that when penetrating a woman during intercourse, \\"Strike left and right as a brave general vbreaking through the enemy's ranks\\" and it further discusses what the author terms as \\"Battle fo the sexes\\" throughout the book. Great. This is what I get for trying to read about sexual tips and practices and look for more ways to please my lover. This is one of many examples of not so nice comments about women in this book. This book makes fun of female ejaculation, performinfg oral sex on a woman and the way women supposedly \\"smell\\". The book also essentially states that women's multiple orgasms are \\"mini-orgasms\\" and are inferior to a man's orgasm. NOT!

At the time I had no idea of what Kundalini was or what Self Realization really was. I was not into meditating but I did like sex and loved to please woman sexually.I thought I was happy and that this book would make me last longer and be a better lover.There are three kinds of Tantra.. Black, Grey and White.. This book teaches Black Tantra in every since of the word.It is doing nothing but teaching how to increase desire and addiction to sensations. Anyone who has any experience with the process of liberation from suffering should know better, so this just shows that the author is unfortunately very ignorant and sad, or just plain deceptive and dark.I have one thing good to say about the book, and I'll tell you to save you the time and money ~ it is that it teaches the Century Count which is just counting to 100 breaths, which is a form of meditation.. If you forget which breath you are on you have to start counting over... This, according to the book is a great way to build up calmness in the sexual act.. True, but to really progress spiritually and soar to unbelievable heights one must renounce the orgasm completely and work on renouncing all desire even in dreams.. This opens up the deep recesses of a persons ego's and creates true growth... Then and only then is the sexual act done with ONE person of the opposite sex to really grow into a Master.... Multiple partners creates imbalances in our chakra system.... Same sex partners can create nothing.. And as above So Below.. They just end up creating more desire and degeneration and really messing up their magnetic centers..I recommend studying The Dalai Lamas or Samael Aun Weor, The Bible, The Bhagavad Gita, The Koran, The Yoga Sutras of Pata&ntilde;jali , Buddha, etc...read these first ~The Mystery of the Golden Blossom, The Perfect Matrimony, Fundamental Notions of Endocrinology and Criminology to understand White Tantra..but do not read this garbage unless you enjoy the material world of lying and deceiving yourself.."},{"Title":"The Multi-Orgasmic Man: Sexual Secrets Every Man Should Know","review":"A complete guide to sexual pleasure.

I simply regularly practiced becoming very aware of the whole process of excitation in my body through to just before ejaculation, and used the book's explicit advice on stopping stimulation a bit before the point of no return by pressing on the perineum area to learn to prevent ejaculation both during regular masturbation practice and when making love with my fianc&eacute;. Eventually after two months I was able to slowly but surely be able to experience more and more of the orgasmic experience without having to ejaculate and with just using contraction of my perineum muscles. I found like many have before me, that orgasm is indeed separate from ejaculation, with some short period in between. I am now able to have as many orgasms as I want to in a love making session, and my fianc&eacute; has learned to do the same. Although mine are no longer accompanied by the additional pleasure of the genital focused ejaculation spasms, except for the once every ten days that I do choose to ejaculate at the end of a session, per the book's advice, my orgasms are full body now and I am clearly aware how the pleasure is brain based, not genital based. Believe me, it's way beyond worth the effort. Sex the way I experienced it previously doesn't even rank on the same scale. It's kind of like the absurd fantasy that is presented in porno movies become real, and I'm not kidding!!! I'm a somewhat average male in most respects, although I would say I do live an alternative lifestyle. I do not have any specific previous \\"spiritual\\" or body awareness training. This book was astoundingly practical and allowed me to become a Multi-Orgasmic male in about two months of regular, although by no means particularly strenuous practice. It has revolutionized my experience of sexuality, and allowed me to leave genital focused orgasm and ejaculation goal orientation far behind, and take a quantum shift in intimacy and ecstatic pleasure for both my lover and I. She found it extremely quick (in a couple of days) and easy to learn how to not \\"crest over\\" and remain multi-orgasmic continuously without getting over-sensitized and not wanting to continue, as many women do after a full orgasm. This book can honestly change your life experience radically!!! I recommend a beginners mind here, and you will definitely be rewarded, even though there may not be an extensive amount of details in the book about the experiential progression of the practice, and even if, as the authors indicate, it may take up to six months of practice to get the hang of it.

That was until the night in Berkeley when I picked up the book, opened my mind, pulled down my pants and went to work... I can remember my physical condition and mindset like it was yesterday. I was fatigued. I was working too hard. I had flown cross-country and was still on East Coast time. And I felt like I was coming down with the flu. I relaxed, started reading the book (had to skim the illustrations first) and started to &quot;go to town&quot; using the techniques described. The first orgasm was the hardest because my natural tendency was to release. I focused. Channeled the energy upwards and felt a sensation I had not really felt for all the years I had been making myself come. Bottom line is, 6 orgasms later -- the last one I released -- my mental and physical condition had completely changed.

Why didn't he just SAY that?!?!\\"The book is very useful just to learn about your body and how it works. He doesn't really give a cookie cutter approach to becoming multiorgasmic though, as many men here seem to suggest here in their reviews. Maybe becoming multiorgasmic was just natural to them??? Deep breathing techniques are overblown/overrated, as are many other techniques. He does give a lot of sound advice that is useful, but really could have written a book that would have been just as useful in about one-third the number of pages.

One year later I was masturbating and right before I was about to release, I stopped and felt a mini-orgasm without ejaculation and realized what this book was about.After that experience I bought the book and read it in a week.

By buying this junk book you are wasting your time since the whole book is about spirituality, self-love, power to hurt and heal, morning prayer, universal love, oral sex and so many irrelevant subjects that has nothing to do with multiple orgasm technique. This book instead of being written based on scientific facts relies on assumptions and tedious story telling that only wastes your time. It is obvious that the writer intended to fill the book with junk and superficial contents only for moneymaking purposes. This book is useful if you want to lose your actual erection and sense of arousal and to be embarrassed in front of your partner.This book has only half a page about multiple orgasm technique that you can Google search it under PC muscles. You can squeeze your PC muscles right before orgasm in order to prevent ejaculation. The PC muscle is the one by which you stop urination and it is located between your anus and testicles. By practicing squeezing your PC muscle and strengthening it you can easily stop ejaculation.

This puts my reputation on the line. I just made a thorough research in the entire online archive of San Francisco Chronicle and did NOT find any recommendation such as \\"This book is the best available for teaching men to have multiple orgasms.\\" The absence of an author, date or any other piece of information which can help a person to verify it, plus the absence of anything like that in the archive most probably means that it has never existed!Then I researched the reviews of The Multi-orgasmic man. I was amazed to see that more than 60% are written by nobody living in the middle of nowhere! There aren't any names. There aren't even pen names! These are simply short absolutely anonymous comments. Customers with Real Name like me or at least a pen name post mostly negative reviews of this book because it does not deliver on the promises to help you enjoy multiple orgasms and great ejaculation control.I thought that maybe I hadn't done the technique properly. So I bought and \\"How to make love all night\\" by Barbara Keesling who teaches very similar, PC muscle based technique. The situation is even worse. Most of her reviews are also written by nobody, the real reviewers are disappointed and the reason is not at all working technique/approach. These two books are very cheap and the reason is that they are actually useless and fail to deliver when it comes to multi-orgasms and great stamina!"},{"Title":"The Multi-Orgasmic Man: Sexual Secrets Every Man Should Know","review":"My primary motivation was to give women better orgasms. If you can control your own ejaculation, you can give more attention to the effect your sexuality is having on your woman. Once you learn how sexual energy moves inside of you, you can sense how your own sexual energy moves inside your woman and how you can direct it to intensifying her experience. She will be very grateful.The main trick is to be able to avoid and redirect ejaculation. This allows the sexual energy to build up in your body. Women can feel this power in you. When you ejaculate, you emasculate yourself energetically. My current girlfriend melts and swoons at the thought of me. She says her molecules change in my presence. She asks me, don't other women feel this in you? I say yes they do. She says how do you know? I say I can feel their molecules changing.The book is remarkable for pinpointing exactly where you may be losing control over the energy circulating inside of you and how you can remove any impediments to the maximum utilization of your sexual energy. This energy is Life Force itself, and when you learn to master it, you will discover more personal power and integrity in yourself and you will be more powerful and directed in all aspects of your life. Other men will trust you more, your business drive will increase, women will be drawn to you.It took me 6 months of practice to reorient my energetic patterns, which had been unchanged for 40 years. Now, ejaculations have about as much appeal as the release felt sneezing. You will not want to ejaculate anymore once you master your energetic body. The power felt coursing through your body will be a thrill like continuous orgasm.I read that other men skipped the breathing exercises. They were key for me. I can now induce an energetic orgasm by just breathing consciously. This makes me feel ecstatically alive. The sexual energy is not contained by your woman. She is just a concentrated version of the feminine energy that pervades the universe. It is here for your pleasure and will welcome you into its embrace.The non-ejaculatory orgasms are completely unlike the squirting kind. They go on and on with blissful intensity, completely unrelated to any other experience I have ever had, but they come closest to the hallucinogenic experiences of LSD or peyote. People report experiencing god on those drugs, and I can tell you that experience is available to anyone who wants to take the time to cultivate it in them."},{"Title":"The Multi-Orgasmic Man: Sexual Secrets Every Man Should Know","review":"I am very familiar with the Taoistic approach to sex and circulation of energy through the 12 channels in the body.

Take a moment and ask yourself what do you want- health problems or orgasms!In order to use this book you should have an excellent knowledge/experience in Qi Gong, Acupuncture or at least Taoistic Yoga. Otherwise you will play with fire!

(I'm only on the third chapter, and won't give her a chance to read it until I'm done.)"},{"Title":"The Multi-Orgasmic Man: Sexual Secrets Every Man Should Know","review":"I have been looking for books about Dapoxetine, the drug that treats patient with premature ejaculation. Since the durg is relatively new, and it is not approval in the U.S, so it is hard to find such book. I redirected my search on books that treat patient with sexual disorder. I get more books than I expected. The preview screen captures before the actual buy of this book reveal a caption \\"Brain Wave and Reflexes\\". After reading several pages in this section, I realized that this book relies heavily on scientific studies both on animal and human. So I purchased it. I first read with curiosity and somewhat skepticism, but at the end I have to say this is the book every adult man should have if he wants to have sexual satisfaction every time, and the lovemaking technique that never fails to please his lover.Style and StructureThe book starts with an acknowledgment and a brief introduction about the content of each chapter of the book. Each chapter is then supported with evidence such as scientific study and test subject's comment. It is full of testimonies from people around the world, who have practiced Sexual Kung Fu (sexual practice produces orgasms while delaying ejaculation) and had multi-orgasms. Written in an informal, narrative way, the book is fun and easy to read.Brief SummaryThe first chapter leads readers to the world of orgasms based on Eastern belief. The Taoists believe that multi-orgasms can be reached, and lovemaking without ejaculation can prolong a man life. The male and female genital anatomy and physiology are studied extensively. Parts of the organs that can be stimulated to trigger sexual arousal are pictured since the technique to achieve orgasms is based upon stimulating these spots. There are several techniques that severed man alone, couple, or man who suffers sexual disorder such as premature ejaculation (PE), impotence, and erectile dysfunction. The last chapter emphasizes the positive effects of lovemaking, encourages monogamy, and promotes sexual education for young adult.Sexual energy plays important roles in the healing Tao philosophy, and it accounts for a large part of energy that a human body generates or absorbs. Chia believes that \\"a person cannot achieve spritual fulfillment without conserving and leveraging the power of sexual energy\\", and having orgasms withou ejaculation is the best way to conserve that energy, and if sexual kung fu is done right with proper techniques, a person can enjoy both the healthy longevity life and the good relationship.Sexual Kung Fu and the philosophySex is always a \\"hot\\" topic, and teaching sexual kung fu, like Chia does, seems to provoke controversial. The foundation of sexual kung fu based on the basic of sexual Alchemy. Its primary purpose is to save energy by delaying ejaculation and transform sexual engery into more refine energy, and the ultimate goal is healing illness and enhancing sexual health. How this energy is transformed, and in what mechanism the disease is cured are explained in the book, but it is not easy to understand, and it is beyond my knowledge. However, the fact that healing Tao attracts attention from the scholars such as Hartman, Michael Winn, Eric Yudelove, and Dennis Lewis, and Chia himself was named the Chi Kung Master of The Year 1990 by the International Congress of Chinese Medicine provide credibility in this book.Sexual Kung Fu and its effects on our daily lifeWe live in a busy world with ordeals and deadlines to be meet. We go to bed often tired with the head full of schedule of the next day. Sex becomes a routine or a responsibility and quite boredom, and soon before we know it, we are one foot into a betrayal to our sex partner. Are we happy with it? Yes, at the beginning of a new relationship, but after that we either accept the boredom when it kicks in, or we start a new relationship, and a cycle of frustration begins. Sexual Kung Fu teaches us how to recharge ourselves, maintain the attraction toward our partner, and preserve our energy to help us from burning out from our daily task.Sexual Kung Fu: the mechanism of orgasms and its benefit on premature ejaculation patientThe idea of Sexual Kung Fu freaks Western men who believe the peak of orgasm comes right after the ejaculation, and ejaculation is inevitable. A peek into the mechanism of sexual intercourse supports Eastern followers. Evidence in the book has shown that ejaculation and orgasm are two independent processes.The ejaculatory mechanism consists of two reflexes: The glans-vasal and urethromuscular. The former reflexe brings the semen to the posterior urethra, and the later ejects it to the exterior. Bases on this knowledge, the authors suggest technique that can revert the flow of semen to the interior.This book with enrich evidence of laboratory experiment on animal and human as well as patient report outcome has been persuasive to readers. Otherwise, it may end up being labeled as junk book and quickly forgoten as many other sex books. Patient with premature ejaculation (PE) may also find this book helpful. Since Dapoxetine (the only drug that treats PE in some European countries) is not approval in the U.S due to its undesireable effects,and the price (when available) is subtantially high ($40.00/pill), and it must be taken before each sexual episode, the book provides an effective non-medical techniques that allow PE patient reaches his ultimate orgasms without worrying about ejaculation time. PE affects more than 30% of male population and causes self-destruction in these people. Imagine how much money can be saved and how life can be enriched if these patients practice Sexual Kung Fu.Lovemaking is a part of nature\\"We are part of nature as nature is part of us\\". Lovemaking is part of nature, as it is a way to transfer our genes to our offspring, and it is the thought that most men carry out through day. People love sex, but are afraid to say it out loud and be accused as a \\"dirty old man\\". There is nothing wrong with the search for sexual satisfaction, and it is as natural as breathing or heartbeat. \\"The multi-orgasmic man\\" should be in every family bookshelf. Read it and adhere to it, and you will happy with the result. Read it and do nothing about it; you certainly gain knowledge necessary for your sex life. Either way, you are the winner!!!The UnexpectedI was reading this book in the hope that I can find the connection between Dapoxetine and PE. What I found is PE can be treated without medication. In addition, there are many aspects that I have never thought can be found in this book. One of these useful aspect is it promotes monogamy based on the fact that the presence of a long-term lover stimulates the production of endorphins, \\" a natural painkillers that gives partners a sense of serenity and security in their lives\\", and \\" that is one reason why it feels so horrible when we're abandoned or a lover dies\\"."},{"Title":"The Multi-Orgasmic Man: Sexual Secrets Every Man Should Know","review":"This book is an excellent step-by-step, how-to manual for achieving sexual ecstasy.

Yes the methods that are described in ths book DO work and a couple (or if you want to do the solo routine) can go for as long as they like thanks to the instructions given. The book also talks about changes that a man goes through in life and how that effects sexuality and ways to fight to keep things up (yeah, pun intended). In addition it gives advice on prostate maintainance and its erotic role during sex (believe it or not). As you read the history of the Eastern culture of which this is based in it was interesting to see how sex was seen thousands of years ago as a medicinal treatment to certain ailments. Imagine going to your doctor and he prescribes you to take two orgasms and call him in the morning. Well apparently the Chinese medicine people were on to something when they would routinely do that. Goodbye HMO's! Authors Chia and Abrams talk about the exact reason why men are tired after ejaculation and how to combat that in ways that can prolong sex to an all night event. They also give interesting information that deals with seminal retention and how that can prolong one's life and add vitality. Of course the American Medical Association isn't going to support this but what the hell, I'm 30 and am more than willing to give it a shot! This book has given me a greater perspective on sex and my abilities as a lover. I'm glad that I have this book and it was more than a worthy investment. I'm going to start my second reading soon so that I can earn my black belt in Sexual Kung Fu (read the book and you'll all see what I mean). Oh and ladies, there is an important chapter for you too in order to not only benefit from the new prowessness of your lover but to show how you can directly benefit from the excercises given.

This is still one of my favorite books. It will totally change how you view sex, taking it from a race towards the cliff of ejaculation to instead riding wave after wave of orgasmic sex for as long as you wish.This book brings ancient Taoist sex secrets to the modern man in a way that Western minds can understand. Research is presented along with the techniques and health benefits you can gain from the practice. The book is aimed more as a sex manual for enriching men, and their partner's, lives than exploring Taoist spirituality. Though there is still a touch of it as the book progresses as it is hard to separate the two. It is accessible to men regardless of their spiritual inclination. Those that do seek a deeper sexual experience will find the Taoist sexual practice more accessible than Tantric sex.Contrary to what the title suggests this book is not just for men. While the main focus of the book is towards men, women can learn a lot about the male anatomy and sexuality. There is also a chapter dedicated to women. It briefly covers the parts about the man and male practice while also giving her techniques for her own practice and cultivation.There is also a chapter for gay men, which can easily be skipped if this does not apply to you.Like any good sex book, The Multi-Orgasmic Man gives you more than just techniques for your own practice. There is also good information on pleasing your partner, taking you on a tour of the female anatomy and what brings her pleasure.If you are in a relationship you should really read and discuss this book with your partner. It will help you both learn and deepen your sexual relationship. Even if you are not with anyone at the moment you can still benefit from the solo practice.I have read of people who have had bad experiences with this practice. Pretty much in all cases when all the information is given the reason that they had problems is that they did not follow the book. People complain even here on Amazon about this or that, but the truth is that everything you need to know is in this book. It seems that people just do not read the entire book or just don't pay attention.So let me say this, please read the entire book and do as it says. It is not a difficult practice. Anyone can be doing this in just a few weeks to a few months, but there are things you need to do to ensure you gain all the benefits for improving your overall life.I have been practicing the techniques I learned in this book for over 10 years with only good results. My partners have only had good things to say and my love life has been great. I highly recommend this book to anyone, male or female, and especially couples looking to enrich their lives. Though if a woman is look for a book focused on female Taoist sexual practices there are better books and this one will probably leave you wanting to find out more.*Edit* I updated this review on Feb. 1, 2010 to be more informative."},{"Title":"The Multi-Orgasmic Man: Sexual Secrets Every Man Should Know","review":"I have practiced Thai Chi and Qi Gong for 12 years and I am very familiar with the movement of energy (chi) within the body. Mantak Chia tried to present on several pages philosophy and practices which take at least 4 MONTHS to master under the guidance of an experienced instructor. Anyone who tries to convince you that you can master such techniques in less than an hour definitely lies you!The author knows how dangerous is to deal with energy without knowing in great details how to control and direct it. That's why if you are also interested in such exoteric practices I strongly recommend you to find an instructor. In this way you will avoid several potentially dangerous problems for your health, which are listed on 2 pages in the book. This is serious and your health and well-being are your responsibility!I know how to circulate the energy in my body but I couldn't enjoy even once \\"multiple orgasms\\" in this way.

I waited for my partner to come home from a long work stint abroad before opening the packet from Amazon and by that point, the 30-return period had expired, so we couldn't even return it. I contacted the individual bookseller about exchanging it for the full edition, but they weren't at all flexible."},{"Title":"The Multi-Orgasmic Man: Sexual Secrets Every Man Should Know","review":"The Multi-orgasmic man is a fairly instructive, easy to read book on a phenomenon which remains largely unknown in our society: male multiple orgasms(MMO). The authors not only reveal the existence of this sexual wonder, but also explain to you, on the basis of age-old Chinese Taoist techniques, how to have it. The emphasis is on practical knowledge. They also explain how detrimental to your health ejaculation is and this is supposed to be a strong incentive to try the techniques.I have learnt a lot about male (and female)anatomy and sexuality from the book and I certainly found the techniques fascinating. Nevertheless when I put it down, I decided not to try all the tricks because1. They are too complicated and not explained very clearly2. There is no possibility to ask questions to the author and I have no Taoist instructor at hand (have you?)3. The techniques are dangerous (the description of the main technique called the big draw is followed by almost two pages of possible dangers and pitfalls)Mantak Chia also discusses gay sexuality but the chapter on gay love is very disappointing. Just a few trite remarks on Taoism being non-judgmental and having a medical, not a moral, approach to sexuality. And none of this backed by quotes from the Taoists books. One wonders if the gay thing is not just a cheap ruse to enlarge the readership of the book...There is very little in the Multi-Orgasmic Man on the theory of male multiple orgasms: how it happens and why. Very little also on what MMO means for anthropology, philosophy and religion. Did the ancients know about it? The author speaks of old Chinese techniques,but doesn't explore the history of MMO in other cultures. All in all, this is a very superficial study and vulgarity is not absent from its pages(\\"touch your balls\\").As most how-to books on ancient exotic techniques, I guess there are very few readers who will actually use them.

This books blends well with Tai-Chi and creative visualizations. All are based on the movement of energy throughout the bodyThe only drawback of being Multi-Orgasmic is having a partner that fully understands that even if you don't ejaculate visibly, you still had a wonderful experience.

It feels as if they know in advance exactly what will happen to you, in terms of the way you feel, how your body reacts and help you deal with these things.Every exercise in the book has been tested and retested with great success, and I can tell you from my own experience of them, the results are breathtaking !!!You would think that being multi-orgasmic could be nice, but wait till you experience it. It is indescribable !!! You get long and powerful full body orgasms that blow your mind away, they come one after the other, for as long as you like. You actually feel as if you become one with you partner and, well I truly advise you to try it for yourselves.Many books will claim to have they way to make you become multi-orgasmic. I know, I bough many of them myself. They would only get you to a second mild orgasm, and some of them have techiques that could be harmfull for your health and for the long term, even for keeping your erection.This book is totally medically safe, and futher more, by practicing the exercises regularly you would greatly improve your health and vitality and harden your erection.I have to warn you though that by truly applying the knowledge in this book through the exercises and all, you would become one of the greatest attraction in town. Don't say I didn't warn you... : )"},{"Title":"The Multi-Orgasmic Man: Sexual Secrets Every Man Should Know","review":"Multiple orgasm is a real thing. It should not be confused with the &quot;backing-off&quot; technique most men already practice, that is, getting as close as possible to an orgasm, then backing off, again and again until one finally lets go and has one powerful climax. That's not what he's talking about, guys. The techniques in this book allow you to have ACTUAL orgasms without ejaculating and without losing one's sexual energy and desire to continue making love.Interestingly, before reading this book, I had already experienced multiple (actual) orgasms (without ejaculating) on a number of occasions over the years---but I couldn't quite figure out what I was doing right, so I couldn't depend on repeating my performance. This book gave me the techniques I need to practice this far better way of making love. I just finished reading it, so I can't report on my success yet. But I did recognize a few techniques I already do naturally---controlling my arousal with my breath, for example---so I see I was on the right track all along, and I trust these methods are going to work."},{"Title":"The Multi-Orgasmic Man: Sexual Secrets Every Man Should Know","review":"I gave this to my husband, reaching middle age has its issues, high blood pressure, menopause, teenagers, and his father's deaths. My husband who never reads at home, read this book. It is a quick, an easy read, he did put it out of site from our 13 year old son.My husband was already familar chi since it is related to martial arts. The breathing he knew also, but other parts of the books held different concepts of interest.I left to visit my family for at the beach for a couple of weeks, since he was facing very stressful weeks at work and dealing with estate issues. I did not think he would look at this book. To my delight and enjoyment upon coming home he had. Our lives have changed.A man having multiple orgasms changes the whole sexual encounter for both parties. It is just amazing. I could not be happier we have opened this door, it is the best gift I have ever given my husband. Menopause is a forgotten, that I am aging is forgotten for I feel sixteen again.The issues of middle age are less of an issue and our enjoyment in each other has increased in everything we do together. We have reconnected on every level, have private jokes, our teenager feels leftout, which is now it should be.I have a lover and my best friend!The book is well written & a quick an easy read."},{"Title":"The Multi-Orgasmic Man: Sexual Secrets Every Man Should Know","review":"The approach towards multi-orgasms is similar to the one of Barbara Keesling. You have to come very close to the end and contract your PC muscle to stop yourself from crossing the point of no return. Hopefully, at that time your prostate will contract and you have got an orgasm. Next, you have to calm down and gradually come back again very close to the edge for a second orgasm. This is in theory but the problem is that most of the time I ended up with unpleasant semi-ejacul. or very stiff and painful PC muscle without reaching even one orgasm. I practiced this method for 3 weeks and was unpleasantly surprised because of sharp decrease in my ability to last long.I searched for an explanation and found it in \\"scientifically guaranteed male multiple orgasms and ultimate sex\\". According to its author scientist Ritz regular and strong contractions of the PC muscle cause hyper activation of the \\"sympathetic nerves\\" in the genitals. They execute each ejaculat. That's why he recommends avoiding using the PC muscle. Instead you should use the \\"VIP Muscle\\", which is completely different, yet a nearby muscle. It is connected with the \\"parasympathetic nerves\\" and cannot influence the ejaculat. control. I easily achieved multi-orgasms with it and after several days my PE (prem. ejacul.) was gone. (update: it was not only gone but my endurance now is the record 40+ minutes)You may find the taoistic information in \\"The Multi-Orgasmic Man\\" refreshing but if you want results (multi-orgasms or greater endurance) then the result could be the opposite namely PE as happened with me. I would suggest reading this book only for its exotic side but if you regularly and strenuously use your PC muscle, it will most probably turn counter productive."},{"Title":"The Multi-Orgasmic Man: Sexual Secrets Every Man Should Know","review":"Having that great feeling more than once is like Christmas come early!

Perfection lies ahead!"},{"Title":"My New York Diary","review":"In My New York Diary, Julie Doucet writes about her life after high school, including art school and her time in New York City. This slim volume details boring classes, bad boyfriends, her personal battle with seizures, a miscarriage, and more. Doucet does a good job with the English language, especially considering she is a native French speaker from Canada. Although the writing is honest and deals with many painful issues, it is very much one-sided (this is a diary, after all). I found myself wishing that Doucet had fleshed out the stories more instead of simply detailing her own points of view, like how possessive and psycho her boyfriend becomes over time. These plot lines are interesting enough to draw you through the book (no pun intended), but you end up feeling that there is much more here. This writing style is the mark of a young writer, perhaps.A note about the artwork in this graphic novel. Doucet is a fine artist, but each and every frame and page are so incredibly jam-packed with clutter - bottles, cans, forks, records, dirty dishes, etc. etc. etc. - that I began to get claustrophobic just looking at it all. It made me wonder if the author is a serious hoarder bound for reality television fame, or if she just draws that way. Instead of giving the reader more information, the cluttered style actually distracts from the story. I wonder if the author tried to use her cluttered drawing style to make up for a thin and lopsided story.If you are a fan of autobiographical graphic novels, especially by women artists, you might want to take a look at My New York Diary and support this increasingly interesting genera.I have one small complaint. Although my volume just took a few hours to read, the binding came loose and the cover fell off. I am not sure if this is a widespread problem with Drawn & Quarterly books, but it is something you should be aware of if you collect graphic novels."},{"Title":"My New York Diary","review":"Julie Doucet really has her pen on the pulse of experiences, particularly hers. This volume focuses on her adventures while living in the heart of New York City, and indeed makes for entertainment. The wonderful illustrations only compliment the story line, and makes the reader want to gobble up the book."},{"Title":"My New York Diary","review":"I can't believe they are selling this so cheap.This is one of my single favorite graphic novels of all time. I put it up there with Maus, David Boring, or even Dark Knight Returns for personal favorite. I just love Julie's honesty and her artwork is mind blowing. My young artist life wasn't exactly like this but its so honest you relate to it with your own troubles and lost friends, lovers, funtimes, badtimes, disasters...I also loved the Film/Comic sequal, My New Newyork Diary. Check that out too, but start with the orginal."},{"Title":"My New York Diary","review":"English does not appear to be the first language of the author--there was a lot of awkward language and typos, frankly -- and that was very distracting. Also, though I sympathized with some of the situations the character got herself in, I did not actually like her as a character -- she appeared spoiled, sheltered, and made really terrible mistakes in her life that I expected her to learn from by the end of the book. Since this is a diary, I assume the events are laid out how just as they happened, but it made for a wandering story that did not have a nice, buttoned up ending (or even a resolution). She also seems to have a disdain for New York that I did not appreciate."},{"Title":"My New York Diary","review":"So you're a confused young man and trying to figure out exactly what women want. Well, Mme Doucet won't help you out there. But she will show you what women HATE in men with brutal honesty. And the guys are utter jerks and crybabies.I probably was like one of the characters in this book and knew someone like Julie when I was younger. I seem to recall sort of being like her roommate, the one always dreading World War III. Why are us guys so obtuse? Probably for phallogocentric reasons. We get wrapped up in upright behavior and lose out on all the fun we could have by being bent. We're also selfish sometimes in the wrong way. (Women do like selfish men, just not stupidly selfish men.)It would be nice if Julie could follow this one up with a story of a successful relationship with some guy. Because we care for her and want her to succeed."},{"Title":"My New York Diary","review":"This book (in fact, everything I have ever read by Doucet) is purely one note. A dire, angry attack on the stereotypes she has formed about men (not to mention those she applies to the cliches she claims to have been involved with), this particular story goes on to prove more of the opposite-sided although far-more-eloquent bigotry of Dave Sim in his anti-woman rants in Cerebus than anything the idea of misogyny could hope to presume. Julie Doucet proves herself to have a purely emotional agenda that lacks even the basic notion of rationality and proves just how stupid single-minded and self-righteous intellectuals are capable of being.Good for the laughs at taking things the wrong way and other forms of profound misunderstanding of human motivations. Absolute trash on the gutter point spectrum of the industry."},{"Title":"Hot Seat: Theater Criticism for The New York Times, 1980-1993","review":"This is one of the best purchases I've made in a long while. I sat up way past my bedtime pouring over this wonderful book. Frank Rich became the NY Times Theatre Critic shortly after I began making annual pilgrimages to NYC and staying abreast of what was happening both on and off-Broadway. Consequently, almost every show I've seen over the years is reviewed somewhere in this book. And how wonderful it is to re-visit some of those cherished experiences through his eye! Reading Rich's reviews of &quot;Dreamgirls&quot;, &quot;Amadeus&quot;, and &quot;Angels in America&quot; again gave me chills. His reviews of &quot;Moose Murders&quot; and &quot;Carrie&quot; had me laughing out loud. And his review of the 3,389th performance of &quot;A Chorus Line&quot; left me in tears. But more than just these isolated moments, the book as a whole provides a rich, varied overview of the commercial theatre during the last decade and a half, obviously written by a man who loved his job and knew what he was talking about. It's a must!"},{"Title":"Hot Seat: Theater Criticism for The New York Times, 1980-1993","review":"What better way to view 10+ years on Broadway than through the eyes of a theatre critic? The so-called &quot;Butcher of Broadway&quot; has collected a large number of his reviews in this volume, and it is a must-read for anyone who remembers the theatre of the 1980s, or wants to experience it for the first time. Rich's reviews are insightful, well-written, and succeed very often at drawing you into the shows, and making you feel like you are part of the audience. The addition of editorial comments, from a modern day perspective, helps put some of the events his reviews and articles detail into an even greater context. Whether you agree with everything Mr. Rich says or not, there are few better windows into the twelve or so years of New York theatre while he was the theatre critic for The New York Times."},{"Title":"Hot Seat: Theater Criticism for The New York Times, 1980-1993","review":"i miss frank rich's reviews so much. they were brilliant and insightful and funny. i loved re-reading them in this book. i love you frank!"},{"Title":"Hot Seat: Theater Criticism for The New York Times, 1980-1993","review":"Obviously, every theater buff (and library) in the country will want this book. But even those of us who are not quite so high-brow will find that it captures a huge chunk of our cultural lives -- 1980 to 1993 -- and in a medium not so easy to grab hold of. Favorite movies? You can just go rent them. TV favorites? Tape them or watch in syndication. But with the theater, what do you do? This book is at least part of the answer. If you want a seat at the opening of Dream Girls, or to read why Cats was the hit it became, or to dip into reviews of plays you saw or that might be coming to town in revival . . . this is a book for your library."},{"Title":"Hot Seat: Theater Criticism for The New York Times, 1980-1993","review":"I am so tired of the clich&eacute; response to critics those who can't do, blah blah blah. As if it constituted some sort of argument.

When I found out it was already out of print, I became a men obsessed.

I end up discovering more and more productions that fascinate me, thanks to this book."},{"Title":"Hot Seat: Theater Criticism for The New York Times, 1980-1993","review":"While Rich's book may be a somewhat useful book of reviews he created for the New York Times, it must be remembered how he nearly ruined Broadway by writing hostile reviews of shows written by creative people he didn't like and glowing reviews for his personal favorites. He and his soon to be wife (Alex Witchel) who wrote the Friday Broadway column in times gave new meaning to the words &quot;conflict of interest&quot; and nearly destroyed Broadway in the process."},{"Title":"Computing Information Technology: The Human Side","review":"The human side of technology is crucial but has not received the dedicated attention it warrants.

Few could match his incisive, dead-on wit. I've been a WSC fan ever since I read his comment about the 'modest' Clement Attlee; talk about hitting the nail on the head! THE WICKED WIT OF WINSTON CHURCHILL includes the Attlee quote and many more entertaining bon mots.Compiler Dominique Enright divides WSC's witticisms into chapters entitled: Be Killed Many Times: Politics; Terminological Diversions: Words; Casting Pearls: Speeches; Friends Like These; and so on. Chapters range in length from eight to 16 pages. Most of the selections run to a single sentence. I would have like some kind of index but that's just me.Paging through Enright's book, you marvel at Churchill's wonderful - and often pungent - use of the English language. Clearly he was a man who understood the majesty, power and joy of words.THE WICKED WIT OF WINSTON CHURCHILL is the first such book I have read on the topic. While it isn't exhaustive or definitive, it is a delightful introduction to the great man's wit and wisdom.

Why, I'd rather vote for the Devil!\\"\\"I understand\\", Churchill answered, \\"But in case your friend is not running, may I count on your support?\\"* * *When passed a very long but turgidly written memorandum on some worthy but uninspiring subject, the elderly Prime Minister weighed the thick wad of paper in his hands and commented, \\"This paper by its very length defends itself against the risk of being read.\\"* * *Churchill liked animals; sometimes he found this difficult to reconcile with his fondness for rich food. Anthony Montague Brown recalled that 'One Christmas he was about to carve a goose. Learning it was one of his own, he put down the knife and fork and said, \\"I could not possibly eat a bird that I have known socially.\\"* * *A BBC broadcaster described once sitting next to Churchill as he gave a speech, keeping his audience hanging on to his every word. The boradcaster noticed, howver, that what appeared to be notes in Churchill's hand was only a laundry slip, and he later remarked upon this to Churchill. \\"Yes\\", said Churchill. \\"It gave confidence to my audience.\\""},{"Title":"The Wicked Wit of Winston Churchill","review":"The title of my review had simply told what I wanna say. Churchill is such a famous person of wit and words. That's beyond argument. Therefore it's not a difficult job for the editor-author to pick and pack Churchill's words, with some short sentences telling the background of each, into a thin book. Anyway, he did it alright.I would like to pick some of my favorite quotes for your reference. Hope you like them and can share my feelings of how brilliant Churchill. and also indirectly, this book is.1. &quot;Trying to maintain good relations with a Communist is like wooing a crocodile. You do not know whether to tickle it under the chin or beat it over the head. When it opens its mouth, you cannot tell whether it is trying to smile or preparing to eat you up.&quot;2. &quot;No one pretends that democracy is perfect or all-wise. Indeeed, it has been said that Democracy is the worst form of government except all those other forms that have been tried from time to time.&quot;3. &quot;You will never get to the end of the journey if you stop to buy a stone at every dog that barks.&quot;4. &quot;Virtuous motives, trammelled by inertia and timidity, are no match for armed and resolute wickedness.&quot;5. &quot;What if I had said, instead of &quot;We shall fight on the beaches&quot;, &quot;Hostilities will be engaged with our adversary on the coastal perimeter?&quot;.and......many other invaluable quotes. In short, a must buy."},{"Title":"The Wicked Wit of Winston Churchill","review":"The wise and witty words of Winston Churchill ring throughout the 20th Century.Any that knew him personally or had anything to do with him must have waited with anticipation of hearing what he would say anytime he opened his mouth.This held true for Kings,Presidents,Generals and yes even for his family,including his grandaughter.At times, his use of silence could be as cuttinga reply as anything he could say.No doubt, he took as much enjoyment in his words as anyone he was aiming them at.It wasn't all one way either,he seemed to love a well delivered line,even if he was the object.He neither claimed to be nor in fact was an'educated man',hewas similar to Mark Twain,in that he could cut to pieces,people of much greater formal education,if they tried to engage him in 'a battle of words'.In his book \\"My Early Life\\" he said.\\"It's a good thing for anuneducated man to read books of quotations\\" and described how he read \\"Bartlett's Quotations\\".It is obvious that he often used and modified others quotations.His friend Lord Brinkenhead quipped,\\"Winston has devoted the best years of his life to preparing his impromptu speeches.\\"\\"One of Churchill's most famous speeches is that of June1940:'We shall fight on the beaches,we shall fight in the fields and in the streets,we shall fight in the hills...'

It is sometimes difficult to place his statements in the context of WW-II (I was born in 1944 and I do have a memory of that era because it was the biggest event in my parents lives - they talked about it all the time).After a session with Mr. Churchill, I often wish American politicians had a bit of his prespective (though I reall doubt they would ever get elected)."},{"Title":"The Wicked Wit of Winston Churchill","review":"I am a long-time admirer of Sir Winston Churchill. As a leader he had few (if any) equals, but I have always been impressed with his sharp wit and stinging retorts.

I've read all the Churchill witticism books on the market and this was by far the weakest. Rather than just simple wicked wit, the book is laden with British Colloquialisms and history that will be utterly lost on the American reader. There is also a smattering of (oddly) untranslated French quotations which require a trip to the internet in order to understand. There are a couple of laugh out loud anecdotes but overall, too many short historical stories which provide (too much) background, are rather bland and cause Churchill's wit to be nearly lost in the process. An OK book but nothing more. If you're a Churchill completist, buy it for the few stories that aren't in the other wit and wisdom books. Otherwise, save your money."},{"Title":"The Wicked Wit of Winston Churchill","review":"Irreverent quotations - some quite funny like on Montgomery.

Living near by it was easy to attend however I had absolutely no knowledge of mushrooms other than eating Portobellos et al., and reading a little about the possibility of plugging stumps and logs. In fact, at the seminar I felt a bit out of place amongst all of the others who had particular goals and agendas for being there. I figured a bit of education could help me understand this whole mushroom thing. When I left I was completely blown away by all of the possibilities that mycelium offer and by Fungi Perfecti's excellent presentation of this data. Most all of what Paul and his staff taught in this seminar is in this book.This fascinating book is a treasure trove of effective low tech methods for 'running mycelium'. Paul describes everything from gardening techniques to soil restoration to health care application using typical gourmet mushrooms (oh what Oyster mushrooms can do) and many other species. As a scientist, he backs his data with reputable references. He also uses language that may be challenging to those not educated in the biological/medical sciences. However, not unlike Dr. Andrew Weil's publications, it is nearly impossible to simplify this type of information without giving all audiences from foresters to backyard gardeners to medical practitioners enough information to help everyone understand how powerful this natural filter in soil is regardless of their educational background.Mycelium Running has very high quality color photos, detailed 'how tos' anyone can follow and specifics describing the chemistry of this powerful ally in its myriad of uses. This is a wonderful text that hopefully will assist us in restoring our battered environment and ailing health one backyard and human body at a time. For what it is worth, this is perhaps the most important and interesting book I have purchased in years. Now I have piles of card board stacked around my property successfully running all kinds of mycelium from spent mushroom kits. I expect to further the \`running' using the techniques from this book to build more productive gardens and help keep Rue Creek running clean.Because of Fungi Perfecti and Mycelium Running's superb information, I have truly become 'beshroomed'. I now go out of my way to educate friends, relatives, neighbors and co-workers alike of the beneficial effects of growing better gardens, managing yard waste (instead of burning), mitigating damage by clear cut logging, cleaning up polluted soil and water ways, removing termites and ants (cannot wait to get an off the shelf solution for this!), alternative/supplemental solutions for treating disease/cancer and every day use for maintaining good health. All of this is painstakingly described in this book; simply amazing.Paul and his staff are the type of people who do wonderful things for humanity. So wonderful, it makes me want to start a new career and open a natural healing center. Because of Mycelium Running, it would seem there is high probability of significant grassroots restoration of earth and human body. Do yourself a huge favor and spend the money to get this book; it is worth its weight in gold. Next thing you'll find is that you'll be running mycelium in some way, shape or form. It is that easy. Kudos to Paul, Dusty and FP staff for your dedication and hard work!"},{"Title":"Mycelium Running: How Mushrooms Can Help Save the World","review":"One of my students recommended this book and I had no idea what I was getting into. A book on fungi that I can't tear myself away from? Yes, it's true. Stamets has made mushrooms his life's work. He knows them like no one else. He presents information based on real science, yet he writes in an easy-to-follow conversational tone. And anyone with a bit of patience can grow fungi using the methods Stamets describes. The things he and his colleagues are doing with mushrooms and tree fungi will astound you. A common mushroom that eliminates diesel fuel from contaminated soil! A tree fungus that out-competes (controls)American Chestnut blight! Erosion control, sewage treatment, enhancing forest health and human health... the list is long and truly inspiring. I am eager for warmer weather so I can get outside and start my own experiments with fungi. And perhaps best of all is the fact that most of these incredibly useful organisms are also edible gourmet delights! This is my first book by Paul Stamets. I am now ready to buy his earlier works (as well as a good field guide to mushrooms and other fungi)."},{"Title":"Mycelium Running: How Mushrooms Can Help Save the World","review":"Paul Stamets truly knows the material and has some great insights into the world of growing mushrooms. He succinctly describes how the science of the relatively unknown 5th kingdom (fungi) can be applied to mycoremediation to help unpollute the planet. Even though this sounds like a heavy subject, the material is understandable for people with little scientific or fungal knowledge and helps anybody understand hwo they too can get closer to mushrooms."},{"Title":"Mycelium Running: How Mushrooms Can Help Save the World","review":"I took my last science course about 40 years ago and had forgotten how interesting science can be. This book is not light reading and some people will probably not get past the first few pages but I really enjoyed it. I found tons of new information on mushrooms in spite of the fact that I studied mushrooms in college (until my father decided science was not for girls and convinced me to go to Law School. Yep, those were the good old days.) You will enjoy it as long as you take into account that it is a scientific book, perfect for geeks."},{"Title":"Mycelium Running: How Mushrooms Can Help Save the World","review":"When research biologist Paul Stamets suggests fungi can help save the world, he is absolutely serious. In fact, he contends they can rescue it in several different ways. There are the medicines to be derived from fungi, probably more than we can yet imagine. Fungi for insect pest control. Fungi can absorb and often digest toxics from their environments---toxics as diverse as heavy metals, PCB's, oil spills, and radioactivity. Fungal partnerships can revolutionize our farming methods. And we can heal the ecosystems of damaged forest lands by introducing selected fungal species into those environments. Paul Stamets is one of the visionaries of our time. He is revolutionizing the ways we look at fungi.This book starts by teaching the basics of mycology. Mycelium are fungal threads that form a network, usually underground. Mushrooms are just their fruiting bodies. Mycelium are so tiny that one cubic inch of soil can contain enough to stretch for 8 miles. But mycelial networks can cover as much as thousands of acres, making certain varieties of fungi the largest organisms in the world, as well as some of the oldest. Fungi build soil by breaking down organic matter, and even cracking apart rocks. Besides that, fungal mycelium enter into symbiotic relationships with trees and other green plants, helpingthem get water and nutrients from the wider environment by surrounding and even penetrating the roots.Paul Stamets believes mycelium are information sharing membranes in their environments. He says they are aware, react to change, have the long term health of their host environment in mind, and devise diverse enzymatic and chemical responses to challenges. He cites research to back up these ideas. In other words, he is telling us fungi are intelligent, sentient organisms. Because they regulate the flow of nutrients through the food chain, we can use them to bioengineer ecosystems.It has been estimated that three fourths of our medicines come from nature originally. Fungi, Paul Stamets claims, show incredible promise as sources of future pharmaceuticals. Many kinds of fungal mycelium compete with bacteria and viruses in the soil, and in doing that, they secrete a variety of chemical substances that kill those microorganisms. So fungi could protect us from microbial infections in three ways: as antibiotics, by increasing our immunity to fight diseases, and by constructing mycelial mats to filter disease contaminated water. He says, \\"Preliminary studies on mushrooms have revealed novel antibiotics, anti-cancer chemotherapeutic agents, immunomodulators, and a slew of other active constituents.\\" Stamets himself has discovered and patented fungal extracts effective in protecting human blood cellsagainst pox viruses. This particular fungi that kills pox viruses lives only in the old growth forests of the Pacific Northwest, as do many other fungal species in that wet climate. He reminds us that these have been logged to the point where only 5% of the old growth are left standing, and who knows what other medicines have been, or still could be lost by this practice. He also discusses the effectiveness some fungal species have shown against the HIV virus, so research is actively continuing on that front.This book contains information on using selected mycelium as \\"mycopesticides\\" to control certain insects, such as ants, termites, or beetle blights in forests, with negligible damage to other species or the environment. And these mycelium will continue to grow and offer long term protection.Mycoremediation is the name Paul Stamets gives to the \\"use of fungi to degrade or remove toxins from the environment\\" by using mycelial mats. Fungi can be used to clean up mercury, polychlorobiphenols (PCB's), fertilizers, munitions, dyes, estrogen-based pharmaceuticals, neurotoxins--including DDT, dioxins, and stored nerve gas. Fungi can also break down oil spills, although several patents on some species are stopping the use of them for clean-ups, he tells us. Mycoremediation apparently takes quite a bit of skill in choosing the best fungi for a given situation, considering both beneficial and hostile competitive microbes in the environment. Also in some cases, these toxin-absorbing mushrooms need to be harvested and taken to toxic waste sites to be stored, incinerated, or otherwise recycled, he advises.This book advocates no-till farming, because tilling breaks up mycelial mats, which then lets the soil erode. No-till farming also disrupts wildlife less, uses less energy and fertilizer, and releases less carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. He tells us that polysaccharides secreted by mycelium bind soils from erosion. And many temperate fungal species produce glycoproteins to protect mycelium from freezing with the added benefit that they protect green plants during extreme cold. Mycelium decomposing organic matter also raises soil temperatures. So by encouraging mycelium formation, farmers canbuild soils while creating mycofiltration membranes to trap farm pollutants, such as water run-off contaminated with manure. Mycelium Running has a large section of detailed information on farming and gardening with mycelium.Paul Stamets explains the principles of mycoforestry, which preserves native forests, recovers and recycles debris, enhances replanted trees, and strengthens sustainability of ecosystems. He describes methods of introducing certain species of fungi into recently logged or burned areas to aid in forest recovery, using native fungal species and matching them to the trees they usually partner. When the mycelium eventually put up mushrooms to reproduce, those are eaten by birds and other animals, who further fertilize the soils and drop seeds from other plant species there, so the new ecosystemdevelops quickly.The last approximately one third of this book is devoted to detailed information on many individual fungal species, their natural habitats, methods of cultivation, how to harvest and cook them if they aren't poisonous, their possible medicinal properties, and their potential for mycorestoration of ecosystems.Paul Stamets has a retail company called Fungi Perfecti, which sells equipment for growing fungi, spores, kits to grow them, fungal medicinals and other fungal derived products, books about fungi, gifts, etc. All the products are certified organic by the Washington State Department of Agriculture. He also offers classes in growing mushrooms and other fungi, and occasional classes in mycorestoration at his place near Olympia, Washington. You can get a color paper catalog from Fungi Perfecti, or visit his web site: [...]Paul Stamets has received many awards from environmental organizations for his research on fungi and repairing damaged ecosystems.

If more people read this book, there could be an ecological revolution.The reader will not go a page in this book without a \\"What?? No Way!!\\" kind of moment. I found myself laughing simply at how amazingly effective and important mushrooms can be.Mushrooms can help save the world. \\"Mycelium Running\\" should be a high school textbook."},{"Title":"Mycelium Running: How Mushrooms Can Help Save the World","review":"When one considers mushrooms, one often thinks of a salad topping or a hallucinogen, but rarely does one consider mushrooms as a means to save the world. In Mycelium Running: How Mushrooms Can Help Save the World, mycologist Paul Stamets proposes that mushrooms can provide much more than a nutritious snack. Stamets is revered as a leader in the field of mushroom cultivation, having published five books on mushroom cultivation and use. By providing strategies by which mushrooms can improve both human and environmental health, cultivation techniques, and a species guide, Mycelium Running serves as an excellent addition to Stamets' other publications.Mycelium Running is divided into three parts: The Mycelial Mind, Mycorestoration, and Growing Mycelia and Mushrooms. The three different parts provide the reader with a better understanding of mycelial structure, four unique mycorestoration strategies, and a detailed guide on how to grow mushrooms. Information is provided on how one can implement some of the proposed restoration strategies.In the Mycelial Mind section, Stamets' passion for mushrooms shines through as he discusses the ubiquity of mushrooms, referred to as \\"mycomagicians,\\" even claiming, \\"without fungi, all ecosystems would fail.\\" The mycelium, which is a web of cells that fruits mushrooms, is \\"so pervasive that a single cubic inch of topsoil contains enough fungal cells to stretch more than 8 miles if placed end to end. I calculate that every footstep I take impacts more than 300 miles of mycelium.\\" Stamets' introduction to fungi goes beyond standard textbook fare, while still providing introductory information on mycelia to any reader completely new to the topic. Stamets then goes on to discuss the medicinal applications of mycelium, including the role of mushrooms in fighting HIV. Other exciting mushroom applications presented in the text include mycorestoration and mycofiltration, where mycelium are used as a means to clean up contaminants, such as oil spills, and filter water.This book presents many exciting ideas to help clean the environment, prevent further contamination, and improve human health, and Stamets managed to convince me of the role mushrooms will play in saving the world. I would recommend Mycelium Running to anyone interested in mushrooms, biology, the environment, human health, or innovative scientific ideas."},{"Title":"Mycelium Running: How Mushrooms Can Help Save the World","review":"I purchased this book as a gift for a fellow graduate student who is studying the relationship between vascular plant roots and fungi.

I studied under Dr Dan Stuntz at UW in the early 70's and one of the authors referred to in Mycelium Running was my lab partner. This book brings back the enthusiasm and joy of mushroom hunting as well as the curiosity and desire to tinker with propagation. The author clearly values species of psylocibe above all, but the book is also full of discussions about (other) edible and medicinal mushrooms and how to grow them.

I find this distracting, irritating and highly inappropriete; as I read science related books for the purpose of science, NOT to be indoctinated into someone's belief system...That being said. Once one gets passed the bulk of \\"personal religious views being stated as fact\\", the book is very enjoyable to read and quite informative.

You cannot find one simple descriptions how to grow mushrooms, the necessary information is spread over various chapters, mixed up with other infirmation about mushrooms.There are no hints which mushroom project would be suitable for beginners and what is better left to experts.The materials he suggests for mushroom growing like sawdust (must be untreated) or straw are either unobtainable for city dwellers or very expensive.There is a great chapter about how vegetables grow better together with mushrooms, but again, no practical step by step guide other than purchasing tablets, which are not available here.After reading the book I think I must search the internet to find out how I really can grow mushrooms.Temperatures are only given in Fahrenheit.The language in vast parts would be suitable for a scientific paper, it is not entertaining to read, even if the information given is quite amazing.Still, the book is a worthwhile read, and I might come back to it when I finally find out how to grow mushrooms other than with a kit, if I find this out at all, as there are not many books on the market."},{"Title":"Mycelium Running: How Mushrooms Can Help Save the World","review":"I was introduced to this book through a magazine article.

This book describes the search for artifacts from Earhart's last flight. The book presents evidence, analyzes its value and develops a hypothesis concerning the events of July, 1937. The author is primarily a archeologist, and while no \\"[fool]-proof\\" evidence is presented, what is known is presented and explained in scientific, but easy to read prose. I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book. My only nits with it are the reproductions of many of the photographs are poor, however, they can all be found at the TIGHAR web site."},{"Title":"Amelia Earhart's Shoes: Is the Mystery Solved?","review":"\\"Amelia Earhart's Shoes: Is the Mystery Solved?\\", Udated 2004 Ed., Thomas F. King, et al., AltaMira Press, NY 2001, ISBN: 0-7591-0131-0, PB 374 pgs., plus 23 pg. Notes, 9 pg. Biblio., 20 pg. Index, & 104 B & W photos, illus. or maps., 6\\" x 9\\".This is an academic work by a contingent of skilled scientific experts whose writings & basic investigative work was coordinated, in part & on behalf of TIGHAR (Int. Group of Historical Aircraft Recovery) & updated 2004. The 27 chapters describe a forensic approach to solve the mystery of aviatrix AE's disappearance enroute 2,223 miles to Howland Isle from Lae, New Guinea, July 2, 1937.The book's format & length makes for difficult reading: -- it is based on best available scientific evidences & hypotheses of multiple disciplines of archeology, geophysics, aeronautics, anthropology, and review of both private & governmental archival information in addition to tabulating their search findings on tiny remote South Pacific Phoenix Isle \\"Gardner\\", but renamed Nikumaroro, or \\"Niku\\". Author was a principle TIGHAR investigator taking part in expeditions to Niku, & he writes with authority, -- having \\"been there, done that!\\"Inclusion of more than 100 photos, illustrations, maps, etc., makes the reading more easily understood & tolerable: -- for it is not a book one picks up and being enchanted 'reads from cover to cover' without pause. For readers who want an up-to-date analysis of AE's disappearance this book is best read after the reader is thoroughly familiar with AE's character, avocations, skills, life experiences's and accolades by the press, politicians & the powerful, -- for Amelia was a complex person living in exciting, changing times on the cutting edge of new technologies.Many of the chapters begin with stanzas of word parodies to be sung to certain melodies, attributable to TIGHAR but not author King. The parodies I found to be highly irregular, unsettling & not in best taste, so downgraded book from 5* to 4*."},{"Title":"Amelia Earhart's Shoes: Is the Mystery Solved?","review":"Who says historical research and science have to be boring? In Amelia Earhart's Shoes, Dr. Tom King and others take us on a winding (sometimes loopy, even!) journey that tries to answer the question: What happened to famed aviatrix Amelia Earhart and renowned navigator Fred Noonan in 1937 after they vanished during her around-the-world flight attempt?Amelia Earhart's Shoes does not pretend to solve the mystery - it does show that by applying the scientific method to a popular event, you can strip away all the myths and fables and assumptions and come up with relatively simple explanations that can be tested to see if they are true or false. That the scientific method may upset a few of those legendary apple carts along the way is proof that it works - something is either true or not true, provable or not provable. In Earhart's case, the truth may turn out to be much more mundane than some of the more colorful \\"solutions\\" to her disappearance would have us believe.There is a lot of information in Shoes, but it is presented in an easy to read, almost chatty style (think ghost stories around the campfire while making s'mores) that keeps you turning the pages to see what the heck is going to happen next. The International Group for Historic Aircraft Recovery (TIGHAR) has now been to the South Pacific eight times to try and prove or disprove their hypothesis that Earhart and Noonan missed their destination, tiny Howland Island, and landed on another deserted island, only to die (or perhaps be completely missed) before the frantic searchers could get to them.Amelia Earhart's Shoes is a great read that should be on the bookshelf of everyone interested in what really did happen out there in the vastness of the Pacific Ocean almost 70 years ago."},{"Title":"Amelia Earhart's Shoes: Is the Mystery Solved?","review":"I do not say this often, and I read a lot of books, but I had a hard time putting this one down. I know enough about Amelia Earhart to make a 30 second discussion, so I came at this with pretty fresh eyes. While deciding whether or not to purchase this book, I read many of the differing theories on her disappearance and the reactions to those theories (some quite vehement), and honestly feel like the authors gave a great description of the mystery and the available data.I am of a scientific background and found the discussion coherent and the assumptions and theories logical. I would have liked a little more meat on the bones, so to speak, but the authors are living by donations to make whatever research opportunities they can - so it's okay. The presentation is scientific enough to satisfy nitpickers like me, but is definitely written for the layman. The tempo and style of the writing is very smooth, casual, and even self-deprecating at times. There were some very minor editing mistakes and presentation issues (my only real reason for not giving 5 stars), but forgivable, being a smaller publisher. If you liked the thought process and detective work of something like Jared Diamond's \\"Collapse\\" - but wanted something MUCH smaller or much more easily digested - this is a good choice. Not nearly as strict, detailed, or complete as \\"Collapse,\\" but the same basic archeology and investigation principles.Given that there was such (healthy) discord on the data and fieldwork, four authors, and competing groups - this book easily has one voice and should be well received by the other Earhart-philes out there. Kudos to the authors!"},{"Title":"Amelia Earhart's Shoes: Is the Mystery Solved?","review":"This is an absolutely fantastic book!! It is extremely well written in a very readable and friendly style. It describes the search for evidence to support the hypothesis that Amelia Earhart and her navigator Fred Noonan wound up on a certain island in the Pacific after radio communication between her and her contacts near and around Howland Island was lost on 2 July, 1937. The four co-authors of this book are all scientists who have been very careful in applying the scientific method in this historical/archaeological research project. Well illustrated with photographs and diagrams, this book is a must read for anyone interested in Amelia Earhart and her fate, in history of the mid-twentieth century, in how scientists work or simply in great detective stories. Very highly recommended!!"},{"Title":"Amelia Earhart's Shoes: Is the Mystery Solved?","review":"For years, the mystery of Amelia Earhart's disappearance has intrigued me. The likely story seems to be that she went down in the sea, never to be found again, but every once in a while, another bit of evidence crops up and implies there is more to the story. How, then, could I ignore \\"Amelia Earhart's Shoes\\"?Written by a team of researchers, the book poses many questions right up front and provides transcripts from Earhart's fateful last few radio transmissions. They raise issues about Gardner Island, which could have been a logical emergency landing site, a theory made more likely by the bits of Plexiglas, steel, struts, shoes, ashes, and so forth, found on the island's shores and among the dense trees and foliage. The book peels back the layers like a good mystery novel, revealing new clues that sometimes turn out to be red herrings, and leading to deeper questions related to the island's native and military past. In the same way the researchers have spent years trying to unravel this story, with triumphs and disappointments, they lay it all out for the readers to experience the same emotions of the archaeological and historical struggle.The narrative is full of facts and details, yet written in a style that is sometimes conversational and occasionally even tongue-in-cheek. We get a sense of the hard work, frustration, and crazed moments in the blistering heat that have defined the researchers' last two-plus decades.All in all, it's a valuable piece in the Earhart puzzle, honest, hopeful, albeit incomplete. The mystery is not yet solved. There is more work to be done."},{"Title":"Amelia Earhart's Shoes: Is the Mystery Solved?","review":"I saw one of the people involved in this project speak at EAA's big national air show in Oshkosh, WI last summer.

I find the appoach of the authors much more satisfying than those who claim to have &quot;solved the mystery&quot; based on interviews with &quot;witnesses&quot; removed a generation or more from the possibility of seeing first-hand anything that would be applicable to the search for Earhart.

I've always been interested in what really happened to Amelia Earhart, but always just assumed that her plane crashed into the ocean. This book, however, completely opened my eyes to a new hypothosis: that Amelia and her navigator managed to land on an island and send out radio signals for help. The information presented in this book isn't just wild guesses and conspiracy theories - the authors make a point of backing up their thoughts with cold, hard evidence. I was hooked from the first page and got so engrossed that I ended up not doing my work at my job just so that I could finish a few more chapters. The book also has a wicked sense of humor and debunks the myth that scientists are just stodgy old guys. I'd reccomend this book to anyone with even an ounce of curosity.

It is so rare to find a book on a controversy in history and not have it be biased towards the conclusion the author wants you to believe.

As lead author Thomas King puts it, \\"Most people have more pressing things to do\\" than hunt for a lost airplane that, given the odds, would more likely than not be under three miles of water.The TIGHARs work, for free, in their spare time, on the assumption that, despite the geographical odds, Earhart and her navigator Fred Noonan didn't just run out of gas and sink under the ocean. They think Earhart missed her target but may have crash landed on an intermittently inhabited (but in 1937 empty) island named Nikumaroro, where Earhart and Noonan might have either survived for a while or been eaten by crabs.It's \\"a mystery that can't be put down,\\" King says.But hard to pin down.Since the publication of \\"Amelia Earhart's Shoes\\" in 2001, the TIGHARs have run down more physical evidence, including things that look a lot like panels from a Lockheed Electra, but nothing definitive yet.

Ms. Thirkell died before finishing it, and it was finished by one of her friends. The difference shows, and it is instructive. Angela Thirkell was the mistress of light, slightly ironic prose. The world her characters inhabited probably seemed old fashioned sixty years ago when she wrote them. Her style was uniquely her own. She seemed to go off on tangents (divigations, she called them) yet they always illuminated her characters and the story she was telling. The divigations are here but instead of a souffle lightness, they are heavy and show the effort that went into them. The characters are not quite as silly and literate as they were when Thirkell's effortless erudition created their dialogue. Still, this is Barsetshire, and all the familiar faces are here--for what clearly Thirkell herself knew would be the last time.Even though not vintage Thirkell, such a visit is well worth the time."},{"Title":"Three Score and Ten","review":"While it's very nice to have a final 'episode' to Angela Thirkell's long running chronicle this book misses too many marks to be be entirely satisfying. The change of author comes through all too clearly with a cloying sweetness evident throughout with none of the original acerbity to offset it. The sharpness of Thirkell's social commentary is also missing. I feel sure,for example, that although she may have planned the final outcome for her young characters Ludo and Lavinia she would also have had much to say on the changed world that made them a suitable match. A pleasant read but not an excellent one"},{"Title":"The Heir Hunter","review":"A good read. The author might have done a slightly better job tieing the characters together earlier in the book.

The realization /that they do, boggled my mind through this whole book. The author takes the reader on a roller coaster ride that, while it may not be the usual fair for an heir hunter, is certainly plausible and in fact may be expected at some time through their career. Character development could have been a bit better, because I found it difficult sometmes to place the secondary characters and what group they belonged to. However the whirl wind intrigue and world travel to track down the heirs of a multmillion dollar fortune were more than enough to take my mind off any flaws in this book.Id like to see more from this author and in fact I could easily see Heir Hunter becoming a series."},{"Title":"The Heir Hunter","review":"This book moved rapidly and was an anjoyable,although harmless read. Others have spoken of the plot line that exists in this work.

The story dos have some good double twists and, once the story takes shape, it is a good page turner.

I get tired of hearing them say that, then sprinting to my computer, hyperventilating until I put my name in an Unclaimed Property list, then find I got nothing coming after all.Reading Heir Hunter didn't take me long to figure out, the TV casters are wrong to tell their viewers, \\"Hang up on those guys and or gals who call and say 'I believe I have located some assets you may be able to claim. You can find that fortune yourself!\\" You can see from this book, it doesn't always work that way. Nick Merchant, in Heir Hunter, doesn't fool around with the minimum of $50.00 to several thousand we may find on an Unclaimed Property list--if we are lucky. Nick finds there is a way to locate the big stuff, estates and other assets that are buried in musty old court records, archives and other hiding places. Assets that belonged to people who died without a will and which may permanently escheat to the state or county coffers if you don't find them in time. And how you gonna find them if you don't know where to look? Nick and his associate Alex Mareno learned, and went for the gold.Chris Larsgaard's first book is a spine-tingler. We find ourselves salivating with Nick and Alex as they lay the ground work to attempt to locate the heirs to a twenty two million dollar fortune. Their commission of twenty percent of that amount (you figure it out in dollars and cents) if they locate the heirs, is a nice chunk of change as compared to the twelve thou Nick has just made on a case. We salivate, hyperventilate, shudder and shake as we trail behind these two P.I's on their perilous journey to the proverbial pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.As you follow them through the twists and turns of a most uncommon heir hunting case, you might want to pop a heart pill or two, or whatever you do to quiet your heart's thudding when a read gets too intense. The suspense builds and builds. The story encompasses murder, greed, mystery and yes, love. I won't parrot what other reiewers have written. When you buy the book you can see for yourself that the reviews are a good start on letting you know of the action and suspense in Chris Laarsgard's first novel. One wonders if Chris will give us another such thriller--or as to be hoped--several. He whetted our appetites for a new kind of thriller, heir hunting, then left us wanting more.

Nick Merchant, the protagonist is anything but cliche. His brand of investigative work has not been explored in fiction before, and I found the concept quite interesting. This business of searching for heirs in order to recover a percentage of the estate involves some curious moral dilemmas, and Nick Merchant grapples with these issues in a very human way. At no point in the novel does Nick transform into a stereotype. Both he and his job are complex, and Larsgaard does a nice job in creating a character that seems to do the right things, without being arrogant.

He has good news and bad. A distant uncle you never knew has died, but he's left you a fortune. It's a dream come true.Or, in the case of Chris Larsgaard's new thriller, &quot;The Heir Hunter,&quot; it could be the start of a nightmare. Larsgaard offers an insider's primer on the murky world of skip-tracers and other people who hunt for humans. And just when you thought it was safe to send your credit card number to an allegedly &quot;secure&quot; Web site, Larsgaard serves up about a hundred more sinister reasons you shouldn't even talk to another human being for the rest of your life if you truly value your privacy.&quot;The Heir Hunter&quot; is original and cool. Larsgaard's debut is a masterly bit of suspense writing."},{"Title":"The Heir Hunter","review":"It's hard to believe this is the authors first book. You hear about books that you can't put down, but this is truly that book! Never a dull moment. The author weaves a web of thrills and suspense that rivals most veteran authors. This book will not go away silently. Do yourself a favor and read it!"},{"Title":"The Heir Hunter","review":"A mysterious millionaire dies with 22 million in the bank and no family making a claim on the estate. Enter the very engaging main characters. I'm not usually crazy about PI books, but this one was a real breath of fresh air. The main characters connect people with inheritances, which is a fresh idea in itself being that they're the first PI's I've heard of who are not trying to (yawn) solve a murder or spy on someone. These two, Nick and Alex, former lovers, are more mercenary in their approach, unashamedly taking up to 35% of lucky heirs' money. These good guys do bad things but are still likable while they bend the law as far as it will bend. Great concept, well-executed with an extremely quick moving plot. I finished it in a day, which I suppose is a good sign. I'm tempted to give it five stars but I want to see what the author can do for an encore. We'll see."},{"Title":"The Heir Hunter","review":"This is not normally the type of book I read, yet I was totally enthralled after the first opening sequence. Nick and Alex are your average, everyday people that are just trying to have the things they want. I felt like I knew these characters very intimately halfway through the book. I also never had heard of heir hunting and it seemed a whole lot easier than it was portrayed in the book! Having your life in danger sure would make me change my mind about searching all over the world to get any money-even millions of dollars. The book was fast-paced and worth every minute of reading. The next book by this author should prove to be just as suspenseful."},{"Title":"The Heir Hunter","review":"Nicholas Merchant is a sort of private detective, who finds the relatives of wealthy individuals who leave no immediate relatives and no will. One case in particular, involving an old man with a multi-million dollar estate leads to government cover-ups and Nazi millions in secret Swiss Accounts. While the story seemed rather derivative (Nazi hidden treasure), I also had a difficult time keeping all the villians straigh. And quite frankly, the secret that was being protected just didn't seem that big. I would read a sequel because the writing was good and the premise sound but hopefully the plot would improve on another outing."},{"Title":"The Heir Hunter","review":"A certain old man dies in Hudson, NY. As it turns out, he has a sizable estate and no heirs to give it to....here is where the Heir Hunter begins his job: finding the heirs and distributing the money after keeping a good percentage. Sound easy? there is a very aggressive competition and dangers of many kinds.I thought this book to be very entertaining. The plot is solid and keeps us readers glued to the book to find out what will eventually happen. I knew who the &quot;bad guys&quot; were, but I could not imagine the end would come that way...!the writing is very easy to read and there are almost no inconsistencies. The characters are very real and seem to flow together with the plot. The absence of any real sexual aspect makes this a nice change.Good book and very entertaining!"},{"Title":"The Heir Hunter","review":"This is a potboiler where the pot really boils. The subject of heir hunting is a new one. The story is tightly written and moves along at a fabulous pace. The sentences are simple and the grammar is good. This is excellent writing, indeed. The plot was well researched, e.g. the author gives a perfect description of the town of Geneva. There is nothing sloppy here. The story itself is fabulous and it is developed extremely well. The international conspiracy does make sense and is interesting: Such cases of hiding German assets after 1945 do exist, and so do the characters who disappear into the woodwork with the loot. Small correction: Hitler would not have appointed anybody that young, and such a recent member of the Party, to such a high position. And why is just about everybody over 6 feet tall? I recommend this book not just as a good mystery, but as a true work of literature."},{"Title":"The Heir Hunter","review":"I aquired a copy of Chris Larsgaard's novel 'The Heir Hunter'and what an adventure it turned out to be.

I am eagerly awaiting Mr. Larsgaard's next novel."},{"Title":"The Heir Hunter","review":"This book began promising, but I felt it strayed and became formulaic toward the finish. I felt that the characters were fairly cardboard, although the premise was interesting. I read about a thriller a week and this is one that I wished I had passed on.

In a nutshell, there were not too many things that this book offerred, that others in the past and future have or will not."},{"Title":"The Heir Hunter","review":"I found the book rather amateur and the characters one-dimensional.

What a great book"},{"Title":"The Heir Hunter","review":"This book has a wonderful original premise. The main characters (a guy and girl naturally) are PI's who look for beneficiaries of recluses who die with $$ in the bank. Don't be fooled though - this is not a PI novel. It's more of a story of two young and naive &quot;heir hunters&quot; who think life is all laughs and $, that is, until they stumble upon a multi-million dollar estate they have no business messing with. There is a great atmosphere of strangled paranoia in this book, and the main characters, although not as well drawn as they might be, are likable and easy to root for, despite their flaws which are in abundance. The underlying conflict in this book is wild, but Larsgard does pull it off. Only nitpick was me wanting to see more characterization, but it's easy to forgive when the story's this good."},{"Title":"The Heir Hunter","review":"When reclusive octogenarian Gerald Jacobs died, he left behindan estate valued at $22 million. No record of Jacob having a lifeprior to a few years ago when he arrived at Hudson, New York exists leaving no heir.Through a bribe, Alex Moreno learns about the estate. Along with her West Coast partner, private investigator Nick Merchant, they begin a search for the missing beneficiary, knowing they can earn several million on this case. They break into the home of the deceased, but run into trouble with the law and rival agencies even more unsavory than Alex and Nick. Worse yet, the Feds want this investigation aborted because Jacob was in the witness protection program.THE HEIR HUNTER is an exciting look at the lucrative but extremely competitive heir hunting business. The story line is fast-paced and filled with non-stop action even though debut author Chris Larsgaard occasionally slows down the plot with too much explanation. The lead protagonists are an intriguing duo. They are not only partners, but former lovers as well. Alex resides in Albany, New York while Nick lives in San Francisco but even keeping a continent between them can not ease the state of sexual tension that exists between them. No matter how good the characterizations and the storyline are, the appeal of this novel lies in the authentic descriptions of the world of the heir hunter, a very intriguing and exciting place to be.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"The Heir Hunter","review":"I had a general impression of what heir hunting was, but I had the sense that a blown computer was about as dangerous as it got. Boy, was I wrong! Nick Merchant and Alex Moreno are heir hunters who've lucked onto a multi-million-dollar estate. If they can track down the dead man's lawful heirs before the competition does, they'll earn the payday of a lifetime. Unfortunately, they aren't the only ones searching for the heirs of the enigmatic corpse. Nick and Alex are poleaxed by competitors, bombed and shot at by assassins, framed for crimes they didn't commit, and threatened by the FBI which has a vested interest in sticking by their story that the dead man never existed. Forced into fleeing under assumed names, Nick and Alex are determined to clear their names and solve the case, even as the bodies pile up around them. Nick and Alex have a past and, hopefully, a future! The chemistry between them works and I hope to see them again in the talented Chris Larsgaard's next book."},{"Title":"The Heir Hunter","review":"The Heir Hunter is a book of suspense with a difference. The difference here is that the occupation of the protagonist is an heir hunter. A what? Nick Merchant is a private investigator, but he specialises in tracking down heirs to estates and matches them up, taking a percentage of the estate as a fee. It's this aspect that gives this story it's uniqueness and added appeal.When Nick and his partner, Alex Moreno, find out about an estate that contains assets in excess of twenty-two million dollars, they think this could be the payday they've dreamt of. As with all things that seem too good to be true, there has to be a problem, and in this case, competition from the opposition is the least of Nick's worries - only he doesn't know that. The deceased was in the FBI's witness protection program, and they're pretty keen for things to remain nice and quiet. Producing heirs to the estate would not be desirable. On top of that, there appears to be an unknown group of killers who use a far more permanent means of keeping things quiet.This is a face-paced story that takes place on both coasts of America as well as places in between, Germany and Switzerland. Nick and Alex make a very likable couple who work well together with none of the sexual tension other authors seem to feel is necessary when using a male / female combination.It's a first-class thriller that reminds me of the best work produced by the likes of Thomas Perry."},{"Title":"The Heir Hunter","review":"I couldn't put this book down! The best story I've read in years. The characters are well developed, and I really liked them.

Not only did I learn about heir hunting, but I was taken to many places near and far, thrown for loops, teased with romance, and thrilled each and every page of the way. Chris Larsgaard has an incredible way with words. He is eloquent, enticing, and inspiring. This was a fresh change from the typical suspense books. I hope Mr. Larsgaard is in the works of writing more books such as this, and quickly! What a treasure! What a talent! Thank you for the opportunity to experience a unique and outstanding book. Pj McGinty"},{"Title":"The Heir Hunter","review":"I'll admit, having never heard of an heir hunter, I wasn't surehow interesting I'd find this book. Mr. Larsgaard has done awonderful job, not only introducing a field that I knew nothing about, but writing a very entertaining story as well. This is not just a very good first novel, it's a terrific book period. The characters are well defined and have indepth personalitles. You care about the characters from page one. The storyline is complex and compelling. It was quite a page turner and I hope that Mr. Larsgaard plans on a long writing career in the future. The main character, Nick, came to life throughout the pages. With twists and turns, as well as intrigue and conspiracy, this book made for quite an exciting ride. It's very much worth reading."},{"Title":"The Causes Of Rape: Understanding Individual Differences In Male Propensity For Sexual Aggression (The Law and Public Policy.)","review":"This book is clearly the definitive book on the subject. Extensively researched this book covers every aspect of enforced sex from the literature (going back to Greek times), from history as in the rape of Nanking and the Russian use of rape in Berlin almost as a matter of policy, and even in the animal kingdom.The authors also attempt to identify the causes rape using mental illnesses or more particularily the personality disorders as a contributing factor. Other aspects such as the relationship of pornography with rape are investigated (and in the case of porn it appears that the almost explosive growth of porn in recent years is lowering rape incidence).The ending chapters list several areas where treatments have been tried with mixed results, and give several areas where additional research is indicated. This is a splendid work on the subject, and may remain the definitive work unless the directions indicated here point the direction to additional research."},{"Title":"REAL-TIME SYSTEMS","review":"This book covers real-time systems in a 'traditional', theoretical, way. The book focuses on hard real-time scheduling, and more recent issues - such as the use of time-triggered systems - are given no coverage. It does cover issues like RMA, etc, clearly. Further examples from real applications would be a real bonus: almost all the examples are of an abstract nature."},{"Title":"REAL-TIME SYSTEMS","review":"I will say this book is really the best book I have ever read in the field of real-time systems. The author is a distinguished researcher in this field, as no one will doubt this. The book covers all the issues(new and old) in the real-time systems. Written in plain language with ample examples, the book is easy to read. At the same time, the author deliberately maintained the depth of the book, embeded the theoretical stuff in it. However, I have to say this book mainly focuss on the hard real-time systems. Maybe this is because soft real-time is still a new issue in this field. Keep this book if you are a researcher in this filed, or you are a student studying this course. You'll have the same feeling with me."},{"Title":"Kingdom Come: A Novel","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed reading KINGDOM COME. Authors Burkett and Bunn have written some fine novels and have the genre pretty much perfected. This must be difficult when writing a Christian novel. You must be careful with the language and use of violence while maintaining a realistic storyline that isn't pure pabulum. In this, they have succeeded. KINGDOM COME had me wondering just who the bad guys were, what the alleged bad guys were up to, and how the situation could be resolved. All in all, a real page-turner. I only had two problems with the story. First, what was the purpose of the fence? It was the single most damning evidence that the community was most likely a cult, yet it was never adequately explained (at least to my satisfaction). Secondly, the book ended too quickly. I would have liked to read more of what eventually happened to all the major players. There was no mention at all of the despicable Miller Kedrick. That he was no Christian, though a major player in the church, was obvious from the beginning. Did he go to prison? Did he commit suicide? I think the book needed another 10 to 15 pages to tie up the loose ends and let the reader know where everyone ended up - both the good guys and the bad. I'm still happy with the book and glad I read it. I look forward to more books from Burkett/Bunn."},{"Title":"Kingdom Come: A Novel","review":"This is a great book. The plot is unexpected, the events and characters unfold in a very quick pace at the end. There are some great descriptions of a personal experience with God. I was thinking the wrong thing when I started this book - I thought I already knew the plot - I was wrong - Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Kingdom Come: A Novel","review":"Kingdom Come by Larry Burkett & T Davis BunnKingdom Come: A Novelis very well written. It is full of twists and turns. Is Kingdom Come a cult? Who are the bad guys? What are they up to? I was thrilled with everything EXCEPT the ending. It doesn't end at all. It's a cliffhanger in the tradition of the 1930s movie serials. Is there a sequel? If not, I would not recommend the book to anyone because the ending is SO frustrating."},{"Title":"Kingdom Come: A Novel","review":"If you want a clean thriller with good moral Christian values, then you can't go wrong with this book.

Her prose is easy to read and her descriptions vivid. However, as with the other Oprah books I've read it was extremely depressing and when I finished felt as though I had wasted my time. What is the point?"},{"Title":"The Book of Ruth","review":"The story was moving but I didn't find the prose well written. It seemed clumsy and childish and prone to nauseous metaphors. The story was sad (neither a good or bad quality in a book) but the main character was unsympathetic. She had an &quot;out&quot; through her Aunt if she had truly desired it. The ending (where her Aunt rescues her) was cloying and unlikely. I picked this book and _The Rapture of Cannan_ up at a local bookstore. I was unimpressed with both. Reading the reviews I find both were reccommended through &quot;Oprah's&quot; book club. While I find the idea interesting, appreciate the sales revenue for writers, and like that she encourages people to read, I think I will avoid her selections in the future. Perhaps I am a book snob but I am not sure why people would care about the opinions of a woman who hosts a daytime television show. It seems like she picks rather melodramatic books of uneven quality. If she wishes to read and reccomend books about characters facing difficult situations and odds, I wish she would pick something truly challenging like _Push_ by Saphire."},{"Title":"The Book of Ruth","review":"As I got on the treadmill and turned on the tape, the plantiff sound of Ruth's voice made me feel I was reading her private journal and I hesitated for a moment. Did I want to know? Like other readers of this book, at times I felt repelled by the life circumstances of this troubled family. But having come from a poor, troubled family in a small town myself, I somehow found empathy even for May and Ruby. Could this have been my life if, by the Grace of God, things hadn't been different? Ruth, telling me her story in her own words, somehow helped me restore a link to my childhood that I had severed sometime in the past when I felt threatened by it. I don't know whether I would have loved this story so much if I had merely read the words off a page. My first experience with an audio book version of a novel was superb! Thank you"},{"Title":"The Book of Ruth","review":"The Book of Ruth is a study in the kind of life nobodywants to live. It's a lesson in the dangers of empathy andthe seductiveness of the familiar. Why don't people, particularly women, leave lives that abuse them? Because sometimes the very dysfunctional family has tiny elements of thevery functional. And, tiny though they may be, they becomehuge in their relativity.Ruth thinks she is retarded. Her mother said so. She iswithout a sense of her self except as a character in thelives of those around her. She doesn't even get to becalled by her name until late in the book when she is objectively discussed by others. Her only route to actualization, to existence, is through her relationships.Ruth's not retarded. On the contrary. She knows too much.Feels too much. And her empathy leads her to allowing alattitude for insanity in others that nearly kills her.Her mother, May, destroys Ruth emotionally and intellectually. Yet the feeling reader has to respond to the pathosof May's own sorry history. Ruth's husband Ruby has rottenteeth and smells, but he has one great redemption. He lovesher. He can be anything, just short of murderer, but if heloves her it is enough. He is horrible, but he is wonder-ful in his love. And it's not his fault. Because somethings really could &quot;make you want to stab, and stab, andstab.&quot; Ruth feels responsibility for everyone, but makesno one take responsibility for themselves. She works over-time to maintain her own sanity, yet allows insanity inothers because they came by it honestly. She asks for sovery little. She gets virtually nothing. That's what she'slearned to expect. We can hold her responsible and disdainher. Or recognize that her foolishness is borne of hervision: She can look back and understand far too well. Thepresent is too gripping, the future to unpromising, to puther focus on either of those. But a painful past she understands. Poor Ruth. She is the saddest of literary characters...And she comes by it honestly."},{"Title":"The Book of Ruth","review":"In the Old Testament, the Book of Ruth tells the story of Ruth's loyalty to her widowed mother-in-law, Naomi, after the death of Ruth's husband. In this extraordinary first novel by Jane Hamilton, after May's son leaves home for college, her daughter Ruth stays on, in spite of a miserable childhood in which May relentlessly belittled her daughter and worshipped her son. Ruth, as faithful and dutiful as her Biblical namesake, nearly crushed by her mother's simmering rage, learns to hide her magnificent love of life, so that only the reader and the very few people who care for her know of her poignant insights, hilarious perspective, and tenacious spirit. After a brief period of relative peace between mother and daughter, Ruth falls in love and marries another wounded soul, Ruby, and the three create a home together where trouble is just waiting to happen. What a magnificent writer! Hamilton won the PEN/Ernest Hemingway Foundation Award, given for best first novel, for The Book of Ruth, in 1989. This is a grim and funny story, and an excellent choice for book clubs"},{"Title":"The Book of Ruth","review":"This book is very well-written. Hamilton's writing is quirky and poetic. But there is very, very little plot to the end. I grew impatient for *something* significant to happen, but not much did till the last 75 pages, when the book becomes a real page turner.That being said, this is an interesting and accurate portrayal of a segment of our population that many of us never see--or choose to ignore. If you've ever wondered how people can be so ignorant and short-sighted as to keep themselves trapped in a cycle of desperate unhappiness and poverty, this book offers some explanation.Not everyone rises above their circumstances. Despite what we read, that is the rare exception, not the rule. Ruth is a protagonist, yes--not the heroine we hope she will become. Few people manage to rise above such unfortunate circumstances, and her story (up till the last 75 pages) is sadly common for persons reared with almost every card stacked against them. I admire Hamilton's realistic portrayal of Ruth, and her unwaveringly and heartbreakingly realistic portrayal of her."},{"Title":"The Book of Ruth","review":"The Book of Ruth tells the sad story of the dimwitted Ruth, daughter of a spiteful woman who favors her genius son more. The leading lady tries to make good of her life, and thinks things are going well for her when she marries Ruby Dahl, a drunkard who can't hold down a job. Despite his many shortcomings, she tries to see good in him, even after a night when a shocking incident changes everything.This was an excellent book. It took a little while for me to really get into it, but when I did, I breezed through the last two-hundred or so pages. You come to really know and care about the characters (even weirdos like Randall or Dee Dee Foote) and when it comes time for the book to end, it's almost impossible to let these people go quite yet. I got through the climax in the breakroom at work and almost started bawling in front of a couple coworkers, including the boss. :)I'd suggest this for anybody. But be warned, this isn't a warmth-and-fuzzies story. It's definitely not a Secret Life of Bees kind of story. It's packed with great writing and strong characters that you'll remember for a long time."},{"Title":"The Book of Ruth","review":"This book has been in my bookcase for several years waiting to be read. After seeing the made-for-tv movie version of this book a couple of weeks ago, I decided to pick it up and read it. There were many parts of the movie that were unexplained and I knew that the answers would be found in the book. I was right. This book examines how people adjust to their environments and how sometimes they love unloveable personalities. Throughout the book, Ruth makes excuses for her mother's behavior, her husband's behavior and to a small extent, her brother's behavior. She reasons away other people's bitterness, slothfulness, drug addictions, etc. until it comes to a point when she can no longer make excuses or look the other way. It's a good observation of the different kinds of people that make up this world that we live in."},{"Title":"The Book of Ruth","review":"I was amazed last year to discover Jane Hamilton. I'm really glad I disregarded my initial impulse _not_ to read _Book of Ruth_ because it was an Oprah pick (it's a prejudice I have, and I should know better than to make gross generalizations). It's like nothing I've read since _The Sound and the Fury_, and although I (understandably) hesitated to mention Hamilton and Faulkner in the same thought, there it is.For once, my ability to put my thoughts into words may fail me in describing the engrossment with which I enjoyed this novel. A surprise from a friend of 4 years' standing was her telling me that she had read it, too, and that, while she grudgingly admitted that it was \\"probably well-written\\" (I'd never heard her make a value judgment on her reading before--she was always amazingly self-deprecating about her \\"beach-level\\" reading habit), it was also a \\"downer.\\" I wasn't hooked in my reading of _Ruth_ at that point, and almost decided to abandon the effort based on her comment. I'm an avid reader, but I don't _look_ for depressing novels.The novel is not depressing. It's beautiful in its evocation of what p.c.-speech calls \\"marginal\\" characters. The power with which the effects of the mother's (and, horrifically, a father's) personality are conveyed is very affecting. The optimism, and--if the pun can be pardoned--the ruthlessness with which the daughter (and a son) nonetheless perseveres in her/his attainment of all the riches that every life offers are conveyed with no less impact. The novel truly amazes in its depictions of the squalor, hope, passions, and horror unthinkably (and unthinkingly) wrought upon _present_ human relations by _past_ human relations. A strong reader will come away from _Ruth_ with some of the optimism, in wonder at the persistence of the human need for love and the many forms it can take. A reader less strong might put _Ruth_ aside without being able to finish it. Both will remember the experience."},{"Title":"The Book of Ruth","review":"Ruth is a girl we all know. We see her in the laundry mat. We catch a glimpse of her buying groceries. We past her rundown house. We sit next to her in high school math. We watch her struggle. We may be the one who always looks away. Or we may be Ruth, unsophisticated, confused, and desperate for love. The point is that she's there. She's everywhere. None of us may have ever given her the time of day, but Ruth has feelings too. Ruth has opinions, friends, goals, and Ruth is living life, just like the rest of us. Give Ruth a chance. See her for who she is. She doesn't want your pity; she doesn't want your scorn. Ruth just wants to be accepted for who she is: Ruth. Be careful when you read this novel. It will creep into you, and Ruth and her friends will become a part of your life."},{"Title":"The Book of Ruth","review":"It's hard to imagine a writer more capable of literally sucking you into the life of her protagonist, Ruth. Once you've turned a few pages, you're going to live it through til the bitter end. And a bitter end it is. Other readers speak of Ruth's subtle transformation in the last two chapters, but I found it ambiguous at best. What really bugged me about &quot;The Book of Ruth&quot; was the main character herself, who narrates her family's life story with amazing astuteness, but remains absolutely clueless about her own dreadful choices. Ruth's family is sour and [understandably] self-absorbed, but none of them measures up in abusiveness to her vapid husband, Ruby, whose unpredictable behavior Ruth overlooks and excuses until he inevitably erupts in a murdeous rage. Guaranteed to be thought-provoking!"},{"Title":"The Book of Ruth","review":"So many of the books in this space (personal narrative of a person who generally isn't in a position to speak) fall into what I think of as the wishful thinking trap. That is, they can't seem to resist some kind of transformative moment which saves the character-- some kind of stock situation that, while tempting to believe, is ultimately unfulfilling because it's so false.The Book of Ruth doesn't write personal history the way we want it to be. It writes history the way it so often is. Some lives are wasted. Some abusive relationships aren't all bad. Some people never recover, no matter how much you wish they would. While this book doesn't close the door on Ruth, it doesn't leave you with a satisfying road map of happiness either. And that uncompromising vision is part of what makes it so strong and beautiful.Hamilton is a very good writer, and can make something beautiful even when logically you agree with Aunt Syd and know it's a disaster. Really a marvelous book."},{"Title":"The Book of Ruth","review":"None are so blind as those who do not wish to see. Ruth, the unreliable narrator of this sad tale, lives this maxim throughout her life. \\"The Book of Ruth\\" is an uncomfortable reminder of how we can be blind when we want something bad enough--even if that thing is an unwise choice. With success, Jane Hamilton places the reader in the mind of a disturbed young woman; somehow Hamilton creates sympathy for the undesirable characters in this novel. Definitely a triumph for the author's first book.Do not read this book if you are looking for something lite to snuggle up with. The Book of Ruth is disturbing; it will make you think."},{"Title":"The Book of Ruth","review":"The first book that I ever read by Jane Hamilton was Map of the World, which pulled me into the dreary world of its heroine and kept me too intrigued to put it down (although I wanted to many times). When I began reading The Book of Ruth, I thought that it would prove to be vastly different from Ms. Hamilton's other novel. It wasn't. Hamilton has a gift for drawing the reader into Ruth's life, a life full of disappointment and anger. The cycle of abuse that Ruth's mother creates creeps up on you gradually, until you are so disturbed that you wonder if this book could really be about monsters instead of human beings.After I closed the last page of the book, I threw it across the room. I wanted to hate it, but I found myself thinking about it more and more. The Book of Ruth is unforgettable because it is a complex portrait of an outwardly simple person. Everyone thinks that Ruth is stupid, but she possesses a keen awareness of something higher. Her character is a martyr, but also one of great dignity and strength."},{"Title":"The Book of Ruth","review":"This is the story of Ruth. It is the story of her struggles, her fears and anxieties, her victories and failures but, ultimately, it is the story of her growth. Like a butterfly emerging from a cocoon Ruth emerges from her trials stronger and more beautiful than she ever believed she could be.I love this story. Just reading it is an affirmation of the human spirit. My own life has been a thousand times easier than Ruth's and yet Jane Hamilton weaves her tail so skillfully that I still could see bits of myself in poor Ruth. And in the end, after seeing how Ruth overcame so much, I knew for sure that I could take on the world and win. Damn right! One hand tied behind my back.Go Ruth! And go Jane Hamilton! Books like this don't come along too often and when they do they should be mandatory reading by order of the king of the universe."},{"Title":"The Book of Ruth","review":"The Book of Ruth's title reminds me instantly of the Biblical Book of Ruth. However, this novel is far from a religious story. If anything, it is rather anti-religious, and a deeply funny book as a result.The book starts a bit slowly, and the reader is rather unsure what the point of the book is until the voice of Ruth telling you about her odd life wins you over. Ruth is a rather dim-witted girl, yet the narrator of the novel. She tells about her life with her genius brother, Matt, and her mother, May, and then her involvement with Ruby, the man she falls in love with. Ruth's life is far from glamorous, being teased in school, working at a dry-cleaners, her evenings filled with bowling or walking with her man. The novel's characters border on the grotesque, yet because the story is told from Ruth's point of view, I sympathized with Ruth, and it is easy to understand why her life is the way it is and how she found it difficult not to live differently.Ruth is not a genius like her brother, who takes off the first chance he gets, leaving Ruth to live with their mother. Yet Ruth is intelligent in her own way--she is not booksmart, and not smart in love, but she has a certain common sense expressed in sarcastic comments that make you laugh out loud. Some of her remarks are pointed at religion, and understandably, because while her mother is difficult to get along with, her mother believes in trying to live the life their Reverend preaches to them. Ruth realizes whatever the Reverend preaches doesn't seem to make any difference, and after the dramatic climax of the novel, she tells him so in no uncertain terms, while he is hard-pressed to know how to reply or comfort her following her tragedy. One example of her humor is when she comments upon how God is always trying to tell people what to do like \\"Honor your mother\\" but that was easy for God to say because his mother was a saint.Without giving away the ending, it is sufficient to say that Ruth makes it on her own, without her mother, brother, or man, and certainly without God. What she learns is the strength she has inside and that is greater than her reliance on anyone else. It is an inspiring, yet a very down-to-earth story. There are no great revelations, but rather a simple determination to carry-on.I think the book will appeal to most readers who aren't afraid to look at real life. This is a dissecting of human nature at its finest--which is the whole purpose of literature.Tyler R. Tichelaar, author of Iron Pioneers, The Marquette Trilogy: Book One"},{"Title":"The Book of Ruth","review":"The Book of Ruth is about a young woman growing up in a small town in the midwest with her dominating, controlling mother, May, and her genious brother Matt, whom May dotes upon. May has always treated Ruth as a slightly retarded girl who has brought her nothing but disappointment, especially compared to Matt. The book describes the difficult path Ruth takes to grow out of this definition of herself. Through her development, the one person who truly believes in her is her Aunt Sid, with whom she corresponds with through letters from childhood through adulthood. The story starts when Ruth is about 10, goes back into her past through flashbacks, and progresses until she gets married and has a child. At each stage, Ruth is sensitive to the cues she gets about whom she should be from authority figures (the Reverend, her mother, Aunt Sid, a social worker), but she also shows a good amount of skepticism as she struggles to match her own thinking to those expectations. As a child, she grudgingly plays the role of the dumb student even if she only half believes it herself, while she genuinely seems to accept the role of wife and mother and changes to match her perception of those roles. All through the book, Ruth foreshadows a tragic ending, which still comes as a bit of a shock, but her again her reaction and adaptation continues to be illuminating.This is my second Jane Hamilton book (A Map of the World was the other). Once again, I'm surprised by how much I became engaged in the story of people I didn't necessarily like and might not otherwise want to read about. Hamilton has a real talent for drawing out the intricacies and humanity of her characters. I especially appreciate how she gives rich motivation for all her characters, so you can't just hate &quot;the bad guys&quot; and root for &quot;the good ones,&quot; but instead you understand everyone as struggling with their own weaknesses and strengths, unhealthy dependencies and noble aspirations. I liked how Ruth often talked about people's &quot;good points,&quot; as something you have to look for in people and may not always see. This could be seen as a book about a down-and-out family, but instead I saw it as a rich description of a small family in a rural town and the difficulty we all have in finding our way."},{"Title":"The Book of Ruth","review":"I found The Book of Ruth to be one of the best books I have ever read. There are a lot of people turning away from the book because they find it too depressing. Sorry people, the world is not made up of 100% happy people. What you have to remember when you read this book is that there are people out there that are living Ruth's life. People that are going no where fast and who feel that they deserve the cards that they were dealt. I have lent The Book of Ruth to a few friends and no it did not seem to have an impact on anyone the way it has impacted me. I have found this book is something that my thoughts return to often. Just the way that Ruth still loved May and Ruby after a lifetime of emotional scars speaks for itself. Ruth had a kind of innocence (or maybe it was ignorance) that will haunt me for years to come. If you are reading this review to help you decide whether or not to read the book please give it a try. Put yourself into the place of Ruth and try to connect eith her desperation and her need to be loved. Again, it is one of the best books I have ever had the pleasure of reading"},{"Title":"The Book of Ruth","review":"This book is definately set at a slow pace and rich in confimration of Ruth's harsh reality. It is incerdibly well written and thorough of this woman's life. I began reading it with no prior information, and was constantly looking for signs of a positive turn in Ruth's life. Don't read it and expect to feel warm and fuzzy. I think that the redemption in The Book of Ruth is that each character is subtle in showing their selfless qualities. The end does contain a note of guarded optimism and leaves the future open for readers."},{"Title":"The Book of Ruth","review":"I have been slowing working my way through the novels of Jane Hamilton over the last few months and think I can now safely say that, in my opinion, she has well and truly joined the ranks of other outstanding North American female writers such as Margaret Atwood, Carol Shields and Annie Proulx. \`The Book of Ruth' is such an accomplished work it is difficult to credit it as a first novel.\`The Book of Ruth', naturally enough, is the story of Ruth. The reader shares her journey from a young child, always in the shadow of her brilliant brother, through to the time when she is a young woman with a child of her own. Her life is often harsh and full of difficulties. Ruth is from a disadvantaged family but while she is materially poor she has a rich internal life that is full of an intelligence and insight that those around her would never credit her with. There is a harshness that encompasses her everyday life that would drag most people down yet Ruth always manages to survive.Hamilton shows a wonderful affinity with her character, no matter how far removed from her own experiences that Ruth might be. Her writing is full of moments of grace and dignity that belie their settings. She has a real feel for the way people - in all their base and selfish ways - truly are and this can sometimes be confronting for the reader. Oddly, it is when Ruth's world erupts in violence that Hamilton's writing is at its most compassionate. Hamilton forgives her characters their humanity, allows Ruth to discover her inner goodness, and permits the reader a glimpse of a better world."},{"Title":"The Book of Ruth","review":"This was a disturbing book subject wise. It was well written and the characters were thoroughly developed. I would recommend any books written by Jane Hamilton."},{"Title":"The Book of Ruth","review":"The Book of Ruth has touched me like no book has. I can relate to a character who is awkward and doesn't fit in, living in a small town where being different isn't appreciated. Ruth has a warm heart and a lot of love to give. I was captivated by her innocence and amazed by her strength. I couldn't put this book down. I loved it so much that I recommended it to my friend and she loved it as much as I did."},{"Title":"The Book of Ruth","review":"I read this book because it was reccomended by Oprah's Book Club. It was written in such a way that the characters seemed as real as life. Ironically, that's also my complaint about the book. It was just too depressing. To this day I remember Ruth and her problems. It's haunting. I got the same feeling when I watched The Glass Menagerie as a child. I'd much prefer to remember a &quot;feel good book&quot; instead of this. The author is an excellent writer but her choice of material needs a big lift."},{"Title":"The Book of Ruth","review":"The characters could be everyday people trying to do the best with what they have...The resilience of Ruth is exceptional.

It was sad and very depressing to read. But I did finish it."},{"Title":"The Book of Ruth","review":"I've just read about half of the reviews and I'm surprised no one has mentioned Artie. He's the hero in this story and the person we should try to emulate. He was gentle, compassionate, fair, understanding. He was Ruth's first and only (until Justy) source for self-respect through her work and the bowling team. He gave jobs and promotions to people who probably didn't enhance his business. Can you imagine working or doing business with May?!!! He drove Ruth to her job and back; he allowed them to work split shifts when the baby came; he gave that slug Ruby a job and let him stay even though it had to be bad for business. He overlooked all their flaws because he was a decent human being. Without Artie where would they have been? I suppose you could argue that he was an enabler because if it wasn't for him they would have all had to try harder to make something of themselves. But I prefer to see him as someone we can strive to be--caretakers of one another regardless of a person's stature, intelligence, glamour, personality, etc. Overall I thought the writing was real and colorful. It was believable. Those who think it wasn't have probably never known people in those situations. My lack of 5 stars is due to the violence. I abhor violence in books and films and was surprised to read it in this book. The points could have been made less graphically."},{"Title":"The Book of Ruth","review":"A grim, sometimes depressing book but one so well written I find myself wearing the thoughts and feelings of Ruth. She is I think like many children of overworked single parents left to herself to make what she can of her life with little or no guidance or recogition. It is not surprising that she accepts the first instance of love offered to her by the boy Ruby. The story of her life as it unfolds to its grim conclusion..leaves me with feelings of sadness for all the Ruths of the world. Margaret Solomon"},{"Title":"The Book of Ruth","review":"Will never again take for granted what I've got in my since reading this book. Also, I feel a little more understanding of the &quot;slow&quot; girl with scars on her arms and neck that assembles sandwiches at my neighborhood 'Subway' store, and why her kids are there at the store all evening while she works for minimum wage. There really are people that never have an opportunity to better themselves or they don't have the mental ability to recognize an opportunity if it does present itself. Ruth married the only guy she thought could ever love her. She had only her verbally abusive mother in her life and was so vunerable when she met Ruby. Having children just seemed like the natural thing to do, even if her husband was a complete imbecile. Ruth didn't know any better than the choices she made. Aunt Sid should have kidnapped her the moment she graduated high school! If you're self-centered, shallow or heartless, then this book isn't for you."},{"Title":"The Book of Ruth","review":"I was browsing through our local book store in Rumford, Maine when I came across this book. Since I am only a junior, when I saw Oprahs club sticker on it, I immediatly thought it would be difficult for me to endure. Plainly, I was wrong. This book was beautifully written, and passionatly expressed. Hamilton is a wonderful author with many words. Ruth is a charactor that we know all to well. She comes out in our darkest moments, and fills our hearts with her wisdom of life itself. I found myself becoming Ruth as the story progressed; every thought of mine reminded me of something in the book. I was not used to connecting with a book so easily, and freely. Again, I found this book to be truly inspiring, and open to a subject that seems all too real. As Hamilton would say, &quot; Blessed are the meek, for they shall inherit the earth.&quot;"},{"Title":"The Book of Ruth","review":"I was under the influence of Oprah's Book Club List, unfortunately.

Too much rereading paragraphs because I've drifted off to thinking about unimportant things like &quot; maybe I should cut my finger nails&quot;. It is a poor read!!!"},{"Title":"The Book of Ruth","review":"If you want an easily read, glossed over, and airbrushed story of an individuals fight to escape the realities of a hard and bitter life, then do not read this book . . . but if you are crying out for a story that is so real it hurts, this book is a must. The narration is so completely honest and raw that I felt as if I were reading an autobiography. Depressing? At times, yes, but the ultimate joy Ruth discovers in herself left an impression of warmth in my heart that has yet to go away. This is a story of hope."},{"Title":"The Book of Ruth","review":"I listened to this book on tape while fighting traffic during rush hour. Although I prefer to read, my sister-in-law gave me the set of audio cassettes, among others. Mare Winningham, a fine actress, reads the novel with a marvelous Southern cadence. I was immediately caught up in the life of Ruth, as I heard her tell her story. Ruth is in all of us, in our insecurities, our connections with family and trying to live up (or down) to others' preconceived opinions of us. Ruth finished her story as I sat parked in the garage, I just couldn't bear not to hear the end. I highly recommend a 'listen' of the Book of Ruth."},{"Title":"The Book of Ruth","review":"While The Book of Ruth is not one of my favorite books- I can definitly say that it held my attention and left an impression on my mind.

I've recommended &quot;Ruth&quot; to several of my friends and they have all had mixed reviews.

This book was sad but sometimes hilarious. I could not help but sometimes laugh at Ruth's string of bad decisions and naive approach to life. I felt sad for Ruth especially because her mother made no secret of the fact that she valued her math-prodigy son more.

Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"The Book of Ruth","review":"I read the book in its entirely because it was an Oprah selection -- my first mistake -- and I kept THINKING that Ruth would finally GET IT. As Ruth struggled early on, I was right there cheering her on, but what a massive disappointment for a reader to discover the character never changes and will probably go on to make the same old stupid mistakes. There was nothing heroic about Ruth. She whined and shivered and settled for a dimwitted alcoholic with rotten teeth who couldn't hold down a job. She was still making excuses for him in the end; however, she flip-flops over it because, guess what, the woman seldom holds a thought for more than two seconds because she is as dimwitted as her husband. It's as if Hamilton tried to think of the crummiest, dullest traits in the world to give her characters and guess who won? Ruth! Ruth survives her ordeal, but she is not a survivor.

I will read everything Ms. Hamilton writes. Yes, she is a dark one, but stirs emotions like crazy.

It is an example of painting a picture of a life with words, that's why I gave it 2 stars. The fact that it wasn't a life worth writing about is why I recommend you look elsewhere.This is as depressing and pointless of a story as I have ever read. I suppose if you are looking for a reason to wear black and cry in the corner it would be a decent read, but I found nothing of value in it.

It is difficult to read this book because it can be so very real.

Although the author was very vivid with the descriptions of each character and the environment around them, I could not help but feel like I was in a dark maze and could not get out. The good point about the book is that the author allowed for the reader to develop each character and their personalities very clearly. I could picture May bickering around in her daily robe after work, and Ruth moving about trying to be extra careful not to strike one of May's nerves, and Ruby constantly smiling with those rotten teeth of his. However, I could not help feeling sorry for Ruth and the whole life she lived. From the time she was a child, she had no choice but to accept that she could not have a better life. May was mean and miserable and eventually got what was coming to her, although I did feel sorry for her in the end. Ruby seemed to have a heart, but his child-hood destroyed any hope that was left for his sanity. The ending of the book was surprising and finally had my attention. The most depressing part about this book is that Ruth was so unfortunate in her upbringing that she never did believe that there was hope for her in the future."},{"Title":"The Book of Ruth","review":"This was a very interesting read, yet very disturbing.

As she gets older her life doesn't get any better, that is until she meets and falls in love with Ruby. Little does she know what lies in her future. I started this book and could not put it down. You feel so sorry for Ruth yet you have a feeling that she will not experience the true happiness you wish for her. One character I wish we saw more of was Matt, Ruth's genius little brother, who moves to Boston early on in the novel. A highly recommendable book, not for every one though."},{"Title":"The Book of Ruth","review":"This is the worst, most horrifying book I have ever read. I hated every minute of it, though I kept reading hoping it would get better. I was wrong, it got worse. Not one of the characters was the least bit likable or able to relate with. I must admit, the writing was great, because I had VERY vivid pictures of what was going on in Ruth's life. She and all the characters, however, were pathetic and disgusting. I felt physically ill when I finished this book. Stay far, far away."},{"Title":"The Book of Ruth","review":"We read this for a library book group. We managed a decent discussion from reading it, but I would never suggest it to someone else.The narrative style is boring! Do I need to know every last detail of Ruth's thought process? NO! It seems to go and on for pages on end, nothing much of interest to read about. It would make a good one hour Dr. Phil show, if you are interested in reading about dysfunctional family relationships. In the end there is a murder. That is the surprise element in the story. Then again, we can hear about that type of thing everyday on the news.I'm surprised anyone would like this book. It was a total waste of my time!"},{"Title":"The Book of Ruth","review":"I started this book before work this morning. In less than half an hour I knew I couldn't go on with it. This evening, curiosity led me to flip through to the middle and skimmed some of it. Then I got to the horrendous later part and it was like watching a train wreck; I didn't want to keep reading but did. I did not, however, read to the end. Was so depressed by the time I put it down, I was glad I wasted no more than one day reading just parts of it. Don't know how the rest of you who didn't like it managed to plow through it. The author does have a way with words but I have no desire to read anything else by her. I would think someone who is already depressed could be pushed to suicide after reading this."},{"Title":"The Book of Ruth","review":"I read this book awhile ago and all I remember is how much I loved it!"},{"Title":"The Book of Ruth","review":"Overall I enjoyed Jane Hamilton's &quot;The Book of Ruth.&quot; I enjoyed reading the story of Ruth's life and how she got to her dramatic situation in the end. Although I really enjoyed the ending of the book, I didn't like the beginning so much. At first, Ruth just continually tells stories about her childhood and skips around to different years of her life. It was hard to figure out what year of her life she was talking about, but eventually the book moved into chronological order, making it much easier to read. This book is a really fast read. As Ruth continues to tell her story, I feel how stressful and hard it was for her to grow up with her mother, May. All of Ruth's life her mother rejected her and made Ruth feel like she was nothing. The shocking ending was the best part of this book. After reading this book the only part I think of right away is the ending."},{"Title":"The Book of Ruth","review":"This book was an interesting one to read a little at a time. The characters and events were provoking, but not so much as to draw you to read the book in one or two sittings. The climax towards the un-escapable ending was very exciting and when the real personalities of the Aunt and the Brother were portrayed it was a real suprise. I would give a fairly high recommendation for this book."},{"Title":"The Book of Ruth","review":"This is a very slow, boring, and depressing book. I don't even know how I managed to finish the book. The whole time, I had to tell myself to read on just incase something exciting happens. Bottom line, this book was a waste of money, and most importantly a waste of my time!"},{"Title":"The Book of Ruth","review":"This is a magnificent book, but women!, don't read it when you're on your period or you may succumb to bawling like a baby."},{"Title":"The Book of Ruth","review":"THIS BOOK WAS HORRIBLE. DONT READ THIS BOOK UNLESS YOU LIKE BORING NAIVE CHARACTERS. THE BOOK DIDNT EVEN GET AROUND TO THE ABUSE UNTIL THE LAST COUPLE CHAPTERS. I SERIOUSLY WANTED RUTH TO DIE JUST SO THE BOOK WOULD BE OVER. THE ONLY EVEN SLIGHTLY GOOD CHARACTER WAS DAISY WHO WAS KIND OF A BIG WH**E"},{"Title":"The Book of Ruth","review":"This is one of the many great books that would not have come to our attention had it not been for Oprah ... I found it disturbing and powerful, an eye-opener into the world of domestic violence and abuse. I saw the sad, tragic climax coming, long before it arrived, but even its inevitability could not lessen its impact. This book and Rapture of Canaan are among the most \\"honest\\" books written of late. Hamilton is a great writer."},{"Title":"The Book of Ruth","review":"Jane Hamilton is a talented writer and in the hands of someone less talented, I probably would not have finished a book that was this depressing. To her credit, Hamilton shows that someone can have a very mundane job and not let it get them down. Also, the book conveys the very important message that although Ruth isn't very bright, she still has some interesting insights on life from which more intelligent people can learn. Therefore, we need to realize that we should not dismiss someone's opinion simply due to their station in life. However, I read the entire book hoping it would have a happier ending than it did. I didn't want an unrealistic ending, just upbeat enough that I wouldn't feel as if reading the book was wasted time. The book did reinforce some important lessons (i.e. an ordinary person with a menial job can find a way to take pride in her work, if a &quot;loser&quot; can perservere during a crisis and survive a tragedy then with hope and determination we all can). While most of have been told to be happy with what we have and to be determined to survive whatever life brings, The Book of Ruth shows how these lessons apply in daily life. Above all, Ruth is a survivor. However, all that kept me from rating this 1* were the valuable lessons and skillful writing, because although there was a glimmer of hope at the end, once I finished the book I mostly felt depressed."},{"Title":"The Book of Ruth","review":"This is the first Jane Hamilton novel I ever read and the best book I've ever read. I was hooked with her style from the very first page. This book is somewhat disturbing with the events that happen throughout Ruth's life. In a way it is also comforting. You have to read it to know what I mean. You won't be disappointed. It is a short and easy read. One you will not want to put down and will want to read over and over. I recommend this book to anyone who likes reading. I look forward to many more good books by this wonderful author. Also recommended-A Map of the World. I hope to meet Ms. Hamilton some day. She is brilliant!"},{"Title":"The Book of Ruth","review":"I am going by memory as I read this book when it was first recommended.The greatest impression I got was how much abuse/torment/rejection was given to Ruth and othercharacters. Have no idea what she was trying to accomplish here and Icertainly did not like the book nor would I recommend it!Oprah, what were you thinking???"},{"Title":"The Book of Ruth","review":"I didn't like reading this book. I'm glad I'm finished.What's the point???Young girl is born into a disastrous family,gets involved in a disastrous marriage. The only good thing she has to show for it is 2 sons. This was definitely a book of survival!!!"},{"Title":"The Book of Ruth","review":"It was an ok book. I read it last week, and I really can't think of too much to write about it. I didn't actively hate it while I read it, and I did read it rather quickly. Story was a bit depressing. My willingness to suspend my disbelief wasn't achieved, but close enough. I may just not want to think that people can really be this mean and depressing, but I bet there are. Matt bothered me throughout the entire story."},{"Title":"The Book of Ruth","review":"This wasn't at all what I expected. Once I was done I understand what the author was trying to do but while reading the book I was wondering what she was doing.It's not a bad book, just not what I expected. To be honest I wanted more of what went on in the club - not why they were there."},{"Title":"The Book of Ruth","review":"I read this book about a year ago and still remember the feeling of fear and sadness to this day. I was on a trip to Europe, Poland to be exact and brought this book along thinking this would be a good read. NOT. This is too much for me and I just couldn't stand the horrible ending. I kind of liked it until the things got too horrible. I disowned this book after reading it. Just couldn't stand having it in my bookshelf."},{"Title":"The Book of Ruth","review":"If you liked \\"Liar's Club\\" you will LOVE this book!!!Tiresome, long-suffering heroine (w/o a brain in her head--) who rather reminds of Faulkner's Dewey-Dell details all her travails. Red-neck city!!!!!! Are there really people lke this????? Characterization is heavy-handed... instead of subtle. Not well-written!This book does not make the world a \\"better\\" place!!!!"},{"Title":"The Book of Ruth","review":"i read this book a very long time ago, and still think about it as baffling. it gives extreme insight into a culture the educated will never experience.it is very well written, the character, ruth's, ways are heavy as narrative. i can't even begin to explain this book, now that i think about it. it is a must read."},{"Title":"The Book of Ruth","review":"After the first few pages, I had to force myself to read this book. It is boring and delves into the monotony of the protagonist, Ruth's life. I kept reading, waiting for something to happen because the author did a good job of foreshadowing something that happens to the characters in the book. In my humble opinion, the story did not represent hope at all and the main character does not emerge \\"a butterfly\\" like some other reviewers have posted. She remains in a life of monotonous boredom and is only saved from the abuse she participates in because of pain and sorrow brought on from abuse. This read was a complete waste of time and has left me feeling depleted and empty, not uplifted and full of hope like I had anticipated."},{"Title":"The Book of Ruth","review":"I found this book to be very disturbing, dark and very slow. I forced myself to keep reading because I thought it must get better soon. It didn't. I just don't understand what anyone liked about it. Don't get me wrong, I don't expect books to be sugar-coated fairytales, I really enjoyed Wally Lamb's 'I Know This Much is True' , which in no way was a fairytale. But this book just didn't seem to have any direction, just sort of rambled along. I read 'Map of the World' first, and should have taken that as a sign. Jane Hamilton writes very slow, depressing books with little dialogue. I also found the book to be very repetitive, there was very little action is the book, the same thing happened to these people day after day. I know that's real life, but who wants to read about that, we read to escape life. I would of like to see more interaction between Ruby and Matt. I know that she was jealous of him, but that was never really explored. He was absent for most of the book. I was also curious why in Matt's letter to Aunt Sid, he said that Ruby abused him? I didn't remember reading about abuse while Matt was still home. The book never explained if Ruby did abuse Matt, or Matt was lying to Aunt Sid. And Ruby was in love with Aunt Sid her whole life, and once she moved in with her, nothing really happened. Aunt Sid was only mentioned a few times, as she was passing through rooms. I thought the ending was a little unbelievable and found myself skimming pages just to get it over with. Well I think I am going to quit paying attention to Oprah's recommendations."},{"Title":"The Book of Ruth","review":"I took my time reading this book and knew from the beginning that something terrible was going to happen to either Ruth or her Mother. As the story went on, it was obvious that it was going to be to her Mother, but that didn't ease the shock or discomfort when it finally happened. Ruth's response was totally out of bounds. She thinks Ruby killed May for her? Why? What did May do that was so horrible? Nobody deserves to be brutally murdered, let alone in front of her daughter and grandson. Ruth should have gotten out long before. She and her husband were deadbeats of the worst order (it's disgusting that these people had children!) and then they blame the world for their problems. Ruby was a loser from the moment he forced himself on Ruth. Why do women insist on playing victim? Ruth blew her life and May and Justy paid the penalties.This book disappointed me. I really enjoyed Hamilton's writing style and prose, but I can't reconcile the ending. I have no sympathy for Ruth and the utmost compassion for May. Was anyone else struck by how hard this woman had worked in her life? Yes, she had her faults, but remember the chapter that ended with Ruth recalling how May had saved Justy from the fire? Why wasn't that ever described in more detail? Am I supposed to be feeling so antagonistic towards the novels heroine? I missed Hamilton on Oprah so if anyone can fill me in, I'd appreciate it. As it is, I see no hope or future for Ruth or her sons. Why can't she see how vile an act Ruby committed and hold him responsible? I couldn't identify with her at all. Her response to her Mother's murder was beyond comprehension. Did she ever grieve for this woman? Anybody who is identifying with Ruth better pack up and find a life."},{"Title":"The Book of Ruth","review":"I read it a few years back. I could explain the whole story to someone in one sentence. You follow the misery of this one girl and in the end she's still miserable, only in a different way. Was bored through the whole story but kept at it because, after all, Oprah really liked it!!!"},{"Title":"The Book of Ruth","review":"I found the book and the role of teh dysfuntional family very true to life. ..I didn't like the way the book ended. ..The characters were very real.If you liked this book, or want to read one that goes straight to your heart, read Stolen Moments by Barbara Jeanne Fisher. . .It is a beautiful story of unrequited love. . .for certain the love story of the nineties. I intended to give the book a quick read, but I got so caught up in the story that I couldn't put the book down. From the very beginning, I was fully caught up in the heart-wrenching account of Julie Hunter's battle with lupus and her growing love for Don Lipton. This love, in the face of Julie's impending death, makes for a story that covers the range of human emotions. The touches of humor are great, too, they add some nice contrast and lighten things a bit when emotions are running high. I've never read a book more deserving of being published. It has rare depth. Julie's story will remind your readers that life and love are precious and not to be taken for granted. It has had an impact on me, and for that I'm grateful. Stolen Moments is written with so much sensitivity that it made me want to cry. It is a spellbinder. What terrific writing. Barbara does have an exceptional gift!"},{"Title":"The Book of Ruth","review":"This novel truly displayed the way a writer should write. Hamilton developed such fabulous characters with strength and feeling. I highly recommend this novel for the young and old."},{"Title":"The Book of Ruth","review":"Depressing, real but somthing missing! I think the story in total was depressing and I kept asking myself why she didnt do anything prodoctive with here life. But I kind of got the answer when she finally left her small village to visit her aunt. She was just a scared small town girl, thats were I found the book real. I have alitle problem identifying what is missing but I guess I just found the book boring. I also think that it dint build it self up enough for the &quot;dramatic&quot; ending. The ending I found not in harmony with the rest of the book...to unreal! If I have nothing better to do with my time I might pick up a book by Jane Hamilton again!

The author should be ashamed of herself. No hope whatsoever is offered to Ruth, the main character. I had to think for days to decide what, if anything, good I could gain from this book. I finally decided that it is the perfect depiction of what a human life would be like if it were totally devoid of beauty. Since when has writing the darkest, most depressing book been something to brag about?"},{"Title":"The Book of Ruth","review":"My mother-in-law read this on Oprah's suggestion, then she asked me to read it so we could discuss it. We both hated it. There is no way the reader can accept the self-consciously literary narrator as Ruth, who tells us repeatedly how stupid and illiterate she is. Likewise I found Hamilton's attempts to empathize with her characters both shallow and condescending. The only reason I finished this book was to discover what horrible thing had happened, as was referred to on the first page...the answer wasn't worth it. Hamilton has used every literary device at her disposal, and she is clearly a skilled writer. Unfortunately, her dislike or disrespect for her characters distances the reader, and the literary skill is wasted"},{"Title":"The Book of Ruth","review":"Jane Hamilton has written a superior novel here, and as such has a definitive appeal for the eclectic. Those into the more smarmy romantic novels need not travel further. You need not be a member of the intelligentsia to understand Hamilton's subtle symbolic meanderings here, but one does have to be able to be aware that they do exist. Hamilton has made a sincere effort here to write a serious novel, and I feel that she has succeeded marvelously. But to digest Ruth's prose on the superficial level suggested by previous reviewers can only inculcate banality. The beauty of this book is far too deep to be equated with the same sort of surface perusal one gives to a Grisham novel. Hence, if you are a Grisham fan, this is probably going to be an unsatisfactory book for you.Hamilton's style is described as &quot;Dickensian&quot; by the Los Angeles times, indubitably meaning her ability to paint characters from society's dregs and fashion them into fully-rounded, larger-than-life characters. There is a sense of naturalism that runs deep in Hamilton's prose, evoking the feel of an Ernest Hemingway or Jack London novel, but perhaps not with their typically unerring diction. And, of course, there are strains of bathos that might even put the lachrymose Louisa May Alcott to shame.Added to all this is Hamilton's final and shocking catharsis, making this book particularly well worth the discerning reader's time and investment. In comparison to the latest Grisham or Stephen King novel, Hamilton is ineffably the better buy."},{"Title":"The Book of Ruth","review":"The thoughts of Ruth is well told in everyday use of language.

I did not identify very much with Ruth, I felt as if her denial of things was extreme. I wanted desperately for her to make it, to achieve the happier, more fruitfull life her aunt tried to help her find. However I never really felt she would get away from what held her down."},{"Title":"The Book of Ruth","review":"&quot;The Book of Ruth&quot; lulls the reader into a false sense ofcomfort with these more than slightly odd characters. Ruby,May and Ruth appear ordinary enough in their sadly mundanelives. Howver, each is a complex, and in the end, disturbingpersonality. The book lured me in with this somewhat twistedversion of an average family engaged in their small battles.The end left me devastated and angry for those of us who settlefor less than we deserve and those who try to keep us back."},{"Title":"The Book of Ruth","review":"I first had trouble getting into the story line. It seemed to drag on and on and I wondered where it was going. Midway through, things began to change and I was more able to see where it was headed. Ruth struggled so much through her childhood only to find what she thought was love and then to have May tear that down was sad. The characters all brought in their own problems that culminated in the tragic ending. My disturbed feelings came for Justy. To have witnessed such a horrific scene and then be seperated from his mother, grandmother and father really reflected in his behavior upon Ruth's return to him. When I read the last words of the book and put it down, I could not help but wonder what would become of him. That was the saddest part for me.

The errors in grammar that were interjected into her dialogue, together with her thoughtful narrative, were truly evident of her essence. Ruth was tremendously admirable character, who was strong, yet vulnerable, trusting, yet not always truthful. Her struggles with Ruby, and especially with May, were heartwrenching. Her endearing love for them both was both frustrating and touching. My only disappointment was that May was never able to resolve the hurt contained within her realtionships with those who were close to her."},{"Title":"The Book of Ruth","review":"I first listened to this by books on tape to relieve a long, boring commute. When I was able to read it, I savored many passages. The book contains real-people characters, portrays the humdrum life we all lead at times, draws a mother who is understandably unlikeable. I wanted to shake Ruth for being such an innocent fool, and I can't remember detesting a character as much as the husband. The ending comes not as a surprise, considering the interplay of characters. A book with the power to rile you, to be sure."},{"Title":"The Book of Ruth","review":"What most disturbed me about this book is that the main character, Ruth, seemed not terribly upset about the horrific murder of her mother. In fact, the last few pages implied that she was set free by the murderer! While her mother was blindly devoted to the gifted brother, at Ruth's expense, she was not as bad towards her daughter as to deserve her indifference. The author writes well and has created authentic characters and their lives. One of her themes is &quot;the meanness&quot; that people are born with and have to overpower. She illustrates this beautifully in the relationships between men and women, parents and children. Still, I missed the &quot;hope&quot; that many reviewers found at the end of the book. I felt I had been in the presence of real evil in the last few pages."},{"Title":"The Book of Ruth","review":"Yes, this story is well written, at times haunting but Hamilton through Ruth seems to patronize and make fun of her characters. All of these characters feel pain yet many just become characatures that we the reader are supposed to laugh at (Daisy, Dee Dee and Randall). The book often seems to rely on stereotypes, especially of the rural poor. The way Hamilton seemed to be so above her midwestern lowerclass characters often made me so angry I did not want to finish the tale (although I am glad I did)."},{"Title":"The Book of Ruth","review":"This book is well-written, but it contains the most difficult, depressing subject matter I have ever encountered in a fiction work (and I've read a few).

(Sorry Oprah.)"},{"Title":"The Book of Ruth","review":"I have to say that I probably would not have read this book if it wasn't for Oprah Winfrey. The books that I usually read are mysteries with romance. I call them easy reading books. Jane Hamilton had me feeling everything Ruth was feeling from the moment I started reading the first page. It touched all my emotions. The characters - May, Ruby, Ruth, and Justy come to life so vividly. I felt like I could touch them and hold them, even strangle them for their stupidity. This book did start out slow but it worked into a chilling climax. I'm glad I didn't put it back on the shelf. All I can say is thank you Oprah for opening my eyes. Thank you Jane Hamilton for making me feel grateful for all the blessings I have in my life"},{"Title":"The Book of Ruth","review":"I read this book a few week ago and found it disturbing and far from one of my favorites.

When you do finally finish, you are left with a feeling you should expect more than this ending. This book is so unrealistic - except in the graphic descriptions of the actual abuse. Throughout the book, you are waiting for something - anything - to happen that will give this book significance - perhaps good or worthy advise for abused women, but, only disparagement and disheartening narratives and messages to are to be found.

There is (was) a very large mental institution in my hometown that had mainstreamed most of it's almost 15,000 residents (in it's hey day) back in to the community. There were multiple group homes for men and women and I often supervised parties and dates for the clients. This book brought all of this back to me. Ruth and Ruby are both fairly high functioning retarded people. This relationship got out of hand mainly from May's iron-fisted way of dealing with her daughter and her constant comparison of her with her genius son Matt. There were parts of their relationship that I thought were beautiful, but most of it was like the beauty of the vibrant patterns on a rattlesnake's back; beautiful but dangerous. This book brought all the sadness back to me that I felt watching people with little or no control of their life attempt to have a relationship.This was certainly a worthwhile book to read and I would recommend it to anyone."},{"Title":"The Book of Ruth","review":"Here's my warning - this is not a happy, peppy book. Jane Hamilton weaves in a feeling of foreboding from the first page. If you only like cheerful and light reads, you will not like The Book of Ruth. It took me two tries to read it because I didn't like the beginning. Too many names thrown at me, and I wasn't up for anything depressing. But I went back to it and I'm glad I did. Some of her sentences are gorgeous. At one point the narrator, Ruth, says she knows what it's like to be a potted plant, with an owner who thinks to water it only once in a while. Perfect. Jane captures Ruth's imagination and shows beautiy in ugly situations. My other favorite line is when Ruth calls down to the \\"puddle of humans.\\" Great language. Dark, beautiful book."},{"Title":"The Book of Ruth","review":"I have read The Book of Ruth twice...it has a sad, depressing feel to it in some ways, yet how Ruth continues to move forward and be strong in spite of her mother and a foolish relationship, is in a way inspiring.

I would recommend this book to anyone. It was wonderfully written."},{"Title":"The Book of Ruth","review":"The Book of Ruth is an experience in reading I will never forget. Though a review on the back of the book refers to it as a human comedy, I totally disagree. Written like an autobiography, The Book of Ruth chronicles the intense life of Ruth Grey. She lived with her rude mother May and her younger brother Matt. Ruth was a person with very low self esteem and she wasn't brilliant either. Matt was a genius who always acted superior to Ruth and stuck up to their mother and their mother would always show favoritism to Matt. Eventually, Matt went off to a great college, and Ruth became a dry clean worker with her mother and they lived together. Soon after, Ruth marries a cheap man named Ruby and they end up living a crumbling life with May. The novel goes through the life of Ruth with her struggles, thoughts, friends, and her very few happy moments. By the time you reach the beginning of the ending it immediately and unexpectedly comes at you. The novel's portrayel of truth and life is so perfect it is haunting and unbearable. The conclusions are mesmerizing and powerful. A painfully honest and astoundingly gorgeus book that must not be neglected. Strongly Reccomend!"},{"Title":"The Book of Ruth","review":"I have recommended this book to several friends. I simply found it enchanting and have re-read it again and again!"},{"Title":"The Book of Ruth","review":"I have a lot of different thoughts and feelings about this book. The story richly describes the gray area of life. We are neither &quot;all good&quot; nor &quot;all bad&quot;. Ruth is a woman who seems to live a life of low expectations and simplicity. Ruth is labeled as &quot;mentally retarded&quot; and is forever in the shadow of her brilliant brother. We learn that Ruth is more complex and creative then what appears on the surface. On one hand, you are pulled to unconditionally support her given her lot in life. On the other hand, you want to knock some sense into her; I wanted her to make choices that would challenge her, get her to stand solid on her own and explore the world around her (not just rely on books-on-tape as a means of escape). You want to hate her mother May as she evokes the critical and unappreciative voice that seems to immobilize Ruth. Yet we learn May's history of shattered dreams and gain some understanding of her choices too. You want to hate Ruby for being such a loaf. He seems to have no redeeming qualities, just a lost soul, yet I found myself enjoying his perspective and words of wisdom. Definitely not an easy read but one that left me with very real and memorable characters"},{"Title":"The Book of Ruth","review":"Growing up in a small PA town, I met some individuals who could easily fit the portrait of Ruth. Anyone who finds this book boring, is lacking depth of the mind, heart, and soul. Jane Hamilton has an amazing ability to become the character in a completely convincing manner."},{"Title":"The Book of Ruth","review":"Some readers are missing Ruth's essence. Our society is quick to judge the victim. Sometimes people are unwittingly victims because they don't know any better; many people don't have the tools to carve out a &quot;normal&quot; life and end up doing the best they can with their lot. There is a caste system in our society whether we admit it or not. This is the first time I ever really thought about someone like Ruth but not the last. There were times when I was surprised at myself for sticking with this book (wondering if this was a pointless waste or not) but I'm very glad I let myself get involved with Ruth."},{"Title":"The Book of Ruth","review":"The book was boring. It took too long/too many pages/too many aimless words for the plot to get anywhere. Thus, 'Ruth' seemed to have a lot of 'filler.' And, perhaps the end is somewhat contrived; how lucky to have a middle class educated aunt (read: fairy godmother) to save her. Hamilton's 'A Map of the World' also is puffed up/out in pages beyond what drives the plot. Perhaps the short story is a better medium for Hamilton. I bought and read 'Ruth' because I was curious about Oprah's picks. So many seem to be replications on the same theme. The best of this genre is Dorothy Allison's Bastard Out of Carolina; Oprah should pick this."},{"Title":"The Book of Ruth","review":"Those people who wrote in to say that this book was too depressing or a waste of time simply baffle me. Hamilton takes us deep into the mind and soul of Ruth...if we cannot learn from her, we are rather hopeless. If we regard this opportunity as a waste of time...we are rather pathetic."},{"Title":"The Book of Ruth","review":"This was a wonderful story of an ordinary woman living and surviving an extraordinary (and tragic) life. The saddest part for me is that this is a very believable story. To those readers who didn't like this story, I say: Open your eyes and see that this is not just &quot;a depressing story&quot; but what is and could be a reality for many women. What depresses me is the blame the victim attitude of so many people in our culture. Just put on your rose colored glasses and hope nothing ever happens to you!"},{"Title":"The Book of Ruth","review":"The Book of Ruth is gripping at times, yet predictable and unsupported other times. It was a relatively easy read, however there were times when I felt like putting the book down and not picking it up again. The references to religion to me seemed unrealistic. That this woman, Ruth, could not understand her own life, but could philosophize about religion. I felt that this book needed one final edit session. But overall, I still recommend reading it, if only to get a glimpse into a world many of us fortunately do not live in, but nevertheless encounter every day."},{"Title":"The Book of Ruth","review":"Don't miss this one. It may take a while to get into the story, but stick with it. Ruth's story will stay with you long after you finish the book."},{"Title":"The Book of Ruth","review":"The reader walks with Ruth through her unspectacular life. But somehow, through Ruth's eyes, it always feels like there's hope. When Ruth's world bursts apart on a Sunday afternoon, so much like any other, it brings a gasp. It illustrated that even the most unspectacular life has the ability to take a turn that will forever change a person, just in a matter of minutes."},{"Title":"The Book of Ruth","review":"I have now read 2 books recommended by Oprah. Does she only recommend books that leave you so sad. I felt this book was way off the mark. Did no one in the school system or even her Aunt Sid who was only 40 miles away care one iota? Ruth seems to love being the victim and even when everything goes wrong, she still doesn't get it. No one can be that clueless. If Oprah only recommends these types of stories than I am out of the running"},{"Title":"The Book of Ruth","review":"This was a wonderful book to listen to on tape. It was really calming to hear Ruth's simple thoughts as I drove to and from work each day. My friend asked me to let her know what I thought about the story...I still haven't decided. From reading the comments, I'm not the only one. It's a definite read though!"},{"Title":"The Book of Ruth","review":"This book is the story of how it sometimes takes catastrophe to dislodge people from their ruts and force them to redefine themselves. It also takes a very long, hard look at the relationships--familial and romantic--that all women experience in their lives and how they can be so forceful--for good or ill. Yes, this book is difficult (emotionally) to read, because we readers can stand on the sidelines and shout advice, but the characters don't hear us any more than the real people who come through our lives and break our hearts by following destructive paths. In the end, the characters have to deal with the consequences of how they've lived their lives. The good news is that for some, it's not too late to turn a new corner. In that respect, this book is a story of hope and redemption."},{"Title":"The Book of Ruth","review":"I listen to a lot of books on tape commuting back and forth to work. I have read books by Jane Hamilton and enjoyed them, but for some reason was never able to get into this book. I tried it on tape and found it difficult, as well, for the first twenty minutes or so. But then it grabbed me and I couldn't wait to get back into the car to continue &quot;reading.&quot; Ruth is a fascinating character, one who seems to know that her life will lead to a disaster but doesn't know how to prevent it. She makes the most out of her miserable existence, making herself believe that love and happiness are and will be hers. The ending was inevitable and I found myself becoming nervous as the end neared.Mare Winningham read the book on tape and it made the book even better I believe. She was the perfect voice of Ruth. Her voice carried the appropriate emotions at the right time. She WAS Ruth. Very often those who read the books are not right for the reading -- but in this case Mare was a perfect choice and made it more enjoyable.I would recommend this book on tape to everyone. But remember when you get close to home after driving an hour and you are in a good place in the book, you will need to drive around the block a few times@"},{"Title":"The Book of Ruth","review":"So, I finished this book this morning, and I am still scratching my head trying to figure out who those characters were.Ruth...loved the dickens out of Dickens, apparently found those stories highly entertaining, somehow Ruth missed out on her brother's share of smarts but retained enough to appreciate &quot;literature&quot; even though she didn't seem able to read and had to listen to the audio tapes. (I like the previous review from the educator who pointed out Ruth most likely had a learning disability).May....did anyone else pick up on what a fastidious housekeeper she was? All the while drinking &quot;gallons and gallons&quot; of spiked lemonade, a pure alcoholic who attended church regularly, had the meanest tongue in any fictional character I've read lately, her character seemed slovenly and uneducated and yet to me she was the most sympathetic character in the book.Ruby....what the hell did Ruth see in him? She talks constantly about his glorious smile, with his missing and blackened teeth, he is drunk and stoned all the time and a big fat baby, sorry he was abused as a child, but was he really the only man in the county available for marriage? Fat Randall would have been a much better choice!And who was her brother, Matt? A parable of what Ruth could have been, and by the way, was he gay?I grew up in a very rural and impoverished part of the country, and I still couldn't get a handle on these characters. This was just one of the weirdest books I've read, and I can't really say it was worth the time. It raised a lot of questions, but in the end never answered any! This is one way to write a thought provoking book....after you read it you have to stop and think, what in the world did I just read? Oh, well. It passed some time in a relatively entertaining way, but don't read it if you like a happy ending."},{"Title":"The Book of Ruth","review":"This book started out well, and I honestly sympathized with the characters and enjoyed reading about such a dysfunctional family. Yet when I finished the book, I was very disappointed. Hamilton's writing style is eloquent yet genuine. However, Hamilton's character development of Ruth left much to be desired. Hamilton couldn't seem to decide if she wanted Ruth to be retarded or a prodigy. Also, the second half of the novel did not live up to the first half's expectations. Rather than entertaining, the book became whiny and frustrating, especially after the climax of the book. What could have been a wonderful novel turned out to be only mediocre."},{"Title":"The Book of Ruth","review":"Yes, Hamilton has the talent to write, but she needs an editor to clean up her work. Chapter 6, time-framed in the early 1970s, features two glaring anachronisms. The first is a children's sermon. Children's sermons are brief interludes during the regular church service. The pastor calls the youngsters to the front of the church, engages them in simple reflection on a Biblical theme, and then dismisses them back to their pews . Children's sermons did not come into vogue until the early or mid '80s. Hamilton also has Ruth's brother Matt sporting a pocket calculator on his belt in this same time period; again, these were not common until about a decade later. But more annoying than the anachronisms is the embarrassing jam the author finds herself in at the end of the book. She intends for Ruby to go berserk and commit mayhem, but she needs a trigger event for his &quot;snap.&quot; Hence we are suddenly told (and expected to believe) that for years May has been fashioning designer-quality Christmas cookies - &quot;thirty different kinds,&quot; no less - for the church, but giving family members only crumbs, literally. And then we are asked to believe that a toddler with a full stomach remembers the location of cookies he has never even tasted, and demands them. Ah well, the book is fiction, after all"},{"Title":"The Book of Ruth","review":"Not much of a plot, not much of a story, but I like how Jane Hamilton writes. If you listen to the lyrics of songs instead of the beat of them, you will like this book; if you are more into the music than you are the lyrics, you won't."},{"Title":"The Book of Ruth","review":"I have only 2 criteria for what I think to be needs when I rate a book. 1- An interesting or very great plot 2- Written very well. For me this book had both, more of the second, and just enough of the first.Ruth is hard to figure out sometimes, she wants to be wild, seems to be low class, but in her own way has a touch of refinement. While living with her mother, who prefers her brother, feelings of doubt and self hate are present. As we follow her journey we read what is so beautifully written, at times I wanted to underline passages for later reference. I was smitten with Jane Hamilton's writing style, almost poetic at moments. You will watch Ruth grow, fall in love with a strange, perverted man, and eventually become a mother herself.One word of caution, a gruesome and shocking ending will grip you. For me, I literally had to set the book down for a while just to breathe. You will not forget this ending or book. For the next few weeks I looked at my family in a different light of appreciation. As you turn the last page you will find Ruth in a bizzare way living out a childhood dream mentioned earlier in the book. I can't wait to read the latest by JAne Hamilton. If you have enjoyed her writing, or if you like to savor beautifully writtten words and can stomach a tough and bloody ending, this book can not be missed."},{"Title":"The Book of Ruth","review":"As a huge fan of Jane Hamilton, I was disappointed overall with this story. The narrator is a mildly-retarded young woman who lives with her emotionally abusive mother. Lonely, poor and unmotivated - Ruth is attracted to a substance-abusing parasite who rapes her on their first date. She then marries him, they start a family and continue to sponge off of her mother - who grows more angry and cruel. Ruth corresponds by mail with her estranged aunt, who appears to be the only one in the family with any redeeming qualities. Her resistance to her aunt's advice and offers of help perpetuate the hopeless situation.What I found especially frustrating was the narrator's lack of acceptance that her situation is the result of her own irresponsible thoughts and actions. She continually makes excuses for herself and her boyfriend...making them out to be perpetual victims rather than slackers. Also - despite her lack of education or basic common sense - she occasionally tells the story in a way that is inappropriately well-spoken and insightful. My initial feelings toward Ruth were of pity, but that quickly changed to contempt.Readers...be prepared for a strange ending."},{"Title":"The Book of Ruth","review":"This book was written in 1988. I can't believe I've waited this long to discover such a brilliant writer. She doesn't try to surprise you or shock you: you know what's coming because the protagonist fairly warns you. Still you find yourself staring aghast as if at a 12-car pile-up. The book is spiced throughout with sharp-witted humor. It seems as though in this one small novel Hamilton has managed to voice the private humiliations, doubts, and insecurities of every human being--yet makes the best days of Ruth's life feel like the best possible days in the world.I don't want to write a long review because I don't want to give anything away, but I did want to speak to the criticism of some reviewers of the book's \\"negativity\\" and the protagonists' dumb choices.The negativity, of course, is just real life. It is how life is for a great many people on this earth--and Hamilton has captured it masterfully. The protagonist's dumb choices are a different issue. Just as Hamilton speaks brilliantly in the voice of a profoundly intelligent yet uneducated woman who believes she is stupid, she has captured the essence of the type of woman who approaches the world with as much love, hope, and gentleness as she can possibly manage, believing that it has to be enough to heal the wounds around her--because it is enough in all of the nature she so loves. We are in her mind as she discovers the cruel truths of humanity's worst sides, we are with her as she descends into black cynicism, and we believe her when she begins her journey: not back home, but away from it and into a better life."},{"Title":"The Book of Ruth","review":"After seeing the last hour of this movie based on this book last week, I had to read The Book of Ruth again, and if possible, it was more powerful the second time around. Silly me. I actually thought I could read bits and pieces of this fabulous novel, but I underestimated Jane Hamilton's ability to draw the reader in. Planning to read one chapter, I was surprised to see that over an hour had passed and that I was well into the book. Two hours later, and I knew that I had to follow through to see what became of Ruth.Where to start? What to say about this strange collection of people who live and literally die (at least one of them) in a small town? Loving, hating, fighting, dreaming, and finding their ways through life, the major characters will break your heart. There's May, Ruth and Matt's mother, so filled with anger and disappointment that she just cannot restrain herself from hurling insults and all manner of hatefulness towards Ruth and Rudy. Matt, the one who got away, is the prince and most beloved. Ruth, left to deal with May and the scorn of the townspeople who think she's stupid, falls in love with Ruby. Poor Ruby. An \\"accident\\" and the victim of physical and verbal cruelty, he's saved by Ruth after his blond, sickly, sad mother is whisked off to Florida by his brutal father.Told from Ruth's point of view, Hamilton's masterful descriptions of scenes, especially the brutal one after Justy asked for a cookie; people like Matt, her popular brother, math wizard and tennis player; and sounds such as frogs in the pond, Daisy's howling laugh, or Justy bawling. Especially powerful are the way Ruth's thoughts are described. One day as she sits in school, Ruth thinks, \\"I was going to be cooped up in a building with rows and rows of metal lockers and bad light in the halls, and drinking fountains with green gum sitting on the porcelain like toads, for years to come.\\" There's no way Ruth could predict the dramatic changes that were soon to take place in her life.This is a book that will make you think hard and long about the people around you and their ties to one another. Never again will you think that things are just peachy behind the picket fence."},{"Title":"The Book of Ruth","review":"I have been slowing working my way through the novels of Jane Hamilton over the last few months and think I can now safely say that, in my opinion, she has well and truly joined the ranks of other outstanding North American female writers such as Margaret Atwood, Carol Shields and Annie Proulx. \`The Book of Ruth' is such an accomplished work it is difficult to credit it as a first novel.\`The Book of Ruth', naturally enough, is the story of Ruth. The reader shares her journey from a young child, always in the shadow of her brilliant brother, through to the time when she is a young woman with a child of her own. Her life is often harsh and full of difficulties. Ruth is from a disadvantaged family but while she is materially poor she has a rich internal life that is full of an intelligence and insight that those around her would never credit her with. There is a harshness that encompasses her everyday life that would drag most people down yet Ruth always manages to survive.Hamilton shows a wonderful affinity with her character, no matter how far removed from her own experiences that Ruth might be. Her writing is full of moments of grace and dignity that belie their settings. She has a real feel for the way people - in all their base and selfish ways - truly are and this can sometimes be confronting for the reader. Oddly, it is when Ruth's world erupts in violence that Hamilton's writing is at its most compassionate. Hamilton forgives her characters their humanity, allows Ruth to discover her inner goodness, and permits the reader a glimpse of a better world."},{"Title":"The Book of Ruth","review":"This book is for the lover of details - small ones. The tale reveals the small gifts people give to each other in this life, and the depth and duration of wounds we inflict. The disappointed readers are probably seeking thrilling turns of plot, which Hamilton does not deliver until the end. Ruth's tale reveals what one loving person can preserve in the life of a forgotten child, as well as the limits of such saving love. Those who find Ruth and her tale boring are not looking deep enough - she is among the wisest persons, seeking understanding everywhere and having the dignity and strength to forgive. The reader is crushed when Ruth suffers her ultimate blow and these qualities are seemingly crushed out of her, yet somehow she crawls back up and reclaims them. Don't overlook this one! You'll never forget her tale. It's not all bitter - much sweet in here!"},{"Title":"The Book of Ruth","review":"It upsets me greatly to see people ripping this book apart because it's too depressing or they can't identify with Ruth's passivity. Her passivity is what makes her Ruth, lovable, naive, and with an innocent intelligent that comes from within. I am sorry some of you could not understand Ruth, because for the past two days, I have been living and breathing every second with Ruth. I am walking around at my job in a daze, waiting for the seconds to pass by so I can find her again. Only one other time (and I graduated with an English major--I have read a lot!!!) has a book effected me so profoundly that I believed in it as reality--that was Morrison's Beloved. I want to go and find Ruth's town, the hillside she cried upon, the old, empty farmhouse . . . I want to breathe where she breathed, to walk where she walked. I am so disappointed in the shallowness of people in our &quot;electronic, media, TELEVISION&quot; world, that they are unable to grasp the concept that people like Ruth do exist, and that Ruth is beautiful, wonderful, and ALIVE. Thank you, Jane Hamilton. I know I will never forget her story."},{"Title":"The Book of Ruth","review":"I had this book sitting on my shelf for sometime since Oprah first recommended it. I happen to pick it up recently to take to the beach. I must admit it was not an easy read and there were many times when I wondered why I was reading it because it was so painful. The ending was not unexpected for me because I felt like we were always leading to a crescendo only I was secretly hoping it would have been a happy one. Needless to say, it was certainly more appropriate than anything sugar coated. I was truly emotionally touched by Ruth's wonderful ability to look past the imperfections of those around her. I completely agree with other reveiwers in that this is not a light read but one that will never totally leave your heart and soul. The book is well worth the effort."},{"Title":"The Book of Ruth","review":"I just finished this book last night. This is the first Jane Hamilton book I have read. I can't wait to read A Map of the World.I'm surprised that so many readers found The Book of Ruth so depressing, pointless, and disturbing. This book portrays the way real people are and live in our world. Only we don't always see them. Most of the time we don't even acknowledge they exist. Then they read a book like this one and can't stand to even think about them being real people. Well they are, and they may live in your neighborhood.I felt sorry for Ruth. She was dealt a hand of cards and wasn't sure what to do with them. Ruth was missing love in her life. When she found Ruby, he gave her something that May couldn't. I am still thinking about Ruth and wonder if hope is enough to get her through."},{"Title":"The Book of Ruth","review":"Those who didn't like this book for its sad and tragic ending must realize that one of the main points of the book is just that, life can be tragic and sad. I loved Ruth like no other character I have read. I cried with pity for her only to laugh out loud a few pages later at her insightful wit. I was overcome by Ruth's desire to be loved and &quot;normal&quot;. The complexity of it's characters, who you will love and hate, helped to keep it intriguing. I will never forget this book."},{"Title":"The Book of Ruth","review":"Ruth is someone who is making due with all that life has thrown at her. She is intelligent, sad, lonely and often angry, but she is not afraid. I loved the character development of both Ruth and Ruby. It has been several days since I finished this book and I cannot stop thinking about it."},{"Title":"The Book of Ruth","review":"I have read both this book and Map of the World (which I loved and lived in and wanted to return to when I was finished).&quot;Ruth&quot; is, in my opinion, even more breathtaking than &quot;Map&quot;. Hamilton has a fine gift not only of fleshing out a character.. but of fleshing out a relationship in all its subtelties and meaning. Her narrative is as intricate and unpredictable as life itself.Hamilton's writing is so fluid and emotionally tactile it not only brings the reader into the story but lets you inside the characters and their relationships... you will live in Ruth's head and heart, you will truly know what it is to be her... the reader is not left wondering at her motives or reactions.The narrative is so finely woven you find yourself understanding completely the most questionable of characters. It is Hamilton's keen understanding of human nature and the dynamics of human interaction which makes these characters shine with their own particular beauty and intelligence and at the same time with the dark horror of their &quot;mean&quot; &quot;kernel&quot;s.Hamilton's writing is not &quot;meandering&quot; or &quot;boring&quot; at all... there is no line that could have been left out of &quot;Ruth&quot;. The story is actually quite spare and we hear all and only what we really need to know.I also do not understand how some readers can give &quot;Ruth&quot; bad reviews simply because it is 'depressing' and 'uninspiring'... Ruth is a victim of circumstances... but we know from living through her all the intricacies of the circumstances and thus how things could have been made better.The story starts with Ruth's feeling that her life's story started with the &quot;meanness&quot; in people... that we all have a kernel of meanness... we see how the subtleties of familial interactions can form the shape of their relationships and people's hearts and ultimately lead to destruction or salvation... the feeding of the kernel of &quot;meanness&quot; or it's eradication through patterns of expected behavior or by deviating from who your world has told you you are.We see how we can change our lives by breaking out of the behavior patterns we follow through the confines of the way our intimates (for better or worse) have drawn us. The only character brave enough to finally leap out of her casted role is Daisy, Ruth's &quot;slutty&quot; friend. Ruth's mother May, tragically, does not have the courage to end the cycle of her expected behavior and neither did Ruth.... but we are left at the end with the possibility of real change for Ruth... by virtue of her having learned how she got to be who and where she is... a revelation we should all be so lucky to make.I found &quot;Ruth&quot; wholly satisfying and also inspiring. This is definitely a book and a character I will carry with me for life and I eagerly await another novel from Hamilton."},{"Title":"The Book of Ruth","review":"Funny writing at the beginning, then it got slow in the middle. I was wondering where this book is going and then you get to the violent part and I felt sick. This book is not worth reading. Ok, read it if you want to feel glum."},{"Title":"The Book of Ruth","review":"What ever happened to that odd, quiet girl in your high school class? Ruth is that invisible girl, poor and proud, but curious, solid, and worth knowing all the same. She has a talent for bowling, a talent for loving, a gift for friendship, and a longing for understanding and truth. Her narrative looks at her bleak life unsparingly, tries to make sense of her suffering, and doesn't dodge her own culpability. We listen as she tries to make sense of tragedy, tries to understand the glib promises of faith, and tries to learn to be the mother her child needs. We count our blessings in comparison, but with a shudder, realize that \\"there but for grace, go I.\\""},{"Title":"The Book of Ruth","review":"Got it off the donated book shelf at the library at least they got 50 out of it. Horrible that an editor allowed them to use the title of a wonderful Bible story for this decidedly uncharitable book. Waste of my time. Kept at it thinking something would happen to uplift the main character. Not! Simple sentences and as depressing as Hemingway. Yes, real life is often the same day after day but this story grinds it into you with no relief and then nothing is resolved."},{"Title":"The Book of Ruth","review":"This book was depressing, depressing, depressing. There was nothing enjoyable about it. I seldom start a book and not finish it so I did read all of this book hoping that something would redeem it! Nothing did!"},{"Title":"The Book of Ruth","review":"I REALLY disliked this book. The Book of Nothing. I found the characters to be very shallow, the story to be very shallow and at the end of the day you really didn't care what happened to anyone.

I thought it was boring, it did not hold my interest."},{"Title":"The Book of Ruth","review":"The story is so typical of modern female authors...PREDICTABLE! What is up with this style of writing? I can't understand why female authors have to digress and 'emote' everything until the actual meaning of the text is lost. If you are looking for a 'typical modern' book, or feel that &quot;Oprah's Book Club Knows Best&quot; then this is an appropriate book. If however, you feel that life is worth digging a little deeper and depth of insight is a treasure, then I recommend looking elsewhere for inspiration. Jane Hamilton is admirable but lacks originality."},{"Title":"The Book of Ruth","review":"If you are at all prone to depression or suicide do NOT read this book. It is well written and well crafted, but to what end?"},{"Title":"The Book of Ruth","review":"This book was the biggest waste of my time.

Is Oprah not aware there are strong, healthy people out there, who not only lead productive useful lives, but raise productive children who also contribute to society, without benefit of abuse and mistreatment?I read painfully about the horrible lives these poor mentally challenged people endured, always with a sense of impending doom. Quite frankly, all but two of the characters (Ruth &amp; Ruby) are individuals who have made messes of their own lives and are the very sort of folks I have worked hard to insure I do not have to live near and certainly do not want my children growing up around. I would ask you then, why would I or any one else want to read about these dregs of society?"},{"Title":"The Book of Ruth","review":"Sorry Oprah, this was a flop. The whole time you're reading about Ruth, you wonder what the point of the book is. I have to admit that I had sympathy for the girl, but when you find out what the point actually is, you are mortified. If the book had focused more on her getting her life back together and finding actual real happiness, that would have been a good story!"},{"Title":"The Book of Ruth","review":"My friend Sherry has been trying to get me to read this book for two years. I have to admit and I am sorry if I offend anyone, but I was happy when he killed the mama. I felt she had it comming. She should have left him and his backward wife alone. It was sad for the sons to grow up with out a dad, however such is life. Women can learn a lesson from this book, stop dogging men who are already being dogged who are already down and out. If you can't help the situation then let it alone. Period. Or you too can be stabbed in the celler on xamas eve."},{"Title":"The Book of Ruth","review":"This was a well-written, very touching story that twists and turns all the way. Ruth, the heroine and narrator of the book, is one of the strongest (if not also strangest) women I've met in literature. Her story has stayed with me as if I read the book yesterday. There are very few books which, using only the scantest number of words, can paint pictures of people, times, and actions which you can see, smell and taste with your senses. This book was SO different from &quot;Map of the World&quot;, I wouldn't have recognized Hamilton as the author. Please read this book. It has a lot to say."},{"Title":"The Book of Ruth","review":"This book was well written and thought provoking but it broke my heart. Thoroughly depressing, it bleeds the spirit of all hope! Read this only on a bright sunny day when all the world is right because even then its dark cloud will hover over your mind."},{"Title":"The Book of Ruth","review":"For the first few chapters, the small town characters were genuinely interesting. I felt sympathy for both Ruth and her prodigy brother. While the family dysfunction was refreshingly honest, the book rapidly declined once Matt left and Ruby was introduced. The romance between Ruth and Ruby was unconvincing and Ruby's character was pathetically tedious. Ruth herself does not stay true to character, oscillating between personality extremes throughout the book. The author can't seem to decide if she is a strong, resourceful heroine and or a mentally challenged weakling. The violent ending is both infuriating and emotionally implausible. All in all, a disappointing read."},{"Title":"The Book of Ruth","review":"An interesting story, but I did not like the end. It tells of a young girl's stuggle in a poor and dysfunctional family. How she tried to gain independence and fell in love. Her husband was strange and in the end was even stranger! A bit too morbid and violent for me."},{"Title":"The Book of Ruth","review":"I, for one, did not feel sorry for Ruth. She was a hoot - had a great sense of humor about all the squalid things happening around her. I did not find her mother as objectionable as the bookcover blurb implied, either. However, I did find the characterization of the mother one of the book's flaws. I just couldn't &quot;see&quot; her, for all of Ruth's talking about her. Maybe it's because she did just that - talk ABOUT her. She was just too much of a cartoon for me - not human enough. Still, that didn't spoil the book for me.As for the previous reviewer who complained about Ruth's (and Hamilton's) jaundiced views on organized religion: MORE POWER TO THEM! Praise God (who is probably amused as Hell by organized religion) for Great Writers. Most of them, throughout history, have presented us with a clear view of the sham - the hypocrisy, the abuse of power, the ignorance bred in the institution.After having seen the movie version of (and then read the book of &quot;Map of The World&quot; ) I am a real fan of this author and look forward to everything else she brings us in the future."},{"Title":"The Book of Ruth","review":"I've read several books from Oprah's Book Club, and I have to say that \\"The Book of Ruth\\" is by far the best book. Jane Hamilton has a great gift to let the reader really step in the characters' shoes. If the same story was told by an less capable author, the first part of the story would seem very boring, and the second part would seem too far-fetched. However, Jane Hamilton made the characters come alive, and you see parts of the characters in yourself and in people you know. By reading \\"The Book of Ruth\\", you go on a journey with Ruth, going through life with her emotionally abusive mother and her talented but emotionally unattached brother, and feeling trapped. Her correspondence with her Aunt Sid is one of the only bright spots in her early years besides reading books with a blind lady. Ruth's journey does not have a happy ever after ending, but you will not regret getting to know Ruth and her life story."},{"Title":"The Book of Ruth","review":"I gave this book 3 out of 5 stars because I really didn't love it. This book was chosen for my book club so I had to read it. I think if it wasn't for my club I wouldn't have finished it. Despite not enjoying the book we did have quite a good conversation about this book. It brought about a lot of good conversation and discussion. The characters were complex and well-developed in my opinion, but they were overall very sad folks. You kept waiting for things to get better for them. I felt like the entire book I spent \\"waiting\\" for something to happen that never really did. Without giving too much away, there was a climatic moment in the book that was dramatic and shocking. I suppose it is worth it to read it to get to this part. It's at the very end though. It is worht a read if you like to analyze different people's personalities and what makes them how they are. That was mostly what our discussion was about, just talking about why these people were the way that they were."},{"Title":"The Book of Ruth","review":"The movement of the novel felt particularly slow in the first half and abrupt in the climax--though some of this has to do with the nature of the plotline. There's some foreshadowing to pull you through Hamilton's ground-laying, but it still felt slow.Part of me wonders what the novel would be like told from Ruby's point of view. You can't help but feel that Ruby is trouble once you meet him and while evidence mounts over the course of the book. Hamilton (through the voice of Ruth) refuses to take the easy way out by blaming Ruby or declaring him inherently evil.The voice of Ruth, the narrator, is lively and believable--sometimes with hilarious bite--and the characters around her are well-rounded and engaging."},{"Title":"The Book of Ruth","review":"I found the book to be very riveting and could not put the book down. I do admit it was very depressing at times but life is that way. The thing I liked about this book was that it was sooooo realistic. You can go to any town in the usa and find somebody like that. And the truth is they do not know they are bad off for this is all they know. I think she did redeem herself at the end. It was one of the best books I have ever read."},{"Title":"The Book of Ruth","review":"Did you ever think about how when you see some \\"sensational, human interest\\" tragedy on the evening news, that there are real people in that story? The news wants you to think it's entertainment. Meanwhile, Hamilton writes a story that reads like real. Hard struggles, and nobody is all good or all bad. People muddle through. Thankfully, most people do not experience tragedy. And yet I think most readers will find something familiar in the Book of Ruth."},{"Title":"The Book of Ruth","review":"While the ending is ever-so-slightly upbeat, this sad tale of underachieving losers is pretty bad. I wonder why the author wasted her time. I certainly question why on earth I wasted mine in reading this dreary saga."},{"Title":"The Book of Ruth","review":"After finishing this book, I had the impression that it was, at least in part, a true story. After reading the other reviews posted here, and agreeing with much of what they say about the book's flaws, I nevertheless believe the lack of consistency in the characterizations somehow makes the story seem more real. I loved Ruth's voice, though the book definitely dragged in parts. I wish that it had a different ending."},{"Title":"The Book of Ruth","review":"Despite the presence of one member in our book group who hates reading anything Oprah selects, we read this book and had a great discussion about it. (Sometimes it's worth reading an imperfect book just because it provokes such a good discussion.) I loved the book but couldn't argue with the many criticisms -- mainly about motivation, behavior, etc. Despite the fact that I couldn't picture myself in this family's situation in any way, I had a gut-level response to the book. On the whole, I think Oprah picks better than most people do. She may lean a little toward the politically correct, but there is usually something gutsy to the books she picks."},{"Title":"The Book of Ruth","review":"I can't believe I'm wasting any more time thinking about this horrible book. If you enjoy this book, you need to stop watching Oprah and get your own opinions besides hers. Its terrible."},{"Title":"The Book of Ruth","review":"I didn't see the attraction of this book. Perhaps because it was so highly recommended to me, I expected too much, or at least more. No offense to Jane Hamilton, but I felt only lackluster empathy for her dangerously benign characters, none of whom for which I had a modicum of repect or pity. With the Biblically-allusive title, I expected to discover some redeeming quality in the titled-character, but, instead, I found only a cavernous soul in a box-car of a life. The murder-by-decapitation twist was not only unexpected but resemblent of a poor, fictionalized Vincent Bugliosi novel. I have to say, I was tragically disappointed in this book."},{"Title":"The Book of Ruth","review":"The Book of Ruth Discussion: Many members could not \\"get into the book\\" and did not finish the novel. Comments ran the gamut form \\"it was a piece of s#$%\\" to \\"it was OK\\". A member mentioned the parallel theme in The Story of Ruth and Moma's Girl by Veronica Chambers: e.g. In the first person, both mothers doted on the brothers and both brothers escaped. It was well written although the characters were not likeable. The hick town Ruth lived in almost seemed a stereotype. You could feel disaster coming based on the dynamics of the personalities while Ruth, Ruby, and May lived in the same house. The disaster was horrific and hard to read. The ending tossed in a few new points but no closure. In Company of My Sistahs' Book Club Northern California"},{"Title":"The Book of Ruth","review":"And then breed? Oprah is clearly working through her abusive childhood with this one. This book proves the idea that well-written doesn't necessarily mean good. Excellent prose drove me on when the characters and plot could no longer do so. Books about women participating in their own degradation is something I would have hoped we could have moved beyond by now"},{"Title":"The Book of Ruth","review":"Once I started this book, I couldn't put it down. However, once I finished it, I wish I hadn't read it. Jane Hamilton makes this family of dysfunctional characters so tangible, so understandable that I was able to empathize with some very unsavory behaviour. While it's so tempting and so easy to categorize the world according to what is right and what is wrong, Ms. Hamilton plops us right in that grey region where moral sensibility fights with human compassion. I cannot get the characters of Ruth, her mother, and her husband, Ruby, out of my mind...and I wish I could. I haven't been so disturbed by a book in years. Ms. Hamilton is a brilliant writer, but I hope she picks less grim subjects for future examination. My only criticism of the book is the character of Ruth's aunt. I didn't really believe her motivation and her desire to help Ruth. All in all, this is a brilliant piece of writing that I cannot recommend---it is just too bleak"},{"Title":"The Book of Ruth","review":"The popularity of this book is probably what happens when talk show hosts start telling people what to read -- and people are misguided enough to listen. This book was too long by half. The language and voice were not convincing, and the characters, despite an excess of description and plot, still managed to be one dimensional. The narrator's constant victimization is wearing rather than sympathetic. If you want to read a book that sets out to accomplish the same task, but accomplishes it with brevity, grace, and power, read Ellen Foster by Kaye Gibbons"},{"Title":"The Book of Ruth","review":"Why does Oprah keep selecting books of depression, opression, poor choices, despair and lack of hope????Forget it!

Her mother, may, whose heart is full of pain and hate,knows little about loving her daughter. ruth's husband, ruby, who is mentally ill, in his way loves ruth. he lives with tormenters inside him. his pain and rage coupled with may's dark heart create in the reader a justified fear for ruth and her son. unwritten throughout the book is how volital life was...a feeling of dread. this book is fiction, created in the mind of the author, however, this story could....and does....happen in the real world."},{"Title":"The Book of Ruth","review":"Roethke describes madness as nobility of the soul at odds with circumstance. I think this message lies at the core of this book. Ruth's hope and quiet determination give meaning to a life fraught with cruelty and pain. The unconditional love she receives from her aunt helps provide her with an outlet for her feelings and a sense of self-worth that ultimately gives Ruth a source of resilience and belief in a future she can forge through her own strengths."},{"Title":"The Book of Ruth","review":"Ruth can't help but believe in a the potential for goodness of everyone she encounters. In the end, she -- perhaps unknowingly -- facilitates the destruction of the two people who do her the most harm. She is an angel, living in the modern world, amongst devils. This is a haunting, deeply meaningful book that leaves you with something, as all classics do. That something is despair or hope; the reader decides."},{"Title":"The Book of Ruth","review":"I see many mixed reviews but I feel that Ruth portrayed a whole different perspective on some of the world's &quot;low-lifes&quot;.

I applaud a book and author that can open my eyes to new ideas, views, perspectives"},{"Title":"The Book of Ruth","review":"Although it's hard to take, I can accept criticism of this book. Readers claim its subject is too depressing; that's why I answer you must be in the mood to read it. You must be ready for a depressing plot, but you almost must walk away with a lesson learned. Jane Hamilton is a wonderful writer who doesn't just paint a rosy picture -- Be Prepared"},{"Title":"The Book of Ruth","review":"I picked the Book of Ruth because I thought itwould be another story about an insecure girl whoafter chapters of having her flagellating egostomped into the ground, inspiringly gained a spineand took hold of her life.

Actually I have a possible Jury call up tomorrow and am HOPING it materializes because I HAVE to read this beautiful creation. These deep insights must come from SOME experience of real-life suffering. It is NOT depressing - it is rich in metaphors that spring from nowhere ... but the disturbing aspect is that there must be many people captivated as Ruth was - and unable to break from their circumstances. Aunt Syd's profound impact on Ruth is a lesson in the effects of unwitting kindness. The most amazing revelation to me thus far is the scope of the unrevealed ramifications of Ruth's mind and emotions"},{"Title":"The Book of Ruth","review":"Jane Hamilton is a first-class writer. She's a poet and a novelist. Her descriptions are humorous, touching and memorable. Keepsake phrases litter the book throughout and are worth reading over and over, sometimes smiling - sometimes tearing up. The story is of a young girl born into circumstances of doom. She is trapped within her own mind. She seems to the reader very bright and yet at the same time, &quot;stuck&quot; and naive. The ending took my breath away and left me to think about the plot more deeply for a while. The novel was a reminder of Sling Blade (vice versa)in that both main characters are sad and hopelessly traumatized by life. The only difference with Ruth is that she is never enlightened. I went directly to the bookstore and bought Hamilton's first novel. This is not a &quot;feel good&quot; book. Stay away if you can't handle unhappy plots"},{"Title":"The Book of Ruth","review":"The characters of the book reveal the answers to many questions we have when familial tragedies occur. The obvious and hidden tensions that exist in families are the cornerstone of this plot and the ending becomes ever more clear as the characters develop and grow. Parts of the book force reflection and reveal bits of sadness that touch the reader who may have frineds and/or family who fit the characters. This book was a joy and a trouble at the same time. armena andrania"},{"Title":"The Book of Ruth","review":"\\"The Book of Ruth\\" describes the life of a woman who loves someone with all her heart and soul, but then loses this love before she even has a chance to consummate it. Then she carries this loss around with her like an albatross, never rejoicing in life's joyful monumental events but instead knocks down any uprising of happiness and joy she encounters as she carries on her life marrying again and having children. She takes this loss out on Ruth, her only daughter, both physically and especially mentally, while she places her son Matt on a pedestal he feels is unwarranted. Matt escapes to college, and Ruth, the dumb one who has not a speck of self-confidence due to her mothers constant disparaging, is resigned to continue to live with her mother and submit to her mothers derilect treatment of herself. A well written dose of some peoples reality."},{"Title":"The Book of Ruth","review":"I enjoyed the book. The authors discriptions and reactions to certain things were very funny and entertaining. It had all the qualities of how a young girl in her circumstances might react. The book also dealt with extreem tragedy in a very touching way. I have recommended it to friends."},{"Title":"The Book of Ruth","review":"This book was absolutely fantastic. I'm working my way through Oprah's book list and I haven't been disappointed yet! I put this one near the top, though. The narrator is so likeable, such an \\"everyman\\" despite her many faults and \\"lack of intelligence,\\" that the reader can't help but sympathize. You get to know this character closely and personally, and because of that, the story draws you in, almost in a Holden Caulfield kind of way. The END is shockingly surprising and unexpected, but makes sense, and leaves the reader rooting for Ruth, even in the very end."},{"Title":"The Book of Ruth","review":"I was leary of taking the time to read (actually listen to) this book as I wasn't nuts about &quot;A Map of the World&quot;. I sure wasn't disappointed this time. Alot of people feel it was too depressing and there were alot of miserable times for Ruth and her family, but Hamilton used some humor in the story too. I laughed over several things, such as the time Ruth tried to make supper and instead of peeling onions, accidently grabbed tulip bulbs. Sounds like something I'd have done. Also, when Randolph, the fat neighbor boy, supposedly had a girlfriend. Ruth is amazed and asks his sister &quot;who?&quot;, to which she simply replies &quot;BAAAA&quot;. The story is a good example of what can happen to a child if they are constantly put down and told they are worthless and stupid. If Ruth had had a better mother, I think things would have turned out alot differently for her. When she finally met Mr. Right, Ruby, I thought he would turn out to be abusive, but he was just like Ruth. Not real smart and just needing to hear someone say something positive to him once in a while. I did get a bit fed up with the way Ruth allowed him to be so lazy and didn't really blame her mother for getting mad at Ruby. I would have kicked them both out a long time before it came down to the final blow-up. My only complaint about the story was the ending. It seemed like Jane Hamilton kind of ran out of steam and just wanted to get the book finished. The interesting storyline seemed to fall apart and did get really depressing towards the end. I hoped to see Ruth finally having some good luck after she moved in with her aunt and cheer up, but the story ended before we got to find out if she did or not. &quot;The book of Ruth&quot; turned out to be one of my favorite Oprah picks. I'll look forward to Hamilton's next novel."},{"Title":"The Book of Ruth","review":"I just finished this book ten minutes ago and I am still clawing at myself. This book is absolutely heart-wrenching, terrifying, and astonishingly vivid. Although I did not always connect with Ruth I was still physically sick and about to scream during the climax with Ruby. Few books have had such a profound effect on me. &quot;The Book of Ruth&quot; is nothing short of amazing."},{"Title":"The Book of Ruth","review":"The sad, beautifully told tale made me laugh and made me cry. Sometimes I wanted to shout at Ruth and sometimes I wanted to hug her close and protect her from all the ugliness in her life.This disturbing but lyrically moving story forced me to rethink some of my most secret prejudices regarding people who exist on an Earth only occasionally glimpsed from the corner of my eye. An existence where poverty and despair rule with a choke hold so strong that hope can only infrequently flail with weak fists.This book is not a \`feel-good', up-lifting, win against all odds kind of book (the kind I generally prefer to select) but it definitely kept me interested. I kept waiting for the big break through, the light, that almost mystical AH HA insight that would save Ruth in the end. Yet Ruth never gives up, no matter how dismal her circumstances and no matter that she certainly wasn't dealt a full deck to begin with. The Book of Ruth will not easily be forgotten nor do I suppose it really should be."},{"Title":"The Book of Ruth","review":"I feel sorry for people who read this book and think that everyone should be just like them. There are people in the world like this who actually experience and feel these things. At first I wanted Ruth to become more than she was...It wasn't difficult to accept her for who she was after I realized that she had accepted who she was. What makes me sad is that this book was not as thought provoking for some of the other readers. Maybe we should all seek the out the Ruths of the world and offer a helping hand. Jane Hamilton is an excellent writer. The Book of Ruth is an excellent novel."},{"Title":"The Book of Ruth","review":"I read through the other reviews before posting my own...I agree and disagree with many of the readers, but life wouldn't be very interesting if we all agreed all the time, would it?There's no doubt that this is a well-written book, but I do agree with many of the comments regarding Ruth. I think my problem comes with the fact that this is her narrative, yet she believes herself to be uneducated. Where in her life did she develop such a way with story-telling? This might be a minor detail, but it does not give credibility to her character.Many readers did not like the book because of its depressing subject matter. I think that's a matter of personal taste, but would it have been a better book had Ruth's life turned out better? I don't think so. I had a hard time with the way it ended...it was very cold. I guess I expected Ruth to at least react. She is a very passive character. Not once does she try to change her life or improve herself whatsoever. I think that's what depresses me the most. She simply accepts her life as it is."},{"Title":"The Book of Ruth","review":"a very cool teacher of mine recently recommended this book to me, so i bought it, read 150 pages the first day, and finished within the next 2 days. i'm not bragging here, this book just has a way of grabbing you. i'm not fond of oprah and her book club deal, so when i saw her &quot;stamp of approval&quot; on the cover i thought to myself ohh i'm screwed. but nonetheless, the book is like a tearful journal of this woman who is humble and seemingly becomes smarter and more confident of herself as she continues to tell her story. but this isn't her journal. it's her life. don't be fooled- this book isn't just for women. throughout ruth's story, you realize how much she has been robbed of even when she is unaware due to so much abuse. maybe you'll see some of ruth in your own self."},{"Title":"The Book of Ruth","review":"I read this book over a family vacation, and finished it in the car on the way home. I almost jumped out of the car while reading the last few pages!! My husband thought I'd taken leave of my senses, and my kids thought I was a nut! Basically I was freaking out... If you've read the book you know what I mean.The book is full of foreshadowing, and starts out with word that go something like \\"I believe it all starts with a seed of meanness in everyone's heart...\\" or something like that, and we find out exactly what the narrator means.True this is not a happy and uplifting book. It deals with an emotionally abusive mother, a young and somewhat naive girl and her husband who is a drug addict as well as unemployed.... Somehow though, Jane Hamilton's excellent character development helps to care about each and every one of these people, and to somehow empathize or at least sympathize with them, and maybe even love them at times. I found the character of Ruby, the husband, to be particularly well developed, pathetic and yet lovable.I found this book better than Map of the World, especially due to its \\"wow\\"! ending; I thought Map of the World fell somewhat flat in that area. But not The Book of Ruth... Great read!!"},{"Title":"The Book of Ruth","review":"This is the first Jane Hamilton book I have read and I'm looking forward to reading more of her work.Ruth is a wholly likeable character who seems to try hard at everything she does.I felt so sorry for her being married to Ruby and trying to keep the peace at home constantly.This book,with its such diverse characters would appeal to a broad range of readers."},{"Title":"The Book of Ruth","review":"I finally can give up my guilt and confusion over my own sister's mild retardation and choice to live in a world I can only imagine.

This book finally let me see that we all have choices, and those choices are based on our capacity to maintain that choice. My sister chooses to live with a husband who is also mentally challenged, and they consistantly make questionable decisions regarding their 4 children (who are slow) and themselves. I now can respect that their life-style is theirs, and my life-style is mine, and I am not responsible for changing her life to come up to my standards.

I'd like to see what she could do with creative nonfiction. I guess this book suffers from my having read it soon after All Over but the Shoutin' by Rick Bragg, a wonderful true account of struggle and hardship in a less privileged corner of the world.

The language was quite harsh, as was the emotional and physical abuse. In one particular case, the violence came to a head and was so full of evil and hatred that it was hard for me to forget.

First, the poor white trash thing gets a little over the top after awhile. OK, we get the point, again. It's just the setting so give it a rest.

Ruth draws you in and you cannot shake her. The towns in the book for Ruth's \\"getaway\\" are near my home. It is not difficult to see this family in small town or rural America. So many people are left behind in their young lives and pulled back if they try to leave. Jane Hamilton is an excellent writer and I look forward to reading more of her works."},{"Title":"The Book of Ruth","review":"This is the best book I have read in a very long time. Perhaps because, like the protagonist, Ruth, I also graduated from high school in 1973, I can identify with her. Unlike Ruth, I was quite intelligent and went on to college. Like her, I have low self-esteem and chose boyfriends who were violent and/or had low IQs. Eventually I grew out of that habit! The characters rang true for me, as I had a best friend growing up who could have BEEN Ruth. People really do talk and act like this in rural America, and derive their pride from bowling strikes, making quilts, and gossiping. Their main joy in life is drinking beer and those moments sucking on a cigarette, which keep them from thinking. There was a wonderful quote to this effect in the book. The character of Ruth is a very keen observer of all that goes on around her. She is also a fantastic daydreamer, being able to put herself into the fanasy lives of her Aunt, and the literary worlds of Jane Austen and Charles Dickens. The motivation for the reason that she hides her academic brilliance from her teachers is confusing at times, but becomes clear at the end: it is her refuge, it is her secret that she knows these things. She messes up on the spelling of the simple word \\"sandwich\\" because she cannot bear to destroy her mother's one dream: that her younger brother Matt is perfect. Warning: This book can be deeply disturbing for its questions about Christianity, and its bold look at little-discussed problems of frustrated teen sexuality and farm life. You can read anything you want into that statement."},{"Title":"The Book of Ruth","review":"A sad story about a girl woman who suffers low self esteem derived from a long suffering childhood of verbal sometimes physical abuse at the hand of her well meaning mother. She is the strong one (only she doesn't know it) who shows unconditional love for a pathetic man whom she only sees the good in when no one else can. Sometimes we all get trapped in these type situations."},{"Title":"The Book of Ruth","review":"At the end Ruth describes herself and her mother as &quot;Ugly, mean and down on their luck&quot;. Her description of herself in these terms, as she emerges from a cataclysmic series of events, is true to her character, in that it reflects her life-long habit of underestimating her own potential, human beauty, and intrinsic worth. Ruth's story is only uncommon due to how far life has carried her and her family into ruin. Hers is the story of those, who by the circumstances of birth including both poverty and ignorance, are doomed to unfulfilled lives of limited horizons and near hopeless desperation.Ms. Hamilton reveals Ruth's life and quest for truth and hope with a journeyman's skill. If, on occasion, you like a dark story you will probably enjoy this book. A better bet, however, would be Tawni O'Dell's &quot;Back Roads&quot;."},{"Title":"The Book of Ruth","review":"Jane Hamilton has shared with us the very real story of a woman we all know. The clarity with which she spins her characterizations and sense of story are the essence of this book. The details of Ruth's surroundings became at once familiar to me in a mid-American sort of way, and I found myself at times ashamed at the presumptive nature of my thoughts and reactions in relation to her state of existence. Perhaps I am an exception, but I had not anticipated the events at the climax of this story. However, I found Ruth to be a character worthy of emulation in many ways. She solidifies our hope that the human spirit will prevail."},{"Title":"The Book of Ruth","review":"This book took my breath away. It is so, so sad, but the characters were so real. What struck me as I began reading was that the heroine had so little, and yet she felt that she had everything she ever wanted - a husband and child she loved, a job she enjoyed, a loyal best friend, and an aunt who seemed so glamourous. Her life doesn't seem like much to the reader, but she was so happy - and then she lost it all. Throughout the story is an underlying tension that suggests that something is coming, but I was not prepared for the climactic scene of violence, which left me shaking and horrified. To me, a book's value is measured by the degree to which it can stir my emotions - good or bad - and this one succeeds as few others have. Wonderful!"},{"Title":"The Book of Ruth","review":"Moved and emotionally tied to this book in many ways, I have chosen it as one of the texts I will discuss in a class I am teaching spring semester. It is a class that will focus on women creating one's own voice. Jane Hamilton's ability to create a believable first person voice, enveloping the reader in a world that becomes (is) so real is remarkable. Especially interesting to me from a woman's perspective...choices made from experiential relatioships. Oh, how I would love to speak with the author..to know the heart of her creative process!"},{"Title":"The Book of Ruth","review":"This book is not a nice, relaxing read. It is not uplifting. I read the book after the Oprah review aired and now I wish I could see it again to find out what it was people liked about it. I am so relieved to read reviews on this page that agree with me. Not all, but some. How about a &quot;0 stars&quot; option? I have learned that Oprah and I do NOT have the same taste in books!"},{"Title":"The Book of Ruth","review":"The Book of Ruth was at first hard to get into, but then I found myself warming up to the protagonist. And now I love her. Ruth is such a warm and believable character. The diction is simple enough to remind me of &quot;The Grapes of Wrath&quot;; it's easy to flow through the book and become connected to this superb story!"},{"Title":"The Book of Ruth","review":"I'ts after midninght, but I just finised &quot;The Book of Ruth&quot;, and I couldn't sleep. This is the first review I have ever written, but I feel compelled to share my thoughts on this disturbing book.I wept for Ruth, for May and for Ruby. I found myself hoping against hope that May would find some compassion for Ruby...that Ruby would somehow get his act together and that Ruth would wake up and realize just where her future was headed, and find someway to make it better.Who amoung us doesn't feel a little guilt, as Aunt Sid does, for not becoming more involved when we sense that there may be something terribly wrong in the lives of those around us.This is a very moving and powerful novel. It is not a &quot;feel good&quot; book, but one that will make you remember the times you may have been less than kind to someone less fortunate. It will make you appreciate the life you have. It will make you think. It will make you cry."},{"Title":"The Book of Ruth","review":"I finished &quot;The Book of Ruth&quot; last night and today I miss her terribly. I read some of the book's reviews on Amazon.com today, and I am amazed at how differently we see things, we humans. Because I cherished the experience of reading this book so deeply (and no, I wasn't abused), I can't imagine that those who didn't care for it could possibly have read the same book.I make an assumption about Ruth from the very first chapter: that she is very mildly retarded or in some way subtly disabled. For me, her behaviors and perceptions are off just enough to imply some missing cerebral link. And this is what is so extraordinary to me: that someone without all resources at her disposal can yet perceive herself and her world with such precious, ingenuous, brilliant vision ... well, I would feel honored to have her as a friend.To write from the point of view of a retarded person makes for such creative use of language and imagery. Ruth is like an idiot savant. She is all the best a human being can be, tireless in her effort to find good and truth in her experiences, resilient beyond belief. I think she puts us all to shame, &quot;healthy&quot; though we be.Depressing? No, no, no. That's too easy. I am reminded of Yeats: &quot;...a terrible beauty is born.&quot; I am in awe of Ruthy. I laugh through my tears and am comforted."},{"Title":"The Book of Ruth","review":"I'm from a very small town, and when I was in high school, I actually had a boyfriend like Ruby - thank God I ran screaming for 1,000 miles before I stopped! This book spoke directly to me and mesmerized me from start to finish. Ruth was not retarded or pathetic - she was living the only life she knew with the only people available to her. I can only imagine how many other lonely &amp; intelligent young women are living in her shoes - wasted, hopeless, potential completely unrealized, put down by everybody they know. I've recommended this book to every serious reader I know."},{"Title":"The Book of Ruth","review":"The Book of Ruth is one of those books that is very thought provoking. It is not exactly the most upbeat book that I have read, but Ruth is in her own way trying to survive the best that she can.Ruth's main tormentor in the book is her mother, May, who is so consumed by negativity that it is really pointless to try to argue with her. Ruth learns to survive her mother's negativity with the dream of visiting her Aunt Sid, who is May's youngest sister. Aunt Sid is like the polar opposite of May.Unfortunately, Ruth has to deal with her brother, Matt, who is a math prodigy. May always seems to be more preoccupied with Matt. Thus, Ruth is always second fiddle. When Matt leaves for college, May still thinks that Matt can do nothing wrong. Even though, he basically cuts off communication with their family.Ruth does eventually hook up with Ruby, who is a very emotionally disturbed man. They form a unique bond that eventually leads to marriage, which leads to Ruth, Ruby and May living under the same roof.All I can say is that the ending is unbelievable. I could see the signs of major tension, but the ending still caught me off guard. I knew that I would finish reading the book, but I had to put it down after the shock in order to get some fresh air.Hamilton has this knack for making you believe that things cannot get any worse, but then they do and you still cannot put the book down.I was glad that there was some hope for Ruth at the end of the book. I'm not sure if Hamilton is trying to emphasize the fact that what we endure will make us stronger, but that is definitely what I get out of this book.I would recommend this book only if you want something that is thought provoking and engaging. If you are in the mood for something light, then this is not the book for you. The Book of Ruth will definitely open your eyes up to someone who has had a rough life. Jane Hamilton has done a good job."},{"Title":"The Book of Ruth","review":"Reading Jane Hamilton's \\"Book of Ruth\\" is like diving into a sea of outrageous dysfunction. It is like drowning. It is like observing from below the surface and unable to do a damn thing about the events happening before your eyes.If one is a writer, The Book of Ruth is the absolute perfect novel to study--because it is structurally superb, beautiful, full of foreshadowing (burnt black birds hanging upside down the telephone line), flowing with imagery, honesty,and more importantly, the characters are likable, hatable, and exquisitely designed.Jane Hamilton has taken a dysfunctional, uneducated family--and through her characteration and mastery, made us care about what happens to them; made us part of the family, even when we didn't care to be there. Hamilton takes a character like mean old May, and causes us to feel empathy for her, even though May is unbearably vicious.\\"The Book of Ruth\\" is about families we all know--but do not invite into our lives because they smell, use the wrong vocabulary, forget to brush their teeth, and make their careers at the dry-cleaners. These people are undesirable,invisible, and sit in the back of the bus.But Hamilton makes us live with them, get to know them, understand them, hate them, and in the end, love them.***I was surprised by the other reviews--as I thought The Book of Ruth was deliciously stunning and overflowing with insight."},{"Title":"The Book of Ruth","review":"Before reading _The Book of Ruth_, I read many of the reviews here at Amazon. I had already made the purchase months ago after I saw the book on display at my local bookstore but I only just now got around to reading it this week. It was only after the fact, that I discovered it was an Oprah's Book Club selection. I never watch her, so I decided to check out the Amazon site to see if this book was worth reading.I have to say, now that I've finished the book, I'm baffled at the number of people who found this story to be so depressing they couldn't bring themselves to finish it. I can only think that perhaps it was too much for some people to handle emotionally. Maybe it hit too close to home and they just aren't ready for it yet. To me, this story is a compassionate look -- never condescending or patronizing -- at a family so many of us can find in our own extended families and in our communities. I'm even more shocked that people would harshly criticize Jane Hamilton for writing a story that made them feel sad. Life's not an episode of the Brady Bunch. Bad things happen to all people and it's only human to feel sadness about those events. Why would you even think about reading a book with a review on the back cover that refers to the story as &quot;a disturbing and beautiful book&quot; if you were looking for an all-around happy tale?Let me tell you what I see in _The Book of Ruth_ and why I see it as a story of hope...I see some of the kids with whom I attended elementary school who were shunned by teachers and students alike because they were not able to keep up financially, socially or academically with their peers. Many of us are privileged enough to have enough money to provide for all our wants and needs. Likewise, most of us have healthy minds and bodies which allow us to work through much of what life throws at us. Too often, however, we take those gifts for granted and harshly criticize those who don't possess those same blessings and don't seem to know how to get a better life for themselves. The shallow and self-absorbed, the fearful will look at those people and think, &quot;Ah, they're just poor because they're lazy.&quot; Or, &quot;Why bother? She's not smart enough to get it anyway.&quot; Forget the qualifiers... they're people. And, until you know them, really know them, you're wrongly assuming a lot when you label them like that.I see my sister and her girls in the characters of May and Ruth. So many times in my life I've wondered how hard it has really been for them back living in a dumpy little trailer in a small town in the northern U.S. Where did they find the strength to overcome circumstances they could never have avoided and what has happened to their spirits when they've suffered the repercussions of poor decisions they've made in their lives?I see myself in Aunt Sid. I live over a thousand miles away from my family and every time I hear the news from home about my sister, I want so much to just rescue her. Sometimes I think she needs rescuing from herself, but also from the meanness of those around her who are so quick to judge her. But then I realize that we don't really even know each other anymore and it makes it hard to rise over the wall that distance and time and experience has built up between us over the years. I shake my head and wonder what's going to happen to them if things don't get better. It just seems like our lives have become two paths running in opposite directions and that we'll never find a common intersection again. And thinking about all of that is what made me sad when I read _The Book of Ruth_. It made me realize that sometimes just because you're family it doesn't mean that you will ever really know each other. At least that's how it has felt to me for the past 30 years.Reading this book gave me hope. It gave me hope that my sister and her family might be able to change their situation somehow for the better. I'm not delusional; I know that the odds still aren't running in their favor and I know that they will probably not become pillars of the community. But at least they still might be able to find some happiness amidst what has now been over 25 years of almost daily doses of pain, humiliation, fear and heartache.It also gives me hope for myself. It gives me hope that my family, which has suffered a lot of isolation and alienation in my lifetime, might be able to be better. If you've never grown up in a family (or within viewing distance of a family) like the one Ruth describes in this novel, you can't possibly know what that life does to a person. There are a lot of people out there who would count themselves lucky to deal with what you consider to be problems in your life. And, for that, you're fortunate. Just be thankful.A review on the back cover of the book describes this as a story about &quot;resiliency.&quot; That's about the most apt description I could imagine. Read about Ruth and you'll see how strong a tender person has to be in order to live."},{"Title":"The Book of Ruth","review":"I read this book nearly 5 years ago, and yet I can clearly remember details from it. Nearly every book that I have ever read that makes an impact on me I read at least twice.This was not necessary with The Book ofRuth. I give it a 3 because it certainly is a story that gripped me from the very beginning, and forced me to continue to the very end in one sitting. It also has stayed with me, which is certainly not the norm for a book read in one sitting and never read again.For me, this was a difficult book to read, because it was so incredibly bleak. The tiny points of brightness in it were vivid, though sparing, which I suppose were made more vivid in the overwhelming tangle of harshness and deprivation.Does this novel have impact? Yes. When a storyteller can seize you with a tale so that you devour it in one sitting, never pick it up again, and still vividly recall details about it years later, that is definitely a novel that makes an impact.My frustration with this novel, however, is that the impact rather felt like a jackhammering of my psyche, rather than an ephiphany or at least a sense of wonder at a wonderful tale told well.It is a tale told well, but it is not a wonderful tale.I have never known whether to recommend this to anyone because of the fact that it *is* a tale told well, or whether to keep my mouth shut on this one, because I'm not convinced one way or the other that the tale was worth telling.Hamilton is beyond doubt talented and gifted in character description (at least of Ruth), has an excellent grasp of narrative voice, but I have read nothing else by her since this book and likely never will. I guess that I am glad that I read the Book of Ruth, because in my opinion it is a classic example of having all the right tools and all of the right gifts and then wasting them on an irredeemable cast of characters.Do I recommend it? Yes - If you are interested in seeing how to right fabulously and still make a mess of things."},{"Title":"The Book of Ruth","review":"Ruth is a strong woman living what some may take as a weak exterior.

This amazing novel is jam-packed with philosophical undertones delivered to the reader through eloquent lyricism and a unique voice pleading to be heard. This novel wasn't just a static read. It was very complex and involving - demanding the reader participate via an internal philosophical debate. Engaging and entertaining... I couldn't put it down and still think of Ruth's dynamic character over 10 years after reading the novel. If you haven't read it, please do! I encourage you to question Ruth's character constantly. I re-read this book in college for a philosophy class and the class discussion was very lively. Treat yourself to a deeply moving read and a woman you'll never forget."},{"Title":"The Book of Ruth","review":"My book club chose the Book of Ruth to discuss last month. We are all educators and have taught Ruth, May and Ruby and their families. I have seen children go through our school system untapped and ignored because of background. These children can be forgotten about from 1st grade on up. It is much easier to ignore these situations than address them. This book made me appreciate the slow children, those from less fortunate, and the ones who do not speak up for fear of being ridiculed just like they are at home. I had a sympathy for Ruth and also for Ruby. T he general concensus was that no one felt sorry for May. She did not even try to overcome her circumstances whereas both Ruby and Ruth did. The ending was sad but all too real in todays society. The positive aspect of this book is that Ruth did survive and has an opportunity for future growth. The fiction of this ending is that all too many times in reality, Ruth would not have survived this brutal attack. Although not an uplifting book, I am certainly glad I read it."},{"Title":"The Book of Ruth","review":"If you are going to read a novel by Jane Hamilton please read this one instead of A Map of the World. THE BOOK OF RUTH is a beautiful story - it's different, it's not what you expect, it's not cookie-cutter happy ending tied up in a neat bow. You will not want to trade places with the characters in this book, but you will find yourself cheering and hoping for Ruth and disocovering beauty in things and situations that at first don't seem so beautiful. And you will laugh. And you will wonder what happens next. And you will ask yourself why do certain things have to happen, just as in life.

My impression was that she has always been told that she was ignorant and therefore that is what she believed.

Well written but the subject matter was a bit alarming."},{"Title":"The Book of Ruth","review":"It is predictable that this book comes recommended on the women's talk show beat. This book is neither inspirational nor empowering. Ruth talks about the meanness of her mother and others in her life. When was she ever kind or considerate?

Her life was certainly tough but she never fought back.

The author did a masterful job of staying in voice, but I suffered through the narrative and all its extensive, childlike detail. That was the worst part for me.

Though we may want it to be perfect, there are a lot of &quot;Ruths&quot; in the real world that suffer and try to make the best of the life they have and find some beauty in it. However, Ruth's resigned attitude to her life and what came out of it; her not being too brave to try out her wings, may cause a lot of frustration to the reader, but we can never judge her nor the people who are living a life like hers, for we'll never know why they accept it until we're in their shoes"},{"Title":"The Book of Ruth","review":"I found this novel haunting. I work with young people who are low functioning (such as Ruth) and with young people who suffer from deep emotional problems (such as Ruby). Hamilton has definite insight in creating the minds of these two characters. When I picked up the book I had no idea what it was about and no idea where it was going but I became very attached to the characters and hated to see the book end. The ending was shocking with nothing happy about it which just added to the book's credibility.

Read this only if you want to be more depressed about life after it ends."},{"Title":"The Book of Ruth","review":"The author, Jane Hamilton, wrote this book as a way to ridicule Christianity. Of course, most of the Christians in the book are mean, toothless, uneducated morons. The other characters in this book are educated and smarter.The book revolves around Ruth, who is an interesting character. She has potential and intelligence but lacks wisdom and strength. Ruth becomes involved with morons and ends up making empty-headed decisions.The author does a good job of developing Ruth's character. The reader starts to care about her and you just hope that life ends up ok. However, if everything turned out fine the book would not be interesting. The one aspect of the main character that the author does not explain or develop is why Ruth suddenly becomes angry at her religion. I know that her dissatisfaction stems from her life not working out the way she wants, but the author could have explained more fully on why she suddenly becomes so negative towards her witless pastor.The book is slow and repetitive. Since the plot takes place in a small town some of that slowness is necessary. Repetitive makes the book slow too; and the author is constantly reminding the readers that the main characters in the book are morons.The author uses the title of the book as a way to slam Christians. Ruth is an important book in the Bible. I looked up a summary of the book of Ruth in [...]. The book of Ruth is about \\"genuine love and kindness\\". In summary, the story of Ruth is a \\"story of love and devotion that tells of Ruth's eventual marriage to a wealthy man named Boaz, by whom she bears a son, Obed, who becomes the grandfather of David and the ancestor of Jesus. Obedience brings Ruth into the privileged lineage of Christ.\\"As I suspected, the Ruth of the bible is some one you can admire, while Jane Hamilton's story is about a woman who marries and ends up abusing her son.I am giving this book three stars because of the good character development of Ruth. I am deducting two stars for the slow repetitious parts of the story and because the author portrays Christians as idiots."},{"Title":"The Book of Ruth","review":"Since I had read &quot;A Map of the World&quot; by Jane Hamilton and liked it, I thought I would enjoy a second book by her. Was I ever in for a disappointment; but not because the book was so horribly depressing. Some books cheer me up, some books depress me; some books challenge me. A good book is a good book, no matter what. However, this was a very different, very off-the-wall style of writing. Jane Hamilton, throughout a good portion of the book, put words in Ruth's thoughts that didn't even make nonsense; for example: &quot;The grass was so lush and green I half hoped someone would put me out to pasture.&quot; &quot;I bet my face looked like a raisin somebody stepped on.&quot; &quot;It was so cold, his tears were the consistency of slush.&quot; &quot;I called up Artie and told him I was sick as a dead pig.&quot; &quot;My head felt like a bowl full of hot applesauce.&quot; &quot;She waited on us hand and toe.&quot; And I've only scratched the surface. The book is chock full of this kind of idiocy. In addition, I was very offended by this story. I have a suspicion that Jane Hamilton may be an agnostic or an atheist. Nobody with the slightest iota of respect for the Word of God would write as sacrilegiously as has Jane Hamilton in The Book of Ruth. I do not care to repeat here the abominations she has put on paper concerning God, his son Jesus, and Scripture in general. She has also, through Ruth's thoughts, wiped the floor with the pastor of the church Ruth sometimes attended. I believe that Jane Hamilton, through Ruth's thoughts, has shown quite clearly what she thinks not only of organized religion, but of a person's personal relationship with the savior of the world. As a Christian, I truly resent this book. You might ask why I continued to read it. I was driven to see it to the end because, it was building up to such a violent crescendo that I had to find out what the end was like. As I mentioned in the title of my review, the book had a strong plot. Robert Morgan could have taken that plot and created a work of genius with it. Jane Hamilton created a strong plot but also created this Ruth person whose weird, nonsensical and sacrilegious thoughts emanated from her almost constantly. I saw her as a stupid woman with a deep-seated desire to destroy herself. Not once did I feel any empathy for her. She was not only self-destructive, but when she was not thinking drivel, she was entertaining sacrilegious thoughts about the church, the pastor, and Holy Scripture. So far as I'm concerned, in the end Ruth got every bit of what she deserved, but I, the reader, felt polluted! I did not want to give this novel even half a star, but I gave it one star because I guess that's the lowest grade one can assign to a book according to the &quot;How do you rate this book?&quot; box. Read this book at your own risk!"},{"Title":"The Book of Ruth","review":"I truly liked this book. It is easy to condemn Ruth for staying with an alcoholic husband whose IQ level is probably the same as his shoe size. He is certainly no bundle of joy as a husband or anything else for that matter. Before one does condemn Ruth and cast her aside, perhaps we should really take an indepth look at Ruth's environment. Her mother, May, has not been herself since the loss of her husband in World War II, and for her life is just another day. May is self-absorbed and what little concern she has seems to have is centred on Ruth's brother, Matt, the math whiz who is off to bigger and better things in the city. Meanwhile, Ruth plods through life with low self-esteem and takes each day in stride.I found all the characters unique and fascinating in their own way, and the story kept compelling me to read more. There was not much about Ruth to like, or dislike, she was just Ruth, trying to make the most out of an unpleasant life. The ending is somewhat of a surprise but it adds to the spirit of the book. \\"The Book of Ruth\\" is not an upbeat one but a very endearing one as many of Hamilton's are."},{"Title":"The Book of Ruth","review":"I decided to read this book after watching the movie version of it. I found it very interesting and fast-moving to read, except once I started to get into the middle of it, and from then on I found it very dark and depressing. It was very annoying in scenes as well. All of the characters were absolute losers, except for Aunt Sid. Ruby, I thought, was the most irritating. He was nothing but a drug addict and a big baby, and at times I honestly couldn't blame May for calling him \\"slow\\" and for mocking him. And it seemed to me that the only thing Ruth and Ruby had going for them was their life in their bedroom. Their relationship was more physical than emotional, and I thought Ruby was just absolutely disgusting and couldn't imagine any woman being attracted to him. And what was wrong with Ruth? She seemed \\"slow\\" herself, although I took it that she was only that way because her mother kept her rather isolated and nave. Had Ruth grown up with her Aunt Sid and I don't at all doubt she would have turned out differently for the better. The ending was unrealistic. The graphic descriptions of the way that loser husband of Ruth's was beating her to near death with the fireplace poker were disturbing to read, and I thought...shouldn't Ruth be dead for how hard and persistently he seems to be striking her? I couldn't believe she survived any of it. Not to mention how pointless the ending was. When I finished the book, it left me with a dark feeling. The book was nothing but a depressive memoir of a very strange life of a very controlled girl. I know I would never read anything like this again. Such a book might be understandable, had it been taken from a true story, but when it's just fiction, it seems pointless."},{"Title":"The Book of Ruth","review":"This book was not a turn pager in the beginning however in the last chapters I could not put it down. Not a complicated read. Basically, the life of a disadvantaged girl trying to make the most of it. A girl who gets left behind as her peers have \\"tools,\\" to go beyond their landscapes and make changes that put them in the direction of a better life."},{"Title":"The Book of Ruth","review":"This novel works backwards. It all starts in the present, in the aftermath of something horrible, and Ruth starts telling the story of her life, as far back as she can remember.The book opens with Ruth under the refuge of her aunt Sid, who reflects on how Ruth is intelligent, when in fact it was assumed she was an idiot. Ruth blames it on her lack of education, on her poor vocabulary. This is true: how many people cannot speak English properly and some assume they are dumb?Ruth had an unfortunate childhood, with a cold mother and an absent father. By the way, it took me a little while to realize May and Elmer were her parents, as Ruth chose to refer to them by their first names, not as mom and dad. Ruth did not know any better, and fell for the first guy who paid attention to her. Unfortunately, it happened to be Ruby. Ruth and Ruby, what a couple! She is perfectly fine with him being a lazy slob. Her hunger for a normal life is so great that she can do without those ingredients that make your life normal. Even after Ruby shows his true colors (I won't spoil the plot here), she excuses him and blames something else for his actions: drugs, his drowning accident, his father's beatings... Her codependency on Ruby is so deep that Ruth gets mad at her brother and aunt after reading a letter where they describe her marriage as a disaster in the making.This book was quite brutal and harsh. Do not expect a happy ending."},{"Title":"The Book of Ruth","review":"This is a beautifully written and powerful book. I found it unforgettable and spent days wondering what to think of the protagonist: was she stupid and naive, or was she so evolved that her acceptance of everyone else just as they are (with the exception of her brother) stands as a model of human compassion, showing what we are capable of if not too busy passing judgment. I finally decided that above all, this story is about the power of poor parenting and its effects on all the main characters. I couldn't help but think of how differently everyone's life could have turned out had they only come from stable backgrounds and loving families. The damage wrought by dysfunctional parenting had repercussions that carried on for generations and damaged numerous lives. This is a thought-provoking, important book...not as dreary as some have said, as I find Ruth's capacity to love, enjoy, and triumph over her life remarkable. The book also shows the power of having even a handful of positive, supportive people in one's corner, and how those few people can sustain and inspire."},{"Title":"The Book of Ruth","review":"I enjoyed the book (and the reviews I've read here) very much. It has been a long time since I have had physical reactions to a book. When Ruth is feeling smothered and trapped by her mother and the intentionally and happily disabled Ruby, *I* felt like I couldn't breathe. When Ruby strikes out, I felt shell shocked, too, as I would had it happened to me.But I have some real issues with the book as well. One thing that left a bad taste in my mouth was Ruth's seemingly perpetual victimhood which she seems to continue to the *very* end--when she is angry at Aunt Sid for not being the person Ruth *wants* her to be and when Ruth feels she can't tolerate being around Daisy. Sid, Daisy, and the social worker are the only women in the book who aren't victims and never have been--yet Ruth seems equally hateful toward them as she was towards her mother and Dee Dee by the end. Why should Ruth dislike the social worker so much for having a brick house and husband with a job, and how in the HELL does Hamilton get ME (the reader) to do same??? (Even though I have a brick house and a husband with a job.....)Ruth is heroic in her ability to subsist on the small flashes of happiness she gets, but she again and again turns a blind eye to her choices that may save her from the misery she's doled. So I'm left, tearing my hair out, wondering what Hamilton was getting at here.....but being truly amazed at Hamilton's work that still has me tied up in knots."},{"Title":"The Book of Ruth","review":"I have always had the problem of not being able to finish books. I read really far into them and then quit because I've lost interest or have already started a new book. The Book of Ruth changed that for me. I was eager and drawn to the pages almost immediately. While it took a few good weeks to fully finish it, I blame the subject matter and not the plot or writing style. I honestly 'hurt' after reading parts of this novel because I saw true human suffering through a victim's perspective. This book openned my eyes to the true feelings of a mentally handicapped and emotionally abused individual. I have become a better person after reading this book because of the understanding it gave me."},{"Title":"The Book of Ruth","review":"&quot;I looked up truth the other day also. The word has a lot to do with seeing clearly, and with things that are honest and beautiful. Perhaps I should change my name to Ruth Truth. The combination of pity and compassion with honesty and beauty would be a real knockout. People might not see me come into a room but they'd feel like there was something unusual in the air -- I have a lot of fantasy dreams, I guess, because I'm by myself so much. I'm not bored too often, though. I have my entire life to think about. I have the ghosts to order away from my room. Ruth Truth. It has a nice ring to it. -Jane HamiltonRuth's memories, as she ruminates about her life, looking back and recounting in a sea of awkward words. She begins with May, her mother, who had no bed of roses herself. She then details her own life with her intellectually gifted brother, and then her subsequent marriage and family life in central Illinois. The book jacket describes this as a human comedy -- but those words would certainly not be chosen to describe this chronicle. Written more in the style of a nonfiction memoir, this book details a woman's choices, and the lack of them; a woman's family with its blessings and banes; a woman's existence in a small town environment where she feels at the same time enchained and empowered by choice. Recommended."},{"Title":"The Book of Ruth","review":"I read this 3 or 4 years ago and at the time I thought that I didn't really care for it -- the negative tone and VERY dramatic end. The funny thing is that years later this is one novel that I can remember quite clearly. It really makes you *feel* something and maybe that's what good literature is supposed to do."},{"Title":"The Book of Ruth","review":"I thought the narration was good, but unconvincing that Ruth was supposed to be mentally deficient...the way she narrates proves that she wasn't as stupid as she and others thought she was. I also find it interesting that Oprah's book picks are usually stories about lower class families surrounded by violence, abuse, and sexual frustration."},{"Title":"The Book of Ruth","review":"I had never heard of the author before I picked up this book; it wasn't until afterwards I knew it was another &quot;Oprah pick;&quot; luckily for me I did not have that to influence my judgement of this book at all.This is one disturbing novel, but at the same time it captivates the reader, it lets a person crawl inside someone else's head and ride the waves of how they think, almost how they feel. We're always sitting back in moral judgement of women who stay in less than desireable and abusive relationships, we're quick to judge a person based on who they choose as a partner; the Book Of Ruth gives sharp insight into WHY.I would have preferred in the end to see more of the story from the brother's eyes, to see Ruth actually TALK to him, whether they reconciled or not. But the stark honestly of the story, the very real way in which it is told, makes the book a treasure, and worth reading again just to catch all the signal and stray thoughts missed the first time through."},{"Title":"The Book of Ruth","review":"Last night after I finished the book, I thoughtI hated it, but today I can't stop thinking aboutit. I searched the internet to find what others have thought, to justify my feelings... that hasto say something. I can't say I identifiedwith any of the characters, but I must say thatthe writing was so well done that I found myselffeeling sick and generally uncomfortable throughthe whole book - especially the ending. It's thesame feeling I got when I read &quot;The Liar's Club&quot;.I would recommend this book for those who canadmire a novel for it's craft. I know everythingI felt, the author intended."},{"Title":"The Book of Ruth","review":"When I was in high school I read Catcher in the Rye. My teacher at the time told me to read the last chapters first and then read the book like normal. Well, where was he for this book? I recommend reading the last few chapters first and then go beginning to end. I was truly disappointed by this book! The end took such a crazy...never in your life would you have guessed it twist that I felt cheated! I missed several important clues during my reading of the book because I didn't see their significance until the end and it was too late. I felt it was an ok book but would have been greatly enhanced if I had known what was at the end. I do not think reading the last few chapters will ruin the book but enhance it"},{"Title":"The Book of Ruth","review":"This group gave mixed reviews to The Book of Ruth. There was consistently high praise for the author's style: &quot;lyrical, descriptive imagery&quot;, &quot;Ruth's voice is honest and straightforward&quot;, &quot;dreary and depressing - with style&quot;. Hamilton's characters do come alive.However, most of our readers felt little sense of connection with the characters - some understanding of them, but little sympathy. The long-unnamed narrator very effectively conveys the atmosphere of domestic violence: the love/hate relationships, the lethargy, and the hopelessness that simmer for a long time and eventually erupt. Unfortunately, there is no sense of closure, no denouement after the violent climax.Not exactly inspiring, this book is, rather, depressing. But the reader will long remember that quirky trio: Ruth, May, and Ruby."},{"Title":"The Book of Ruth","review":"I could not like Ruth, no matter how hard I tried. She deserved all that she got. In all my favorite books I can empathize with the main character. This is a depressing, disappointing (nothing ever got better for Ruth) but well-written novel. I really expected more"},{"Title":"The Book of Ruth","review":"The fact that I am still thinking about this book a fews daysafter finishing it must mean something. I read through most of theposted reviews and agree with many who said it was a &quot;beautifully written book.&quot; Indeed it was. For such a simple minded woman, Ruth came up with some beautiful, profound observations on life. I felt for her; I rooted for her; I just wish I had been able to witness more of her recovery. I agree with the reviewer who said she wanted to shake Ruth. Me too! She had such potential, seen only by Miss Finch and Aunt Sid. In the end, I'm somewhat ambivalent about the book as a whole. I enjoyed the telling of Ruth's story, but I felt the ending was not satisfying."},{"Title":"The Book of Ruth","review":"People look for different things in books. One of them is subject matter. Reviewers state that they didn't like &quot;The Book of Ruth&quot; because it was depressing. That is true. But, I think the most important aspect of fiction is the ability of the author to take you where they are. I was with Ruth. I lived with her during this storytelling. I felt her pain,her helplessness, her confusion and her love. Yes, I wanted to shake her. I wanted to sit down, have a talk with her, and tell her to get out of her situation. Jane Hamilton's book is life as it is. I am disturbed by it, but very glad I read it"},{"Title":"The Book of Ruth","review":"This book got under my skin and will stay there. The prose is wonderful. I kept jotting down my favorite passages, especially the ones about 'Is that all there is?' concerning work down at the Trim'N Tidy. I compare this to Winter Birds by Jim Grimsley"},{"Title":"The Book of Ruth","review":"&quot;In my bones I'm so scared, but the mystery is in my heart--that where I have the gumption.&quot; Ruth knows she has to make a journey into the painful past if she is to make sense of what's happened to her and to heal for the future. Ruth's Aunt Sid doesn't understand how her clear intelligence went unrecognized. Ruth knows we are the products of our limited environments. The language she had to speak to be understood was not the language of poetry. This book answers the question if we are products of our environment. I feel it proves that if we stay, we may pay a dear price for the lessons learned there. If we are able to dream, we can overcome. The book ends with Ruth making a simple statement: &quot;Sometime I'm going to try my wings.&quot; A must read book for everyone"},{"Title":"The Book of Ruth","review":"This story with its highs and lows, draws you in with thehints of dark consequences you know the narrator (Ruth) cannot avoid. It tells the tale of a family composed of peoplewe have all seen -- the mother, overbearing and sarcastic,we want to slap her long before the tragedy unfolds; thebrother who moves on to &quot;live his own life&quot;; the Aunt who cares but keeps her distance; the husband, loving but dim-witted, who no matter who or what he was would not be accepted as a &quot;son&quot;, and Ruth -- destined to a life of sameness, a breath away from a good life because of feelings of duty, responsibility, and insecurity."},{"Title":"The Book of Ruth","review":"This book is wonderful!!!! It has rich, evocative characterizations of a family that is trapped by internalized feelings of hopelessness. These feelings escape sideways - through meanness, escape, fantasy, and love.Ruth is a young woman caught up in an abusive environment. In her external life she has very little, yet her inner life is very rich. She makes life choices in an attempt to try to find a 'normal' life, one where hope and happiness are there every day. Instead, she is stuck with an alcoholic husband, a baby, TV, and a bitchy mother. What occurs is a tragedy but it is also an opportunity for Ruth to re-assess her life and see possibilities that can lead her out of the hopeless trap she is in.This is a beautiful and poignant book, very well-written with a riveting narrative."},{"Title":"The Book of Ruth","review":"I found The Story of Ruth intriguing, depressingly sad, and so real. I was caught up in the inherent goodness that exixts in all people (Ruth, Aunt Sid, Rudy, Daisy, even May...) only to be caught off guard by the insanity in the inherent badness that also exists near the end of the book. The resilency of humankind is also an important theme in the book. I'll admit, I needed a good ending. It didn't happen, but it was one that leaves you pondering for a long time."},{"Title":"The Book of Ruth","review":"This is a great book (yes, it's a sad story, but the fact that it has moved so many so profoundly is just further proof of what a good piece of work it is.) Beautifully crafted--even if you shake your head at Ruth and want to scream, I guarantee you'll get something out of this book."},{"Title":"The Book of Ruth","review":"As a special education teacher, I associated Ruth's feelings of muteness with the helplessness of having a learning disability. Ruth was naive, and her lack of experiences also contribute to her feelings and inability to make good choices. The author includes many details that anyone who grew up in a rural setting can relate to. Yes, the story does turn dark. This has a greater shock value since we are absorbed in day to day events on an intimite basis. Like many who grow up outside of society, Ruth is unable to judge others using social norms."},{"Title":"The Book of Ruth","review":"Hamilton makes a clear statement in this novel. She illustrates the life of a young and innocent girl who blooms into an experienced yet naive woman. Her younger life story touched me as no other book was able to do. She had most of the same feelings as me and it made me feel a bit less lonely and left out in the grand scheme of things. I can feel a little motivation to stop from making the same mistakes Ruth did as i have the rest of my life to look forward to. This book truly opened my eyes to the many masks we wear and the many ways we make excuses for out human nature. I quite enjoyed this novel and it will stick with me forever. And when i reread this book someday i hope i can look back on my life without the regrets Ruth had."},{"Title":"The Book of Ruth","review":"What amazes me about Hamilton's writing is that she can take this mundane family, very much down-and-outers, and skillfully bring them to life with her terrific prose. For 90% of the book, nothing much happens, but thoughts and feelings are so eloquently expressed. The ending is bit flawed in that I feel cheated by not knowing what happens to the characters we grew to know so well as well as how life will turn out for Ruth's children. (I can see another related novel brewing!). Although this is a terrific read, the subject matter is not for everyone."},{"Title":"The Book of Ruth","review":"Jane Hamilton is a wonderful writer, but I wouldn't reccommend this book. It offers the reader a story of some very trashy people who make terrible choices and in the end are left with anger and no faith. I don't understand the author's point, unless it is simply to depress us."},{"Title":"The Book of Ruth","review":"I have read many of the Oprah selections and have been pleased with all thus far, with the exception of Wally Lamb's &quot;She's Come Undone&quot;. Considering the similar subject matter and somewhat slow beginning, I thought I might not enjoy &quot;The Book of Ruth&quot;. On the contrary, I found this to be a great piece of literature. I'm surprised that none of the reviews/discussion questions mentioned the strong use of religious symbolism (snake/hands)throughout the book. I also enjoyed the parallels between Matt and Ruby. This book reminded me of one of my favorites, John Irwin's &quot;A Prayer for Owen Meany&quot;."},{"Title":"The Book of Ruth","review":"I found this book to be boring and unbelievable. Esecially the ending, which I found felt very contrived. Even though I have had not trouble reading books of this nature in the past, I found myself disturbed by this one because horrible things were happening to a woman that I couldn't feel compassion for. I would find myself drifing off through most of it so when something caught my attention I had lost the context it was happening in. I would have to hear lots of amazing things before I would try this author again."},{"Title":"The Book of Ruth","review":"In a beautifully executed, almost hilarious, but most definitely bittersweet novel, Ruth Hamilton has demonstrated that Dysfunction is learned. But more importantly, Dysfunction is a lifestyle choice, not an inheritance. Her style is a little reminscent of the Existential writers.When one is old enough, say 18, one is free to make his/her own choices, even a half-wit like Ruth. Ruth chose to be just like her mother -- a dreamer in denial, an angry perpetual victim. Ruth was likeable and so had several aides in life, particularly Aunt Sid who was always there to help, if only Ruth asked. Her brother also, to a lesser extent, Ruth had the option to be his best friend. She chose him as a sworn enemy, and was oblivious to any pain he might have felt being a savant in a dim-witted world. Perhaps he could have used a sibling's love, too.One could argue that Ruth, a victim in a heartless environment, made this Dysfunction choice unwittingly. But that would mean we are all powerless in our lives. Each of us has the power of choice, as did Ruth, and she acknowledged her power at the very end, a little too late."},{"Title":"The Book of Ruth","review":"I would say this book was merely &quot;OK&quot;. I found that I would force myself to read it to get it over with. The characters were hard to identify with - especially Ruth. I think it lacked in character development - and lacked any kind of identifiable reason for the behavior. Something just did not fit. I found the whole book was building and building up to a strange ending...which also seemed unfinished."},{"Title":"The Book of Ruth","review":"I have read all of Jane Hamilton's novels, and this first book is still my favorite, which is not to say that the others aren't as good; simply that I fell in love with poor Ruth. I heard Jane say once that she worried about how people would respond to Ruth, and that touched me. Jane Hamilton has a way of becoming a character in a way no author does, in my mind. She usually writes in 1st person, so she has her work cut out for her in portraying a slow, awkward girl despised in her own skin and by her own family, yet who exudes a simple goodness even she herself is aware of. Further, Jane never takes the easy way out, making the central character so predictable as to be easily definable in any way. Real people are not definable creatures, and neither are Jane Hamilton's people. How can you help but feel a stab of sorrow for Ruth's mother May after reading her remembrance of the loss of her one true love, the only good thing, she thinks, that ever came her way. Especially insightful is Ruth's description of her father's hand on her head in a brief moment of unscripted happiness, a rarity in their household, so simple and yet so wonderful that she remembers it for the whole of her life.Read this book - it is not the happiest prose you'll ever spend time with, but Ruth's sheer determination to rise above all the 'meanness' in her life is well worth the effort."},{"Title":"The Book of Ruth","review":"I absolutely, positively, loooooooovvvvvvveeed this book ( however, I have been known to be kinda...well...very morbid :). This book was a hit with me. It actually gets you into the characters thoughts and inner-most feelings - one of my friends said that she absolutely hated the book, and I'm thinking, 'Are we from the same planet???' I mean, this book has truly changed my perspective of many things, including so-called 'trailer-trash'. You gotta read this book, but be prepared to be amazed at how seemingly simple, everyday life, when really looked at, can be as horrifying as any Stephen King novel."},{"Title":"The Book of Ruth","review":"The story is very well written. I came away from it very disturbed by the violence; however, sometimes squirming is good for a reader. I think it is a good literal awakening to the realistic violence that exists in life."},{"Title":"The Book of Ruth","review":"I can't put it anymore eloquently that that! A very disturbing novel of uneducated people with no ambition. This seemingly endless story of booooooring bowling and booze ends senslessly and tragically. A recommended book of similar family peril is &quot;Black and Blue&quot; by Anna Quinlan. It's much better written and worth your time."},{"Title":"The Book of Ruth","review":"My book club read THE BOOK OF RUTH as our September pick. This book was a very good discussion book as there are a lot of situations in the plot to discuss. Things like, \\"What is wrong with Ruth that she can not get her life on track?\\" and \\"How can she be attracted to that skuzzy Ruby?\\" and Why did she stay with her mother and let herself continue to be abused?\\". So, there are certainly many questions to discuss concerning life questions.However, it is not a \\"feel good\\" book so I probably would not recommend it for pleasure reading. Emotionally, this book is a downer and I had to get out of the house after finishing it to shake off the melancholy. I checked this out from the library and am ready to get it back to them like a bad talisman."},{"Title":"The Book of Ruth","review":"I have read and re-read this book so many times, it is silly. Jane Hamilton allows us into such a world of happiness, grief, torment, fulfillment, simple joy and tragic circumstances that to read this book only once is like to take only a small bite of an exquisite meal. Can you not catch a whiff of the rich earth when Ruth does? Do you not see Ruby's teeth glinting in the moonlight! Can't you hear May barking orders and hacking her cough? I first read Jane Hamilton with Map of The World, which is an excellent book also, but I find this one richer. It reminds me in a strange way, of another book which I have read and re-read, This Much I Know is True by Wally Lamb. Totally different story, but the ability of the author to awaken all your senses is amazing"},{"Title":"The Book of Ruth","review":"I, for one, have shied away from buying books with that big orange &quot;O&quot; on the cover...I have not been entirely impressed with Oprah's book club choices (with a few exceptions of course). But after reading &quot;A Map of the World&quot; I thought I'd give &quot;The Book of Ruth&quot; a try. Admittedly it took me a while to get into, it didn't seem like there was any sort of plot, simply a sort of autobiographical novel about one woman's life. But I found myself getting sucked into the book more and more.Is the book depressing? Yes, of course it is. I find it funny that so many readers complained about that, considering that SO much good literature IS depressing. But it was so interesting to me to read about a character with such a bad lot in life who really, truly tries to see the best in everything. I could really relate to Ruth's relationship with Ruby. From a distance, it would be so easy to think that Ruth was stupid for even getting involved with someone like Ruby. But clearly it was hard for her to see the bad side of Ruby when he would do such other wonderful things for Ruth.I was totally shocked by the ending of the book. I don't think I've been that suprised by a book for a long time. And I don't think I would have liked the book as much if the ending wasn't so shocking.Another great one by Jane Hamilton--get your tissue out!"},{"Title":"The Book of Ruth","review":"I was required to read this book for a college English class, and I started it out the way most students would when they have to read something. The beginning is a little slow and boring. But I quickly got into this book. Ruth is an amazing character. She may not be too bright, but somehow she seems wise to me.Some of the events that took place in this book are funny, yet others are so depressing. The ending is a total shock. This is a great book which I strongly recommend to others. This book made me think about life. It was really touched me, and it made me want to read more of Hamilton's work."},{"Title":"The Book of Ruth","review":"The Book of Ruth does a masterful job of showing the reader the world view of a person who is blinded by her circumstances. Ruth is like a person with impaired sight. She sees the world from a devastating perspective and cannot get herself to shift her vision until she is forced to by horrific events. Jane Hamilton writes without losing Ruth's limited perspective and gives the reader the gift of insight into all our lives. We all see the world limited by our experience; some of us are more fortunate than others in that our experiences are more expansive and loving than Ruth's are. But to some extent, we all make choices based on where we see (mostly) artificial boundries. Ruth's extreme situation highlights this common denominator. I think we would prefer not to identify with Ruth and her life, but the impact the book has on the reader--the way the characters stay with the reader long after the book ends--is a testament to how much Ruth and her strange family really live in each of us. I congratulate Jane Hamilton for giving us Ruth and her beautifully written book"},{"Title":"The Book of Ruth","review":"I was treated like a very stupid girl .. by my mother .. in my growing years .. and I saw how she expected everything from my brothers .. not from me !! .. my brothers left the nest and I stayed with her .. through my hard work ..

Sometimes when you finish a book that you really like you want to tell everyone you meet to read it, this is not that book. There are some very ugly parts of life that I think are covered very well. The hero, Ruth, is often fustrating because she is so dumb about some stuff, like her marriage to Ruby, what a loser he was. But how many of us have fallen for the wrong person? (Though hopefully not this obviously wrong). But at some points you have to be envious of her childlike ignorance, to be a child again... I actually liked the ending which many found shocking, well duh, it was very shocking! All my fustration throughout this book was resolved with Ruby's attack. The mom was getting on my nerves anyway, and I knew it was just a matter of time, so I was morbidly pleased with the ending. Let's keep in my that this is fiction and not based on real people, even though it really could have been. If you get depressed easy or take stuff too seriously this book may upset you. Personally I liked it when a book makes me angry,sad, happy or whatever, just that it gets a rise out of me and that doesn't happen too often."},{"Title":"The Book of Ruth","review":"This is an amazing book! I have to write an essay on it now, for Englsih class, and I will definitely write a good review of each character. Ruth, May, Ruby, Justy, Aunt Sid and Daisy (howcome everyone is ignoring Daisy?) are all some of the most beautiful characters I have ever met. Yeah, its a depressing book, but shouldnt something be emotional for one for the book to have an impact?? I know I will never be the same.

The story itself was dark but very interesting and thought provoking. I could see a little bit of myself in Ruth as I'm sure anyone who has ever been misunderstood and/or rejected could. I found myself relating to Ruth, feeling sorry for her and being frustrated with her. All the charactors were interesting and unique.

Hamilton's Ruth belongs to the set most people would classify as &quot;trailer trash.&quot; But Hamilton shows us how any person can bloom with love and guidance. There is a sophistication of understanding and compassion in Ruth that many of the educated would do well to emulate. The story is well-told, touching, and believable."},{"Title":"The Book of Ruth","review":"Several months ago, I listened to my first audio. Love the idea of someone reading to me. However, with this novel, I felt disconnected, it was like the movies, no character building, etc. So I READ The BOOK, and was thoroughly impressed. There was so much detail identifiying the characters and settings, and I gathered a real sense of who characters are and how and why it all came about. The writing is excellent! I was consistently captivated, Was Ruth toooo ignorant to realize her mother's unhappiness and verbal abuse, was Ruth toooo ignorant that she immediately settled for someone as pathetic as Ruby. She encountered positive people in her life but chose to ignore and live her life with losers. Tragedy is what makes a body change, hopefully it changed Ruth."},{"Title":"The Book of Ruth","review":"The Book of Ruth is really a story about survival in difficult world. Ruth, a shy often pitiful specimen of a girl, is, by fate, placed in a world mismatched for her potential. Born to harsh, cold, depressed mother, she is doomed from the start. But it is her connection to one supportive human being, Aunt Sid, that allows her to survive. I was haunted by the real world issues of the profound impact of poverty and igonorance on the lives of 'good' people. Ruby was not the enemy and maybe May was not either. Every character is this book were surviving the best way they could given their unique situations. A great book."},{"Title":"The Book of Ruth","review":"Must read book!!!"},{"Title":"The Book of Ruth","review":"I love this writer. Her books draw the reader in and are so hard to end. I hated finishing this book because I missed all the people in it so much when I did. This story is amazing about a daughter and a mother who are probably retarded. How they live their lives and what happens to them is amazing. It gets a little violent but it made sense that it would."},{"Title":"The Book of Ruth","review":"I read this book many years ago but it left such an impact on me. I still remember the words from the first paragraph and the horrific ending. I didn't find it to be an easy read but it was well worth it. I felt it made such a powerful statement. Would highly recommend."},{"Title":"The Book of Ruth","review":"This book is now in second place in my &quot;Top 10 Best Books&quot; behind &quot;To Kill A Mockingbird&quot;. I've read it 3 times and know I will again. Hamilton's writing style is like no other (though I've read all her other books and none are quite this poetic). She takes a depressing subject matter and gives us hope and a deep understanding of the other side. Read this book- it will make it's mark."},{"Title":"The Book of Ruth","review":"There's an awful lot to like in this well-crafted tale of a young woman surviving a life of poverty, abuse, and general dysfunction, but this book should come with a warning across the cover about the sickeningly graphic violence it contains. Though the story is first-rate, the violence is lovingly described and as repellent as any of the action sequences in &quot;A Nightmare on Elm Street&quot; and other slasher flick fare."},{"Title":"The Book of Ruth","review":"I have read both this book and Map of the World (which I loved and lived in and wanted to return to when I was finished).&quot;Ruth&quot; is, in my opinion, even more breathtaking than &quot;Map&quot;. Hamilton has a fine gift not only of fleshing out a character.. but of fleshing out a relationship in all its subtelties and meaning. Her narrative is as intricate and unpredictable as life itself.Hamilton's writing is so fluid and emotionally tactile it not only brings the reader into the story but lets you inside the characters and their relationships... you will live in Ruth's head and heart, you will truly know what it is to be her... the reader is not left wondering at her motives or reactions.The narrative is so finely woven you find yourself understanding completely the most questionable of characters. It is Hamilton's keen understanding of human nature and the dynamics of human interaction which makes these characters shine with their own particular beauty and intelligence and at the same time with the dark horror of their &quot;mean&quot; &quot;kernel&quot;s.Hamilton's writing is not &quot;meandering&quot; or &quot;boring&quot; at all... there is no line that could have been left out of &quot;Ruth&quot;. The story is actually quite spare and we hear all and only what we really need to know.I also do not understand how some readers can give &quot;Ruth&quot; bad reviews simply because it is 'depressing' and 'uninspiring'... Ruth is a victim of circumstances... but we know from living through her all the intricacies of the circumstances and thus how things could have been made better.The story starts with Ruth's feeling that her life's story started with the &quot;meanness&quot; in people... that we all have a kernel of meanness... we see how the subtleties of familial interactions can form the shape of their relationships and people's hearts and ultimately lead to destruction or salvation... the feeding of the kernel of &quot;meanness&quot; or it's eradication through patterns of expected behavior or by deviating from who your world has told you you are.We see how we can change our lives by breaking out of the behavior patterns we follow through the confines of the way our intimates (for better or worse) have drawn us. The only character brave enough to finally leap out of her casted role is Daisy, Ruth's &quot;slutty&quot; friend. Ruth's mother May, tragically, does not have the courage to end the cycle of her expected behavior and neither did Ruth.... but we are left at the end with the possibility of real change for Ruth... by virtue of her having learned how she got to be who and where she is... a revelation we should all be so lucky to make.I found &quot;Ruth&quot; wholly satisfying and also inspiring. This is definitely a book and a character I will carry with me for life and I eagerly await another novel from Hamilton."},{"Title":"The Book of Ruth","review":"Perhaps the biggest mistake I made was reading all of the reviews. Everyone raved about this book. I began reading it with hopes of reading a wonderful novel that would leave me feeling satisfied. I wasn't.I can't quite understand my feelings; I can just say that part of me loved this book and part of me didn't. Ruth grew on me as a person and I loved who she was. I just found it difficult to figure out what she was all about. Was she retarded, slow, or normal with a repressive Mother? I realize &quot;retarded&quot; is politically incorrect, and I understand and respect why. However, the reason I use it here is because the alternative term, &quot;mentally challenged&quot;, definitely applies to Ruth. But to what degree? And why? What was the cause? Her small town upbringing, her living in the shadow of her brilliant younger brother, her sensitivity?Somehow you get the feeling, she was &quot;normal&quot;, but perhaps not. Even still, it was frustrating for me not to understand the root, and precisely, who she was and what her problems were.I also could not &quot;see&quot; her Mother May. Another reviewer said the same thing and I understand completely. May was a major force in this book, and a major influence in Ruth's life, but I just couldn't get a good picture of who she was either!!! Another odd thing is that you never even here the name &quot;Ruth&quot; throughout the book. You don't even think of 'Ruth' as Ruth.I thought of her as this young woman who was given no opportunities in life and who was repressed by her overbearing Mother. She was strong, but may be not strong enough. This book does not give you the answers on a silver platter and perhaps that is the beauty of this story. You are drawn in and become emotionaly attached to these non-entities.I was very frustrated with the ending. Ruth, who persevered through so much, just seemed to crumble, probably with good reason though. But still, I hated that. That doesn't mean to say that Ruth doesn't succeed, she probably will, you just don't get that satisfaction here.Still, I ended the book feeling very emotional, and perhaps that in itself says alot about this story. To feel so emotional about characters you do not completely know or understand and yet still feel for, is quite remarkable. And that is why I have such mixed feelings; my head is stil spinning on this one.I feel as if I only scratched the surface of a very deep story... yet I still feel moved."},{"Title":"The Book of Ruth","review":"I loved this book.

There was no light at the end of the tunnel for her."},{"Title":"The Book of Ruth","review":"I took this book off a dusty shelf of my house to examine it. It had no sign of a synopsis nor any indication of its plot entailments just a few critics' reviews that wailed \\"sly and wistful\\" and \\"a disturbing and beautiful book\\" making it seem like a promising read; then again, what author would put a bad review on his or her book? Regardless, I decided to give it a try. It was only twelve pages shy of the reading requirement, after all. As I read page after page, finding it hard to put down, I discovered it to be a fascinating autobiographical narrative of the fictional character Ruth Grey Dahl. The observant and sensitive narrator recounts, in her descriptive colloquial language, the triumphs and struggles throughout her life-from her days as a bright-eyed young girl living with her strong-willed, domineering mother May, to her bittersweet days as a young mother and wife. She stresses the importance of family and that each member is an important piece to the puzzle of the family unit. The author Jane Hamilton uses foreshadowing at the very start of the novel. She gives hints to the violent nature of her husband Ruby and their perpetually disastrous future as a married couple. Hamilton uses the motif of escape throughout the novel. As a young woman, Ruth's mother May had big plans for herself and her husband. They longed to escape the small town of Honey Creek, Illinois, to the bigger and brighter world of Chicago. Miss Finch, an old blind woman who becomes a mentor for Ruth, often reminisces of times as a young woman when she and her husband would take trips to Hawaii. She longed for her restored sight-to be able to see the clear blue oceans and soft, sandy beaches. Imagery is also an important aspect in Hamilton's novel. The reader sees the \\"tight gray curls fuming\\" when May is in one of her moods and envisions Ruby's blackened, rotten front tooth that was a result of his father's violent outrages. The novel was a delightful and emotional read that reminds us that, as long as we have family, we are never alone."},{"Title":"The Book of Ruth","review":"Maybe it is just me but I am so tired of reading overhyped, overexposed, sensationalized depictions of women's lives that are riddled with violence, poverty, abuse, and depression. The Book of Ruth clearly fits the Oprah bookclub mold of novels, written by women, which, in prurient detail, discuss women as victims. I find this incredibly boring and uninspiring.The main character Ruth suffers from a horrible home life--an abusive mother who lavishes all her attention and affection on her son. Ruth, as a character, demonstrates no motivation, no desire, and generally no sign of life. She makes erroneous choices and then pretends not to understand why her life falls apart--I could say more about this but I prefer not to give the novel away.Furthermore, I simply do not appreciate Hamilton's style as an author. First, her novels are in-your-face depressing. Second, her prose is not as &quot;poetical&quot; as other reviewers have described it. However, I do not think she is a bad writer.As an alternative, I would suggest Connie May Fowler's somewhat autobiographical novel Before Women had Wings. This is another Oprah bookclub novel that is truly inspirational and truly poetical. The main character in this novel actually strives to rise above the abuses and poverty in her life. And Fowler is, quite simply, a better writer.I've also read Hamilton's A Map of the World and found it just as uninspiring and depressing as The Book of Ruth but that is another review."},{"Title":"Justice and Its Surroundings (Collected Papers of Anthony de Jasay)","review":"(excerted from The Independent Review, Summer 2003)Justice and Its Surroundings is an unusually rich, provocative, and wide-ranging work, to which a short review cannot do, well, justice.Admirers of the state argue that various goals can be achieved only via the coercive power of government. To meet such arguments, libertarians must show either that the goals in question are not worth pursuing, because they are undesirable or impossible (the &quot;icky-goal response&quot;), or that however worthwhile the goals may be, state power is not necessary for achieving them (the &quot;needless-means response&quot;).In part 1, de Jasay offers a needless-means response to the claim that the state is necessary for the provision of social order. After explaining social order as a model of a prisoner's dilemma, arguing against the idea that the state must provide public goods, and exploring the claim that the state is a precondition of social order, de Jasay concludes that the problem with stateless social orders is not that they are inherently unworkable, but rather that &quot;states stop them from emerging, and intrude upon them when they do emerge&quot; (p. 15). It is difficult to know what moral the anarchists among us should draw from this conclusion. On the one hand, de Jasay brings us the cheery news that social order can be maintained without a state. On the other hand, he observes more gloomily that stateless social orders have not succeeded in holding their own against predatory states. Is protection against the state, then, one good that markets have trouble supplying? One would like to hear more from de Jasay about this apparent instance of market failure.De Jasay devotes parts 2 through 4 to examining claims that state power is needed to provide redistributive justice. Here the icky-goal response predominates. Against the \\"to each according to (blank)\\" approach to justice popular among redistributionists, de Jasay defends the more traditional conception \\"to each his own.\\" He is at his weakest, however, when advancing this position on moral grounds. Owing perhaps to his quaintly positivistic conviction that moral judgments are \\"neither true nor false\\" and so do not admit of \\"intersubjective validity\\" (p. 143), he has trouble taking seriously, and indeed has a tin ear for, the kinds of concerns that motivate egalitarian liberals. By contrast, he is at his strongest when showing that redistributionist proposals cannot achieve the goals their proponents claim to desire.In part 5, de Jasay examines Amartya Sen's argument that the Pareto criterion clashes with libertarian values because it allows the voluntary transfer of liberties that are properly inalienable. De Jasay comes down on the side of Pareto, arguing that the (epistemologically grounded) presumption of liberty extends to the liberty to give up one's liberties. I found this section less persuasive. For inalienability theorists, the question is not whether one should be allowed to surrender certain liberties, but whether one even can.Of necessity, my summary has passed over much valuable material in Justice and Its Surroundings (including a devastating critique of market socialism). Anyone with an interest in philosophy, economics, political theory, or rational-choice analysis will profit from close reading and long pondering of de Jasay's arguments."},{"Title":"Justice and Its Surroundings (Collected Papers of Anthony de Jasay)","review":"Justice and Its Surroundings is fascinating. de Jasay's style is clear and straightforward; which, given the bad writing so common among political scientists, is amazing. Students of libertarianism and admirers of Rothbard and Mises will be delighted."},{"Title":"Justice and Its Surroundings (Collected Papers of Anthony de Jasay)","review":"This book was not very insightful. Dejasay's ideas may be original, but they are terribly organized. This guy has the worst grammar in the game. As a legal positivist, his prescriptions for government are so vague they are almost useless. His ambiguous style of writing, complemented by his unclear ideas make for a poor read."},{"Title":"Winning 'em Over: A New Model for Management in the Age of Persuasion","review":"&quot;One important aim of this book is to challenge your stereotypes of persuasion. We usually think of persuasion as something reserved for salespeople-certainly not for managers. What I am going to propose to you is that, quite to the contrary, persuasion skills have become absolutely essential to the job of managing-far more than we might imagine. Much of what a good manager does today is sell: sell their ideas to coworkers; sell their organizations on change; sell their bosses on new investments. But it's not traditional selling. A large part of what we do as effective managers is to find optimal solutions for problems through investigation, discussion, and debate. We then convince our organization to get behind them. It is in the convincing part that we face our greatest hurdless-getting buy-in. This is where the skills of constructive persuasion play a vital role. So leave behind your older notions of persuasion. It's time for a paradigm shift. Your effectiveness depends on it&quot; (pp.14-15).In this context, in Chapter 2, after listing wrong ideas about persuasion as following:1. persuasion is simply mustering the best arguments for something;2. persuasion almost always involves stating your position up front;3. persuasion means being assertive-often very assertive; and4. negotiating and deal making are at the heart of it.Jay A. Conger writes that &quot;These are some of the stereotypes people have about the act of convincing. There are several others. Together I call them the 'killer myths' of persuasion-'killer' because they can kill our ability to be effective and our motivation to become better persuaders.&quot;Killer Myth 1- The most effective persuasion is the hard sell.Killer Myth 2- Persuasion is a one-way process.Killer Myth 3- Effective persuaders succeed on the first try.Killer Myth 4- Good persuaders don't need to compromise.Killer Myth 5- Great arguments are the secret to successful persuasion.Killer Myth 6- Persuasion is pure manipulation.As a result, he writes that &quot;Now that we know what persuasion isn't, we may be wondering what constructive persuasion really is.&quot; Hence, he shows four distinct steps such as (i)building your credibility, (ii)finding the common ground, (iii)developing compelling positions and evidence, and (iv)connecting emotionally to becoming an effective persuader, and he discusses these steps/the four elements of effective persuasion throuhout the following four (3-6) chapters.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Winning 'em Over: A New Model for Management in the Age of Persuasion","review":"As an indication of how good this book is, I bought five copies when it came back in print. There are less than a dozen business books I have more than 2-3 copies of (Drucker is half of them.) It's that good.As a leadership consultant who regularly has to assist Directors, Vice Presidents and above - many of them in technology-heavy companies - this is the book I used to recommend most often, and it breaks my heart it is out of print. It is good enough that I have contacted Mr. Conger directly. Here's what I've found: it speaks in language that most executives can understand, and with a litle bit of coaching this book provides a framework for them to see what they are doing and not doing when it comes to internal communications, relationships, and, yes, politics. I am no longer amazed at the lack of caolition-building and relationship development skills of executives, but I come across it constantly. As such, I often find that great ideas are NOT being implemented either do to a lack of understanding of, or blatant disregard for, the need to PERSUADE others of the viability and effectiveness of the recommended course of action.If you're a bright executive who wonders why someone with less technical depth than you has gotten promoted in front of you, this book is a good place to start looking. Ask yourself whether you are as good interpersonally as you are technically."},{"Title":"Winning 'em Over: A New Model for Management in the Age of Persuasion","review":"As a recent MBA graduate, I found &quot;Winning 'Em Over&quot; to be a perfect complement to my formal education. By drawing on the disciplines of rhetoric, communication studies, management, and even storytelling, Jay Conger weaves a provocative and compelling argument for a fundamental and generational shift in the nature of management - from an Age of Command to an Age of Persuasion. Conger proves with contemporary examples what Aristotle knew thousands of years ago - that the author/audience (or persuader/persuadee) relationship is a covenant based on trust and mutually beneficial outcomes, that the audience must be an active participant in the process of persuasion, and that persuasion is a subtle art form. The beauty of &quot;Winning 'Em Over&quot; is that Conger explains the essence of this art in the context of the modern-day manager. In doing so, he provides the tools by which we can begin to understand the route to effective persusasion and, by extension, exemplary leadership. To become effective managers and leaders, we NEED to understand and adopt the principles examined in this book."},{"Title":"Winning 'em Over: A New Model for Management in the Age of Persuasion","review":"Jay Conger's new book is a must read for managers on all rungs of the corporate ladder. Most organizational behavior books shower readers with platitudes, but this book goes beyond. Conger gives current examples of persuasive leaders (both positive and negative) and then shows the reader step-by-step how to begin building the skills necessary to powerfully pursuade. The exercises and practical tips make the book a highly effective tool. Conger's techniques have helped me grapple with difficult negociations at work. I find that I am much more analytical and have a better appreciation of the inner dealings that go on within my work teams. At points the book makes pursuasion seem a bit too easy (at least for me), but it is a key book for all of us read and learn from. Honestly, I use the skills that I picked up reading this book outside the office just as much as I do inside. We all need to learn to pursuade and this text lays a solid foundation for us all to do so."},{"Title":"Winning 'em Over: A New Model for Management in the Age of Persuasion","review":"I really liked this book a lot and found it very useful in modifying my mindset.

This is a truly useful book!"},{"Title":"The Thirty-Six Dramatic Situations (1977 The Writer Edition)","review":"Legend has it that Georges Polti heard that there were 36 possible plots, and set about creating a list of plots to match the 36. He claims that this number isn't special, and there may be other classifications a bit higher, or a bit lower. He also says that these correspond to the 36 basic emotions people have, which I honestly don't see.Some of the dramatic situations seem to be stretched a bit thin where several of them have similar parts but in sleightly different context.For example: Twentieth Situation: Self-Sacrifice for an Ideal, Twenty First Situation: Self-Sacrifice for Kindred.If someone proposed that there are only 36 plots (someone who the author holds in high recard) I would be tempted to say that with such a number as 36 - divisible by 1, 2, 3, 4 and all higher multiples thereof, that really what he meant was variations on a handful of plots. For example the 3 basic plots of Person v. Person, Person v. Nature (God), Person v. Herself. If I could think of 3 permutations on each of those, and 4 variations of each, then I too would have 36 plots.Here it seems that Polti just started listing plots until he got to 36. I do recommend this book, along with Games People Play by Eric Berne (which falls under the psychology/self help section) as a good resource for when you're stuck for an idea. Eric Berne was a psychologist, concerned with figuring out what the basic transactions between people are (games) and what are reasons are for playing them. The difference here is that Eric Berne acknowledges that his list is a work in progress, and more games will be recognized as time goes on.As far as more classical plotting, Aristotle's Poetics, The Art of Dramatic Writing by Lajos Egri (see my review), and The Hero With A Thousand Faces by Joseph Campbell are great resources. I'd also add The Hero by Lord Raglan (available in In Quest of the Hero by Otto Rank). These books make up the canonical library every writer should have.Aristotle laid down the fundamentals of drama over 2,000 years ago, and they are followed to this day. Probably his closest modern rival is Lajos Egri, and you'll see that many of the writing software packages out there are either Aristotle, Egri, or Campbell based.Another reviewer mentioned Star Wars. George Lucas was highly influenced by Joseph Campbell, and the famed Bill Moyers interviews were conducted on Skywalker Ranch. I think analyzing Star Wars from the point of view of The 36 Dramatic Situations is like analyzing soup from the point of view of it's ingredients: &quot;I noticed Celery, and Potatoes, and...&quot; without getting a feel for the arc of the story, or that the soup is a Stew. Star Wars is a myth, and follows the basic mythic structure.Lord Raglan identifies 22 common traits of heros, such as: His father is a king, he is raised by foster parents, we're told nothing of his childhood, etc. Everyone from Oedipus to Moses to King Arthur to Jesus to Luke Skywalker to Robin Hood to Neo follow this scale to one degree or another, and he gives examples of each.I'd also encourage the curious to learn more about the Hollywood formula, 7 point plots, and the all important turnaround."},{"Title":"The Thirty-Six Dramatic Situations (1977 The Writer Edition)","review":"This text comes highly recommended as a classic by far too many creative writing and screenwriting teachers.Want to know if this book is for you?

If it doesn't, you'll need to look elsewhere."},{"Title":"The Thirty-Six Dramatic Situations (1977 The Writer Edition)","review":"George Polti's book tells you about the inner workings of the thirty-six dramatic situations he claims to have found. According to him, the possible plots can be reduced to one of these situations or to a variation on them. Additionally, he offers specific sub-types to each one of the plots, so that it is easier to precise which elements will make a distinct kind of plot. At the end of the book, you will also find useful information on how every element of a plot can vary. The classical avenger archetypical figure, for example, can be split into several characters for a different effect; the object of a passion can be a man or a woman, but it can be an addiction too! A book that would-be writers should not miss, &quot;The Thirty-six Dramatic Situations&quot; will make a good reading even for those only interested in getting a better grasp of the plot of, say, a movie they have seen. It is, simply, a work of art."},{"Title":"The Thirty-Six Dramatic Situations (1977 The Writer Edition)","review":"The elevated language of this nearly 100-year-old reference book makes the writing disconcerting to read at first, but as you leaf through situations (&quot;Supplication,&quot; &quot;Enmity of Kinsmen,&quot; &quot;Vengance Taken for Kindred Upon Kindred&quot;), you'll find yourself thinking of modern examples. An example: how many of these named plot devices are in the first &quot;Star Wars&quot; film? Well, for starters, there's Pursuit, Deliverance, Disaster, Revolt, Daring Enterprise, The Enigma (&quot;Use the Force, Luke!&quot; -- &quot;Luke, I am your father!&quot;) and probably a few more that I didn't see. So if you're stumped for plots and conflict, this book will give you a good kick-start."},{"Title":"The Thirty-Six Dramatic Situations (1977 The Writer Edition)","review":"This book is famous mostly among people who have only heard of it. People who have actually read it are less gushy with their praise.Most folks think of this as a book of all the different plots and their variations. But personally, I prefer to look at the title itself, which speaks not of \\"plots\\" but of \\"dramatic situations\\".Picture a story as if it were a play. When the curtain rises, the actors are all on stage and frozen in a tableau that displays their roles and inter-relationships. It is Polti's contention that these tableaus, or \\"dramatic situations\\", amount to no more than 36 in number.How does this differ from 36 plots? Well, there may be only a limited number of relationships among the characters when the curtain first rises, but there are a zillion different ways in which those relationships can play themselves out. In Polti's sub-headings he goes through a wide range of different variations.So if you're looking for a one-size-fits-all set of plotlines so that you can write your blockbuster, forget it. If you want a densely written analysis of the 36 Dramatic Situations, this is your book. The book will help writers think about their craft, but it's still not as simple as people make it sound when they describe the book over a beer.One problem that I ran into was Polti's era and nationality. He was a Frenchman writing almost a hundred years ago. As a result, his voluminous notations describing a plethora of literary examples was mainly lost on me. Unless you're an expert on 19th Century French theatre, you may find yourself in the same boat.My bottom line: this is a good book. I'm glad I've got it and I occasionaslly pull it off the shelf and re-read sections. But is it a masterpiece, the Holy Grail of plot-writers? No."},{"Title":"The Thirty-Six Dramatic Situations (1977 The Writer Edition)","review":"I found Polti's \\"Les trente-six situations dramatiques\\" with another classic of his, \\"L'art d'inventer les personnages\\" reprinted by &Eacute;ditions d'aujourd'hui in a serie called \\"Les introuvables\\" and I can assure you that both books are very difficult to find as genuine originals. Now Lucille Ray has made a tour de force and Thirty-Six Dramatic Situations is available to English speaking readers. Polti claims that all dramatic situations boil down to only 36 basic situations. You can believe him or not but much what he says makes sense and he supports his claim by giving examples from classic literature. He also refers to novels and stories which may be difficult to find but the point is that somebody has used the dramatic situation in question and there may be others. This is the true value of Polti, if you truly want to offer your readers something new and don't want to copy your ideas from published novels. The other side of the coin is that certain dramatic situations can be safely used over and over again because the public wants you to play the same old song again and again. I like to read Polti's ideas just for fun and only regret that many of the books he refers to are difficult to find. Some of them are also available only in French. There must be some well-read amateur who could write an English version of Polti's book and give examples based on English texts. I guarantee a huge success.

So he went away and washed, and came back seeing.\\" Gospel of John: 9: 6-7.The intended audience of this work: the permanently cynical (me), writers, and English Literature undergraduates. For undergrads: after mentioning Foucault you quote Polti's structural plot diagnostic in some obfuscated sentence in about your third paragraph of any lit paper and you're on your way to graduating with honors. Heck, you professor won't even read any further and just slap an \\"A\\" on the darn thing. For writers: if you are stuck, reading this will send you screaming back to your alphanumeric clavichord faster than a Mustang with a tank full of white lightening and jet fuel.One of the horrible things about reviewing is you start to think about what you've seen and read. Given man's continued Aristotelian imperative to classify, we also begin to classify written and visual literature. Soon this is distilled to an essence, and soon you read the essence instead of the story. Or the familiar story is re-written in a disguised way, and with such excellent selection of language, you don't care.Georges Polti made things even worse than Aristotle did, and now there are no new stories under the sun. Instead of a Novel-O-Matic or \\"Mad-Lib: The Novel\\" we have Polti's \\"The Thirty-Six Dramatic Situations.\\" Read this and you need never read again, but will always just flip to this most essential of the \\"Master Plots.\\"Why 36? Why not. Nice factoring on that handy number, sounds plausible, and didn't Jesus die at 36 years old? Or was it 33?

For those of us who have wondered what the heck Skipp has been up to for a decade (believe it or not, it's been eleven years since the publication of the last Skipp & Spector novel, ANIMALS), this book is the answer. It also makes a nice segue into where Skipp is at now as a writer (everyone should also check out his wonderful EMERALD BURRITO OF OZ, co-written with Marc Levinthal). This collection spans a wide-ranging gamut, from metaphysical noir (the title story) to EC-style horror (the brilliant two-pager A QUICKEE) to devastating social and psychological terror (FILM AT ELEVEN and EMPATHY) to flat-out fun erotica (ALL THIS, AND HEAVEN TOO) and more, culminating in the spectacular, full-tilt-boogie epic horror screenplay, JOHNNY DEATH (which, given the recent success of HELLBOY at the movies is sure to be on a movie screen near you soon - only Skipp wrote this one in 1993!!!) Readers of every taste will find something to their liking in this collection, and for those of us who are long-time Skipp & Spector fans, one also finds work far more satisfying, human, and elegant than Spector's solo efforts. On top of everything else, Skipp punctuates the book with introductions to each work, giving us a fascinating insight into his creative process (he's a fine essayist, and is happily continuing his essays in a twice-weekly column called The Hard Way on his website, johnskipp.com). There aren't enough superlatives at my disposal to describe CONSCIENCE as far as I'm concerned: It's that great and that important a work. Happily, Skipp seems to have returned full-force, since we're promised another book shortly - a screenplay collection called SICK CHICK FLICKS!!! Can't wait!"},{"Title":"Conscience","review":"ConscienceJohn Skipp$19.99Softcover, 326 pageshttp://www.johnskipp.comJohn Skipp's name should be familiar to well-read horror fans -- he was one-half of the famed writing duo \\"Skipp and Spector\\" who wrote such genre classics as The Light at the End and The Bridge. Along with many of the younger breed of horror writers, Skipp and Spector were lumped (fairly or unfairly) into the horror sub-genre of \\"splatterpunk,\\" which offered readers a much darker world-view along with graphic, no-holds barred descriptions that most authors would leave to the reader's imaginations. Skipp and Spector authored several novels and short stories together, garnering a strong critical and popular following.When the Skipp and Spector partnership fell apart in 1993, due to creative and personal reasons that have never fully been revealed or discussed by either party, many horror fans predicted great things from both writers, and waited with anticipation for them to release their own, single-author works. It took over ten years for Skipp to make good on these grand predictions, but there can be little doubt of his return to form.The novella \\"Conscience,\\" which gives the book its title, is actually just one of the eight works found between the book's covers, which also include a full-length unproduced screenplay, \\"Johnny Death,\\" and several short stories that predate or run parallel to the writing of \\"Conscience.\\" Introductions to each piece help to place it within its historical context, and provide the reader with backstory and history for each piece. Skipp's shorter fiction packs a remarkable punch, and the stories are lessons in economy -- rarely revealing more than they need to, and not lasting a second longer than necessary to maximize their impact.But for all Skipp's success with short stories, the short novel \\"Conscience\\" is really the centerpiece of the book, and in it he offers an unforgettable look at the city of Los Angeles as a micro-chasm of the overall human condition, offering the reader a mind-and-genre-bending excursion into the darker side of humanity, and one man's quest for personal redemption. Part noir nightmare and part personal quest, this is a story that pulls equally from both popular culture and personal demons, both real and imagined. It is neither truly a horror story or crime story, but an original combination of the two . . . something uniquely its own. Like the twisted love-child of Raymond Chandler, Stephen King, and Quentin Tarantino, Skipp holds the reader in sway for the length of the story, as foul-mouthed anti-heroes, philosophical doppelgangers, and fallen messiahs weave into a story that lingers in a reader's mind for long after it has finished.It may have taken ten years for Skipp to release a new book, but the wait was worthwhile. Rarely has a book crossed my desk that has so quickly demanded my attention or stuck with me so long afterwards. So, without further adieu, let me be among the first to tell you that Skipp has returned, and all the grand predictions made about his second-coming are true. Grab yourself a copy of Conscience, and prepare to experience something quite unlike anything else you'll read this year."},{"Title":"Conscience","review":"Just flew through the novella \\"Conscience\\" without being able to put it down.

Would absolutely use again."},{"Title":"Not the End of the World","review":"This attack on hypocrisy, religion and the mass media masquerades as a millennial thriller, and while enjoyable in a beach-reading kind of way, doesn't really leave much of a mark. Certainly Brookmyre's targets are valid (albeit obvious and easy to demolish), and he does yeoman's work in blasting away at all the self-righteous characters that scheme to destroy LA in a SPECTRE-like operation. His two central heroes (Senator's daughter turned porn-star and Scottish seminarian turned photographer) are fairly adorable, and the rest of the cast is admirably drawn in a Carl Hiassen, Elmore Leonard kind of way. As with most thrillers, it's fairly predictable, the fun is in seeing how the heroes deal with the mayhem. One small thing I found really jarring was the 5 or 6 times he has American characters using a English or Scottish idiom in their speech or thoughts. The editors need to have an American read the manuscript to point these errors out."},{"Title":"Not the End of the World","review":"This is one of the worst books I have read in a long, long time. The plot is full of tired cliches and all of the characters, heroes as well as villains, are one dimensional and annoying. Who wants to read more tripe involving Y2K terrorism?"},{"Title":"Not the End of the World","review":"NOT THE END OF THE WORLD is an apocalyptic millennial book that is dark comedy at its darkest. Although Brookmyre missed a bit on the facts and timing, this tale of fanatical religious zealots trying to destroy America and rebuild it in their image is unfortunately all too timely. The zealots in this fictional account are Christian, not Moslem; but when dealing with fanaticism the exact flavor scarcely matters. However, Brookmyre uses his book to mount a scathing attack on fundamentalism of any sort and simultaneously makes a compelling, albeit tragically jaded, case for atheism: \\"Some wee old spinster in Coatsbridge, in her hairy coat, plastic Rainmate and furry boots, nipping into the Co-op minimarket for a half-pound of cheap mince on the way home from the chapel, Scottish Catholic Universe under her arm, might tell herself she wasn't, spiritually speaking, doing any harm. But she'd be kidding herself. And acting the humble innocent wouldn't help. Hardline Islamics would have her on the dress-code, for a start. Vain, shameless slattern, flaunting herself like that in public, for all the world to see. Hindus wouldn't go a bundle on her planned ingestion of bloody flesh, or her wider complicity in the sacred animal's slaughter. Attendance at the 'temple of the Satanic anti-Christ of Rome' remains something of a no-no as far as the Scottish Free Presbyterians and Ian Paisley's mob are concerned. And as for a woman being able to read, well, ask the Taleban about that in Kabul. Then duck. Cumulatively, the world's religions could provide a God-given justification to hate anything about anybody. Steff had decided some years ago to hate them all back.\\" And there is much more. In fact, Brookmyre's apparent vitriol toward organized religion is so strong that I am surprised the book was published in America at all.But those of us who are not offended by that point of view will find NOT THE END OF THE WORLD a terrific thriller, with a fascinating and ever-twisting plot that engages the reader throughout. Just when I thought I knew what would happen next the action took another unexpected but plausible turn. And the characterizations were engaging; even the villains had some sympathetic motivations to their heinous plans.Brookmyre has a darkly wicked sense of humor and pays homage to the Monty Python gang and Scottish comedian Billy Connolly, among others. All in all, NOT THE END OF THE WORLD is definitely worth a read, even though the dates in the book didn't quite pan out. People are still reading 1984, aren't they?"},{"Title":"Not the End of the World","review":"Christopher Brookmyre is an unusual writer. His works are sort of detective fiction, sort of block buster thriller and sort of left wing satire. Until this book all of his books were set in Scotland. His first book quite ugly one morning introduced a new sort of hero, a short sarcastic investigative reporter called Parlabane.This book is set in Los Angles but one of the main characters is a visiting Scots photographer. The plot is as with his other works somewhat convoluted and ends in a climax which would not be out of place in a Bruce Willis movie. Along the way there is a ferocious satire of Baptist Evangelical Sects and the consumerist aspects of American life.The main attraction of the book apart from the non stop action is the fact that it is side splittingly funny. Brookmyre is one of the most amusing authors to write mystery fiction. The humour however has a distinctly adult bite to it."},{"Title":"Not the End of the World","review":"I guess, reading the other reviews, you either love Brookmyre or you hate him! I loved him. Brilliant book, brilliantly written, with more than a touch of black humor. This guy has guts, and he tells it like it is. Recommended reading for anyone who lives in the real world."},{"Title":"Not the End of the World","review":"Brookmyre has the killer touch when it comes to exposing the hypocrisy of religious fundamentalism. In 'Not the End of the World', he makes a pretty good meal of the media as well!. His humor is really 'in-your-face' - not passive beach reading as one reviewer believes - and, if you look below the (excellent) storyline, you'll see some remarkably accurate social observations about life in general.Try and get his other books -'One Fine Day in the Middle of the Night', 'Quite Ugly one Morning' and 'Boiling a Frog' - they're also excellent reads."},{"Title":"Not the End of the World","review":"I actually bought this book because it, then, had a slight science fiction theme, and had received a sterling review in New Scientist. I ususally do not go for thrillers, but I do make now make exceptions for Christopher Brookmyre! This book is highly satirical, funny, grisly, and thoughtprovoking. The heroes work in porn industry, and the crooks are biblethumpers and &quot;patriots&quot;."},{"Title":"Not the End of the World","review":"There is a certain style of writing that compels you to read until you finish. And then there is a another style that compels you to go and find any other book written by the same author. Fitting into the latter category, the story is as humorous as it is action packed, and is so fast moving that you are simply disappointed when there are no more pages left. Of course you can simply start again, and you'll find that it is just as good on the second pass. The story is great, and will be enjoyed by anyone with school day memories, either good or bad. Of course, the story has very little to do with school day memories and everything to with life, albeit not quite exactly in circumstances that you will find yourself in. Unless of course you are a mercenary with a conscience... Quite simply read this, have a single malt in hand and enjoy."},{"Title":"Not the End of the World","review":"I bought this book in London in 1999 for my long flight back to Sydney. Well, I arrived exhausted and even more jet-lagged than usual because I couldn't put it down!Brookmyre melds a fantastically twisted thriller with an amused outsider view of LA pop culture and fervent religious fanaticism. Smart, fun, perceptive, great characters -- a great all-rounder. This is a really enjoyable read."},{"Title":"Not the End of the World","review":"This book probably reads better now than when it was published in 1998 (set in 1999). My recollection of Y2k fears was that a lot of quite rational secular people were afraid of what negligent computer coding would do to the world when the clocks tried to roll over to the year 2000; Christian millenialists may have taken advantage of the new year to preach the end of the world, but those that were well-situated, like Brookmyre's Luther St. John, were certainly looking ahead to more decades of power. So Brookmyre can't really bite into Y2k per se, and he ends up with a plot that is an acknowledged rip-off of the 1978 Superman movie. However, he does a sharp job on the longing of fundamentalist religion to create a millenial atmosphere, which we have seen since both with 9/11 (where the Christian right quickly associated the World Trade Center and the Pentagon with abortion, feminism, and gay activism) and Hurricane Katrina. His understanding of this kind of spin was chillingly prescient.He presents a face-off between two Americans, a Christian fundamentalist media mogul with Presidential aspirations and a porn actress, both of whom were abused children. Other characters include Larry Freeman of the LAPD, an old friend of Brookmyre's Scottish hero Jack Parlabane, and Steff Kennedy, a Scottish photographer on assignment--and a Dickensian multiplicity of other vividly sketched characters. Larry and Steff have their own issues, their own reasons to mourn losses of innocence and to question the comfort offered by religion.Brookmyre does make a lot of mistakes in handling the Los Angeles mentality. There is more to sounding American than saying \\"ain't\\" and \\"no way,\\" and American cops don't suss out conspiracies as they head for the lifts; nor do Americans consume Twiglets; nor are Texas instruments of corporal punishment made in Lochgelly. The first 100 pages or so are more careful, switching smoothly between the Scottish mind of Steff and the American minds of other protagonists, but after that it is written to be read by a Brit. Despite these small annoyances, it is a powerful book and I stayed up late to finish it!"},{"Title":"Not the End of the World","review":"I am a big Brookmyre fan and was a little disappointed with his stab at a story set in the US. There Scottish connection is still there, with the main character a Scotsman, but the punch just wasn't there - which really is his trademark. Just read &quot;Quite Ugly One Morning&quot; and you will see. Don't get me wrong, I still liked the book, but it just wasn't up to his usual standard, that's all."},{"Title":"Not the End of the World","review":"From referring to Santa Monica as \\"Santa M\\" repeatedly to having his main character claim that he grew up in Los Angeles, Brookmyre is miles away from any reality of Los Angeles. His thinks-he's-so-brilliant quips and cliches are tired and show him to be a dull imitator of greats like Irvine Welsh. The absolte funniest/worst part of the book was his made up translation of an ancient document found on the island of Crete, containing gems such as \\"Often have I wondered, watching the rhytons being filled in sacrifice from a quaking beast's throat, would we do the same were it a cold, clear water that issued forth, and not this liquid jewel, this decorative prize?\\"In the end, Brookmyre's approach is too casual and cocky to be convincing and his prose is sub-par.

However it would be of no use for the progress of the comming music of future composers."},{"Title":"Orchestration (The musician's library)","review":"This book is superb, very indepth. I bought it, however, thinking it was going to discuss topics such as instrumental combinations, balance of tone, and other concepts more typically associated with 'orchestration'. It turns out, it deals more with the various characteristics and capabilities of each instrument in the orchestra...EXCELLENTLY!

Published between the world wars, it is obviously has no information on the way cool toys of the last few decades, but it is as thorough and practical a treatment as can be found in any language for most of the instruments (other than percussion oddities) in the European musical tradition, and certainly compares favorably with most of the standard textbooks peddled by needy American college professors. In addition, Forsyth can be droll, as for example when he reports that Berlioz observes &quot;ominously&quot; that the best notes on the little known Russian bassoon are said to be D and E-flat."},{"Title":"Orchestration (The musician's library)","review":"I've got a small shelf of orchestration books and this is easily the best of the lot. While it doesn't talk as much about combinations of instruments as Rimsky-Korsakoff's book, it provides detailed and practical information on each of the instruments it covers. Yes, it's old and the state of the art has advanced on some instruments, but that has little impact on just how wonderful this book is.I'd suggest also picking up Essential Dictionary of Orchestration (The Essential Dictionary Series) by Dave Black and Tom Gerou to fill in some of the gaps on contemporary orchestration."},{"Title":"Orchestration (The musician's library)","review":"This is an older text, most of which dates to the dawn of the 20th century. As a result, some aspects are out-of-date. Many instruments have gone out of favor or undergone further evolution.

(His opera &quot;A View from the Bridge&quot; premiered November 1999 and was favorably reviewed in &quot;Newsweek&quot;, &quot;Time Magazine&quot;, and &quot;The New York Times.&quot;) As William Bolcolm points out, very little of this book is out of date--a few tiny, insignificant bits; it remains &quot;eminently usable&quot;. It also remains head and shoulders above the scores of tedious, dull, and perfunctory orchestration manuals subsequently published. One of its many virtues is its immersion in what Mr. Bolcolm calls &quot;technical culture&quot;: It imparts to you a sense of what it's like to play the various orchestral instruments. Future fetishists (those wishing to obliterate the past and present in sacrificial rite to a future they can know as little as you and I) take note: what is best is what endures."},{"Title":"Orchestration (The musician's library)","review":"An excellent and authoritative text. There have been some changes in the capabilities of the instruments that are not reflected in the text, and of course it is missing all of the more modern and electronic instruments (this has the same unabridged text as the 1935 edition), but it's still very useful and well-written.One (small) lack: after reading the section on the harp, I still greatly prefer the standard on that subject, &quot;Harp Scoring&quot; by Stanley Chaloupka, for discussion of composing or orchestrating for the harp.I feel this book should be in the library of anyone serious about orchestration or composing for an orchestra."},{"Title":"Orchestration (The musician's library)","review":"This is one of my very favorite books--not merely one of my very favorite orchestration books, not merely one of my very favorite music theory books.

By the bye, William Bolcom's new introduction is my favorite introduction to any book.Also recommended: PENTATONIC SCALES FOR THE JAZZ-ROCK KEYBOARDIST by Jeff Burns."},{"Title":"Orchestration (The musician's library)","review":"I am an amateur orchestrationist and I loved this book. The history of the instruments gave me a greater understanding of each group and their strengths and weaknesses. I hope everyone who has an interest in instrumentation would read and study this book."},{"Title":"Orchestration (The musician's library)","review":"While Forsythe offers a great deal of depth and detail, much of it I found superfluous unless you are a musicologist, and I am a musicologist. But now my primary interest is orchestrating. The author includes too much historical background on the various instruments, such as the evolution of the horn, which you only need to know if you are analyzing Hadyn symphonies. If you are orchestrating a new symphony, you need to know current instrumental capabilities and practices, and the Forsythe book is now nearly 100 years old. Most of his information remains valid, but how will you know what isn't?I read this and a few other classics (Berlioz/Strauss, Rimsky, Piston) -- all of which are worthwhile -- before getting some coaching from a composition professor, who recognized that I needed a newer text. He recommended Adler or Kennan. So I bought the fourth edition of Kennan's orchestration book, a good place to start. Continue later with Forsythe and the others once you've acquired the up-to-date basics."},{"Title":"Orchestration (The musician's library)","review":"Please note that this is a review of the 'General Books' edition of this work only.Cecil Forsyth, (or 'FORKYTH' as this edition would have it), may indeed have written an eminently usable book, but this edition is anything but that. It is apparently a raw OCR copy of an earlier edition, including headings such as the following \\"ITiii, 3. MODEKN OUOKKSTIIAI, VALVK-HuuN\\" (at 63). While most of the text has not been quite as badly garbled, they layout (it is not visually apparent where one chapter or section begins or ends, what is a chapter heading vs example text, etc), makes it impossible to locate specific information and very difficult to read.If you want this book, spend the extra money buying an edition upon which a modicum of editorial effort has been exercised."},{"Title":"Orchestration (The musician's library)","review":"This book is organized as a tour of the many instruments that comprise an orchestra, together with description about how each instrument sounds, and how it might be used. Its primary focus is the instruments, not their arrangement.My interest was more the latter. I am an amateur, novice composer of short works, working to arrange and orchestrate my own music. I want to understand better when oboes are best used over strings, how strings sections \\"against\\" each other are sculpted, when interplay between brass instruments is most appealing, etc.I respect this man, but his book is not for me."},{"Title":"Orchestration (The musician's library)","review":"Cecil Forsyth's Orchestration is a fascinating introduction to the topic. The text is broken up into sections, each section dedicated to an instrument of the orchestra. There are a great number of musical examples which Forsyth uses to prove the points he makes. Although the age of the book fails to lend a modern perspective (I'd LOVE to see what the percussion section of the book would look like if it was written after Orff's Carmina Burana!), many fundamentals of orchestration are timeless. The string section is glorious, and is a wonderful introduction to the instruments for any non-string player. Overall, the text is invaluable to any student with moderate theory knowledge interested in the technical side of music."},{"Title":"Orchestration (The musician's library)","review":"Don't waste your money on this edition which is basically a scam. The first page where the copyright is explains how they saved money by making digital copies of the original manuscript without doing any editing. Therefore, this book is full of typos and THERE ARE NO ILLUSTRATIONS OR MUSICAL EXAMPLES. Then they try to solicit more business by saying if you want to read the original version you have to join a website where you can join on a \\"trial basis.\\" Although the original edition had plenty of examples of musical scores to study, this edition merely omitted all illustrations in the name of saving the consumer a few bucks. The text accompanying each example is still there but if you want to know what they're talking about you'll have to go find the original scores yourself. Do yourself a favor and buy the original version at your local bookstore where you can see what you're getting before you buy it.NOTE: this review is for the publication by General Books LLC (Large Loads of Crap).
