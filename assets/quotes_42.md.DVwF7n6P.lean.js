Anyone who has children or enjoys \\"outdoorsy\\" and nature-related activities, whether you have kids or were ever a boy or not, should get this. Yes, it's outdated in many ways, but it is still very relevant in many others and the nostalgia aspect more than makes up for the irrelevancies. I would love to see an update of this book so that presently-accessible materials would be included, but I fear that updating it would require taking out, or modifying too much, some of the best parts of it because of modern ideas about safety and such. It's not that I want my kids to put broken glass or knife blades on the tails of their kites for kite wars, or feed a bullfrog a perch, but I think that taking that type of thing out would be a travesty. Anyway, I highly recommend this to anyone who enjoys the outdoors and do-it-yourself type of books, especially if you have children, are a child at heart and/or enjoy nostalgia."},{"Title":"THE AMERICAN BOY'S HANDY BOOK","review":"Some things simply never change. \\"The American Boy's Handy Book\\" is a guide for young boys who still find the time of playing outside highly appealing.

A fair number of the materials called for are hard if not impossible to find today, but the spirit of adaptation and improvisation that imbues this book will inspire the reader to find substitutes. Some parents may suspect the fair number of projectile- launching devices described, but the book is infinitely less violent than most child-oriented television shows and never fails to stress safety. My friends and I learned a lot of practical mechanics and crafting skills, developed our hand-eye coordination, and never shot anything more fragile than a plastic figure.

The emphasis is on building things yourself, and to that end it is an extremely valuable handbook for our increasingly passive society. There are definitely things here that will give you pause or that are culturally dated -- like making a blow gun, trapping and raising wild animals and taxidermy at home -- but that is where parenting comes in, and all-in-all I would say this is a valuable and exciting book for kids, filled with pragmatic insights and a fun historical document as well.

This treasure of a book will suggest projects for your class which will help them understand the world of Tom Sawyer and Huck Finn. Make kites in the shape of stars, turtles, shields and dragons. Build your own giant bubble machine or a Puss in Boots puppet show (script is included). Avoid the more violent blow guns and fighting kites but enjoy the simplicity and just plain fun of this book.

Part of me wants to address the parents of the children this book seems to be directed to. And part of me wants to treat this book as a historical reference.To take the easier path first, let me talk about the American Boy's Handy Book's place in history. The book was written by Daniel Carter Beard. Carter was an artist, naturalist and early founder of the Boy Scouts of America. His love of the outdoors and empathy for youth is evident right from the start of the first chapter: he writes, \\"[I]t is a pleasant sensation to sit in the first spring sunshine and feel the steady pull of a good kite upon the string, and watch it's graceful movements as it sways from side to side, ever mounting higher and higher, as if impatient to free itself and soar away amid the clouds.\\"And it was his concern with the lack of structure and supervision of city kids that caused him write this book. His own childhood was in antebellum Ohio. When his life took him to the city of New York he despaired at seeing the news boys sleeping on the wet streets and he began writing all sorts of articles for children's magazines of the time.Eventually, he was urged to collect these pieces and to put them in a single volume. The American Boy's Handy Book is the result.Chapter Headings, under the major seasonal divisionsSpring1. Kite Time2. War Kites3. Novel Modes of Fishing4. Hand-Made Fishing Tackle5.

Home-Made masquerade and Theatrical CostumesYou might wonder why I list this chapters. I do it first because I have not found them given anywhere else. And you need to see, as Historians or History enthusiasts the scope of activities that are covered. Carter really provides, in my opinion, a look into both indoor and outdoor activities of the times. These are the activities that the boys and men going into Civil War would have known about. What they would have done to pass the evenings at home, and it gives a precursor of the basic field skills they might have had.Now, for the parents and adults that are considering this book for children. Let me say that this is not a 19th Century equivalent of \\"The Dangerous Book for Boys\\". This is a book written before there were Warning Labels and you will have to assess the readiness of your child to read the book.What I mean by this is that The \\"American Handy Book for Boys\\" is filled with activities, some of which should not be attempted by anyone under 12 years of age. While some projects like the costumes and \\"phunnygraph\\" and kites are more or less timeless and safe activities, there are others like making your own boomerang and outdoor oven, that require tools that most of us don't normally hand over to youngers.And there are other activities that ought not to ever be engaged in, even with adult supervision. Blowing up balloons using natural gas comes to mind. Similarly there are other activities that ought to only be engaged in under adult supervision, like dissecting a bird and stuffing it.There are other activities like making costumes and whirligig's that are harmless. But I would suggest this book for the mature, young adult. Perhaps someone interesting in the times of Huck Finn.I highly recommend this book for it's unique view of the past. It would make a great gift for someone like myself who is interested in the sociological side of history. Or the older child, like an Eagle Scout, who might want to experiment with making their own oven, boat, blow gun, camp bed, etc.Pam T~mom and reviewer at PageInHistory and BooksForKids-reviews"},{"Title":"THE AMERICAN BOY'S HANDY BOOK","review":"I was given a first edition by my grandfather in 1973.

I purchased this for a 10-year-old who appreciates \\"old fashioned\\" books and is an active Cub Scout learning about camping. I was very disappointed to find that the book included some racial slurs that made me too uncomfortable to give it as a gift. An adult reader could consider the era in which it was written and overlook the references, but I wouldn't want to count on a 10-year old being able to make that same value judgement.

He not only got out of the house, away from the TV, Video Games..but he got involved in real and imaginative play. He could see the value in reading a \\"manual\\" in a sense...follow the directions and make a bow and arrow. Schools today seem to center on testing and learning facts.

Even for a 20th century suburban kid, the book opened up a world of possibilities for projects and activities. It is hard to express how refreshing it was to find a perspective from a time when boys were assumed to have craft skills, initiative, and to be responsible for their own safety through common sense.Some of the projects I carried out were an aquarium of local fish, homemade boats, bows & arrows, blowguns, fish spears, ice-fishing gear, fire without matches, primitive camping, snow forts and homemade fireworks. The book is also a good guide to the habits of various animals.It is worth mentioning that the prose is excellent, with a higher vocabulary and more complex sentence structure than in childrens' books today.I have also browsed \\"The Dangerous Book for Boys\\" and the few projects it describes are watered-down, liability-conscious versions of the sort you find in this classic (though its non-project sections are interesting). If your kid is a tinkerer, go for the original and let him know that you expect him to be responsible with the knowledge therein -- my experience is that boys will be as serious as you expect them to be."},{"Title":"THE AMERICAN BOY'S HANDY BOOK","review":"This is an extraordinary book - written before TV invaded our homes. Reading this book was a bit sad - the skills assumed of a 12 year old boy then are rare today; even among scouts and free range kids.As with the Dangerous Book for boys; it is not a book that you can hand to a child and expect them to be able to follow or remain interested in. Once they have completed a few projects and discovered the joy of doing something themselves even though it is difficult then they will most likely continue these types of activities.WARNING: if you do not trust your child with their own pocket knife you will probably not get the full benefit of this book!"},{"Title":"THE AMERICAN BOY'S HANDY BOOK","review":"I read this book in 5th grade when I checked it out of our school library. I remember needing to learn how to tie a certain knot which is why I checked it out. At the time I thought it was pretty interesting but I basically left most of it unread and returned it when my knot project was finished. Reading it later as an adult I wish that I had given it more attention when I was a kid because it is a wonderful book. It has a place in every home, particularly homes with children(big and small alike) Another interesting point is the languauge of the book. Being that it was written well over 100 yrs ago the book has a bit of a different dialect. However it's pleasant to read. It's nice to see even a book on leisure topics written more formally and it's a shame more books aimed at children and parents aren't written this way.This book would be a great gift to any family looking to do something on a weekend other than watch TV.

My son is really enjoying it."},{"Title":"THE AMERICAN BOY'S HANDY BOOK","review":"The American Boy's Handy Book by Daniel Beard is a guide book for boys. It includes directions for knots, kite building, camping without a tent, and how to build a snow fort, just to name a few. The book was originally published in 1882 and is filled with black and white drawings. While I think it's wonderful to introduce young boys to the joys of the outdoors, they will have some difficulty with the language of the book. The chapter on Knots, Bends, and Hitches starts like this: \\"The art of tying knots is an almost necessary adjunct to not a few recreations. Especially is this true of summer sports, many of which are nautical, or in some manner connected with the water.\\" This book is more suited for older boys or nostalgic men.Daniel Beard was one of the founder's of Boy Scouts. He was born in 1850 and lived until 1941. He received the only Golden Eagle badge awarded by the Boy Scouts. He believed in allowing boys to create their own toys and he loved the outdoors. There is a mountain peak in Alaska named for him."},{"Title":"THE AMERICAN BOY'S HANDY BOOK","review":"This book goes back to the eartly 1900's. It was before boy scouts came into existanc. Thre were many handy illustrations of how to make a dug out canoe, build a tent, make a fishing pole. It was so interesting to see how people had fun in the outdoor before all oof the luxeries of toeday.

As an interesting browse in the library or book store, maybe. The stuff it talks about is simply impractical for most kids.

It's one of those books that you constantly go back to to confirm what you are doing. The book is well written, concise and covers material in a number of college level finanical courses. For the general Accountant, it is a learning tool and for the experienced Financial Analyst, an excellent reference."},{"Title":"Techniques of financial analysis","review":"Professor Helfert's graphic presentations have caused concepts to gel that were amorphous in my mind for years despite an investment banking background. I would recommend this book as a first book to anyone interested in quickly obtaining a bird's eye view of the business entity from a &quot;business systems&quot; approach. Helfert's position is that of an engineer or a scientist: Every business has a structure that can be indentified, analyzed, and then manipulated to increase shareholder value.Every new issue refers back to the Investment, Operations, Financing structure Helfert lucidly charts out in the introductory chapter. If this is old hat to you, and you've read Corp. Fin. by Brealy &amp; Meyers (sp?), maybe you don't need this book. All others: BUY IT!!!"},{"Title":"Techniques of financial analysis","review":"This may be a great book if you already know everything about finance. I've taken MBA level Finance courses, and quite honestly, I found this book difficult to understand. The author casually mentions financial concepts without defining them and expect you to understand complex financial theories he hasn't covered.I tried to do the questions at the end of each chapter, and while there is an answer guide, it does nothing to explain how the answer was derived. How you get the answer is the important part, but this text won't give you any assistance. Plus, some of the answers were just plain wrong (I checked with several experts).There are better texts out there - your time is better spent elsewhere."},{"Title":"Techniques of financial analysis","review":"If you read a financial text w/o checking the numbers, you wouldn't find the mistakes.

The ideal of democracy, while on the surface has an almost universal appeal, has never been able to inspire the desired attributes that are necessary to its maintenance, in the people it has embraced.This book, \\"DAMN-OCRACY\\", by Wendall Dennis, gives us a clear and concise historical examination of why the socio-political concept of democracy and the government it spawns unfailingly becomes its own worst enemy and lands its citizens in the tyranny of uncontrollable debt and totalitarian rule.Robert H. Brevig (Author of \\"BEYOND OUR CONSENT\\")"},{"Title":"Damn-ocracy-Government From Hell!: The Political, Economic and Money System After the Devil's Own Heart","review":"maybe there are wonderful insights here.

Their use of clashing patterns and brilliant color is one step away from a nervous breakdown. In a vigilent attempt to get press (and boy have they), they have masterminded an attention getting style that has kept them on the forefront of shelter magazines for two decades, yet they are clearly the laughing stock of thier peers.Pity they could not do something original AND liveable. Now that would have been brilliant."},{"Title":"Diamond Baratta Design","review":"I have clipped Diamond and Baratta pictures from magazines for years. But nothing prepared me for the arrival of their first book!As a decorative painter and homeowner who loves to decorate, this book is simply superb! I have more than 100 decorating books, and none of them compare to the joy, exuberance, and warmth that the Diamond and Baratta rooms exhibit. The colors are bright and happy, while the rooms themselves invite the reader in. There's enough inspiration going on to keep a person busy for months - with a museum's worth of pictures. The first few passes through the book are almost overwhelming. If you can't have a cup of coffee actually sitting in one of those gorgeous places, you can have one while looking at them! The layout, paper quality, and photography are superior. Oddly enough, I found the most understated and least exciting part of the entire book is the cover....it gives little clue to the wonders within.For a homeowner, collector, interior designer, or booklover - this is a great find! Highly recommmend!!"},{"Title":"Diamond Baratta Design","review":"I am floored by the interior design of Diamond Baratta and this book is filled with page after page of incredible rooms. Even if your own taste is more on the mild side--check out this book because it could very well convert you to bringing pizzazz and excitement into your own home. Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Diamond Baratta Design","review":"I waited for this book to publish after seeing some of their work in magazines-when you see their work you know it b/c of their precision to detail. To be honest-isn't that why you hire a decorator and honestly no one does it quite like these guys!!!Their pinks are VERY pink- yellows Very yellow but NO ONE does BLUE like these guys do BLUE and that is worth the price of admission!!!!!Enter their world you won't be disappointed!"},{"Title":"Diamond Baratta Design","review":"As the other reviewers have indicated, this is really a wonderful book.

Being a longtime braider it does my heart good to see Jan Jurta's great rugs showcased in such a fine manner. The colors and decor are exciting and let us know that braided rugs will fit in a lot of different venues and don't necessarily have to be dark and country.Recommended if you are planning an expensive redecorating project or if you're just dreaming you can afford it."},{"Title":"Diamond Baratta Design","review":"Basically Diamond Baratta Design is a lovely picture book - If you are a decorator or decorating your own home it can be a good source of inspiration or at least a few ideas .If just a fan of decorators it might disappoint as there is little substantive background information about their careers and philosophy. A good mate to this volume would be a book about Dorothy Draper as the Diamond Baretta team follow through on many of her ideas about color and scale."},{"Title":"Diamond Baratta Design","review":"These designers can wow you with their floors. They use a lot of painted floors, so you'll see a dining room with a Pennsylvania Dutch hex sign on it. There's another floor that periwinkle blue and stenciled with whales, lighthouses and mermaids.They are imaginative with rugs too. In Baratta's own apartment, she used menswear fabrics in a modern pattern of concentric squares for a rug.Although they go for dramatic affects with bold colors, they use white liberally with that. Lamps can be playful (an old leather fire bucket, a teapot, a metal coffee grinder). Be aware, though, that some homeowners might find it too bold.If you're looking for color ideas to free yourself from dull and bland, then these designers are for you."},{"Title":"Diamond Baratta Design","review":"This book was written by the designers themselves. After working together for twenty-five years they decided to create a selection of their favorite designs for publication. Their most telling comment was that it became apparent that each of the twenty four projects in this book reflect the clients personalities and passions. As they say: 'We think of our clients as partners and muses and see ourselves as interpreters of their dreams by listening very carefully to them.'Perhaps the most outstand characteristics of their designs that come through in project after project is the bold use of bright, often primary colors. Not long after that comes a spark of insight as they talk about things like the fabric or lamps or furniture that they had made for this or that project.All design is a matter of personal taste and desire. The Diamond Baratta designs are bold and striking, but as they say in the quote above, these are not for everyone. I have a hard time imagining some of these homes in a house with four or five kids.A very interesting book of bold designs that makes for a good idea book."},{"Title":"Diamond Baratta Design","review":"Great style and advice from Diamond and Baratta.

It is largely reminisces, but that is offset by the grandson's excellent editing notes that point out errors or give further details. There is some \\"man, we were good\\" attitude, but I believe that is understandable. I may rate Smithwick a slightly better read because of the humor and intelligence, but I felt this book gives a better overall picture of the time and situation."},{"Title":"Recollections of early Texas;: The memoirs of John Holland Jenkins","review":"What I expected. Good. Recollections of Early Texas. It meets with my approval. It was as advertised in your ad."},{"Title":"Recollections of early Texas;: The memoirs of John Holland Jenkins","review":"If you like Texas history you'll love this book.

He tells about the Texas Revolution plus just how life was for the early settlers during those early days."},{"Title":"A Real American Breakfast: The Best Meal of the Day, Any Time of the Day","review":"Most breakfast cookbooks are top-heavy with variations on the usual: lots of waffles, omelets, home fries, and muffins. This one is unique, because it collects a set of recipes you *wouldn't* have thought up on your own.For instance, it's the only book in which I've found a recipe for goldenrod eggs (hard boiled eggs in a cream sauce, served over toast, with grated egg yolks and paprika sprinkled on top) except for a 1942 WWII-era pamphlet my mom had. It's the only recipe I've found for dutch baby pancakes -- sort of a cross between a pancake and a sweetened popover, traditionally served with lemon and maybe a sprinkling of confectioner's sugar.Aside from completeness, the recipes are clearly written, entertaining (with sidebars that include breakfast menus from, say, a 1904 hotel menu), and educational.I have at least three or four breakfast cookbooks. This is the only one I use regularly."},{"Title":"A Real American Breakfast: The Best Meal of the Day, Any Time of the Day","review":"This cookbook has recipes from across America. It has recipes that are the old traditional such as pancakes and runs the gamut to recipes from various parts of the country.The recipes do not generally call for any out of the ordinary ingredients, they are easy to follow and the end results of every recipe I have tried turns out great.The pictures are lovely. The pages are uncluttered and easy to read. However, I particularly like that there are sidebars with interesting facts, menus from eating establishments say from the 1940's, etc. It makes for an interesting read as well as a nice cookbook.This is the cookbook I regularly turn to when picking out what I'm going to make for breakfast. It is well worth the money.Enjoy."},{"Title":"A Real American Breakfast: The Best Meal of the Day, Any Time of the Day","review":"I was pessimistic about this cookbook. I have been looking for an excellent breakfast cookbook for years with no luck, until now. It has the best recipes. I always want to try out pricy cookbooks so I admittedly went to my local Borders, borrowed two recipes and tried them. They were excellent. I even did the unthinkable, I made a recipe to serve at a breakfast meeting without trying it first. The overnight french toast was very different and fabulous, including the presentation idea.I highly recommend this book!"},{"Title":"A Real American Breakfast: The Best Meal of the Day, Any Time of the Day","review":"After stunning huevos rancheros this morning, I had to get online to tell you to read no further, click \\"add to cart\\" and start enjoying. This is a fabulous cookbook with a variety of recipes which are easy to follow. The book itself is in a format which also makes it great for browsing and picking up ideas to incorporate in the breakfasts you have already perfected.

It was on Food and Wine Magazine's 25 best list a couple of years ago, and it's full of all kinds of breakfast delicacies, both familiar and unusual.Breakfast (the American way at least) is an interesting meal, as it's appropriate any time of day -- the buzz created in September '06 by McDonalds' consideration of serving breakfast all day shows that much. The Jamisons take full advantage of that, starting out with the San Francisco classic Joe's Special (a spinach, hamburger, and egg scramble) and branching out into dishes with both wide appeal (waffles and corned beef hash) and strong ethnic and regional associations (including the much-loved grits and the much-dreaded scrapple and menudo). There are numerous variations on some themes as well -- pancakes include basic buttermilk pancakes, chuckwagon-style sourdough pancakes, big puffy Dutch baby pancakes, and even silver dollar pancakes (a long, long stack of which decorates the spine of the book). Hashes go from basic corned beef to fish, poultry, and even mushroom-based. There is even an entire section on baked goods such as biscuits, muffins, and doughnuts.Books on breakfast are hard to find for some reason -- it's possible to get a very good idea of what a culture eats for lunch and dinner from a good ethnic cookbook, but breakfast seems to be left out in a great many of them; as a general rule, I believe that if you find a good breakfast book, you should buy it, as there aren't that many out there. Overall, this book is a good breakfast book -- a remarkable tour of the breakfast habits of Americans, with a bounty of interesting and unusual recipes. Anyone who likes to cook breakfast -- at any time of the day -- should have this book."},{"Title":"A Real American Breakfast: The Best Meal of the Day, Any Time of the Day","review":"&quot;A Real American Breakfast&quot; is also a Real cookbook.

Anyone who loves making good food and especially anyone who enjoys making breakfast at home must have this book. It's perfect for eating a quiet meal at home for two, for making a nice breakfast to share with your children before school (we use a lot of the cereal recipes and fruit recipes for weekdays), for impressing overnight guests, and it is so good it should be a staple in every B&B.

This brings you back to a time in our lives when we ate breakfast as a family instead of a fast food drive through. Those smells that you used to wake up too seem to resonate from the pages. The recipes have been good for me to get my family together for those week end breakfasts once again. Also, we have week end guests quiet often and it is so nice to have such a variety of recipes to choose from vs the usual breakfast stand bys.

The other regions of the US are not neglected and then there are the surprises, meals I'd never dream of but are quite wonderful.

Also, unless you have at least a bit of experience, I can imagine it would be frustrating and time intensive.

They fostered over 400 adopted children and now enjoy their grand children in their early retirement. This book provides tools that will help Parents and others to better control the negative feelings that accompany caring for a child.As a parent we are to provide for our children, give them shelter and make them feel safe. It's sad to say that often times I see in the public arena the physical and emotional turmoil on today's young children left by parents.The secret to raising happy kids is to be a happy adult. Katherine teaches us how to build our emotional fitness/intelligence. The topics she includes;* feeling awareness* self soothing* distracting* focusing on what is important* disputing* giving feedback* proper expression of feelings* acceptance* radical acceptanceKatherine shares her true stories of how she really felt when she stayed up all night with her sick baby. She explains in detail, and as hard as it may sound, most parents I think go though rough patches with their children making it harder on ourselves which in turn makes it harder on the child. In her first lesson Katherine teaches us the emotional fitness skills are as follows;* recognizing the start of a feeling* measuring the growth of the feelings* calming the body when a feeling threatens to overwhelm* changing the flow of negative feelings when that is possible* Deciding what needs acting on* Accepting and living with negative feelings when changing them is not possibleThis is one novel to keep and pass along to your family. I could not read it in one sitting. At 178 pages I realized that working the exercises are the keep to keeping emotions under constant and consistent control. She teaches us how to properly breathe to release tensing in our bodies. I tried the exercise and to my surprise, it works! So this tension releasing can be used daily for many individuals who suffer from anxious thoughts as well as parents with testing children.One thing I learned that I want to share with each reader today is that feelings begin when something arouses your interest. They are caused by external events like thunder or lightening. Then there are Physiological arousals, like being tired or hungry which form inside our body because of our body's physical state. Then we have thoughts which are caused by both internal and external events that arouse a person. Katherine teaches us how to understand each of these to manage our feelings before they lost control or have control over us. Wow, this is not so hard to absorb and maintain.If you are a parent to be this is a Must Buy book to help you with your future as a parent. If you are a parent of children Katherine is the founder of Emotional Fitness training, Inc. She has 12 years experience as a foster parent, and over 30 years experience in social work and counseling. I am glad I pick up a copy of her book for when I become a gamma. I wish I had this book when my own daughter was a baby as it would of helped me stay calm and be a better parent.2012 written by Jackie Paulson"},{"Title":"Diamond Hunters","review":"I am a huge Wilbur Smith fan. &quot;River God&quot; is the best novel I have ever read. My second favorite Smith book is his newest: &quot;Monsoon&quot;, 3 &quot;Men of Men&quot;, 4 &quot;The Sunbird&quot;, 5 &quot;Golden Fox&quot;, 6 &quot;Burning Shore&quot;, 7 &quot;The Diamond Hunters&quot;. If you have read all the Wilbur Smith books like I have, you'll yearn for more, but it takes him years to come up with a new book these days. You might look at &quot;Churchill's Gold&quot; by James Follett after you have read all of Mr. Smith's books. It is very similar in style and quality to &quot;The Diamond Hunters&quot;."},{"Title":"Diamond Hunters","review":"THE DIAMOND HUNTERS revolves around the mining of beach and offshore deposits for diamonds, and the rivalry and jealousy of two \\"brothers\\" involved in this mining. The detailed and accurately depicted diamond mining methods described will be unfamiliar and informative to most readers. In my opinion, the plot is a bit more complex than it could be, and characters could be filled-in a little more, and more numerous and more detailed descriptive passages would have been appreciated. Even so, THE DIAMOND HUNTERS is a good read.WILBER SMITH NOVELSWilber Smith's novels are characterized by hard edged characters in harsh, unforgiving environments and situations, against implacable foes. When one of Smith's \\"heros\\" succeeds, his victory is usually pyrrhic-as is often the case in the real world. This gritty pioneer mentality is appropriate to South Africa.I imagine that many readers will conclude that many of the characters in Smith's novels lack dimension. But that's a failure of people, not of the author. There ARE nasty, vengeful people in the world who are NOT complex, and Smith describes such people accurately. Smith does not attempt to explain such people-which I appreciate (in contrast with most modern novels filled with dreary shallow pop-psychology). Smith's heros are men who manage to exceed the sum of their heredity and environment-as is often the case in the real world."},{"Title":"Diamond Hunters","review":"i have read all of Wilbur's books and found that one learns a lot about Africa (with a few exceptions). you learn african history, economics, social problems, environmental problems, natural history, etc. in this one, you learn about the diamond industry and the history of the Namibian diamond coasts, while Wilbur weaves it into his &quot;unputdownable&quot; story. kind of like the Master of the Game with substance. for an even better look at Namibian history, try the Burning Shore."},{"Title":"Diamond Hunters","review":"I have seen Wilbur Smith novels on the bookshelves for years but for one reason or another none of them had ever really piqued my interest, but while browsing in an airport bookstore looking for something to read on a long flight I picked this one up and as I began to read I found that my flight was too short. I didn't want to be interrupted for something as trivial as changing flights. I intend to read more Wilbur Smith in the near future.The way Smith builds the story of Johnny Lance being an outcast and the way that he discovers the truth about his childhood and the animosity that builds between him and his foster brother Benedict Van der Byle makes for a spellbinding read. Smith's descriptions of the African landscape and exotic locations are well written without being over-done. When he describes Thunderbolt and Suicide you can smell the salt air and see the foamy spray shooting skyward and hear the crashing of the huge waves against the unyielding rock formations.Like all fiction stories this one is not for everyone, but if you enjoy action/adventure, emphasis on action you will find this a very enjoyable read."},{"Title":"Diamond Hunters","review":"The descriptions of diamond mining and sorting are as good as it gets. An updated version would be Robinson's, Sapphire Sea, set in Madagascar."},{"Title":"Diamond Hunters","review":"This book is one of Smith's early books - originally published in the mid-70's, I think, and anyone who's read a lot of Wilbur Smith (like me) will be able to tell. It's shorter, and he's definitely refined his writing style since then. However, his talent for plot twists, engaging characters and sucking you right into the story is still there - I loved this book! It is well worth it for anyone who likes a rip-roaring adventure!"},{"Title":"Diamond Hunters","review":"This book is one of Wilbur Smith's early books and it shows.After reading his books set in ancient Egypt, I bought this thinking it would be a good read. He spent too much time on the relationships and too little time on the meat of the story which should have been the search for the elusive diamonds. I was able to finish it but was very disappointed particularly with the ending. It was as if he ran out of steam or got into a hurry. The ending in the book just left you wishing that he would have given you a little more to tie up the loose ends. Not a bad book but, not a great one either."},{"Title":"Diamond Hunters","review":"Wilbur Smith just proves how good he is this is a must read book with characteristics of betrayal and loyalty coming into the fray.The ending was not finished strongly but never the less another work of art by Wilbur Smith"},{"Title":"Diamond Hunters","review":"This novel was written over 30 years ago. It is not as polished as his newer books but it contains all the elements that make Smith one of the masters of action and adventure. Exotic locale, unforgettable characters and a prose that takes you \`there'.Let Wilbur take you to a trip to Africa, you will be coming back for more."},{"Title":"Diamond Hunters","review":"Terminally boring and predictable but was able to finish it. I would rate his Monsoon and the early Courtney triliogy as 4-5 stars."},{"Title":"Diamond Hunters","review":"This book falls in the bottom five of the 28 books that I have read by Wilbur Smith. There is no review of the African continent that is so prevalent in his other books. No intermingling of the diverse peoples that populate this country that you find in most of these books. Here there is nothing here but greed and sex without purpose and typical family squabbles.To my knowledge diamond mining has never been done in this fashion in Africa."},{"Title":"Diamond Hunters","review":"This is a great book. I read a lot of adventure fiction. This one was really good. The plot was well thought out. The details are great. The building of the characters.... Everything about this book is good."},{"Title":"Diamond Hunters","review":"Wilbur Smith is my favorite author, but I was disappointed in this book. It appeared to be written hastily and without the wonderful descriptive phrases he normally uses to paint his stories background. Never the less I still read it cover to cover."},{"Title":"Diamond Hunters","review":"Wilbur Smith is a master story teller. He can convey a sense of time and place like no other. This is not a historical novel, but could be one. If you wanted to know how diamond prospection was at these wild times in Africa, no need to go further. Smith's characters are both deep and simple, like real human beings driven by simple overpowering emotions like hate, love and revenge. Wilbur stories usually cover more than one generation and it gives his sories a sense of reality seldom achieved. This book is classic Wilbur Smith: thrilling, entertaining and educating."},{"Title":"Diamond Hunters","review":"I THINK THAT WILBER SMITH IS A FANTASTIC WRITER, EVERY PAGE FILLED FROM TOP TO BOTTOM WITH HIS STORYS. A GREAT WRITER THAT TELLS A STORY THAT IS COMPELLING, HISTORICAL FACTS AND BREATHTAKING ADVENTURE. I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO READING EACH OF HIS BOOKS.

Mark Ryan's mathematic expertise coupled with a desire to help others is evident as he offers refreshing instruction to those of us with rusty math skill. Subtle humor splashed the pages while I learned to tackle seemingly complex situations involving math in my daily life. Never again will I fear helping children with math homework, nor will I avoid conversations involving finance or insurance. I might have overlooked it had I not been led to it during a math course, and for that I'm grateful, because it will hold center stage in my library from now on and should be the math book of choice for any average person as an invaluable resource of basic formulas and fundamental math concepts. Compared to other math books I've look through, this one is the easiest to read and follow. My conclusion is that everyone should have had a math instructor like Mr. Ryan. Owning his book is the next best thing."},{"Title":"Everyday Math for Everyday Life: A Handbook for When It Just Doesn't Add Up","review":"This book is great. I was shopping around for a basic math book for my wife, who recently got a management position, and stumbled across Everyday Math for Everyday Life. Most of the other book choices were just pages and pages of numbers, but Mr. Ryan does a wonderful job of putting the numbers into readable and understandable words. It is also well organized and clearly indexed. Now, the book is not only on my wife's desk, but I bought another copy for our reference shelf at home. I found the practical examples and explanations so well put that I expect to use Everyday Math as a resource to help my two school age children with their homework."},{"Title":"Everyday Math for Everyday Life: A Handbook for When It Just Doesn't Add Up","review":"I wish I had this book when I was in 5th and 7th grade. I'm not good at math. In fact I have listed on my lifetime things to do list, be good at math. Mark Ryan's book Everyday Math for Everyday Life... is helping me in a big way to reach that goal. I like the approach that the author takes. He's not just telling you how to work a math problem, he's also explains why the process works and in some cases he addresses common mistakes made when trying to solve problems.

He went well out of his way to make this book simultaneously entertaining and enlightening. The book is obviously geared toward those who aren't math-oriented, but it would be a welcome addition to a math-lover's collection as well. Someone who has enjoyed John Allen Paulos's books &quot;Immumeracy&quot; and &quot;A Mathematician Reads the Newspaper,&quot; would definately appreciate this too."},{"Title":"Everyday Math for Everyday Life: A Handbook for When It Just Doesn't Add Up","review":"My order arrived very quickly.

Unauthorized Train Stories","review":"As a newly hired conductor with a western railroad, I purchased this book to get some more insight on my new job. The stories that Mr. Lothridge tells are entertaining and great examples of the good and bad of railroading - however, I unfortuntately have to say that the book is filled with grammatical, spelling, and other errors. I seemed to find some type of error on every page, and it does take something away from the book.Mr. Lothridge's writing, while mostly detailed and precise, sometimes jumps all over the place, and makes a general assumption that the reader has a fairly good knowledge of railroads before picking up the book.The first chapter of the book describes the history of railroading in the United States, but doesn't go into enough details about the railroads that Mr. Lothridge worked for.Even with all of the editing problems, this is a book that I would recommend for the content."},{"Title":"A Conductor Tells... Unauthorized Train Stories","review":"I expected a lot from this book, based on earlier reviews. While the stories are moderately enjoyable, the book as a whole is spoiled by an average of one error of spelling, grammar, or usage per page."},{"Title":"A Conductor Tells... Unauthorized Train Stories","review":"Mr Lothridge has some good stories about his experiences on the railroad but my enjoyment of this somewhat short book was runined by his poor writing. Along with spelling and grammar errors throughout, he has a tendency to wander in his storytelling in a most annoying way. What's needed here is a good ghost writer. Having said that, the short stories are interesting but I don't think the book is worth the price."},{"Title":"Two Steps Forward, No Steps Back: Why the Left Isn't Right for America","review":"Mr Richey's collection of musings, epigrams and witticisms has something for everyone. While Mr. Richey's political leanings are definitely to the right, if you are an objective thinker, you will appreciate this book. His rhetorical questions should cause all who read the book to pause and think about the condition of our society. His writings are reflective of a person who has read everything from Aristotle to Thomas Sowell and has touched all points in between. Mr. Richey is obviously a fan of Ayn Rand having read \\"Atlas Shrugged\\" nine times. He also quotes freely from her writings. If nothing else, his writings will cause you to have a dictionary by your side. Be careful though, he will trick you with some of his word play."},{"Title":"Two Steps Forward, No Steps Back: Why the Left Isn't Right for America","review":"Very well written book offers a great deal of food for thought. While I tend to lean a little closer to the center, I found Mr. Richey's musings extremely refreshing and genuinely entertaining.I do however take exception for the continuing trend of the white washing of the Reagan years (let's not forget the national debt tripled under Reagan, eventually quadrupling during the senior Bush's administration. Not to mention the Iran-Contra scandal, also not to mention the Savings and Loan scandal which is to date the largest theft in documented World history, etc...) The ever popular Clinton bashing, (hey didn't he fix the majority of those debt problems left by his predecessors mentioned in the last statement...) Oh that's right, he had an affair in the White House. Never mind, apparently that cancels out all of his validity and achievements. Be rest assured America, that no one is having sex in the White House during this administration! The republican collective conscience always tends to forget or choose to ignore their scandals.This book will make you reflect on America's triumphs and shortcomings. Our current U.S. leaders should aspire to be as well read and articulate as Mr. Richey."},{"Title":"Two Steps Forward, No Steps Back: Why the Left Isn't Right for America","review":"How well do you think you know the ancient philosophers.

It will challenge the amount of information you think you possess for everything from ancient philosophy through the Renaissance to modern politics and pop culture. I found myself constantly checking to see exactly who it was Mr. Richey was quoting because I had never heard of the person. Or I found myself checking historical facts regarding a person or event that I thought I knew all about. This is a book that will challenge not how smart you think are, but how much you think you understand about what you know. It will challenge you to think about why our society seems to be going down the drain, and what we might do to slow or stop the spiral. There is definitely a conservative slant to Mr. Richey's writings, but it is hard to disagree with his arguments.

It is packed full of facts, graphs, and explanations. One problem I did find in this book is that it tried cover too broad a field. If it would have concentrated on one specific topic like the international economics, and left out the finance, it could be a much stronger work. I grew tired of hearing &quot;as you already know...&quot; It could have not made so many assumtions about what students already knew and used the extra area to cover them. All in all, it was a helpful resource for extra learning, however, I would suggest looking further for a book that will stand alone in teaching an international economics course."},{"Title":"International economics","review":"This book could be really good if you just need it to reference information that you may need for a research project.

It was written at a time of heightened awareness of the importance of science education in the U.S. when the Russians beat us into space with Sputnik and also with Yuri Gagarin, the first man into space. Today with the Russians now emerging capitalists and the U.S. having won the Cold War, it's hard to imagine the anxiety and fear that those events inspired over here, along with the related concern that the Russians were also leading us in science and math education. And in fact, they were and oddly enough in some ways still do.This amazing series came out of that climate. With beautiful photo essays and extremely well written text by top science and nature writers there was nothing like it for the young reader at the time. It was also a time when companies like Time and Life were still powerhouses in the publishing industry and had the resources to undertake large projects like this. This volume by Arthur Beiser, a geology professor who could write for a lay audience, was one of my favorites. Although written before plate tectonics became accepted, it's still a fine introduction to many aspects of geology, including structural geology and landforms, the internal structure of the earth, historical geology, basic rocks and minerals, marine geology, vulcanology, and other topics. Although intended for younger readers at the time, don't let that mislead you as it assumes a level of scientific literacy that no longer exists these days even among adults in the U.S. anymore, as another reviewer here already observed."},{"Title":"The Earth","review":"The Earth is one of twenty-five volumes in the Life Nature Library. Published by Time-Life books in the 1960s, this series portrays the many aspects of the natural world. Though obviously dated (it was written before the coining of the term plate tectonics), The Earth is still a good, basic introduction to geology. Topics covered include the Earth in space, internal structure of the Earth, the atmosphere, earthquakes, erosion, fossils, types of rocks, geologic history, and the future of the Earth. The book also describes theories which attempt to explain natural climate change. I did like this book, but at times I felt as if I was reading one of my geology textbooks from college. Nevertheless, The Earth is an ideal book for one who desires a basic introduction to the many facets of our fascinating planet."},{"Title":"FRANK SINATRA : A CELEBRATION","review":"Derek Jewell's style of writing may be appealing to some, but to me he leaves much to be desired.Pros:-Almost no detail was overlooked-1/4 of the book is an index-useful for book reports-well arrangedCons:-Written in a breathy style where there is no good place to stop-hard to concentrate on, hard to keep reading-facts were boring-could have used more opinions or quotes-hard to pick out information for projects-small print"},{"Title":"FRANK SINATRA : A CELEBRATION","review":"This is an interesting way to spend some idle time.

What an incredible disappointment 'Amazon' turned out to be. The novel seemed to be written at the level of a young reader. The story line was flat and unexciting. The book dragged on and on, frequently repetitive and completely lacking credibility. As others have mentioned, the book was loaded with misspellings and words out of context.

I thoroughly enjoyed the Amazon setting and the way MacGregor weaves the mythos of the ghost tribe throughout the story. The characters are great, the plot moves. As for the complaints about being duped into believing that Benchley wrote the book, I don't get it. The TV show is called Peter Benchley's Amazon; I assume that's why that title is on the cover. MacGregor's name is on the spine and the title page, in letters large enough for just about anyone who picks up the book to see it.

I was spellbound by it. It's an easy read, the characters were great. I got mad, sad, happy, and frustrated with all of them. I found myself saying &quot;Oh, puhleese!&quot; with some of the First Elder Malachi's actions and words, let alone Nathan, oh man!I'm glad that the author didn't use the language normally used in the period of 1627, because the book wouldn't be as easy to read.

It is populated with cardboard characters(including an impossible, improbable villain,) who struggle through an episodic, pointless plot. Even the editing is poor--typos abound; the point seemed to be get this on the stands ASAP (and the lurid cover seemed designed to capitalize on Benchley's &lt;Jaws&gt; fame, even though this book has virtually nothing in common with that well-done thriller).

I picked up the novel at the recommendation of the author, whom I correspond with. I didn't know what to expect, but I was not to be disappointed!Amazon rings with the same trailblazing spirit of adventure and intrigue as MacGregor's Indiana Jones novels, particularly Seven Veils. From the very beginning, Amazon is filled with interesting characters, situations, and unexpected events. After being shipwrecked off the coast of South America, a group of English Puritans find themselves at the mercy of the elements. They are driven into the Amazon jungle by bloodthirsty pirates, who have kidnapped the daughter of the First Elder. Her new husband Jacob, a headstrong man, though not a Puritan, sets out to rescue the woman he loves.So begins a tale that will ultimately span twenty-six years. The remaining survivors venture further into the treacherous rainforest, a place which conspires to kill anyone who enters. They are torn by the beliefs of the Reverend Malachi, who strictly enforces their Puritan ways, and is convinced that they are in the devil's realm; and by Jacob, who has befriended a native boy, wise in the lore of the jungle and a student of the Medicine Way. He teaches Jacob the skills necessary to survive in the jungle. Jacob in turn, tries to convince the pilgrims that they can survive if they adopt the native ways.This puts him at odds with reverend Malachi, who thinks that Jacob's dealings with the natives will be their downfall. The remainder of the novel centers around the Puritans trying to make a new home in the jungle, while defending themselves from hostile native tribes intent on destroying the intruders. But unbeknownst to them, the greatest enemy lies within.For gripping, non-stop drama and adventure, Amazon is sure to please. The author, an explorer and adventurer in his own right, is in top form here. Writing from experience, he offers a realistic, eye-opening look at one of the most inhospitable places on earth. It is a story of the most basic human instinct: survival.If you liked Seven Veils, then I highly recommend Amazon: The Ghost Tribe.Also check out MacGregor's other Indiana Jones novels which, in my opinion, are some of the greatest stories ever written. MacGregor is must-have reading."},{"Title":"Peter Benchley's Amazon: The Ghost Tribe","review":"In spite of the fact that I never got to see the TV series, Peter Benchely's Amazon, I thoroughly enjoyed reading The Ghost Tribe. As a long time fan of Rob MacGregor's work, I was not surprised that this book kept me turning pages well into the night. The author draws on his considerable knowledge of the Amazon Rain Forest, its native tribes, and their Shamanistic practices in order to weave an unforgettably dramatic tale of the battles waged against the jungle by the pilgrim survivors of a brutal shipwreck in 1627. I highly recommend this book to everyone who loves a good yarn of love, hate, friendship, adventure, magic, and salvation."},{"Title":"Peter Benchley's Amazon: The Ghost Tribe","review":"What can you say about an author who thinks characters in 1627 employed modern slang such as, &quot;Okay,&quot; in dialogue? I expected to turn a page and hear the hero saying, &quot;Way cool,&quot; and &quot;Far Out,&quot; next. Aside from that glaring glitch, the characters are cardboard, thin and mechanical, and the plot is just a repetition of the same incident over and over again with slight variations. Marketing is also deceptive--the cut-out cover only reveals &quot;Peter Benchley's AMAZON,&quot; and only when you look inside do you see Rob MacGregor's name. Back copy also leads the reader to believe the book will include what happens when a new group of people lost in the jungle will encounter the descendants of the original shipwrecked Puritans 300 years later. Not so. It's a series, in which nothing much but drug-induced &quot;magic&quot; and &quot;narrow&quot; escapes from tiresomely similar enemies happens throughout, with no mention of the encounter in the future. A very bad book with misleading cover copy."},{"Title":"Peter Benchley's Amazon: The Ghost Tribe","review":"'Revolvers ?' The year is 1627 and they have revolvers ?

There is enough history in it that one can make their own deductions, and still have room for some mysticism. Also, it has no gratuitous violence, sex, or profanity which makes it a rare gem.

It certainly kept me coming back to it and I found it hard to put down. Very few books that weave that kind of spell on me. At close to 400-pages in length, I finished the book in a few weeks--fast for me.I recommend this book to anyone who includes a clean read: very little (if any) profanity, the violence is relatively non-gratuitous, and the sex mostly discreet (this is not a Romance novel.)

As a big fan of Peter Benchley's works, I was excited when I found what i thought was a new title from him, and featuring the man-v-nature genre no less, my favorite, oh goody! When i started reading it, however, i was struck by a feeling of \\"sumthin aint' right here...\\" It just didn't \\"feel\\" like Benchley. i looked online for information on the book, and was surprised to find it missing from any list of Benchley's novels. just by chance i set the book on the side of the desk to search, and happened to glance over and see the name \\"Rob Macgreggor\\" on the spine. this led me here, and I wanted to add my name to the list. Yes it's my own fault for not seeing the name before i bought the book, but who would expect something with \\"Peter Benchley\\" -or any author's name, for that matter- prominently on the cover, above the apparent title, to not actually be by Peter Benchley(not to mention the cutout in the cover art, just like the PB cover of \\"White Shark,\\")? I rather doubt this is accidental, and it ticks me off either way. this is the kind of shenanigans I expect from wave-riding movie studios(you know, the ones responsible for titles like \\"Terminators,\\" One-hundred-million BC,\\" or \\"Relative Evil\\" printed in fonts very similar to the \\"inspiration\\"), not book publishers. MacGregor should be on the front cover. don't get me wrong; there's nothing intrinsically wrong with a book based on another's work if the original author gives the OK, but here i feel like they went out of their way to NOT make it clear that this was the case."},{"Title":"Peter Benchley's Amazon: The Ghost Tribe","review":"Not what I had hoped for. The story lacked development, not to mention an ending. The book ends like MacGregor just got tired of writing, ran out of paper, said &quot;oh well, I guess I'll end it here&quot;.

Like most children I saw the angel topping our beautiful green Christmas tree and saw my mothers ornamental nativity scene. But I had no idea what it was for.

From the young infant born in Bethlehem to the visiter's to His crib of hay. Children are getting a strong foundation and the proper realization of Christmas. There is a reason why Christmas is my favorite holiday. It isn't how family comes together, nor chestnuts roasting on an open fire. It is the birth of Jesus Christ. It is knowing that a miracle happend and our King was born. Your children can learn at a younger age and see with beautiful illistrations in this book, just what happend in Bethlehem those many years ago.

The new 2004 edition of Terrorism: Opposing Viewpoints contains twenty-five short articles and essays addressing central tenets of terrorism and the war against it. I decided to read this book after noticing the inclusion of an article by Noam Chomsky; given the fact that Chomsky is exceedingly anti-America and anti-Israel, I felt compelled to know just what this book (and others like it) might be teaching our children. I found a number of good things in these pages, but I also noticed several problems (including a small but significant bias toward the liberal viewpoint).I would have thought it needless to say that this book does not feature arguments for and against terrorism; unfortunately, Chomsky's typical screed is all but pro-terrorist and, much to my surprise, the book actually contains one essay that originates with Hamas itself. I have no problem with essays seeking to explain or even defend Hamas, but I personally don't think propaganda taken directly from a terrorist organization belongs anywhere near this book - especially when there is no counter-balancing article or essay reflecting the views of the Israeli or American governments.Most of the issues are addressed in pairs and set the framework for honest debate, but a couple of articles stand alone in their argument, which I have to chalk up as a negative. The book begins by posing a seemingly nonsensical question, namely whether terrorism is an actual threat. Paul Bremer and John Ashcroft do a good job encapsulating the seriousness of the threat, while other contributors argue that the threat has been exaggerated. (Chomsky, of course, contends that the U.S. and Israel are the only two terrorist groups or nations in the entire world.) The debate then turns to the origins of terrorism: whether Islam itself, economic conditions, and/or the Israel-Palestine situation encourage terrorism. The next item on the agenda is America's proper response to terrorism, which gives us pro and con articles on the Patriot Act (which is never given an adequate description), racial profiling, and immigration restrictions. Finally, the proper response of the international community to terrorism is addressed, with contributors arguing the merits of UN leadership, military action, and the brokering of a peace deal between Israel and the Palestinians.For the most part, Terrorism: Opposing Viewpoints can serve as a decent starting point for youngsters coming to terms with the threat of terrorism or those who wish to get a better feel for the debate - but only in conjunction with other sources of information. Each article is rather short (3 to 8 pages or so), so there is not a great deal of detail included. I see a major weakness here, as what you get is debate in the absence of the basic facts you need to know about the issues. I do believe there is a discernible amount of liberal bias overall in the selections chosen by the editor, as well (particularly in terms of the views expressed about Israel). As a result, I cannot really recommend this book in good conscience, especially to young people, unless it is complemented by other sources of information and debate."},{"Title":"Targeted : The Blade Brothers of Cougar County (Harlequin Intrigue No. 901) (Intrigue)","review":"Targeted by Lori L.

By follwing the detailed analysis that Cheri brings from her many years of experience, one can see the kinetic breakdown of the pitching motion in step by step form. I have picked up many ideas and pointers to use with my daughter, and I would highly recommend this book to anyone serious about the proper mechanics of fastpitch softball pitching."},{"Title":"The Softball Pitching Edge","review":"Cheri Kempf has written a fine book for the established female pitcher. She also makes a few attempts to relate her wisdom to the coaching of the beginner, but that is where I find this book most lacking. My daughter just began pitching this year, and I'm really searching for something that gives instruction from day one. Kempf gives numerous drills that are wonderful for correcting mistakes in the established pitcher's form, but I just felt that it lacked the beginning steps that I was looking for.While the book did correct a number of things that my daughter had been taught--like worrying about \\"opening the gate and closing the gate\\" with the hips, which Kempf says is worthless and can lead to knee injuries--I wanted more for the beginner. However, if you, your daughter or a girl you coach IS an established pitcher who is looking to correct bad habits, learn new pitches, learn how to mentally prepare for games and the like, I doubt there is a better book out there. It just didn't fill all of my needs.One thing in an earlier review that I must comment on: why on Earth would someone criticize this book because there is a picture of Amanda Freed on the cover? There are also pictures of Michelle Smith and Lisa Fernandez within the book which are put there to give the reader an idea of correct form. Do I know what Kempf's connection is to any of these women? No, but I do know that those photos could not have been used without permission from each woman. The women concerned obviously don't have a problem with their likenesses being used in the book, so how could anyone else complain about it?"},{"Title":"The Softball Pitching Edge","review":"We love this book. We borrowed it from the library twice before finally purchasing. Its the best step by step coaching book we've found.

We highly recommend this book to any aspiring pitcher!"},{"Title":"The Softball Pitching Edge","review":"\\"The Softball Pitching Edge\\" is simply the best Fastpitch softball pitching book, ever. The first four chapters (\\"Pre-Motion Presentation\\", \\"Feet and Legs\\", \\"Arms and Posture\\", and \\"Timing of the Motion\\") set the beginning pitcher (and her parents) on her way by detailing and developing sound mechanics. The rest of the book is a fantastic resource for the intermediate or advanced pitcher and any fastpitch softball coach, teaching the mechanics, grips and body position required for pitching the drop, the change-up, the rise, the curve, and the screwball. It concludes with a section titled \\"Five more Factors for Excellent Pitching\\" which cover the importance of the catcher, practice routines and game preparation, mental makeup, physical conditioning, and communication. In short, it covers anything that could possibly be required to instruct a Fastpitch softball pitcher.There is so much that this book offers that it is difficult to narrow down exactly the one thing it does best. The chapters on mechanics go through every single part of the motion of a straight fastball pitch. Not only does it offer detailed explanations on the \\"why\\", but it also dispels common misconceptions about pitching. One example is why the adage \\"open the door, close the door\\" is the wrong approach for pitchers. I have heard \\"open the door, close the door\\" since I started coaching, but I am now convinced that the author is correct, and will incorporate this knowledge into my own teaching.Each chapter has multiple drills that reinforce the correct mechanics discussed. Even more helpful are the \\"Catching Common Errors\\" sub-chapters, which help a coach diagnose problems and identify which drills will help correct those problems. There are also hundreds of detailed pictures so that the reader can see and understand each and every movement and grip.This is also one of the few softball books I have seen that advocates the use of videoing practice. Better yet, this is the only softball book that I know of that shows you exactly how to conduct a video analysis of a pitcher. This book is worth every penny just for this information alone (pages 52 to 54).Finally, it not only teaches the mechanics of pitching, but also how to pitch -- specifically how to locate pitches inside and outside the strike zone, where the catcher should be positioned, and the movement one can expect on various different pitches. This is invaluable information for pitchers, catchers, and coaches alike.\\"The Softball Pitching Edge\\" is a must-buy if you are a Fastpitch softball coach at any level, a parent of a pitcher at any but the highest level, or a pitcher herself who wants to get better."},{"Title":"The Softball Pitching Edge","review":"This is an excellent resource for the serious softball pitcher.

They are jam-packed with a great mix of pictures in good proportion which show the morphing of fashions over the decade(s). Dominant are women's clothing (formal, casual, dresses, hats, coats, shoes, with some undergarments, sportswear, nightwear, swimwear). Then there are smatterings of accessories (handbags, watches, gloves, powder compacts, belts, jewelry). Also some menswear and a small amount of childrenswear. All clothing is being worn.All pictures are black and white and have a certain (pleasant) level of graininess. What you get are the original pictures, prices and descriptions from the catalogs. There is only a very small amount of introductory material (just a one page 'Publisher's Note' for the Thirties).Changes over the series:The transition from drawings (all very good and realistic) to photos occurs in the Thirties.The variety of accessories appearing in the Twenties is largely reduced by the later decades (Fifties almost exclusively clothing and hats with some shoes).There's only one problem with these catalogs...you can't order the contents!"},{"Title":"Everyday Fashions of the Thirties As Pictured in Sears Catalogs (Dover Fashion and Costumes)","review":"This book gives a good look at what the Sears catalog offered in the way of women's fashions in the thirties.

They all seemed to indicate a well sampled view of 1930's fashion in general, of men, women and children, so obviously I was eager to purchase the book.When I finally got it I was disappointed to see that this book did not provide fashions of the general 1930's populace, but rather concentrated mainly on women's fashions. There were only a few pages dedicated to men's clothes and I was especially surprised to see how much the book lacked in portraying men's suits. So as for for portraying a good view of what people wore in the 1930's I'd say the book was inadequate.If you're into learning mainly about 1930's women's fashion, then go ahead and purchase this, but if you are really interested in a more detailed portrayal of what the whole population in general wore in those times then you are better off buying a vintage Sears catalog on ebay."},{"Title":"Everyday Fashions of the Thirties As Pictured in Sears Catalogs (Dover Fashion and Costumes)","review":"Wonderful book, gives an authentic overview of the way people dressed in the 1930's.

Modern fashion tends to look \\"dumbed down\\". I've owned this book for some time and refer to it often. Not to copy, necessarily; but to find inspiration. There are clothes available that still look \\"classic\\". Many of the original Sears pictures were in color but are reproduced here in b&w. Many of the reproductions have an overly fuzzy look. I suppose that's why the book is only $15 instead of 2 or 3 times as much. The Schiffer Sears series has sharp color images but you pay twice as much. You could buy the original Sears catalogs on eBay (I have a few) for even more. Your choice. This book will give you a good overview of the fashion changes during the decade and you can take it from there. Also of note are the accessories. A New Deal/FDR watch! A Buck Rogers watch!

These handsome illustrations--a mix of cuts, engravings, pen-and-ink drawings, and photographs--and their accompanying descriptions show how. Models of all ages and both genders display not-unattractive dresses (ranging in length from just-over-the-kneecap to ankle), hats (some of fantastic shape), undergarments, accessories and jewelry, gents' suits, sweaters, children's school- and playwear, \\"daytime frocks,\\" knickers and cotton overalls for informal female wear, infants' clothes, a page of dashing brightly-patterned scarves, uniforms for nurses, maids, and waitresses, shoes, formalwear (ballroom dancing was widely popular in the 30's), sports clothing, cloth and even fur coats. Indeed, several of the young male models are shown wearing wide-legged trousers not unlike the floppy \\"Oxford bags\\" of the previous decade.

Powys's novel inspired by the Hell in Dante's Divina Commedia, exposes the all too familiar and still very actual excuses and justifications of violence and torture for religious, political and scientific reasons.In his hell, religion is represented by Calvin, the bigot of Predestination, and by the great Inquisitor Torquemada, for whom torture is necessary to save human souls: better torture the whole human race than loose one human soul.The Roman emperor Nero represents statesmen, for whom individual lives are unimportant. They \`torture in their prisons and plunge whole nations into the anguish of war.'But worst of all are those who torture for the sake of scientific knowledge (like vivisectors) and who justify their practises by stressing that they are looking for remedies to prolong human life. Their theories end in pure racism: \`We shall keep the lower races alive for experimental purposes. Just as we do with dogs now. So that by their torture we and our dear ones may live forever.'The author confronts \`ambition, egoism, greed and pride', on the one hand, with the conscience of Socrates and the eternal laws of Right and Wrong, and on the other hand with \`the creative magic of feminity', symbolized by a young girl, Morwyn.This book with its hellish scenes worth a Hieronymus Bosch, is a rare find.Not to be missed."},{"Title":"You Bet Your Tomatoes: Fun Facts, Tall Tales, and a Handful of Useful Gardening Tips","review":"If you want to read a funny book on how to grow beautiful tomatoes, then You Bet Your Tomatoes is right up your alley.

It's a tad dated in comments and references, but still entertaining."},{"Title":"Death Match","review":"Very few thriller novels can keep you reading well into the night. This is one of them. Yes, you'll probably have figured out the identity of the killer long before the main character does, but it still doesn't prepare you for the ending. There are several surprises along the way in this story, and it keeps you turning pages. The opening scene with the crying baby will give you chills.The only downside to this story is the lack of intensity to the goal. Six supercouples are found in Eden, Inc. One by one, they are being killed. Two are dead, and the third is coming quickly, yet you never really get to know the couple at all. The third couple gets a few pages, but otherwise you feel nothing for them. You actually couldn't care less if they live or die, you just want to see how Lash and Tara find the killer. That was a lost opportunity, as I would have liked to felt some sort of high stakes in the game. Instead, it barely rates a blip on the radar. Other than that, this story is solid and enjoyable. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Death Match","review":"Since other reviewers have outlined the plot to this novel (perhaps some of them giving away more than they should have), I only want to add a few comments. While I enjoyed &quot;Utopia&quot;, I thought it an inferior effort to the partnership efforts, but this one was one of this year's few &quot;cannot put it down&quot; novels for me so far. I did guess the ending about three quarters of the way through, but - honestly - that was probably only because Child dropped a few fair hints. The concept of the avatar constructs was quite inspired and very impressive. I agree with a previous reviewer that the title of the novel was a problem - to me, &quot;Death Match&quot; seemed to suggest a futuristic gladiatorial interaction, and I never would have looked twice at the book had Lincoln Child's name not been on the cover. Also, as a corrective to those critics who found the premise untenable, concurrently while I was reading the book I encountered a news item stating that EHarmony.com Inc. this month received U.S. Patent No. 6,735,568, which describes a \`\`method and system for identifying people who are likely to have a successful relationship.'' Child is just a little ahead of the process."},{"Title":"Death Match","review":"UTOPIA, Lincoln Child's only novel that he authored alone concerned an imaginary theme park- the ultimate in technology. In effect, it is a warning of what can happen when technology goes unchecked. It is a wildly suspenseful book and also provides some key insights into the thought, creation and running of a theme park. Now, with his second solo authored novel, he explores another imaginary technology and what can happen if human intervention goes too far.Christopher Lash is a former FBI forensic psychologist with a busy private practice in New York. He is hired as a special consultant by Eden, a company that specializes in dating services. However, not just any dating service. For a $25,000 fee, the client is put through a barrage of physical, psychological and emotional testing. The data is put into a super computer and a match would be made from the thousands of other applicants. Their success rate is near perfect as most couples match upwards of 98%. However, Lash is asked to look into the double suicide of a perfect 100% match. There does not appear to be precursors that would indicate why the couple decided to commit suicide. Things heat up considerably when the second perfect match turns up dead from another double suicide. Lash must get to the bottom of this before more couples turn up dead.DEATH MATCH is another fun and exciting read. The positives of this novel include the pacing which is relentless and the plot which is imaginative. Characters, though not filled with great depth, are quite serviceable for this type of an entertainment. The major negative is the needless depth and endless description of the technology. Page after page of psychological testing parameters are covered as is the computer technology used to run the company. This information could and should have been greatly edited. However, by skimming these sections, the reader will move quickly through to the exciting climax and somewhat predictable conclusion. Fun for a day at the beach."},{"Title":"Death Match","review":"I don't understand the &quot;review&quot; below this one (from the top 500 guy). Everything but the last sentence or two is just a substitute for what you might find on the back cover (or in the amazon summary above). Except perhaps the &quot;reviewer&quot; gives too much information about the book. Then he/she gives the book 3(.5) stars with absoultely no justification whatsoever. Lastly, the reviewer states that Child finds his &quot;Crichtonesque&quot; voice. Having read every novel by both authors (including the novels co-authored by Douglas Preston and Lincoln Child) multiple times in most cases, I can attest to the falsehood of this statement. Lincoln Child is better than Michael Crichton in most respects. In particular when writing with Douglas Preston (although in this case he has done beautifully by himself). Crichton's writing (especially his early writing) reads like an overly ordered jumble of college term paper excerpts and relatively lifeless character interactions. Lincoln Child (working alone or with Douglas Preston) weave's the necessary background, the characters and the plot seamlessly together in a much more natural fashion.Death Match clearly demonstrates the application of a great amount of writing experience. The book unfolds masterfully with practically no rushed or contrived scenes. I think this is due in large part to the very plot of the book which itself uncontrives what would otherwise be contrived. The book seems considerably better written than both Lincoln Child's previous solo novel and Douglas Preston's solo novel (though I did enjoy both of these for the most part). It easily stands up with the best of their co-authored novels as well (and surpasses some of them in certain ways).The central theme raises some very interesting questions about human relationships as well. I imagine that most readers would find this highly relevant. Like Utopia, it focuses on some very specific technology (that is realistically just out of reach). This focus on a technology is the fundamental difference in plot style that justifies Lincoln Child's solo novels. This is where my only worry would come in when recommending Lincoln Child's books to others. Some readers may find the technology unbelievable. However, as a computer science graduate, I would suggest that the technology is believable enough if you consider what might be accomplished by applying the most cutting edge theoretical research with a huge infusion of cash from the private sector. It's clear to me that Lincoln Child did his research and then let his imagination run away just a bit. I think things turned out beautifully. However, I can understand if others feel differently. One of my biggest beefs with Utopia was that I found the holographic technology to be far too advanced for its own good.The best thing about Lincoln Child's solo projects is that they clearly haven't slowed down the work that he and Douglas Preston are doing together in the slightest. Nor has it affected the quality of that work (as the recent Still Life with Crows and sample chapters from the upcoming Brimstone prove).The worst thing about Death Match is perhaps its title and cover. The cover for the ARC was much better (hopefully they revert for the paperback). The final cover was probably a result of trying to undo the damage done by the title (which suggests a very a different kind of novel to me). That's not to say that the title isn't appropriate; it fits wonderfully in retrospect, but it may convey the wrong impression prior to reading. Everyone should know not to judge a book by its cover, but that doesn't make it any less difficult to avoid doing so when the title is Death Match."},{"Title":"Death Match","review":"Sometimes the time is right to get lost in a novel, and this novel was the one for me. I know this is a short review, but I hope it is \\"helpful.\\"I do a lot of reading, and about once a year, I come across a novel that grabs me and doesn't let go. \\"Death Match\\" was that kind of novel for me.A high-tech computer dating firm offers perfect matches for $25,000, and then something happens to one of their \\"super couples.\\" They commit a double suicide.

I am not usually a fan of science fiction type books buth this novel is an excellent mix of suspense thiller and techno thriller. The premise is extremely intriguing and gives the book the great plot it needs to succeed.We have Eden, Inc. a highly developed matchmaking service - it uses high tech artificial intelligence to try to match people on up to 1 million separate pieces of criteria. It is expensive, very popular and succesful. People are finding their soul mates. But 2 \\"super couples\\" have committed double suicide. A \\"super couple\\" is a couple that matches on all 1 million pieces of criteria. The deaths are a problem and Eden, Inc. needs help so they call in Chris Lass, a psychologist on marital relationships who used to work for the FBI. He is given all he needs to try to figure out why these couples are killing themselves - or are they?This novel is excellent escape fiction. Many have given it 4 stars saying that the ending was predictable or not believable. What I love about this book is just that. It is not reality based. But it is so expertly, intelligently written that we get caught up in Eden, Inc. and their computerized matchmaking. We go into another world and it is exciting. The characters are superbly developed. None of them are thin or caricatures. They are all fully developed and carefully crafted just as Eden is detailed to expert precision. Some characters you will root for, some you will hate, some will surprise you.The suspense starts at the beginning and never lets up. Someone is not happy with Chris Lass looking into the working of Eden and they start causing serious problems for him. The journey Chris goes on and how expertly we are made a part of it is what carries this novel. The ending may be a little over the top but for me it followed the rest of the book and was very satisfying.I highly recommend this book for intelligent, well crafted escape fiction. The suspense is awesome and you will be on the edge of your seat."},{"Title":"Death Match","review":"Having recently felt the urge to read thriller novels that would keep me awake all night, I tried a few novels by some authors I had not read before.

Eventually I found a thriller novel that would fulfill the premise of keeping me awake all night. I have only read one work of Lincoln Child in conjunction with Douglas Preston, which I thoroughly liked, but since this one was a solo effort, I did not know what to expect.It \`turned' out to be quite a page-turner, and although it started off a bit on the slow side, the pace was quickly stepped up and became more frantic towards the end. The plot was well-crafted and the characters engaging. I especially liked how Mr. Child developed the main character, Dr. Christopher Lash, and how he brought in some ghosts of his past life in the FBI to start haunting him again in his investigation of the suicides of the so-called \\"super couples\\" of Eden Incorporated. I also found the female character, Tara, very interesting, and seeing that she played a very prominent part later on in the book, I would have liked to see her developed a bit further.All-in-all, I want to congratulate Lincoln Child on an excellent thriller, and providing me with a story that I found very hard to put down."},{"Title":"Death Match","review":"When Dr. Christopher Lash gets a call from Eden Incorporated, he is mystified. Why would they want to hire him for his services? He is a former FBI forensics psychologist, a profiler. A tragedy at work had affected him personally, and it not only caused him to retire early, but ended his marriage. He is in private practice now and working hard to exorcise the demons of his past. When Eden calls, he decides to see what they could possibly want from him.Because everyone in the country knows about Eden. They are a match-making service. But not just any service. They are a high-tech company surrounded by secrecy and have a phenomenal success rate. Founded by the reclusive computer genius, Richard Silver, Eden boosts 100% accuracy in finding couples happiness. For just $25,000/person, you too can find the perfect mate! But people are LINING UP to apply for it's services.When Christopher arrives, he finds he is meeting with the upper echelon of Eden. At Eden, they guarantee the matches they make. Using complicated computing and psychological analysis, couples are matched. If they reach a percentage, around 95%, they are considered a perfect match. And Eden's record stands: All couples that have been matched, have been happy. But in all the years that Eden has been operating, they have seen 6 100% matches. A uniquely perfect match. These are referred to as a \\"supercouple\\" match. But the reason Christopher has been called in is that one of the supercouples just committed a double suicide. Eden would like someone from the outside to check into the occurrence.Everything that Christopher sees about the Thorpes indicates they are indeed the perfect couple. There are absolutely no indicators of suicidal tendencies. Just when he is about to give up, another one of Eden's supercouples commits suicide. Now the real question is this: Is it truly a suicide or is it homicide?I enjoyed this book. It was a nice thriller with a lot of intensity. The nature of the book is truly far-fetched. Can a computer really match couples perfectly? Aren't there many factors that a computer can't take into consideration? But the book does get into some confusing explanations about Artificial Intelligence and technical jargon. For those that aren't familiar with computers and processing it might be a little too much. And the back story of Lash's time in the FBI just seemed to be thrown in rather hastily and was tied up unsatisfyingly. It's almost like Child was trying to do too many things at one time. He touches on a lot of topics: AI, dating, match-making, serial killers, psychology, suicide, computer programming, computer security. In the end, it was just too much to make a really GREAT book. I figured out the conclusion long before I turned to that page. But I was entertained. And that is truly what 'braincandy' is all about. It was enough for me to put Lincoln Child on my reading list for the future, especially his collaborations with Douglas Preston."},{"Title":"Death Match","review":"i found this to be an excellent book. in a nutshell, when perfect couples who were matched by an exclusive dating service commit double suicides, the company consults with a forensic psychologist to help resolve the problem. in the meantime, he must face his own demons, although not completely spelled out how, he manages to overcome his liabilities and fears. the book was well-written, believable (for the most part), and, frankly, i had a hard time putting it down. i found 3 very minor inconsistencies and additional technical errors throughout the book and i'd imagine there are more. i wish that there would have been a little bit more character development, especially of the main four or five characters. it's a quick read and well worth the several hours and the few dollars. i highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Death Match","review":"Even without his partner Doug Preston, Lincoln Child can spin a yarn to keep you on the edge of your seat page, after page, after page. I can honestly say there hasn't been one book these gentlemen have written together or by themselves that I haven't throughly enjoyed.Lincoln Child is definately in a class by himself, when teamed with Doug Preston, this duo is unbeatable."},{"Title":"Death Match","review":"Very well written and goes into much detail so you know the author has done a lot of research. You hate to put it down as you never know what will happen. Amazon.com carries amazing reads."},{"Title":"Death Match","review":"I enjoyed \\"Death Match\\" by Lincoln Child so much that I couldn't put it down. It was exciting at every twist and turn - always a surprise event that couldn't be anticipated."},{"Title":"Death Match","review":"OLDER BOOK IN MINT CONDITION & ONE I HAVE BEEN LOOKING FOR FOR A LONG TIME. GOOD STORY, GREAT PRICING, REASONABLE & TIMELY SHIPPING - THANK YOU!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"Title":"Death Match","review":"I'm a big fan of both Douglas Preston and Lincoln Child. I'm also a fan of their work when they're not working together. As for Child, Utopia was neat. Deep Storm was a joy to read (and the first work I read that put me on a path to reading everything they wrote). Terminal Freeze was great, especially since I lived at a radar site in Alaska for awhile and I could easily relate. I'm really looking forward to Third Gate.However, Death Match was, well, boring. My wife and I listened to it in the car on the way to work, and we both had it figured out somewhere around 1/3 of the way in. I personally thought the characters were a little two dimensional and cliche. The action wasn't very exciting, and the final scene was more complicated than it needed to be.I'm still going to give it 3 stars because it was a fun read. Not a read I would visit again, but a fun read nonetheless."},{"Title":"Death Match","review":"These are the kind of books that MOVIES should be made from! They grip your attention and hold you on the edge of your seat. You never know what is going to happen, but it turns out to be what you may never expect."},{"Title":"Death Match","review":"I downloading this book to my kindle just biding my time til the next Pendergast book comes out; but, I have to say that once I started reading, I couldn't put it down. Enjoyable read from start to finish."},{"Title":"Death Match","review":"Pretty good. SubjectDeath Matchwasn't that interesting to me--I'm too old! Also, I guessed the ending before I got to far into the book."},{"Title":"Death Match","review":"This is the first techno-thriller I've read. I'm a little of a tech-geek so the computer technology part appealed to me as I'd never read any books that combine geek and crime. The storyline was very unique and a little creepy because I don't doubt at all that genetic dating matching isn't too far off (if not already being done on a small scale). And I have no doubt that there are computers that are very close to doing a little too much thinking on their own. AI (artificial intelligence) is just a fascinating topic on it's own, so combine all of this into a fast moving story and you have a book that you can really sink your teeth into. The only reason I gave it four stars is because the ending was unexpected and a bit of a let-down. But not enough for me to not recommend this book, I really enjoyed it."},{"Title":"Death Match","review":"Death Match by Lincoln Child is a very fast read, or at least it was for me. The story of trying to find a perfect romantic match is intriguing to me, and when Child starts telling us about a new match-making program called Eden Incorporated and how successful they are, the feeling of unease begins to settle in. The company is incredibly secritive and Christopher Lash, our protagonist, finds this out when he begins to investigate the double-suicide of Eden's first 100% matched couple. The Thorpe's were perfect for each other, so why are they dead? Lash is asked to figure this out to save Eden's reputation as the best match-making service in the world. More perfect couples die mysteriously and the horror of it all deepens when Lash himself enters the program to really see how it works.This book was absolutely excellent and I would expect nothing less from the co-author of the Pendergast series. The book had a surprise ending that I did not see coming as well which is always nice when reading novels. It had the feel of a Crichton novel with all of the high-tech stuff involved in the match-making program, but it didn't have Crichton's usual anti-climactic ending. Death Match is a good book for fans of fiction in general but I would call it a techno-thriller. Horror is here though in the old fashioned, building tention to unbearable levels sort of way. It is just a good book all around and one that I will definitely read again in the future."},{"Title":"Death Match","review":"Lincoln Child always has a way of changing your perceptions right at the end of book. This is no exception. I read this some years ago and still think about it fondly. An absolutely terrific read!"},{"Title":"Death Match","review":"This entire computer story line has been done before on the original version of Star Trek, I kept expecting they would change it, but it is almost verbatim! Would have liked more of a twist! I listened to the audio version and I could not believe how many numbers that poor person had to read out. Every time Lash picked up a file he read the client number and that was for 6 different files, all the different tests, all the different results. It was beyond tedious to listen to over and over. I think I had one of the numbers memorized by the end! When you are reading you can just skim over it, when listening you are stuck!!! I have to admit the basic premise is intriguing. The thought of a perfect match, the one person who complements you completely is fascinating. It is hard not to wonder if they person you are with would match with you in the tank!!!"},{"Title":"Death Match","review":"The story centers around a Dating company who use immensely powerful computers to work out if people match with each other along with some complex screening procedures. Everything is working well and those who have used it are very happy with the results until two \\"super couples\\" die. Super couples are those who are 100% matched with each other and there are only 6. The first pair to die are an apparent suicide and there are a lot of questions asked about it. Christopher Lash, a former FBI forensic psychologist, is brought in to investigate. He finds himself caught up in a maze of detail and involved situations, each clue seems to make things more complicated rather than easier.It's of it's type, a techno thriller, there's some serious handwaving about the technical end of things and there are a few pieces that seem to be a bit off but otherwise it's an engaging read. It's not something I'd rush out to read again but it did keep my attention while I was reading. I had a fairly good idea what was going on from very early in the story but the characters kept me reading."},{"Title":"Death Match","review":"I've read all of the Lincoln Child books & this book keeps one guessing until the end. It's a fast paced ride to the finish. It's written in a different style of his previous books, but still is a hit with me!"},{"Title":"Death Match","review":"I read a lot of genre fiction, and I can say without hesitation that Lincoln Child has real talent. Unfortunately, DEATH MATCH turns out to be a minor effort from a writer with tremendous potential.DEATH MATCH is a very well written book. The quality and intelligence of the writing is first rate, much higher than average. I also thought the premise of the book was highly inventive: the idea of a highly sophisticated matchmaking service that can create \\"perfect\\" couples. Indeed, the first two hundred pages of this novel are genuinely great, as Child explores in depth the inner workings of how such a matchmaking organization would work. Clearly, Child has done a great deal of research into personality psychology, which I found quite fascinating.Unfortunately, this novel goes off the rails about mid-way through. Child abandons the matchmaking premise and instead turns his attention to a supercomputer with artificial intelligence. The reader is forced to wade through a lot of technical computer jargon and a completely unrealistic chase scene through an office building. Even worse, there is an ending that is supposed to be a big surprise, but I found completely predictable and cliched. This book ends with a whimper.I liked DEATH MATCH enough to read more work by this author. However, this book was ultimately kind of a disappointment, since I was hoping for so much better. Still, if Lincoln Child can fine-tune his plotting, he can turn into the next Michael Crichton in my opinion."},{"Title":"Death Match","review":"I agree with the other reviewers. Do not waste your time here. What started off as riveting, ended with me throwing the book across the room. The last 100 pages were torture for me, but I forced myself through them. I will not read another book by this Child."},{"Title":"Death Match","review":"I was so into this book I read the last 150 pages in one sitting."},{"Title":"Death Match","review":"Extremely disappointed is high praise for this work. This will be my last read for Child alone. I found this book pretentious in its long and lenghthy explanations of computers, software, codes, interfacing, sequences, etc. which really were just not that interesting and didn't add much to the story overall. Seems Child got lost in his own words and complicated ideas and I felt like I needed a PHD in computer science to really enjoy the story. I can't fault Child for the charts thorughout the book that don't read at all on a Kindle, but it still annoyed me.There was an enormous effort in detailed descriptions of facililties, rooms, hallways, staircases, ducts, buildings and surprising little development of any of the characters. Odd really, as the Preston/Child collaborations on character development are so strong. Maybe Preston writes those parts.At 60%, I figured out the identity of the killer and pretty much skimmed the rest of the book. And the method of murder was just unbelievable for several couples you know little about and care even less. They are not really people.....but products....maybe that's the point. I wish I had ordered a sample first before I spent the $$.The Preston/Child books are some of my favorite reads, which probably made this one all the most disappointing."},{"Title":"Death Match","review":"Lincoln Child starts with an intriguing premise for what could have easily been a 5 star novel.The book starts of strong and is very gripping -- until the technology that was supposedly used to match the couples is revealed. It starts out pushing the reader's ability to suspend disbelief and things go down hill from there.The ending is obvious very early on and the book continues on longer after the \\"secret\\" is revealed.I checked it out the library and I would recommend the same for any Lincoln Child fan. It's worth a read, but not a purchase."},{"Title":"Death Match","review":"** Possible spoilers **Child obviously has done his homework regarding computers and AI. The premise is an interesting one, the storyline is very well developed and proceeds at an exciting pace. The ending is somewhat far fatched though; the computer Liza being the culprit and all. I mean, if it is capable of tracking Lash's activites and realizing that he is a threat, how come it cannot figure out the plan by our hero and his friends in the end that results in its termination?Also there are a few loose ends that seem to be storylines in themselves - the stalker, Lash's past life, the enigmatic employees of Eden who seem to be hiding secrets etc. Were they added just to distract and keep you guessing? If so, they were not brought to a satisfactory conclusion.This book is certainly better than Child's other solo effort - Utopia, a monumental bore despite the lofty title. I am still waiting for the next Douglas/Child joint effort, sans Pendergast, of course. I think we have had enough of the Holmes/Mycroft alter egos."},{"Title":"Death Match","review":"AT THE RISK OF BEING REDUNDANT, I find myself sharing the views of several other reviewers: it starts out great, but the last third is so bogged down in technical mumbo jumbo, and it seems as if Child fixed everything to make sense. Too bad, because for a while, we have a real pageturner going here. While I hadn't totally picked the real killer, the revelation is no surprise, considering the direction Childs is taking us in. Christopher Lash is an interesting hero, but his immediate love for his perfect match, Diana Mirren, comes out of nowhere; how come he doesn't fall for the lovely if offish Tara? And we could have done without the lengthy chase scene through the buildings tunnels or whatever they were. Richard Silver, the owner of Eden, is like most of the megalomaniacs in books like this, so his fate is likewise telegraphed.All in all, DEATH MATCH is a fun book, but it's overly technical climax is detrimental in the long run."},{"Title":"Death Match","review":"This is a totally different storyline from the usual Child books. It was an enjoyable read about a futuristic (one hopes!) concept of dating and the perfect couple. It shows what can go wrong if you allow the human relationship matching to be done by a computer. A very good read and a very different plot from the regular Preston and Child books."},{"Title":"Death Match","review":"This rates lower than it would if it were written by another author, because I've come to expect great things from Lincoln Child - either writing alone, or with Preston. And while this book really drew me in to begin with, it got a little stagnant towards the middle. And the end was entirely predictable. It was an interesting plot, but there wasn't enough of a twist to keep it interesting, and I'd say that if you read a lot, it's probably worth it. But if you're only going to read a handful of books this year, I wouldn't recommend it. It was just okay.I'd strongly recommend you check out his other works."},{"Title":"Death Match","review":"Mr. Child certainly has found a niche - technology and writing thrillers. A little difficult to get through all the 00000000's and other techno babble - but necessary to be convincing. Great read..."},{"Title":"Death Match","review":"Now that I've read both Preston and Child as singular authors and coauthors, I now know Preston seems to be the backbone to Preston/Child's collaborative works. With \\"Death Match\\", Child developed an intriguing premise but failed to execute the story. Despite the promising premise, the story was actually BORING. It was slow-moving, the characters were \\"eh\\", and the end was predictable. It's unfortunate Child didn't have the insight to insert more conspiracy and intrigue, for the \\"long-awaited\\" answer to the deaths ended up being disappointingly simple and obvious. Hopefully Child's \\"Utopia\\" proves to be a more interesting read."},{"Title":"Death Match","review":"This is a very entertaining novel which held my interest. Some of the high tech jargon was over my head and could have been eliminated. It is a good mystery. I liked the characters. At the end of the story two of the characters seemed to have a chance at love while one was doomed to search for it."},{"Title":"Death Match","review":"I got this book after reading a previous book by Lincoln Child, \\"Utopia\\", which I liked very much. I wasn't disappointed although I have to say that \\"Utopia\\" was better. This book makes for a very easy, fast paced, page turning, read. One could argue that characters are not very developed but this somehow doesn't spoil the fun. I don't agree with some of the reviewers that reffered to this novel as sci-fiction - just having non-existing company and non-existing computer with unusual powers dowsn't qualify for sci-fiction. So you shouldn't expect here all the other qualities that come with sic-fi territory. The novel is not without shortcomings. I pretty much knew the gist of the ending long before the end. Some of the points that are related to the artificial intelligence and the computer that is part of this story are argumentative (but not utter ridiculous, as in some other works of similar genre). Still, I would recommend the book as a very good entertainment."},{"Title":"Death Match","review":"Eden, Inc. can match couples so that they will live a deleriously happy life.

Using highly proprietary screening methods and exceedingly sophisticated computerized processes, they've matched more \\"perfect\\" couples than any of the competition. Eden Inc. is the brainchild of brilliant computer scientist Richard Silver, originating from parent company PharmGem before branching off as a privately held company. But something recently has gone very wrong; of the five \\"supercouples\\" matching 100% at Eden, the first of them, Lewis and Lindsey Thorpe, are found dead of what looks to be mutual suicide. How could this happen to a perfect couple?Silver and his corporate director Edwin Mauchly call upon the aid of Dr. Christopher Lash, currently a psychologist specializing and family and marital relationships. But it's Lash's past experience as a special agent in forensic psychology for the FBI's Behavioral Science program as a criminal personality profiler that really interests them. Dr. Lash left the FBI after a particularly bad run-in with serial killer Edmund Wyre, which was also the cause of his divorce from his wife Shirley.Dr. Lash has difficulty uncovering any reason for the couple's suicide, until the next 100% \\"supercouple\\" also commit mutual suicide. Now Silver knows it was no coincidence. Lash gains access to the inner workings of Eden Inc. and meets the enigmatic Richard Silver, and his self-aware computer system Liza. Teamed up with Tara Stapleton from systems security, Lash continues his search. As a research project, Lash himself goes through Eden's screening process and is rejected, yet somehow his Avatar gets placed in \\"The Tank\\" and is matched to a potential mate. According to Tara, such a mistake is impossible. Impossible or not, the more Lash and Tara uncover, the more unrealistic the suicides seem to be. But they must work fast to find the answer, because there's still three more \\"supercouples\\" left.This enticing story is interspersed with chapters from Lash's past against serial killer Edmund Wyre, adding an intriguing subplot to the novel. The characters are thoughtfully constructed and the \\"self-aware\\" computer personality made believable. Like most of Child's novels, the \\"whodunit\\" factor is usually easily guessable, but the tension at the build-up is exciting and enjoyable anyway. I've found novels by Lincoln Child to be peculiarly addictive, whether written on his own or with co-author Douglas Preston. While not perfect, they contain a substance to them that is attractive; good storylines and plot-development being a couple of factors to mention. With the popularity of the \\"computerized dating\\" businesses growing, 'Death Match' is a modern and tantalizing tale. Check out other novels by Lincoln Child also. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Death Match","review":"The premise was great. The writing in the early part was absorbing. I was hoping against hope the ending would be different. But it became the boring, flat ending I was afraid of.As to Eden, while the premise of an all-knowing computer was intriguing, the extent to which it was pushed, & for a purpose like match-making, made it rather implausible, if not laughable. It is conceivable a computer can hack into that much data. It is rather dubious it can do that a million times without anybody detecting anything.Would have preferred if the novel had taken another direction, like, how all the information in the world still can't predict a perfect match...a little misinterpretation can ruin all the hard data..."},{"Title":"Death Match","review":"Once again Lincoln Child spins a tale that makes one think!

I give it 5 stars!"},{"Title":"Death Match","review":"One thing is absolutely certain- Child & Preston both do their best work when they are writing together. That's not to say that their individual works are terrible, but it's pretty clear that they seem to complement each other & make up for the other's shortcomings. That factor is slightly apparent in this novel, even though it's one of my favorites by Lincoln Child as an individual writer.Death Match is about a matchmaking company named Eden. Eden's not just any type of matchmaker company- they offer 100% complete satisfaction & the waiting list to get into their databases is legendary. Why are they so sought after? Because they claim that they can find you your soul mate within their logs & prove their compatibility with an uncanny percentage. They've even got a few couples that are 100% compatible. Too bad all of those couples are being mysteriously killed one by one. Lash has been hired to discover why this is happening, but someone doesn't want him getting to close. Or is it something?There's many good & bad things about this novel. First, the good. I really enjoyed the premise of the super matchmaking computer service. I thought it was pretty original & let's be honest- with companies touting similar services, it's a somewhat realistic premise. I also liked the characters, especially the strange & intriguing creator of Eden. The pacing was interesting & I liked the mystery of what exactly happened to cause the deaths of so many people & why.Now for the bad. After a while, everything became predictable & the \\"whodunnit\\" part of it just sort of lost it's luster for me. I still enjoyed the book greatly, but I just wish that I'd have been able to go a little longer before I was easily able to guess what was going on. The other thing that bothered me was that the idea of such a strong computer being used purely for dating was a little unbelievable. I just couldn't believe that the government wouldn't have stepped in & tried to take it over for their own purposes. That's a petty complaint, but I had it all the same.Fans of Child & Preston will love this book. Fans of techno thrillers are sure to like it as well. Just don't go in expecting this to be anything other than what it is- a beach/vacation read to get you through until the next Preston/Child book is out."},{"Title":"Death Match","review":"This one isn't as tense or thrilling as Child's work with Douglas Preston to whom he gives credit for a chapter here. The story builds as we are introduced to the ultimate dating service. Unintended (or intended) consequences result in two double murders and the threat of a third.If you're looking for a nail biter or a read-until-dawn experience, I'm afraid you'll be disappointed. If, however, a combination of murder, match-making and artificial intelligence sounds intriguing, log on, by all means. Just make sure you can shut down when you want to."},{"Title":"Death Match","review":"I only wish the culprit had been different.

It also raises some interesting concepts about love relationships. It seems everyone is searching for a conceptualized \\"perfect\\" mate that they have in their mind, which is probably someone made up of ideas garnered from Hollywood and other such sources. In reality, the perfect mate is someone you never really pictured. You just know them when you meet them.I thoroughly enjoyed this book about a company that has figured out that with enough information about a person (historic, physical, mental) you can use computer simulations to find the perfect mate.

This could be matched up with others to find a guaranteed suitable mate.The service provided by Eden had been wildly successful until a perfectly matched couple called a supercouple, The Thorpes are found to have committed double suicide in their Flagstaff home. Silver immediately implores his corporate staff to bring in former FBI forensic psychologist and profiler Dr. Christopher Lash to find out what happened. Soon after Lash's investigation starts another one of the six supercouples also turn up dead. Lash with assistance from Eden security chief Tara Stapleton proceed to plod through a morass of computer files to unravel this perplexing problem.Although the ending is somewhat predictable Child holds your interest throughout. He does at times get bogged down in computer jargon but the psychoanalysis presented is quite interesting. I still feel however, that collaboration with Douglas Preston produces a superior product."},{"Title":"Death Match","review":"Love makes the world go round and keeps Lincoln Child's latest techno-thriller tightly wound.Child, with or without his writing partner, Douglas Preston, keeps me up at night. I'm a little bit scared, a little bit thrilled and I find it tough to put the book down and catch some ZZZZs. This is his best solo effort to this point.Death Match has a very strong start with a puzzling, compelling problem for the book's hero. I don't want to spoil the plot for any readers, but the opening chapters hit hard emotionally.Child has always excelled at balancing technical explanation with jazzing it up so it's fun to read. He seems to choose his technology for thrillers by picking something he himself is interested in but he's very good at explaining current art plus fun but logical extensions without lapsing into major geekdom.This book has excellent pacing - I required two coffees the next morning even though I seldom touch caffeine. I just couldn't stop reading. I wasn't scared. Instead I found myself trying to take Child's clues and play \\"Clue.\\" Who was the villain? Why were these inexplicable things happening? Was there any connection to the psychologist's past experiences?Almost everyone I know has had a fling at computer dating and been disappointed. Child dangles a very realistic though flashy scenario of making a \\"perfect match\\" in front of the reader.There is a sense that the villain is playing a game with Christopher Lash, the forensic psychologist. Is this a match that started in his past? Or did it start in Eden (the corporation that matches prospective life mates)?Definitely a thrill ride and perfect beach reading, too."},{"Title":"Death Match","review":"I've been a fan of preston and child books for some time now. And I've managed to read their solo efforts as well. While it was decent, Utopia just didn't live up to the previous efforts that child had worked on with his partner, douglas preston. This book, however, was a great read from beginning to end.It leans more on the technological side, but it doesn't get bogged down in the actual technology like utopia did. The characters are great and there's alot of great twists and turns.Definetly worth reading!"},{"Title":"Death Match","review":"\\"Death Match\\", Lincoln Child's second effort, is a compelling and entertaining page-turner. The theme - a modern day dating service - could hardly be any less promising as the backdrop for a techno-thriller. But Child spins a tale with the aplomb of Michael Crichton, while bringing the often terrifying cyber-future of William Gibson to a broader audience.\\"Death Match\\" is the story of Eden, a high-tech match making company whose coupling of singles has extraordinary results - for an extraordinary price of $25,000 per person - launching Eden and reclusive founder Richard Silver to an American icons and Wall Street darlings. Darlings, that is, until some seemingly well adjusted couples start committing double suicides. Enter Christopher Lash, former FBI psychologist and profiler with his own baggage, called in by the Eden brass to get a handle on these unlikely suicides. The ultra-secret, ultra high security Eden must increasingly reveal their matching methods to Lash as another couple dies and the need for damage control escalates. Child does a masterful job of making an engaging story of arcane psychobabble, complete with actual Rorschach inkblots and IQ tests. He dives deep into founder Richard Silver's neural-networked supercomputer, the core of Eden's success, as Child unravels the mysteries databases, avatars, and other geek-speak into a who-dunnit even your grandmother would understand and enjoy. For the \\"black helicopter\\" crowd, there is enough bizarre conspiracy theory and \\"big brother\\" to keep the Internet chat rooms buzzing, while the more skeptical reader can still enjoy Child's fantasy of an industrial-government tryanny with nothing better to do than invade individual privacy.In short, slickly plotted, believable (if thinly developed) characters, and steady action make \\"Death Match\\" the best solo effort I've read of either Child or Preston, and definitely up to par with some of their more popular team efforts. A good bet for the big screen, this fiction is a frightening as it is imaginative; the perfect read for a lazy day or long flight."},{"Title":"Death Match","review":"This is not the kind of book I would normally pick up and read. The story surrounds the mysterious double suicide of a couple who were perfectly matched through a succesful computerised dating agency (which has a success rate that is even higher than Cupid's arrows). Now I like computers, but mix computers and dating and the image that this conjures up for me is such a sad stereotype that I shall not dare write it out! I also don't go for crime thrillers much.But Lincoln Child also wrote Utopia, which I also very much enjoyed - so I gave this one a go, and was surprised to find this story was every bit as readable. Here is a good plot driven thriller with perfect amounts of mystery, suspense, prejudicial emotions and action to make it the kind of book you just want to pick up again each time you set it down.The nature of the narrative would suit it for adaption to film, I expect. It is not a deep and philosophical novel. It is just a very good story, well written and well executed. This is the kind of book Dan Brown would have aspired to write, had he had a better talent for detail (but what does Dan Brown care? people buy his books anyway!)So if you want a good and exciting plot driven thriller without annoying inconsistencies or silly pretentions, then this one will do just fine."},{"Title":"Death Match","review":"I wish there were more hours in the day just so I could read this book more!

He previous worked for the FBI, giving him insight into criminal behavior. This is the reason officials at Eden Inc. have contacted him, to investigate the mysterious double-suicide of two of their clients.Eden is a matchmaker, but unlike any before it. Eden uses a highly advanced Artificial Intelligence to match individuals on every little detail (more than a million criteria). Lewis and Lindsay Thorpe were two such individuals, and were also the company's first \\"supercouple:\\" two people who are a 100% match. But now they are dead...and Lash must find out why. Because another supercouple has killed themselves...and there are four more such couples to go. But finding out why two perfect couples would want to kill themselves is only half of Lash's problem, because somebody is messing with his life, in ways that could only be done through the technology available at Eden...\\"Death Match\\" is a top-notch thriller from Lincoln Child, who has brought us (especially in collaboration with Douglas Preston) so many enjoyable, well-planned thrillers. This novel is no exception; though it is a bit predictable, it is still enthralling. The technological details are broken down into layman's terms, but with serious research behind them. Lash is an appealing, conflicted character, as are those he encounters. While \\"Death Match\\" may not be Child's best work to-date, it is certainly worth checking out, and a repeated reading or two."},{"Title":"Death Match","review":"Eden, Incorporated is a huge corporation that promises to find the perfect love match for each of its applicants. These matches are performed using a powerful artificial intelligence-based computer called Liza. The matches are so accurate and the resulting partnerships so idyllic that not a single client has ever claimed a refund from the money-back guarantee. When two of Eden's \\"perfect match\\" couples are found dead of double-suicide, a former FBI forensic psychologist, Christopher Lash, is brought in to investigate whether Eden has failed to predict a psychological instability when it performed its thorough personality testing of each applicant. Lash finds nothing in the psychological profiles of the four suicides and he suspects foul play. Could this be homicide made to look like suicide, and if so, why? Could it be a disgruntled former Eden employee? Or could it be a rejected applicant for Eden's services? As Lash is granted complete access to the mysterious workings of Eden, he finds that someone is out to stop him from discovering the perpetrator, and soon Lash finds his reputation and his life in jeopardy.Having read Child's previous novel \\"Utopia,\\" I found a lot of similarities between the two books. Both feature a large and highly successful corporation engineered using next-generation computers and incredibly futuristic technology. Both companies are being undermined, and ultimately threatened, by evildoers. In both cases an outsider is brought in to investigate the problem. Both investigators are drawn into the dangers and must race against the clock to save the lives of innocent people, including themselves. Both stories are fast-paced, suspenseful thrillers. The main difference is that \\"Death Match\\" has several plot twists and turns before the mysterious perpetrator is unmasked, and its ending is not as satisfying as that in \\"Utopia.\\" This novel is still a worthwhile read, whether or not you have read its predecessor.The book's details on psychological testing and profiling are quite interesting, although I cannot judge how accurate they are. The story also made me ponder the nature of attraction that people feel for each other, how its characteristics could be scientifically quantified, and whether there is such a thing as one or more \\"perfect matches\\" for every individual. I recommend this story for those who enjoy high-tech thrillers and cinematic action.Eileen Rieback"},{"Title":"Death Match","review":"I really enjoyed Death Match.

However, I have read the following books he co-authored with Douglas Preston: RELIC, MOUNT DRAGON, RELIQUARY, THE CABINET OF CURIOSITIES and STILL LIFE WITH CROWS. I found all of the co-authored books profoundly intense. With that in mind, I read DEATH MATCH.I can make two points that will assist people to decide whether to read this novel. First, like the co-authored novels, there is a level of intensity that takes the reader into the eyes of the central character -- in this case, Christopher Lash, a forensic psychologist. I relish novels that make me forget about meals I need to eat or meetings I am suppose to attend. Child's work does this. This writing style locks outside environmental stimuli out of my consciousness.Second, this novel has the same favor as MOUNT DRAGON, the second novel Lincoln Child wrote with Douglas Preston. In that respect, I felt this novel was a bit too predictable. By chapter 36, I eliminated the culprit to two possibilities. In a later chapter (I can't identify it), Richard Silver says, \\"Don't hurt him.\\" At that second, everything fell into place and knew how the novel was going to end. The rest of the novel was anticlimactic and I found myself disappointed. I found myself reading more rapidly and with much less relish in my mind. As a result, I skipped the epilogue. DEATH MATCH was too much like other novels.About five days later while I was bored, I picked up the DEATH MATCH and finally read the epilogue. Everything changed! Child should have entitled this epilogue \\"Chapter Sixty-Five.\\" The ending is not as predictable as I had thought when I heard Richard Silver utter those words, \\"Don't hurt him.\\" The epilogue provides an unexpected twist. It is the kind of twist I love in a novel. Most importantly and unlike MOUNT DRAGON, this story doesn't end. Child can easily write a sequel; perhaps he can entitle it, LIFE MATCH."},{"Title":"Death Match","review":"I have read all of Child's collaborations with Douglas Preston and have generally liked them-some of their stories are among my favorites. I have also read Child's and Preston's solo books and they have never been quite as good as their team efforts. Much like Child's last solo work, Utopia, this book starts with an interesting premise that grips the reader, but it degenerates as the technology is introduced and fails to follow through with an equally compelling ending.The story begins with the apparent suicide of a couple that were supposedly perfectly matched by the Eden corporation. The main character, a forensic psycologist named Christopher Lash, is brought in to determine why this happened. Then a second perfectly matched couple commits double-suicide and the intrigue builds. At this point, Lash is exposed to the highly secretive operations of Eden and their extensive matching process and this is where the story begins to lose credibility.The matching process accumulates a massive amount of data that are analyzed by a super computer named Liza. We are told that Liza is based on artificial intelligence concepts and is actually self-aware and can learn. We are supposed to believe that Liza is by far the the most powerful and advanced computer in the world and yet it is owned by a private company and used primarily as a matchmaker? We are told that some of the early funding to build Liza came from the government and that Liza does contracting work for various Federal agencies, but the fact that Liza is not under government control is too unbelievable.Another ridiculous aspect of Liza is her construction. She is cobbled together with computers dating back to the 1960's! Anyone who has ever tried to install a CD/DVD drive or a new operating system is aware of the considerable compatability issues with computers. And yet we are supposed to believe that the world's most advanced system is pieced together with Apple IIe's, Commodore 64's, and whatever else could be found. Finally, the data gathering is over the top and highly illegal. Liza has access to clients' (and Eden employees') internet-related data: bank/credit card records, traffic tickets/crimianl records, etc. I can believe that clients would allow this, but Liza has unfettered access to rejected clients and the general public and constantly spies on them! Liza: the world's most advanced hacker!Overall the characters are well written and their dialog is not distractingly bad. But the book is pretty short and the ending unoriginal. As I read it I couldn't help but think this was a cross between Wargames and The Lawnmower Man.

Founded by reclusive Richard Silver, the company is famous for matching couples that are nearly perfect for each other, with wild success. This couple was a so-called &quot;supercouple,&quot; one that was indeed a perfect match.It begins strong and fluid, and is quite enjoyable. It feels different, as the company isn't dark, sinister and shadowy. They have some aspects of your standard dark, sinister and shadowy companies, but none of the characteristics. In fact it's refreshingly honest and benevolent.So what changes? Well, the company is based on an incredible computer. This computer, named Liza, is a learning machine capable of passing the Turing Test. That is, the AI can pass for human. It learns, evolves, and adapts. It even teaches itself.Gee, have you heard this one before?*Spoilers*Ok, so you have a smart machine. You read this and your first thought was &quot;did it have something to do with the suicides?

With an extra 100 pages left (the book is a bit thin), well, I'm sorry to say you won't care. You already know the ending, so you won't want to read it all that carefully.Even worse, many of the final pages get bogged down with technical aspects you don't care much about, either. I've done extensive programming in Assembly and even found myself skimming over his discussions on machine language and registers. I feel bad for the non-technically inclined, they'll be utterly lost just as the conclusion is playing out.Not that it matters, I'm sure they figured the ending out long before and are just reading to get it over with, hoping they are somehow surprised.A worthy first 200 pages, a sad final 250 pages.

The writing style is smooth and the concept of making perfect matches is pretty cool. Even though halfway through the book you pretty much have it figured out, it is OK because the story was going on fine. Unfortunately, for Mr. Child the wheels fell off or in this case the system crashed in the middle. He could have really created something cool here and built up the suspense of the book, but it just seems like he thought \\"I'm tired off writing this book, I'll just wrap it up here and work on something else\\". He left plot lines that went nowhere, i.e. the sudden release from prison of the physco killer. Also, he never really develops the computer concept fully. One minute the computer is this super intelligent evil self aware entity and the next it is dumb as a door knob that wouldn't know which way is up. It is too bad the author couldn't have taken a little more time to fix the last half of the novel to be as good as the first.

The ideas that Lincoln Child plays with allowed for limitless possibilities. I felt like I was walking into a detailed extended episode of the very best Twilight Zone episode. The writing style here of Child is dry, crisp, and sets up an ambiance that will allow you to step into a fully realized world. I have read all of Child and Preston's work. It is revealing when you start to compare the solo writing of the two authors. As a team they make a pretty decent series of books with agent Pendergast. By himself, Preston is bombastic, over the top, silly, and typical. Along with Child, the Pendergast series is pretty good. When Child allows for himself to be a solo author, he is in my mind, filled with more potential as an author than either a solo Preston or the duo together.What I think happens to Child as an author, is that he has yet to find a confident voice. He relies heavily on formula. The promising start to this book gets bogged down in your average hollywood thriller. All of the great ideas funnel into a silly chase story. It's still good, and I might like this book more than just about any of Child's other books. But the story is in the end forgettable. It could have been on par with Kafka or Phillip K Dick if Child had let his imagination wander.The ending, as other reviewers here have said, is very staid. I am kind of mad with Child for coping out here in such an expected manner. You can see the resolution here from a long ways off if you pay attention. I bet that Child will end up writing both with Preston and by himself, several dozen more books. I think that he could, if he wanted to, write several great genre masterpieces. This here is not one of those, but you can see the potential all over the place here."},{"Title":"Death Match","review":"Yep, I, too, am a huge fan of Preston and Child. Or maybe &quot;was&quot; is a better word. Lately, they've been dwelling too much on serial killings, which I do not find entertaining at all. However, as far as this solo effort by Lincoln Child goes, it is a sham! The author should be embarrassed for writing this one. This story is old, hackneyed, uninspired and without any suspense whatsoever (the ending is easily guessable by page 50!). And yes, the ending... implausible and very, very far-fetched. But the big thing I'm beginning to notice about Child and Preston is their lack of character development lately. In their past few books, both individually and collectively, they have given us &quot;nil&quot; in this department, to the point where I couldn't care any less about the main characters since they don't give us the oportunity to get to know them!

In our current multi-tasking society, people are turning more frequently to computers, with their immediacy and convenience. Stepping off from this premise, Child takes it one step further: suppose a company, dedicated to matching the most compatible couples, was so successful that they could afford to charge $25,000.00 for their services?Entrepreneur and child genius Richard Silver, the founder of Eden, Incorporated, appears to have met this daunting challenge with brilliant success. After years of refining the process and adding to the base of his super-computer, nicknamed \\"Liza\\", Silver charges this exorbitant rate simply because the end results are so remarkably successful.The process is exhaustive, but well worth the investment, as new subscribers line up for consideration, checks in hand. Eden has its standards as well, with substantial testing before accepting candidates. Inside the company, the buzz is all about the so-called Supercouples, a small percentage of almost-perfect matches that are the darlings of the system and a great source of pride for Eden, Inc. Imagine the chagrin when the very first Supercouple commits double-suicide. Eden is willing to do whatever it takes to get to the bottom of this shocking anomaly and blight on their perfect record.Enter Dr. Christopher Lash, formerly an FBI profiler, now in private practice. If Lash has a few skeletons in his closet, he doesn't believe there are any obstacles in locating the systems error that resulted in the tragedies. As an independent contractor and in an effort to replicate the Eden experience, Lash undergoes the same testing process as the other successful applicants, seeking specific flaws in the system. Then things get dicey as yet another super couple self-destructs.Meeting with Richard Silver, Lash is impressed with the man behind Eden's success, and the computer Silver painstakingly put together over the years. Lash is struck by Silver's genuine altruism, concern for the couples who are matched via the company. But Lash is shocked by the intrusiveness of Eden's testing procedures, both psychological and physical. The data retrieval alone suggests interfacing with computers that the general public could never access, a fact that raises Lash's suspicions.Lash has immediate results in his investigation, confident he has located the person behind the suicides of the Supercouples. Unfortunately, complications arise and Lash finds himself on the defensive, with dangerous implications for his personal safety. He is in a desperate race to remove the sudden suspicion cast on his motives and the revelation of his questionable past history.Childs proves himself a capable writer in this singular effort. In this cutting-edge techno-mystery, Childs finds his Crichton-esque voice, pulling out all the stops, projecting the complexities of a world run almost exclusively by technology. In Death Match, Child steps comfortably into his m&eacute;tier as a mystery novelist. Luan Gaines/2004."},{"Title":"Death Match","review":"I recommend this book.

I enjoyed the read.A double suicide involving a dating service's clients causes a company (Eden, Inc.) to become concerned and they hire Christopher Lash, a former FBI forensic psychologist. His private investigation of these deaths (and others) is the substance of the book. To describe more would steal some of the suspense.It is a small thing, but in the \\"how I would improve the book\\" category, I would reduce the author's usage of the uncommon word \\"unrelieved.\\" It was distracting. Author Child describes a hall as \\"unrelievedly white\\" on page 67. When it popped up again on page 222 to describe a building as \\"unrelievedly modern,\\" I turned down the page corner.

Now he gets a new job, helping Eden, a very high-tech matchmaking company that matches it's couples in every imaginable way. Eden's problem is that one of their couples, a supercouple at that (which means they are a 100% perfect match), has been found dead in what appears to be a double suicide.It seems that there is no answer has any connections to Eden, but they want him to investigate further to make absolutely sure, before the media is all over it.The twist at the end is just the extra juice to hurl you over that after-taste in a nice refreshing way.The problems with the book is that some points are predictable, not VERY predictable, but it comes as no great shock. The plot moves along at a bit of a choppy speed, switching between amazing speed making the pages almost burn as you turn them so fast, and then it moves very slowely.Not really a problem, but I find it a bit odd that Lincoln Child left out something as regular as homosexuality in the matchmaking Eden has, it's always male/female, whcih is just a bit odd and sometimes you notice other missing things in the matchmaking process."},{"Title":"Death Match","review":"I am a huge fan of the Preston/Child coauthored books. Individually, I have never found their books to be quite as great. I believe this is a great writing duo because they apparently fill in each others' weak spots brilliantly. But Death Match, to me, is the best of their solo efforts. I will not sumarize the story as it's been done numerous times previously. Unlike Utopia, which had a brilliant premise that I felt was not developed as fully as it could have been, Death Match does fully explore the premise of this book. The premise however, is not nearly as exciting as that in Utopia (Child's former solo effort). The characters in Death Match were better written and unlike other reviewers I found the tech talk believable and not overly complicated (and I am no techie). This book moves at a furious pace although the stops into Lash's past seem unneccessary since it never does develop into anything. The ending is predictable and gives you a sense of deja vu to many other books and movies where humans build a too powerful computer. But, overall I enjoyed the book for what it is a fast thrill ride into the near future that is not beyond believabiility. I recommend this book to anyone with a few hours to kill.

Definitely a five-star read."},{"Title":"Death Match","review":"This is going to be quick because I listened to this book a while ago and can't remember a lot of the details! I do remember that I enjoyed it. I found the concept more interesting than I expected. Basically, couples who are deemed \\"perfect matches\\" by the high-tech matchmaking company, Eden, are committing mutual suicide at an alarming rate. Lash, a psychiatrist, is brought in to find out why people who have no known suicidal tendencies would do it. Eden is panicking, desperate to show that their process is not flawed, and therefore, not responsible.The plot probably could have moved along a little more quickly, but overall I thought it was a good listen. There was one big problem with the audio production - there are parts of the book where Lash is reading various psychological reports and test results, and in the audio they read out every bit, even the multi-digit id numbers and various other numerical data. It grew tedious, and I think they should have altered that a bit for the audiobook.If you are looking for a thriller that isn't mired in the military, in espionage, or in the financial district, I think this would be a good choice."},{"Title":"Death Match","review":"Great jobIt keeps you wondering. The ending is not what I expected. Didn't want the book to end. Can't wait for the next one"},{"Title":"Death Match","review":"Having read Relic and Reliquary by the author and Douglas Preston, I was expecting the same kind of wonderful, exciting, and highly entertaining thriller. Unfortunately, Lincoln Child really disappointed me. Only after wading through the first two-thirds of the novel did the action start to pick up and climaxed in a good surprise ending about the crazy computer and the mad scientist who created it. If you like techno-thrillers, it's passable, but in the case of this author, two writers collaborating are far better than this solo effort."},{"Title":"Death Match","review":"Lincoln Child does it again. I'm one of his biggest fans (I'm 6'4'' and 285) and \\"Death Match\\" was a big hit in my book. I don't know what it is about Lincoln that makes him one of my favorite authors, but he won me over again with this masterpiece. He drags you into the book with the charactors and makes you want to scream \\"No, don't do that or No, it not him\\". He gives you so much information, that you think you're watching a movie. This isn't a good book, it's a great book."},{"Title":"Death Match","review":"I loved Lincoln Child's other e-books from Amazon but \\"Death Match\\" was a bit tedious. The hero Dr.Christopher Lash was an animated mannequin. The plot along with Liza the super computer being the killer was obvious from the fourth chapter and was a rehash from a thousand books and movies from the seventies and eighties about computers killing people and or taking over the world. I give it two yawns, Speed Reader."},{"Title":"Death Match","review":"I truly enjoyed 'Utopia' quite a bit, and was thrilled when I saw Lincoln Child coming out with solo effort #2. If 'Utopia' was any indication, I was expecting something really thrilling... and as I started 'Death Match' I just KNEW I had found exactly what I was looking for to fill my reading void. I must admit Mr. Child has quite a talent for sustained energy, but after a long spell of VERY interesting storytelling, 'Death Match' began to slow down. This did not bother me in the least -- at FIRST. Almost EVERY novel has a slow portion or two. However when things began to shift downward, the pace almost slowed to a crawl compared to the wonderful beginning.'Death Match' has an absolutely brilliant opening chapter, one that literally grabbed me quite rapidly. It only began to build from there to the point that I (for a while anyway) thought Mr. Child had just about written the perfect Beach Read. Now I don't wish to come down on 'Death Match' too harshly, because I still enjoyed it quite a bit. But had I known better about how the pacing dropped off after a couple-hundred pages or so, I would most certainly have enjoyed it more.With that said, the story behind a computer-based Love-Connection business revolves around a company that is so certain of their ability to bring the perfect couples together they quite literally offer a money-back guarantee. Up front however is a rather stiff fee in order to join 'Eden', the amazing company dedicated to customer service and life-long loving relationships. Among the thousands of applicants floating around the almost living computer, every once-in-a-while a Supercouple is found, with virtually a 100% compatibility ratio. Only a small number of Supercouples have been produced in the time Eden has been operating, and these couples are something special to the incredibly dedicated employees. However, suddenly one of the couples are found dead in an apparent murder/suicide that literally defies ALL logic. Enter Christopher Lash, former FBI profiler who is brought in to determine how this seemingly perfect couple could meet such a tragic end. As Lash begins his investigation, he discovers from every single person he interviews that this couple was quite literally PERFECT for each other in every conceivable way.While making the rounds to uncover the truth, word reaches Lash of another Supercouple found under very similar circumstances. Things begin to spiral out of control rather quickly at this point. Lash begins to suspect murder, but cannot find ANY evidence to support this theory, because once again, this 2nd couple was as perfect for one another as anyone had ever seen, and ALL evidence again points toward murder/suicide.Many reviewers have pointed that Mr. Child has telegraphed the so-called surprise ending a little too much throughout the story, and while it did NOT come as any kind of a shock to me, and also despite the wheels of action slowing to a snails pace, I still found myself engrossed in this tale. Both Lincoln Child and Douglas Preston are amazingly talented authors, but I also believe as many others do, they are much like John Lennon and Paul McCartney -- really good separately, but they are MUCH better when they work together.For those who cannot wait until 'Brimstone' hits the shelves, get a quick fix by reading 'Death Match' and check out Douglas Preston's 'Codex', another fun summer Beach Read."},{"Title":"Death Match","review":"I have read all of Child's and Preston&Child;'s books and have never been dissapointed until now. The storyline became so un-believable that I could not take it anymore.**SPOILER**I stopped reading the book during the chapter where they lost control of the computer and they couldn't turn it off (because it controlled the power), they couldn't slow it down (because it had redundant systems), they couldn't bash it with a sledgehammer (because all of the computer housings were rebuilt w/ hardened steel cases), etc... All of this for a computer system used for match-making?The monster in Relic was actually more believable than this."},{"Title":"Death Match","review":"I was a little skeptical about this book after reading the works of Preston & Child together I wondered about how Lincoln Child would write to compared to his other stuff when writing with a partner.I got such a surprise at this simply brillant thriller that kept me up for nights and sometimes days and the pages turning. The thriller was endless and although nearering the end I had the story figured out, the chase was marvelous and it is a joy to read.Lincoln Child's use of language and description was simple yet imagative and the mystery keeps evolving into new and different heights. It is one of the best books I've read in 2007."},{"Title":"Death Match","review":"I listened to this book as a download from audible.com.I have always had this little nest of paranoia like a clutch of spider eggs waiting to hatch. It's concerns what I don't know about what I don't know. This book incubated that paranoia. If half of what is in this book can be done in reality, we should all run for the hills...we're being watched by the spiders. If that much information can be gathered on any one of us in a blink of an eye, I'm all for turning in our keyboards and going back to division the long way.From a privacy standpoint, this novel is truly frightening.However, I liked this book, especially the first half. It was charming and amazing, and truly mysterious as to how the murders were accomplished. I hadn't a clue. It touched on that romantic dream inside each of us that concerns falling madly in love with someone who's madly in love with us and who just happens to be perfect for us. It happened in my 40's for me, but even if it hadn't, I doubt I would sign up with \\"Eden\\" or Match.com or any of those places. This book taps into the idea that we can be matched to our perfect mate by technology. But it's presented in such a benign and charming way, one doesn't realize the slight malevolence behind it all...the loss of our most private beings.I have to say, I figured out the whodunnit part of this right after the first half of the book, and the flashing back to the killing of the policemen seemed to break the stride of the story at times, but all in all it was a good read. It's slow in places and sometimes a bit predictable, but there are many more moments when you wish that everything turns out okay because the characters deserve some happiness.Anyway, this is not for thrill a minute readers or people who are put off by computer science...but it is a thinking person's book. And like I wrote earlier, it will scare the bejeezus out of you about privacy. Interestingly, yesterday or the day before, CNN did a piece on exactly how much can be found about a person through technology. They chose random people in Maricopa County, AZ and then typed a few keystrokes. They confronted the people with the info they had found. One rancher had never owned a computer in his life and had never used a computer, but yet...there was his history right before him on paper.I have to say, that heightened my tension when finishing this book.This book is like a romantic fairy tale written by Bill Gates when he's in a real bad mood."},{"Title":"Death Match","review":"Death Match is a first-rate sci-fi thriller. There is no reason why it should not be made into a movie. In many ways it reminds me of Click Here for Murder because both weave an intricate web involving a \\"sentient\\", or self-aware, Artificial Intelligence and murders. However, CHFM tells the story from the sentient AI's point of view and has many long monologs that serve as philosophical discussions, while in DM, the supercomputer is a mystery that works in the background and only emerges into full view towards the end of the book. Not bogged down by philosophical details, DM is fast-paced and gripping throughout. It also introduces many psychological theories and programming technicalities, both of which I only half understand, although both make the straight thriller all the more fascinating. For me there are three main suspects in this story. Although I guessed the \\"murderer\\" when they first appears (by reading between the lines of a sentence that is suggestive of motives), I was not at all sure and kept vacillating among all three suspects. As I read on, I saw the ending coming but still appreciated it that things generally fall into place at the end.The scenario of technology controlling, monitoring and destroying people's lives and even altering behaviors by adjusting external factors is mind-boggling, yet so real it's chilling. With the ever growing connectivity and increasing loss of privacy, it is entirely possible that in the decades to follow, we will ALL be living in a fish bowl, ALL THE TIME. When everything is digitized, transmitted and shared among networks (governments, for-profit corporations, even junk-mail vendors), it will be as easy as a keystroke to change everything about you, your life history, your health, employment and financial records, your psychological profile, and many more, when the *right* people (not meaning \\"morally\\" or \\"ethically\\" *right*, but those with power and access) decide to do it.The philosophical discussion about AI becoming \\"self-aware\\" and beginning to adopt a personality and experience emotions can be endless. It is beautiful, yet dangerous, to have emotions, because besides joy and love, there are also jealousy and hate. When a supercomputer begins to experience the budding emotions of a child, its enormous power, unmatched by thousands or millions of geniuses, is also a gigantic liability to those around it. Can you imagine dealing with a willful child so powerful intellectually that s/he is well beyond your control?"},{"Title":"Death Match","review":"I am truly sorry to give this book only two stars. Like so many have stated, it started out promisingly only to dissolve into a hash of melodrama in the end. Without tipping the plot with spoilers that adorn other reviews, I guess there were so many ways the story could have gone and been so-o-o-o-o much more interesting.This is not to grind Mr. Child (the author). He and his associate, Mr. Preston are good writers and seemingly so much more approachable than others of their genre. I had read their work, \\"Ice Limit\\" and, after becoming enthralled in the somewhat amgiguous ending, I stumbled on a web site where they set up a sort of epilogue for the novel and some manner of chat room for their readers. Despite the heavy traffic, both authors were cordial enough to *personally* respond several times to comments and questions I made.Another thing I can't fault Mr. Child on is his lack of research. While maybe not 100% accurate in the area of computers -- I am a career software developer and noted a couple of clinkers -- he certainly made an effort to understand that discipline and try to get it right. I can only guess at a similar effort behind his representation of forensic psychology.I don't mind recommending the book; it's fun to read but dissapointing because of a rather pedestrian ending."},{"Title":"Death Match","review":"I was very entertained throughout the novel, however I do agree with the others about the predictable ending. Still very good and worth your time."},{"Title":"Death Match","review":"In his recent novel \\"Utopia\\" Author Lincoln Child envisioned a theme park that used state of the art computer technology to entertain the masses. Computer technology that was so sophisticated, it could and did kill under the noses of the operators. The same idea is behind the latest book, \\"Death Match.\\"In this case, the sophisticated computer technology is at work in \\"Eden, Incorporated.\\" For a $25,000 application fee Eden, Incorporated will provide the ultimate in match making services. An incredibly secretive company led by the reclusive Richard Silver, nobody outside the company knows how it works, but it does as literally tens of thousands of people can attest from all walks of life and all races. In some cases, six to be exact, the system has found the ultimate perfect match where couples were 100 compatible in every single testing point.Those 100 perfect matches are known at Eden as the \\"super couples.\\" One such super couple was Lewis and Lindsey Thorne. They were the first perfect match and like all the Eden clients followed extensively after the match to make sure everything was fine. By all appearances and testing criteria everything was fine. That is until both were found dead in what appeared to be a double suicide leaving their infant baby daughter alone in the world. Dr. Christopher Lash, once a forensic psychologist with the FBI with an impressive track record, both positive and negative, is brought in to provide a quick impartial investigation to determine what went wrong and if Eden's extensive profiling and tracking systems failed.His access is limited at first and Dr. Lash is unable to find anything. His frustration is compounded by his slow realization that this case is so similar to the events of three years ago that ultimately destroyed his family, his FBI career and nearly took his life. Unable to explain why the first couple died, he pushes for and is finally granted full access on the news that a second super couple has died, also victims of what appeared to be a double suicide.As Lash delves deep into the hidden world of Eden, Inc., he discovers that everything is not nearly as perfect as they would have the public believe. While the technology is advanced, it is built on the mind of man and every person has flaws hidden deep below the surface. On the hunt for a killer, he is slow to realize that his past can be exploited by a killer who believes Lash is a target that must be stopped before the secrets are uncovered. Anything, no matter what, when cornered will fight back which is something Dr. Lash never considered to his own peril.Much like \\"Utopia,\\" this novel is primarily an action adventure read with a constant viewpoint that technology is limited by the vision of the humans that create it. The characters are somewhat stereotypical and remind the reader heavily of those who populated \\"Utopia.\\" Again, there is the reclusive genius, the hard edged security chief who means well and has absolute loyalty to the reclusive genius, and the deeply troubled outside expert brought into research the problem. Then there is the clear and very obvious nod to a certain episode of the original Star Trek, intentional or otherwise, which to divulge more would ruin the book.At the same time, despite its limitations, this is another fast and fun read through the 356 pages. While the secondary storyline is weak and should have been given a little more depth and instead is barely noticed through much of the novel, the overall read keeps the reader heavily engrossed in the twisting chase. As such, like \\"Utopia\\" this novel is still worth the read and seems perfectly suited to be synthesized down into a movie."},{"Title":"Death Match","review":"As another reviewer pointed out, this book started out fast and then sort of faded out. For the first half of the book, I couldn't wait to keep reading to find out what would happen next. But during the second half, it began to drag, and I just wanted to finish it so I could move on to another book. I have to admit that I was surprised to discover who was responsible for the murders, though. I thought it was a little far-fetched, but I must admit that I didn't see it coming.All in all, this book isn't bad. This is what I would consider a &quot;beach read&quot; or summer book. Nothing too thought-provoking or deep, just an entertaining (for the most part) book. Not that there's anything wrong with that! Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Death Match","review":"Would you pay $25,000 and undergo a battery of rigorous physical and psychological tests to meet the man or woman of your dreams? In Lincoln Child's new thriller, &quot;Death Match,&quot; the eager clients of a company called Eden Incorporated are happy to do so. Unfortunately, a series of unexplained suicides among some of Eden's most well-matched pairs, known as &quot;supercouples,&quot; has begun to worry the company's executives. They bring in Christopher Lash, a forensic psychologist who once worked with the FBI, to find out why and how these men and women died. Were these deaths just bizarre coincidences or is something more sinister going on?&quot;Death Match&quot; is an intriguing thriller that touches on some contemporary themes, such as computer matchmaking, the lack of privacy in the age of the Internet, and the synergy between our government and large corporations. As Lash studies the deaths of these &quot;perfect&quot; couples, he learns that they were indeed happy in every way, with no psychological disorders that would predispose them to suicide. As Lash digs deeper, he makes some horrifying discoveries, and in the process, he places both his reputation and his life in danger.Child's writing is fast-paced and lively, and the author includes fascinating details about psychological testing and artificial intelligence. He also explores the difficulty that modern men and women have in finding an appropriate mate, and why they turn to computer dating services to solve their problems. Can a sophisticated computer come up with a foolproof way to bring the right people together, or is the attraction between individuals too indefinable to be captured by computer software?There are aspects of this novel that are far-fetched, and many readers will guess where the book is heading way before the denouement. However, the plot still plays out with sufficient suspense and flair to make &quot;Death Match&quot; a timely and engrossing thriller."},{"Title":"Death Match","review":"I am a big fan of Preston and Child, both their books written collaboratively and solo. I am currently working my way through every single one, have finished about half, and though I enjoy Child's solo books, as others state here, their collaborative works are just better, for some reason. I liked Utopia and Deep Storm, but this one was predictable - good and readable, but not very different from what you'd expect. Also as others have said, it was too tech geeky - there needs to be a more human element to the story, and this is where (I think) Preston contributes in their joint books. Anyway, thanks for the fun read, Mr. Child."},{"Title":"Death Match","review":"I've read several books by Lincoln Child (with and without Douglas Preston), but this was my first disappointment. It isn't that the story doesn't move well, it does. The protagonist wasn't dumb, but he was a bit too.....slow. I don't want to spoil the story for someone else, but I realized what was going on way before Chapter 57, when the main character finally finds out.The idea that someone's life can be so transparent (and manipulated) by digital media is frighteningly real. It's a good story, I just like the protagonist to figure out what's going on before--or at least at the same time--as I do."},{"Title":"Death Match","review":"I listened to the audiobook version, well read by Barrett Whitener.Mr. Child's ability to generate unputdownable pageturners is beyond any reasonable dispute, whether he's writing by himself or with Douglas Preston. I stayed up way too late listening to events unfold and trying to solve the mystery. The plot is absorbing and suspenseful. I am grateful that Mr. Child knows that the past tense of \\"spring\\" is \\"sprang\\"!I do have a few quibbles, though, which I offer mainly for Mr. Child if he happens to read readers' comments on Amazon.com.*** SPOILERS FOLLOW ****** STOP READING HERE UNLESS YOU WANT ADVANCE INSIGHTS INTO THE PLOT ***1. Why would Lash seemingly forget about Karen Wilner's last words and go off in an inconsistent direction?2. How could Lash, an intelligent man, fail to connect his personal logistical problems with events at Eden?3. I was able to figure out Liza's role and motivations midway through the novel. It's a tribute to its suspenseful qualities that I had no problem listening to the rest of it.4. How could all of those analytical and naturally skeptical people be so easily conned by the framing of Lash? They would only have had to send detectives to one Flagstaff motel to find out that Lash had been set up.5. It doesn't work for Edwin Mauchly to be ordering Lash to be killed. That's simply murder, and few people on earth are willing to murder for a corporation. This has always been my problem with James Bond movies, too, much as I like them: underlings are willing to kill and even be killed simply to carry out someone else's grand design, presumably for mere compensation.6. Also, once Mauchly does this, he's guilty of attempted murder and conspiracy to murder and one loses all ability to relate to him in any positive sense. He should have been prosecuted and imprisoned. Same for the subalterns firing shots at Lash.7. A big corporation like Eden would know it cannot falsely imprison its employees or administer truth serum to them. It might be able to question them, but if they refused, it could only fire them.8. The initial $100,000 consulting fee Eden offered Lash seemed rather paltry and I thought it odd that he was thrilled by it. The final compensation Eden offered Lash, another $100,000, seemed laughably low given what the corporation had subjected him to. This is New York, not Bhopal! Realistically, Eden would have arranged to pay Lash millions for negligence, perhaps through its insurers, and millions more out of its own funds for intentional misconduct.9. When things are burning, where are the sprinklers and fire extinguishers? I doubt anyone can avoid the requirements of the New York City building code, which is said to be stringent.Despite these quibbles, my hat is off to Child. I am in the embarrassing position of offering a critique, knowing full well that I could never write a novel of this quality."},{"Title":"Death Match","review":"For a summary of the book, see the editorial reviews above. Having read all the Preston/Child books and a few by each author's solo efforts, I can honestly say it's hard to tell the difference between the two. Child appears to grasp the technical intricacies of many subjects, while Preston has a handle on archeology and history. Then I'll read another book by either one and my opinion shifts again. It's almost as if they are the same person.In this book, Child pulls out all the stops to make geek-speak (computer lingo) extremely easy to grasp, though some of his literary allusions can fall flat. The one thing they both have in common are white-knuckle reads set to improbable scenarios with intelligent characters and involving plot lines.This book is no exception. I was up quite late on many a night and had to force myself to put it down so I could get to bed at a reasonable hour. My only complaint is this: the type size in the paperback edition is tiny! I have 20/20 vision, both near and far, and found myself squinting or losing my place on the page. The publisher, in the next print run, needs to seriously consider bumping up the font size a point or changing to a more readable font altogether. I think it's garamond which is notoriously hard to read at small sizes. Whatever the case, it was very frustrating and I almost considered going to the local drugstore and getting granny glasses for reading!So if that is not a big deal, or you have a Kindle, I implore you to read this great thrill ride of a book! It's timely, smart, funny, and will remind you of a few dating services currently in existence. That's when you'll get a chill."},{"Title":"Death Match","review":"I love all of Douglas Preston and Lincoln Child's books. This story is based on the use of a computer to determine the perfect mating of man and woman. But the computer is diabolical and kills some of its best matches and makes it look like suicide. It requires an eminent psychiatrist to go up against this \\"dating\\" computer. Some interesting concepts about how computers can conceivable control our lives. Fun Read!"},{"Title":"Death Match","review":"I'm a big fan of Lincoln Child (and Douglas Preston), and I rank Death Match among Child's better work. I think the only thing that really brought this book down from five stars to four was that Child's premise left the book rather predictable in terms of \\"who dunnit\\", and the \\"how\\" was not quite up to the standards of some of his other work (particularly with Preston).However, the book was a very enjoyable read. Anyone who enjoys the type of books written by Child and Preston should definitely check this one out."},{"Title":"Death Match","review":"I guess I shouldn't beat a dead horse here by saying how predictable the end was, but it was. That being said, I've always enjoyed Linc's writing and this book didn't ruin that.My biggest gripe was that the font was a little too tiny for my tastes, and that's not Linc's problem but the publishers. Despite everything, the story was a good ride, I could hardly put it down, and the ending satisfied me.

While reading it, however, I had the entire story figured out in the first 150 pages. On the plus side, the story is very well written, and I came away from the book wishing I could read more about these characters. The last \\"twist\\" in particular was more than obvious - I think those last three pages or so should have been omitted. If I were to read it again, I would have just skipped them! Overall, however, I would recommend this book to anyone looking for a good read."},{"Title":"Death Match","review":"This book really knocked me for a loop! I was not expecting a \\"page turner\\" that wouldn't let me go, but it was. I have not had such enjoyment from a book in a long time. Imagine going back after you are finished and rereading sections just for pure pleasure. I am a great fan of Preston & Child. I like their individual books too. I liked \\"Utopia\\". But this one is in another league all together. I think that anyone who tells you more about the plot than the book jacket does is doing you a great wrong. Among other things this is a good \\"who done it?\\" Child manages to prolong the uncertainty for a very long time - almost right to the end. But it is a lot more than a mystery. It's a love story, in fact several love stories. It's also a philosophical treatise - what, really is a man or woman? What is love? What does it mean when we say two people were \\"made for each other\\"? Child also poses the reader a puzzle in his acknowledgement section at the beginning: he states that Douglas Preston wrote one of the chapters. My guess is its the epilogue. What will be your guess?"},{"Title":"Death Match","review":"I am an avid fan and follower of Lincoln Child and Douglas Preston's works. I have all books, even the obscure ones, but this latest I put at the end of the shelf. If you are a 'puter techie and know all the jargon you will LOVE this book. Being only elementary level on that knowledge I had to skip over the &quot;tech talk&quot; and stick to the character plot. It was good - it was excellent in Child's own imaginary way --- but not up to his usual. I am looking forward to their new one, Brimstone, in August - but this one was only so so if you have read the rest. Still - if you are a collector --- BUY IT!"},{"Title":"Death Match","review":"Eden Incorporated is not your run-of-the-mill matchmaking service. For the rather lofty price tag of $25,000, Richard Silver, the company's brilliant and reclusive founder and Liza, the computer and its state of the art artificial intelligence software that is more person than machine, will guarantee to find you a \\"perfect\\" lifelong soul-mate. Well ... not quite perfect, but so close mind you that the paired partners certainly aren't complaining. So nobody was more surprised than Silver and Eden's management when Liza, despite overwhelming odds against such a match, found six absolutely perfect pairings.But when Lewis and Lindsay Thorpe, the first of Eden's starry-eyed perfect couples, are found dead as the result of an apparent double suicide, Eden's corporate alarms sound wildly and Christopher Lash, a former FBI forensic psychologist is hired to quietly investigate the death from the inside. Lash, struggling with demons from his own past and memories that the investigation has brought to the surface, finds himself faced with a situation spiraling completely out of control when another perfect couple is also found dead - a bizarre second double suicide!\\"Death Match\\" is first-rate brain candy when it's compared to other plot driven thrillers that seem much more screenplay than novel - James Patterson's and Iris Johansen's recent factory driven voluminous output comes to mind. But by comparison to the rather high standards that have been self-imposed by his own previous work - the Pendergast canon in conjunction with his partner, Douglas Preston, and his first solo effort,Utopia- \\"Death Match\\" falls well short of that mark.There were so many opportunities for those technical addenda, side-bars and essays that I think of as part and parcel of Child's and Preston's writing - forensics, artificial intelligence, the computer dating and match-making industries, the psychology of suicide, computer security and corporate espionage, for example. But, sadly, all of them (not to mention character development in the bargain) were virtually ignored and the only motive for turning the pages was a plot. Creative and well-crafted, to be sure, but rather naked and lonely!Well, I enjoyed it and I'll certainly look for more of his work. It just wasn't quite as cerebral a thriller as I had hoped for. Recommended for those looking for a fast-paced lightweight summer read. Three stars and a thumb-and-a-half!Paul Weiss"},{"Title":"Death Match","review":"This story really gives you something to think about if you have ever considered searching for a mate through a computerized service. Fast-paced and totally intriguing, the web that Childs weaves makes for a real page-turner! I found it a very suspensful story up until nearly the last when I had figured out the \\"whodunit\\" part of the story, but still I have to say that it was a fastinating web of mystery all the way to the end. Very well thought out and, as are all of his novels, a real winner. Anyone who enjoys a good mystery would enjoy this book."},{"Title":"Death Match","review":"I thought I had heard most of the possible things that could go wrong as concerns computer useage, privacy, ethics and bioethics. This book by Child brought to the fore a new and disturbing idea. Many people are using the Internet and computers as a way to make their lives better. In this case, singles use a company to find the person who is most likely to be a compatible companion for their lifetime. I know it is a frustrating world for young people to date in, and many don't want to waste time going to places like bars or even churches trying to find someone they can spend a lifetime with. So they turn to modern technology to provide the answer, just as many people are turning to technology to be able to have children. Unfortunately, even though many places are issuing privacy notices to people to assure them that the companies will keep very vital information secret, there are often ways to get around those promises of privacy.Child's imagination is a little scarier then most people's, from books of his I've read before. In this case, perfect couples are finding one another...but someone or something is killing them and leaving very little information as 'clues' as to whom it might be. Using the concept of artifical intelligence to spin possibilities, Child introduces the reader into a new world, where we may be creating our own problems. Not only are computers not 'hack-proof' so others with motives that are not nice can invade our homes and our places of business, but we also have to deal with the possible repurcussions of computers attaining a level of awareness, without having the conscience to go with it.Many people may say that something like this scenario of someone using computer information against the very people it is trying to serve as being far-fetched. I'd like to remind people that when Jules Verne wrote his sci-fi masterpieces, people also read his books and said those machines in his imaginations would never happen, but many of them are not only possible, but are in use now. Books like Child's make me a little uneasy, for fear it will give people 'ideas' that they normally would not have come up with by themselves. I guess we should count ourselves lucky that Child only writes these plots (rather than put them into action!) :-)Karen SAdler"},{"Title":"Death Match","review":"Lincoln Child has written a fun sci-fi suspense thriller in \\"Death Match.\\" The basic plot line is simple. People are lonely and lonely people will pay a lot to find their \\"perfect match.\\" Thus t is that a reclusive computer genius has launched Eden, an incredibly sophisticated matchmaking service.All is not well in paradise, however, as Christopher Lash, \\"a gifted former FBI forensic psychologist\\" soon learns. Summoned to Eden, he is told that Lewis and Lindsay Thorpe have committed suicide. What makes the Thorpes so special to Eden is that they are one of six couples Eden believes is perfectly matched, so happy they could not have committed suicide. Lash receives a handsome retainer to set aside his private practice and find out why the Thorpes did themslves in.You guessed it, of course: Lash after pursuing all the threads suspects that it is murder, not suicicde. His theory gains strentgth when a second perfect couple apparently commits suicide.The story is just plain fun. Suspects abound. The Eden vice-president who seems aloof and openly opposed to Lash. The beautiful, but reserved and cold Eden security operative. The super-genius who has devoted his life to building the super-computer that makes Eden possible. The plot is equally fun. Yes, you do have to swallow once in a while as you learn that Eden keeps track of all its applicants, successful or rejected, with an access to information that should land everyone connected to it in prison.If someone of lesser talent were doing it, all the loose ends would probably sink the story. But Child pulls it off, delivering a sci-fi thriller that is just plain fun.Jerry"},{"Title":"Death Match","review":"I bought this novel after I finished reading \\"Utopia\\"--which I consider the best thriller ever written. The characters in \\"Death Match\\" were likable, but the plot was more typical (and overused) than Utopia. Again, modern technological marvels come to take over the world. I was disappointed after my earlier read. As a stand alone novel, if you like the anti-technology type, it does earn its four star rating. The writing is top notch, the characters great and it is truly a page turner. But Mr. Child--please--give us a story line that has not been done before! I know you can do it!!"},{"Title":"Death Match","review":"I've read all the novels by Lincoln Child, including those co-written with Douglas Preston, and I would say this is typical of that remarkable team's individual efforts -- a strong premise flawed by a weak ending.The story involves Christopher Lash, a troubled ex-FBI psychologist who is hired as a consultant by Eden Inc., a matchmaking service that has flawlessly brought couples together using a supercomputer system named Liza. When Eden \\"supercouples\\" start committing suicide, Lash tries to figure out what went wrong, The characters are good, the dialogue is fine, and there are some spectacular touches such as The Tank, where computer avatars of Eden's applicants search for their matches.HOWEVER, there are some problems -- mostly small but one big. First, one victim gives a major clue to Lash, but it is never brought up again. Secondly, Lash receives harassing phone calls, makes an assumption about who is calling him, and confronts that person -- why doesn't he just do *69? Lash is increasingly harassed but just ignores it. etcThe book is 356 pages long and I figured out the mystery on page 170. The ending is derivative and unoriginal. I won't say more, but I kept reading, hoping that there would a twist. There wasn't.In the acknowledgments the author thanks Douglas Preston for supplying a crucial chapter. Too bad he didn't supply a more interesting ending as well."},{"Title":"Death Match","review":"I picked up this book looking for some light reading over the holidays. And I guess, based on that criteria alone, the book fulfilled its purpose. The overwhelming problem I had, however, is the fact that it is completely predictable. If you make it more than a third of the way through without having figured out the end, then you have probably never watched a movie, seen a television show, or read another book. I don't mean that as an exaggeration. It is just that obvious. Once I reached that point in the book I absolutely knew how the story would end--and not just a good guess about how it would end, but knew that there was no other way it could be concluded.I continued reading, however, partly because Child is a pretty good writer--the characters are interesting and the world very well thought out--but mostly because I had high hopes the author would surprise me with something unexpected. Unfortunately, that wasn't the case. In fact, the predictability became something of a plot hole for me. I kept wondering how the supposedly brilliant lead character could miss something that seemed so completely obvious.However, having said all that, if you go into it with the realization that you will see the ending coming well before you get there, the book is reasonably entertaining, fast paced, and makes for a nice little diversion."},{"Title":"Death Match","review":"The book was entertaining, a good mystery. However, it was completely predicable. After I figured out what was going to happen it was difficult to enjoy because there was nothing left to learn."},{"Title":"Death Match","review":"Lincoln Child's \\"Death Match\\" is a fast-moving, thrilling read about matchmaking gone awry. The reader is quickly introduced to the Eden Corporation, a company that guarantees (for the eye-popping sum of $25,000) to help singles find the love of their lives. Eden is so successful, by the way, that they have never had to refund anyone's fee. There's trouble in paradise, however, when two of the corporation's \\"supercouples\\" (couples that are *perfectly* matched with one another on all criterion) are suddenly found dead in possible murder/suicide situations.Eden's founder and CEO, Richard Silver (a reclusive \\"Howard Hughes type\\") hires psychologist and former FBI agent, Christopher Lash, to investigate the tragedies so that the company's name and reputation are not damaged. What Lash finds during his investigation is more than he bargains for. Child takes the reader on a whirlwind trip through the final 300 pages of the novel with many plot twists and turns along the way. While, the ending is not unexpected (at least by this reader) it is not totally unsatisfying, either. In this reviewer's humble opinion, the ending is the only reason that keeps this book from being a 5 star book.If you're a fan of Preston and Child's many novels or any of those by Michael Crichton, then you will find a lot to like about \\"Death Match\\"."},{"Title":"Death Match","review":"I truly enjoyed 'Utopia' quite a bit, and was thrilled when I saw Lincoln Child coming out with solo effort #2. If 'Utopia' was any indication, I was expecting something really thrilling... and as I started 'Death Match' I just KNEW I had found exactly what I was looking for to fill my reading void. I must admit Mr. Child has quite a talent for sustained energy, but after a long spell of VERY interesting storytelling, 'Death Match' began to slow down. This did not bother me in the least -- at FIRST. Almost EVERY novel has a slow portion or two. However when things began to shift downward, the pace almost slowed to a crawl compared to the wonderful beginning.'Death Match' has an absolutely brilliant opening chapter, one that literally grabbed me quite rapidly. It only began to build from there to the point that I (for a while anyway) thought Mr. Child had just about written the perfect Beach Read. Now I don't wish to come down on 'Death Match' too harshly, because I still enjoyed it quite a bit. But had I known better about how the pacing dropped off after a couple-hundred pages or so, I would most certainly have enjoyed it more.With that said, the story behind a computer-based Love-Connection business revolves around a company that is so certain of their ability to bring the perfect couples together they quite literally offer a money-back guarantee. Up front however is a rather stiff fee in order to join 'Eden', the amazing company dedicated to customer service and life-long loving relationships. Among the thousands of applicants floating around the almost living computer, every once-in-a-while a Supercouple is found, with virtually a 100% compatibility ratio. Only a small number of Supercouples have been produced in the time Eden has been operating, and these couples are something special to the incredibly dedicated employees. However, suddenly one of the couples are found dead in an apparent murder/suicide that literally defies ALL logic. Enter Christopher Lash, former FBI profiler who is brought in to determine how this seemingly perfect couple could meet such a tragic end. As Lash begins his investigation, he discovers from every single person he interviews that this couple was quite literally PERFECT for each other in every conceivable way.While making the rounds to uncover the truth, word reaches Lash of another Supercouple found under very similar circumstances. Things begin to spiral out of control rather quickly at this point. Lash begins to suspect murder, but cannot find ANY evidence to support this theory, because once again, this 2nd couple was as perfect for one another as anyone had ever seen, and ALL evidence again points toward murder/suicide.Many reviewers have pointed that Mr. Child has telegraphed the so-called surprise ending a little too much throughout the story, and while it did NOT come as any kind of a shock to me, and also despite the wheels of action slowing to a snails pace, I still found myself engrossed in this tale. Both Lincoln Child and Douglas Preston are amazingly talented authors, but I also believe as many others do, they are much like John Lennon and Paul McCartney -- really good separately, but they are MUCH better when they work together.For those who cannot wait until 'Brimstone' hits the shelves, get a quick fix by reading 'Death Match' and check out Douglas Preston's 'Codex', another fun summer Beach Read."},{"Title":"The Duchess of Duke Street: A novel","review":"During times of stress I pick up a quick read. This one was much better than most. Characters were very real to me and the plot kept me inovlved and engaged."},{"Title":"Seasons of Sun & Rain","review":"I was fascinated by the characters in this book and by the way in which it was written. While I was puzzled at first as to why so much of the discussion revolves around past events, I soon realized the beautiful interwoven commentaries this allowed Dorner to make about the connections between memory and self-definition as well as about what the loss of memory truly does mean. I finished the book in a 24-hour period, unwilling to put it down and wishing that I could follow these six women for just a bit longer through their lives."},{"Title":"Seasons of Sun & Rain","review":"I won this book in a drawing and had no idea the jewel I now had in my hand. Once I began this story I could not put it down because I became so entwined into the lives of these friends who became acquainted in college. This book mirrors the relationships so many of us have in our own lives---creating friendships, losing contact for a while, and rebonding later. These relationships are part of who we are and continue to be important to us. The beautiful friendships, acceptance of others, and how each of us perceive the &quot;role&quot; others have in our friendship are examined. I had never thought much about this until I read this book."},{"Title":"Seasons of Sun & Rain","review":"I wish that I could afford to send a copy of this book to all my friends."},{"Title":"Seasons of Sun & Rain","review":"A girl friend recommended this book to me because, like the women in the book, Seasons of Sun and Rain, I also have a long time group of girl friends that travel together. While these friends are \\"only\\" 50 (and we are all in our upper 60's), the themes of long time friendship remains the same. While one of the group is experiencing early onset Alzheimer's, and the rest of the group is trying to come to terms w/this, another one in the group (spoiler alert) is asked to help her exit when the time comes. If there is any plot at all, it concerns the decision that has to be made. Mostly this book is a retrospective of their trip w/flashbacks on how and when they became friends. I found it sad, moving, sentimental and an engrossing read. I also saw myself in the woman experiencing Alzheimer's."},{"Title":"Seasons of Sun & Rain","review":"No matter how &quot;important&quot; a subject is (and Altzheimer's is an important subject), it is not sufficient in itself to carry a reader through a story, much less through the entire plot of &quot;Seasons of Sun and Rain.&quot; As a former student of Dorner's, I am disappointed to see her falling back on the literary habits of rural college professors, who almost invariably write about characters who sit around and think; and the women in &quot;Sun and Rain&quot; think A LOT. When you read this book, you keep waiting for the story to begin. The action is minimal--&quot;How's your daughter?&quot; &quot;Fine.&quot; etc.--while too much uninteresting background information is dumped onto the reader, who is called upon to keep these interchangeable women straight. And that's all backwards. A story is something that happens forward, but most of this novel consists of internal reveries by the characters. Literature can have subtext, but a book should not be ALL subtext, and the real challenge for any writer is to develop a story dramatically, with interesting ACTION and DIALOGUE, and even FEELINGS, not &quot;realistic&quot; (humdrum)acts and words by characters who don't do much. (By the way, having a superior intellectual &quot;insight&quot; is not the same as having an honest feeling.) There's too much reminiscing in this book, and there's way too much intellectualizing! That's not literature; that's a sermon."},{"Title":"Seasons of Sun & Rain","review":"I wrote Summers with the bears and was the publisher of Cook County News Herald in Grand Marais, stumbled onto this book in our library and saw GM in book so brought it home where my wife read it in one and half days.

For students and researchers in the field, it may not be much useful as the works came from early 60s to late 80s.

She had the ability to provoke so many emotions in a reader, and Petals on the Wind, was no exception.Although Cory didn't make it, Cathy, Chris, and Carrie are out of the attic. Although Cathy is confused about her and Chris's relationship, she is sure that there is only good times ahead of them... right? But when Carrie becomes violently ill on a bus they are taking to Florida, Cathy begins to worry. Fortunately, a kind woman named Henrietta Beech, (who is a mute woman), takes them to her boss, a doctor named Paul Sheffield, who hides sad secrets. He is taken with the three oprhands, especially when he hears their story of the attic... and their mother. Cathy, suffering from the emotional damage of being locked away in the attic, is confused about relationships, and drifts between Paul (who is 24 years older than she), Julian Marquet, (a fellow dancer with a violent temper), Chris (Her brother), and ultimately, Bart, (her mother's husband).

Even at any cost."},{"Title":"Petals on the wind","review":"I was first captivated by Flowers in the Attic many years ago when I first lifted the cover and engrossed myself in the poetic style of the author's chilling tale. The story itself is a phenomenal surprise. The events that occur for the four children from Gladstone, PA left me feeling bitter and restless. Luring me into the rest of the series, which is the most captivating of all the V.C. Andrews series, in my opinion. Petals on the Wind is a spectacular journey of Catherine Dahl's life that makes the reader feel the bitter vengence that boils through the heroine's veins. It is a sad and beguiling tale, but truly a great accomplishment for the wonderful author, Cleo Virgina Andrews. It has remained among my favorite books for years, and to this day, I still pick it up periodically to re-read. It is a must-have for any book lover!!!"},{"Title":"Petals on the wind","review":"Can anyone create characters like VCA?

I can feel their heartbreak when Carrie dies, feel Paul's mixed emotions about falling for Cathy, etc. etc.As for the incest. I just have to set this straight.

The Dollanganger series always have incest in them and she makes it sound as if its OK! And I like the books. It takes some writer to write about all these controversial topics that are considered offensive and make it sound good."},{"Title":"Petals on the wind","review":"It's really sad how much of a difference you can tell b/w the books written by VC Andrews herself and the books written by her ghostwriter. The entire Flowers series shows what a genius storyteller VCA really was and how now, the company, and the ghostwriter have pretty much tarnished that image with the new novels and the repeated sereies which is the Hudson. Had the Hudson family series been written by VC Andrews and not a ghostwriter, it would have been one heck of a groundbraking series.But on to the review of Petals on the Wind: Petals is a great book.

Not one to be missed at all."},{"Title":"Petals on the wind","review":"The second of the &quot;Flowers in the Attic&quot; series, I believe, is the best book in the aforementioned series. It tells of Cathy's incline in the world of ballet, her affairs, and the bitterness she harbors towards her grandmother, her mother, and her mother's betrayal. She wants revenge on the two and will stop at nothing to gain it, but even better is the longing that Chris has for her, and her passionate relationship with another prominent ballet dancer, Julian.

Eventually I gave in and read FITA. I was astounded, how could I have missed such a deeply emotional, gripping story? Having eagerly read to the end and cheered at their freedom, I reached for the sequel and started to read...and boy did I wish I had stopped at book 1. Cathy, our protagonist, turns into the most feather-headed, sex obsessed victim I've ever seen. I could understand Paul (the whole gratitude thing) and I could see why she had the hots for Chris, (the whole attic thing) but Julian? From the strong, fairly mature character in the 1st book, she transforms into a petulant, whining, constantly crying version of her mother.VC Andrews should have stopped at FITA. Their lives slipped from drama to melodrama and Cathy (who was the only sane voice in the FITA) turns into a throughly dependent, foolish bitch. The book stumbles from crisis to crisis, with half the cast dying and Cathy moving in with her brother, who can't seem to get over his 'love' for her. I was so disappointed that I read it in bits and ignored most of the book. Read FITA but leave the rest on the shelf."},{"Title":"Petals on the wind","review":"I would've given it five if Cathy didn't change so much. In &quot;Flowers in the Attic&quot; she was sweet, innocent, nice, caring, etc. Now she seems conceited, slutty, and whorish. The way she threw herself at Paul (and she did throw!) was disgusting. What was she doing? Practicing her seducing skills? I mean, &quot;You're only 24 years and seven months older.&quot; So what?! He could be your Dad! I felt the time in the attic really gave Cathy some severe mental problems. Than Bart, that was slutty again. Can't she get revenge some other way than her body? I really wanted to see Cathy become a famous ballerina, than face Bart and her mother again. This time, Bart falls in love with her, her, not her young body, not her seducing skills, not how much she looks like her mom, but her. Instead, Cathy uses her body, not her mind or talent, to sleep with every single guy interested so she can get revenge. If I were her mother, I would be laughing my head off at her stupidity! I really felt bad for Chris too. The reason I gave it four stars instead of two is because of V.A's talent to put what is so looked down upon in society as such a normal,and sweet thing. I felt sorry for both Cathy and Chris, they were doomed by the grandmother and their relations (brother and sister.). And some of the things Cathy did, I did understand a bit, how she thought if she slept with Paul, her brother would be mad and forget about her. But how many times do you need to sleep with Paul? She's like an older version of Lolita, only more perverse."},{"Title":"Petals on the wind","review":"I contiually chastised myself for reading such trash, but I guess that only added to the fun... it really makes me wonder how the author's mind worked! Constant themes of incest, abuse, humiliation (miscarriages in public)tragedy, despair, hopelessness and hate fill the pages of this book. Still, it has an innocent, lilting feel to it... strange, that! There were probaly some incidents that werent neccessary to mention, and she was raped so often, that it made rape seem tolerable. But now I cant bring my self to read anything but this author! God help me. The one part that touched me was when Carrie gave up hope. She had been so young and impressionable while living in the attic, that there seemed no way for her to ever believe in herself again. She really did believe she was the Devil's Spawn. Poor darling..."},{"Title":"Petals on the wind","review":"Lots of reviews on the story. I agree with many of the critics. Cathy has devolved in this story to be akin to another Cathy I despise, the whiny selfish stupid Cathy of Wuthering Heights. However, I don't despise this Cathy quite that much, as I take into consideration the fact that she's screwed up from her horrid childhood and has not received any psychological counseling at all...how can one be expected to suddenly become a normal productive member of society merely because she was taken in and cared for...by a man who gave her 15 year old self negligees for her birthday? Overall, I liked Paul. He is flawed like everyone else....Cathy should have married him instead of Julian. IMHO, the biggest mistake Paul made was in giving the under-aged Cathy those nighties.I can understand Cathy's flaws; doesn't make me like her very much but I can understand them. Christopher...poor Christopher. V.C. Andrews turned him into a glowering nuisance; his jealousy surfaced every time Cathy tried to break free of that unhealthy love they shared. Carrie...I can understand her as well.While this book was not as well written as its predecessor, and it had an extra element of trashy/smutty romance novel sex that would have been better left out and merely alluded to, it was OK. My main reason for giving it 2 stars is for the actual Kindle Edition.I have to ask a question of someone who knows the original Petals on the Wind inside and out: I read the book years ago and forgot much of the detail; I just recently read the Kindle edition. In the Kindle edition, at some point Cathy ends up standing next to Corinne in a jewelry store where she (Corinne) is ordering a locket that a girl will treasure forever. Cathy is upset that Corinne would buy something for another girl to treasure when she ignored their existence when Paul sent the court petition for her to appear at the custody hearing.Then nothing is ever made of that locket Corinne bought again. Christopher gave Cathy a locket for her birthday, but I was expecting to read about Cathy receiving one in the mail or after a performance from her mother...but she never did...it was never mentioned again. I am wondering if there was something missing from the Kindle edition that was in the original?I paid $8 for this and am sorely disappointed to find it so full of typos that it became ridiculous. Who edits these things? They should be fired, or maybe they should hire someone with a better grasp of English grammar. Granted, it is just a trashy novel...but I like the trashy novels that I pay good money for to be free of typos.

Once they discover that their mother has been poisoning their doughnuts with arsenic, they knew they'd have to run away if they had any chance to survive. Their plan is to work at a circus until they make enough money to fulfill their dreams. Chris wants to be a doctor and Cathy wants to be a prima ballerina. But things don't work out the way they'd planned. Instead, they meet a lonely doctor who takes them under his care. He pays for Chris's medical education, sends Carrie to a private school (with disastrous results), and falls in love with Cathy, who becomes a famous ballerina for some time. Things appear to look up for the \\"Dresden Dolls,\\" as they were known as children. However, they may have left the attic, but the horrible memories from that attic haven't left them -- especially for Cathy. Everything that goes wrong in her life has a scapegoat: her mother. A mother that leaves her children to wither away and die in an attic just so she could inherit millions and marry a younger man. Through tragic deaths, bad marriages, inappropriate incestuous feelings, and clandestine affairs, Cathy manages to carry her one-track determination to make her mother pay for everything she has put her through...Petals on the Wind is flooring. It's better than Flowers in the Attic -- more haunting and thought provoking. You feel the psychological trauma and emotional scars the characters feel. You feel awful for Cathy and Chris, even when they fight for the forbidden desires and feelings a brother and sister shouldn't feel towards one another (well, Cathy does most of the fighting, for Chris is determined to live a life of sin with his sister). Incest is one of the main themes in this series. Even though the scenes centered on incest are disturbing and difficult to read at times, it is understandable that the author develops this storyline, for nature versus nurture is another main theme in this series. It appears that the less Cathy wants to be like her mother, the more she finds herself doing the very things her mother would do. Carrie's story, while short and somewhat underdeveloped, is the saddest of them all. You feel her anguish, her inferiority complex, her fear of rejection, and you'd be made of stone if you weren't touched by her sad story. All of the characters are complex and well written, all with shades of gray, none of them perfect. V.C. Andrews was a wonderful writer of gothic suspense. I have If There Be Thorns and Seeds of Yesterday lined up, and will also pick up the prequel called Garden of Shadows. If you haven't read V.C. Andrews, then hurry up and pick up this series. Don't let the controversial theme put you off. This is great writing, folks!"},{"Title":"Petals on the wind","review":"Petals on The Wind is not a great book. It is a necessary read because after Flowers in the Attic, one cannot help but want to go on to the sequel, and after all it is an entire series of four books. However, there are many problems which other reviews have duly noted, the major ones being that the character of Cathy is extremely annoying, and not like the caring, sensitive, shy girl in the attic. Further, it is really hard to like any of the men she gets involved with, and sadly, and most regrettably, there is little to no development of Chris's character. We mostly see him pining for his sister and turning up to save her from bad situations. I was definitely expecting more from the book. Cathy seemed too concerned with her looks and so ever aware of her irresistible sexuality! Not to mention that she contradicts herself many times in the novel. Why is it that only after a husband or lover dies does she realize how much she loved them. It is frustrating to say the least. Cathy goes on and on about how she loved \\"dark\\" haired men with moustaches, only to confess at the end of the book that this was her mother's influence! and that the blonde, blue-eyed Chris was ideal. Somehow, this could have been written better.She never fully becomes the prima ballerina she could have been and this is a curious let down to the reader. We learn nothing of Chris's life at medical school, his friends, girlfriends etc. I was really hoping for this!The relationship between Cathy and Paul was not a good one, I feel that by taking it to the sexual level it somehow cheapened it, and I can't say what purpose it served for moving the narrative along. Julien was a one-dimensional character from start to finish, and completely did not elicit any sympathy from me! Bart can be placed in this same category. They came across as just sperm-donors!Having said all this, the book is still satisfying because it follows Flowers in the Attic, and there are some good moments, as when Cathy gets \\"revenge\\" on her mother, but this too is somehow ineffectual, and I'm not sure what happens at the end, because originally it seemed to say that the mother had gone mad, but then it suggested that it might be a ruse by her to avoid justice. Another good moment is seeing the grandmother humbled, but making her dumb somehow lessened the dramatic effect.The truth remains that the incestuous and tempestuous relationship between Cathy and Chris is what enthralled many readers, and taking the emphasis off of them to place on wishy washy characters was not worth it."},{"Title":"Petals on the wind","review":"Near the end of the book, Cathy and Chris interrogated their mother, during which time they told her about a recent discovery they had made in Foxworth Hall of a small, hidden room from which emanated a foul odor. The implication was that this room was their dead brother Cory's final resting place; what I couldn't understand was why the reader learned of this secondhand and in passing from the characters. Why didn't the reader see Cathy and Chris actually discovering and opening the hidden room? Where was the firsthand account? I searched the entire book thinking I had overlooked this important event in the story but couldn't find it. Was it mistakenly edited out?The Cathy character came across as annoying, not so much for her thirst for vengeance (who could blame her?) but for her narcicissm and nymphomania. Every time I turned another page, she was either going on about how beautiful she was or embarking on another sexual conquest.Virtually everybody in this book seemed to have a gripe about something. Okay, maybe Chris, Cathy and Carrie had a right to be whiney and complaining; who wouldn't after having your mother lock you away for three years and literally try to kill you? But I thought POTW could have been just a bit more lighthearted; after all, they're out of the attic! But it was the same grousing, just a different topic.I think Cathy's vengeance could have materialized a bit earlier, but her method of choice (initiating an affair w/her mother's second husband) really wasn't possible until her own husband had died, which didn't happen till the second part of the book. Oh well, I was able to rest easier knowing that Corinne had gotten hers in the end."},{"Title":"Petals on the wind","review":"The second book in the thrilling Flowers in the Attic saga. After years of torture and suffering in the Attic of Foxworth Hall Cathy, Chris, and Carrie are finally free (!), but the twisted story doesn't end there. After a long trip they are forced to go to a doctor when Carrie becomes violently ill. This is where they meet Dr. Paul Sheffeild who soon takes them into his home when he hears their unfortunate story. Cathy continues to persue her dream of becoming a prima ballerina and winds in and out of various relationships. After her dancing partner and lover, Julian, dies she goes to Barthomelow Winslow to have him get money from Julian's life insurance. After a few run-ons she decides to move next to him and make him fall in love with her as she gets revenge on her mother. (finally) One word for this book : WOW! It was very exiting. I couldn't put it down. If you want to see what happens to the Dollanger family and want to see Cathy give some serious payback to their selfish mother read this book! If you like horror, romance, and a dash of suspence rolled up in one, go for V.C. Andrews. But be sure to read Flowers in the Attic before this one or you may be left in the dark. Then you may move on to the next book,If There be Thorns, which only gets crazier!"},{"Title":"Petals on the wind","review":"WARNING!!! SPOILERS AHEAD!!!This one's a rather disappointing follow-up to the tight and engrossing Flowers In The Attic. In the first book, we become so involved with the plight of the four Dollanganger children and the torment they suffer under the hands of Momma and Grandmother. We also find ourselves shocked but sympathetic to the love that blossoms between the two eldest children. We cheered when they finally find freedom. And how do the kids find freedom?Well, each has their own trauma but I have to say that even if traumatized, Catherine the protagonist becomes the most annoying and hateful character in this sequel. My sympathy for her went out the window. She is so obsessed in getting revenge that she manages to mess up so many lives including her own yet always blames Momma for her trouble. I nearly cheered for Momma in this sequel. Seriously. That's how annoying Cathy becomes. It's like she left her brain behind in the attic. In trying so hard to be not like Momma and not surrender to her incestuous love for her brother, the golden-boy Chris (who is forever faithfully in love with her and saves her from disasters everytime!), she goes from one man after another...each man getting worse as she progresses. First it's her kind but somewhat lecherous guardian who is at least 25 years older than her, then she goes to an abusive dancer named Julian who becomes her husband, then the biggest jerk of the lot, her philandering stepfather Bart (a.k.a. Corrine/Momma's lapdog). Isn't that nice? Her love life , or more appropriately her sex life ( I don't think she loved any of these men despite her protests that she loved them...AFTER they're dead!) is the stuff Jerry Springer producers would kill for. By the end of it all, I started wishing Chris would do a Rhett Butler and tell Cathy, \\"Frankly my dear, I don't give a damn!\\" Then slam the door on her stupid face."},{"Title":"Petals on the wind","review":"Whatever happened to the Dollanganger kids? The ones locked in the attic and tortured for 3 years 4 months and 16 days in \`Flowers In The Attic.'After escaping from the hell of the attic of Foxworth Hall the three surviving children, Cathy, Chris, and Carrie hope to start over and live a normal life. They are immediately blessed when Carrie is taken to the hospital and they meet a wealthy widowed doctor whom takes them into his home to raise them as his own simply out of good will. Now they will be able to regain their health and attend school.But with the emotional scars of the attic can they ever hope to live a normal happy life? This is answered the first night when Cathy bursts into tears realizing that she will not be able to sleep in the same bed with Chris.These first 100 pages of adapting to the real world are absolutely heart stopping. Cathy and Chris rekindle their love and the metal scars of the attic are apparent by the way the children begin having fond memories of the attic. Yes, FOND MEMORIES OF THE ATTIC!!! Much in the way convicts become addicted to the prison life. Cathy and Chris remember being able to express their love openly, Carrie remembers playing with her twin brother Cory. In one scene at Cathy's insistence they drive back to Foxworth Hall. Carrie cheers, \\"It's the house we used to live in with Cory!\\" It's lines like that which really pull on the reader's heartstrings and brought me to tears.Free of the attic, Cathy and Chris are also able to view their love objectively. They agree they are only in love because of the trauma of the attic which should not have happened. But the reality is it did happen and they are in love.I don't want to give away any spoilers so I can't describe too much of the plot, but unfortunately the story declines over 18 years as narrator Cathy makes ALL the wrong decisions with her life in love, sex, and marriage. It's really hard to blame her problems on the trauma of the attic because they could just be a result the stupid choices young women make.This is what's so infuriating about the book. I felt like reaching into the book and strangling Cathy because she is the villain of the story. I no longer felt sorry for her because she was responsible for all the misery. For example, she turns down marriage proposals from two men she would have been perfect with.These years of Cathy's life are a testament to VC Andrews' writing talent because most of it focuses on ballet, the most hated subject known to man. Yet I didn't fall asleep or attempt suicide once while reading them. Truly this is a feet only accomplished by VC Andrews.After the first 100 pages, Chris is really kicked to the side in the novel. He goes from hero to zero. Once he leaves for medical school that's all he does, goes to medical school. He really doesn't do anything. Even when he unexpectedly appears at the climax he still doesn't do anything.Chris's scar from the attic is that over the 18 years he loves only Cathy. She keeps telling him to fall in love with someone else, the first girl he meets. He always responds that he already did. Again, the heartstrings.Carrie's scars of the attic are arguably the most tragic because her growth was stunted and she cannot fit in socially. She was also deeply affected by the Grandmother's words that she was damned and should never have been born. These lies are something Carrie actually believes.In the closing act Cathy does seek out revenge on the Foxworths. But she's able to mess this up as well so it seems to harm her more than it does the Foxworths. The revenge seems rather hollow. Too little too late.The epilogue to \`Pedals In The Wind' does have a happy ending. Or the happiest ending we could expect in a book series this depressing. It leaves the reader even angrier with Cathy for not achieving this happy ending 18 years earlier when she had so many opportunities.In conclusion, \`Pedals In The Wind' really is a great book, but as other readers here on Amazon have already noted, it could have been so much more.The first 100 pages start off very very strong and beat me into tears as the children marvel at everyday things like food and sunlight that we take for granted. The romantic scenes between Cathy and Chris are absolutely heart stopping. After \`Flowers In The Attic' simple lines like, \\"What we did was sinful wasn't it Chris?\\" say so much just remembering reading those words stops my heart."},{"Title":"Petals on the wind","review":"'Petals on the Wind' is a wonderful book because it has both fantasy and reality combined, and one cannot stop reading it. I read it when I was only 11, although it is somewhat &quot;adult&quot;. I've read it about 5 times since. Every character has depth and is very real... even characters who are evil are easy to forgive. It brings every emotion to you imaginable- fear, anger, love, hate, sadness. You end up wanting to know more about Catherine and the people in her life. The diction brings a magical feel to the book and it can be very haunting. It is my favorite book out of the whole V.C.

Not as good as 'Flowers' almost but not quite, very good novel all together though! 'Thorns' is good to!"},{"Title":"Petals on the wind","review":"I was captivated by Flowers in the Attic and so had to read this. It answers a lot of questions left by the first book and develops the story further."},{"Title":"Petals on the wind","review":"This is the original sequel to \\"Flowers In The Attic\\". The 3 Dollanganger children escape Foxworth Hall, and into a world that in someways stood still in time, but others changed since being locked in the attic almost 4 years earlier. This is still Cathy's story as she chronolizes what happens after the escape. They find themselves on a bus going south to Florida originally, but make it only as far as South Carolina where Carrie is so violently ill that they can't go on, and make acquaintance with a black woman who's a maid to a local doctor and take them to his house. This doctor has a checkered past of the mysterious death of his wife and son, and he decides to take care of them, and gives them a new life, a new outlook, but this is not enough for Cathy as she wants her mother to pay as she continues to read about her mother, and how her life is so gratifying. Chris tries to make her see that it is better to just let go, but to Cathy this just cuts way too deep as she feels betrayed by her mother making her lose out on her innocence, and losing all her friends, and her identity. I'm here to say that the minute a person moves towards freedom it's assumed that they know what they're doing otherwise they wouldn't have made such a bold daring move, but in reality that's not necessarily the case. Here they cast thier fates to the wind, and it was here that the 2 stronger children had to mother over the youngest one as her twin died, and now she's not able to be strong independent anymore, and they had to learn things on thier own. Alot of people seem to hold stock in this theory called \\"The School Of Hard Knocks\\", and it's praised as a hallowed university that is to be revered, and honored. To be honest it's a wilderness that can make a person all devoid of love, sensitivity especially when the drugs are applied, and the systems are all dried up, and out. After all that's what drug means is to dry up, and out. People tend to get tougher when this happens, and most tend to forget about the pains, and hardship after taking this drug administered by the school of hard knocks, and that drug is Stoicism. It's where we convince ourselves that this happened for a reason, and there's nothing that can be done about it...especially now, so it's best to drop it, and move on, but the side effects are, and they have not studied this to see if little, or no effect went on is the loss of love, compassion, and innocence. I admit this is a rather long drawn-out book, and at times it was hard for me to read as I would see poor Carrie just trying everything to get herself on with living only to see her kill herself the same way that her beloved twin was murdered, Chris even I don't feel that it's morally correct for a brother and sister to be married, and having babies together my heart ached for him to see him going through the story without the one love of his life. I know that feeling all too well, and when Cathy fell on her face I'm sure that Chris wanted so much for her to just come to him, and allow him to make it all better; I know with girls I was interested in dating that I'd see them fall flat, and wanted so much to be the one to rescue them, but I'd see them dig thier heels in even deeper, and more determined not to come to me. However, I know that Cathy with all the positive things happening to her it didn't mean a thing because I'm sure that while the best thing a person can do for themselves is to learn to be self-sufficent the worst thing is to not have someone teach you how to do this, and find out you have to do it all on your own, and you have to pick and choose the people that will teach you when you haven't really had the experience that would've helped you out. Cathy would try, and try, but it was no use her soul would not be calm until she confronted her mother, and see why she just left her children up in the attic to rot. Alot of confrontation would go down in this book, but to be honest it was hard to really get into this book until about page 200 which is about two-thirds of this book. I feel that it was a little too long, but considering the way it had to tie into where Chris and Cathy took Cathy's two boys, and moved to California alot of things had to be tied up. This is a guidebook for revenge if I ever read one, and I know that in alot of people it's a driving force. I know it is with me, so I want to caution those who want to pursue it don't forget how human you are. I mean it don't forget how human you are because we're all cut from the same cloth, and that was cast by Adam and Eve in the Garden Of Eden."},{"Title":"Petals on the wind","review":"This book held my interest, when I had nothing else to do and wanted to escape \\"real life.\\"The people in this book, Cathy, Julian, Dr. Paul, Chris, Carrie, et al., are fictional, but close enough to make things interesting.The problem with these people is that they have no metaphysical side at all, except maybe some superstitions about life after death (Cory's in heaven along with his father, waiting for whoever comes next).But who am I to say they're superstitions? Maybe there is a fictional heaven.No, I don't mean like the \\"grandmother's\\" metaphysics, whipping folks who look at the opposite gender, that's not spiritual, but it does sound like something a misguided fundamentalist might do, doesn't it?The grandmother gets hers. And that's what the book is mostly about: revenge, or \\"what goes around comes around.\\"Momma finally flips out, after all those years of holding it inside, \\"for the love of money.\\" Like the OJ's said, it's all about that \\"mean green,\\" and how mean it can be!Chris is the most spiritual. He is willing to forgive and forget. Isn't that nice?Hennie is a decent person, one of those who takes \\"lemons and makes lemonade.\\"Dr. Paul seems like a good guy. He is generous and somewhat wise, but not too wise to avoid falling in love with a nymph. No, I don't mean nympho, but Cathy does have a high libido, I'd say.Carrie is sweet but sad and delusioned.Bart is unbelievable. He's a lawyer, married money (but not for money), wants children but knows his wife can have none, has a shoddy memory and almost no intuition, and dies a hero, of a sort.Julian Marquet knows how to dance ballet, but he always wanted his father to take him hiking and camping. Julian shows what can happen when fathers don't bring their sons up unselfishly.Then come all the other characters, full of greed, avarice, vengeance, what have you.It's like a soap opera, but longer and more detailed. Maybe it's a soap opera meant for people who like to read but don't like television (me).Okay, it's on to book three in the trilogy (If There Be Thorns).See you there (maybe)!Diximus."},{"Title":"Petals on the wind","review":"I thought this book was pure, without a doubt, trash!

Cathy being the seductive brat, had came on to the 24 years old doctor named Dr.Paul Sheffield whom let her and her older brother and little sister in. She thought a proper repayment to paul was to sleep with him! She was 16 years old and he's old enough to be her father.Cathy in this book didn't accept Chris's love for her. Chris is Cathy's older brother whom fallen in in love with her. Cathy is a brat for playing with his emotions and dropped him down. I loved chris he was sweet, smart and concerned. But don't worry Cathy X Chris fans they get married in the THIRD Novel. Cathy truly hurt her brother's feelings in this novel. She's such an ingrate after all the nice the things her brother had done for her.Cathy went on to her revenge work on her mon by sleeping with her mom's husband Bart Winslow. She also kicked the evil Grandmother's butt , physically. Cathy was stupid and superficial enough to marry her insane and violent dance partner, Julian. I think Paul, Bart and Julian were not mean't for Cathy at all. I think Chris and Cathy were meant to be even though it may be wrong, but it feels right because Chris was watching Cathy in the shadows. If you all read \\"Flowers in the attic\\" you will notice that Chris and Cathy fallen in love with each other. Their love story had captured my heart because it was so beautiful.The few good points in this book was that Cathy still had feelings for her brother somewhat. And Chris was a wonderful and adoring character. Well I gotta say this book was interesting but it wasn't as good as The first Dollanganer novel \\"Flowers in the attic\\"The \\"Petals in the Wind\\" was a dramatic,sad,mushy love story. It was well a kinda X-rated. The reason why I read on to this novel was becuase I wanted to find out how all the Dollanganger children came out to be. This book is for people who can handle the Mature stuff. If Cathy was still innocent and pure unlike the mirror image of her mom she came out to be and If she hadn't been so cold rowards chris I would've gave the book 5 stars.Overall I would recommend this book to Dollanganger fans and people who were wondering how the children were doing. And also as I said before the main reason for 3 stars were about the cathy being a brat thing. If you ladies and gentleman hadn't guessed it by now I liked the book \\"petals on the wind\\" :) somewhat. But the \\"Flowers in the Attic\\" was Fantastic!

IF you like books with never ending events. This book has a little bit of all of it. All of V.C. Anderews stories are full filling and have endless amount of details. This story is about a family with four children that start out normal then as always something goes wrong. The book &quot;Pedals on the Wind&quot; is a sad story but I realized it's not true but it does go on out there in the real world. this is a book young adults and older can learn a lot from. I once again recomend the book &quot;Pedals on the Wind&quot; very stongly."},{"Title":"Petals on the wind","review":"This sequel to &quot;Flowers in the Attic&quot; is a very pleasant surprise, given that &quot;Flowers&quot; was no literary achievement or even a very interesting soap, since its aspirations to be the Gothic Anne Frank were too high. Here, V. C. Andrews hits her stride, realizing that the Gothic horror is more effective combined with soap-opera romances than war history rewrites. The story is again first person, narrated by Cathy, but since our protagonists are not sequestered in the beyond-boring attic, the action and dialogue are ten times more involving. If &quot;Flowers&quot; was a long hibernation into inertia, &quot;Petals&quot; is a true page-turner, an edge-of-your-seat adventure. Overall, this is the book that &quot;Flowers in the Attic&quot; should have been, had V. C. Andrews spiced it up with more characterization. END"},{"Title":"Petals on the wind","review":"I can't say whether or not I liked Petals on the Wind better than Flowers in the Attic, because I felt they were both equally wonderful. Petals on the Wind was utterly enchanting and it was literally a book that I could not put down--I brought this book with me at every spare moment I had to read it only took me four days ro read. Again in this book Cathy is this supreme herione to me and she puts up with so much stuff, but her dream of becoming a ballerina does come true but there were other difficulties that went along with that dream. Now there are only two Dollanganger children left, and I can't wait to read If There Be Thorns. They should seriously make a movie out of this book and combine it with Flowers in the Attic.

But I loved Cathy and her revenge against her mother. Although seducing Bart Winslow was down right cruel, and then having his kid.. not to mention, she practically killed him. But I think that Corrine Foxworth Winslow deserved it for locking her four kids up in an attic, and then trying to kill all of them, and secceeded on killing Cory, but that's in &quot;Flowers in the Attic&quot;, which I also have a review on.

Join the three siblings right where \\"Flowers\\" left off. I didn't think anything could live up to \\"Flowers\\", but \\"Petals\\" is just as fascinating. Cathy longs for revenge against her mother, Corrine, and that other evil woman - Grandmother. Chris wants to let it go and move on with his life, but oh, man does this guy have his own issues: He's hopelessly in love with his sister! Meanwhile, the other little sister (can't remember her name right now) just can't seem to continue living without her twin brother Corrie. A nice doctor takes the three of them in and helps them get their lives back on track. But guess what? Yeah, he's got some issues as well...though not quite as bad as the siblings. Cathy can't seem to keep her pants on and Chris can't seem to understand her habits. Finally, Cathy does what she has to do. She carefully plots a revenge tactic that lands her right back in that house, and the attic!! The final couple of chapters will have you climbing the walls! I didn't bother to continue reading the other books after this one, though I heard mixed reviews."},{"Title":"Petals on the wind","review":"Wow. This is one of the great series of books I have read, that could draw you in an instant once you've picked it up and read it. For new readers, i suggest reading \\"Flowers in the Attic\\" prior hand to understand why Catherine had that much fury buried withing her, leading her to series of uncalculated bad choices but only to prep her up to face who she felt was responsible for all the trauma she and her siblings faced. This book will leaves you turning pages until you reach the end, which of course, leaves you wondering for more.The pages started from where they left of, on their way away from their hell home known as the Foxworth Hall on a bus. A chance meeting with Henny, the black woman, who bring them to the hospital when Carrie suddenly turn to the worse, where he introduced them to Paul, her doctor son; who welcome them all into his large home, share with Henny.Paul send them off to the their own perpective schools to further their education, sending both Chris and Carrie away to boarding school and Cathy to attend ballerina school in the same town, only to be together again every weekends.Even though years passes by, the trauma inflicted onto them while they were back in Foxworth Hall leaves a scar deep enough for Cathy to persue vengence against her mother. Carrie was still mourning for her lost twin, Cory and couldn't grow properly after being poisoned by their own mother. The same scar that lead Chris who still long for Cathy; the same scar that lead Cathy to fall in love harshly with Paul and Julian, the ballet dancer she met that brought them both up to fame as they partnered together and who also became her first husband, and the same scar that left Carrie with the feeling that she was a terrible sin to exist. everything wrong happened in their life, Cathy default blame on her mother, who loves mother more than her own children.Cathy took vengence by proxy, making sure her mother's new husband, Bart Winslow fall for her. Her mother, Corrine, of course, deserved nothing less than what was her fate in this book, after the revelations of her dark secret spilled open for the world to see."},{"Title":"Petals on the wind","review":".....Is there an echo in here?It certainly felt that way with nearly every chapter pretty much mirroring the one before...Out of respect for Flowers in the Attic, I completed reading this book but under other circumstances I would've tossed it way before mid-point.I tried hard to understand the Cathy character and her outbursts and whininess and wishy-washy attitude. Afterall, children of abuse and neglect sometimes develop self-destructive tendencies and sometimes the cycle of abuse can be hard to stop as a result but, after four or five chapters of the same dramatic nonsense dumped out using new words and a new male love interest, I starting hating Corrine for not giving Cathy more arsenic when she had the chance. All these outbursts may have at least been worth it if there was any attempt at insight either via the characters or the author. You're lucky if you get a few lines at the end of a chapter.And what is wrong with the men in this book? True, beauty can have a serious power over men but come on. Every man she met fell in love with her in about two seconds flat despite anything and everything she did to hurt them including marrying one while engaged to the other and all the while lusting after her own brother. I can buy one, even two, but four? Were blondes hard to come by back in the 70s or something?The last few chapters tried their hardest to get interesting but even Cathy's grand entrance at the ball fell flat. She planned it for so long and then let her mother's husband try to convince the guests it was a show they were putting on before demanding they go into the den to speak in private .... What? For someone so consumed with revenge and waiting for the perfect moment, she went awfully quiet-like into that den. Was it asking too much to get a grand 'freak out' moment? She was a spazz the whole book and I figured that was where it was going but no. Then what you ask? Well, the house was on fire of course! Wait. What? Another failing of this book - the jumping around - to the point where I found myself flipping back a page thinking I accidentally hit my \\"next page\\" on my Kindle one (or two or three or twenty) times too many.It seemed to me that the author got so much attention over the 10 most controversial pages in Flowers in the Attic that she decided to write 400 more pages of just that. Unfortunately, without a deeper heart breaking story and character development to back it up, all that makes for is a trashy novel and a huge disappointment."},{"Title":"Petals on the wind","review":"This book focuses more on Catherine's husbands and lovers, and on her revenge against her mother. Both make for great, entertaining reading.Love story #1: Cathy's forbidden love for Chris. I think it was fitting Chris's full name means Christ-bearer because he really is Christlike when it comes to forgiveness. He doesn't even hate his mother for being responsible for the death of his only brother, neither for Carrie's stunted growth, which, I believe, in part, leads to her dying so young, and his own loss of trust in the woman who gave him life, not to mention the three years, four months and sixteen days of his childhood lost, lost to him forever.It did take Cathy a long time to finally execute her revenge, but I think she wanted to prove to her mother that she could make something of herself first, which she did, by becoming a prima ballerina, who, sadly, would have been a superstar if only Julian (her first husband and dance partner) hadn't been such a jerk.I think Cathy's love affair with Paul Sheffield, the doctor who took her and her siblings in, was genuine, and though I believe she really did love him, part of that love was gratitude. I also think his age played a role (Paul was twenty four years and some months older than she, just like her father was, for when she was twelve, Chris Sr. was thirty-six). Paul represented stability, the kind of life she knew with her father, and that was partly why he was so attractive to her. Like Chris, Paul was always there for her because her love life went in this order: Chris, Paul, Julian, Paul, Bart, Paul, Chris. I liked all of Cathy's beaus but Julian, who was in love with Cathy, but she just didn't feel that way about him. I think she only thought she loved him at the end. I know some readers thought Cathy promiscuous, but I didn't get that at all. Chris was a mistake, and it wasn't her who initiated it, Paul and Julian she married, and Bart was part of her revenge plan, but all along, I don't think she realized it until the end that it was Bart who was her true love, ever since she was fifteen when she first kissed him and he thought she was part of a dream. I also don't think Bart realized Cathy was his true love either until the end (though I do believe he did love his wife, Corinne, Cathy's mother), when she revealed to him who she was, the dream that had stayed with him all those many years.CAUTION: SPOILER'S AHEAD!!!What's heartbreaking is that just as they realized this, Bart dies, leaving Cathy to go back to Paul carrying Bart's child. Cathy's one true love was the one man she didn't marry.I think Cathy slept with Paul at first only to get Christopher out of her system (\\"Good-bye, my Christopher Doll\\", I think she said, as soon as Paul had, um, done the deed), and though her feelings towards her brother that were less than sisterly remained dormant through all her romances, I think she finally accepted at the end that Chris was the one constant in her life. All the rest of the men in it had died on her. I think she was just tired of fighting him, deciding to make a life together with him and her two sons.I advise against reading, or at least accepting the three latter books of this series. Ms. Andrews totally veered off the path by using Bart and Jory's (Cathy's sons) first person voices, especially when they are still children. I have never been a fan of switching points-of-view. I was used to seeing everything through Cathy's eyes and this totally jarred me. It wouldn't have been so bad if the story had went in a different direction, but, well, I won't spoil it for you. \\"Petals\\" ended nicely (Foxworth Hall burns down and Corinne is in a convalescent home for the insane), and could have been left alone (which would have been better than having \\"Thorns\\" published), letting Cathy and Chris to just live happily ever after, maybe even going back to Gladstone, Pennsylvania, to visit, and raising two nice, normal sons, with Corinne perhaps redeeming herself at the end by saving one of the boys or something and Cathy finally being able to forgive her. As far as I'm concerned, that's what happened. \\"Thorns\\" and \\"Seeds\\" is V.C.'s version of what happened to Chris and Cathy after they go to Calfornia (I would have liked it better if they had stayed on the East Coast), but I have my own, where they decide to go to Sarasota after all. Though V.C. created the Dresden dolls, I made them mine.This book covers a lot more time than the first, which I think metaphorically illustrates how fast life flew by when they had their freedom and were no longer locked in the attic.Read this wonderful novel.Note to Amazon: The name's Dollanganger, not Dollanger."},{"Title":"Petals on the wind","review":"The second book in the thrilling Flowers in the Attic saga. After years of torture and suffering in the Attic of Foxworth Hall Cathy, Chris, and Carrie are finally free (!), but the twisted story doesn't end there. After a long trip they are forced to go to a doctor when Carrie becomes violently ill. This is where they meet Dr. Paul Sheffeild who soon takes them into his home when he hears their unfortunate story. Cathy continues to persue her dream of becoming a prima ballerina and winds in and out of various relationships. After her dancing partner and lover, Julian, dies she goes to Barthomelow Winslow to have him get money from Julian's life insurance. After a few run-ons she decides to move next to him and make him fall in love with her as she gets revenge on her mother. (finally) One word for this book : WOW! It was very exiting. I couldn't put it down. If you want to see what happens to the Dollanger family and want to see Cathy give some serious payback to their selfish mother read this book! If you like horror, romance, and a dash of suspence rolled up in one, go for V.C. Andrews. But be sure to read Flowers in the Attic before this one or you may be left in the dark. Then you may move on to the next book,If There be Thorns, which only gets crazier!"},{"Title":"Petals on the wind","review":"Reading this book was like watching a car accident in super extra slow millisecond by millisecond slow motion. Petals in the Wind is excrutiatingly repetitive in its dialogue, narration, and plot.The book dragged on and on, repeating the same coda. It may have made a decent short story but it could not sustain itself over 400+ pages. As for the characters, Catherine makes a particularly unsympathetic protagonist. In the first novel, it was refreshing to have a flawed main character as trashy novels usually make them out to be perfect, but in Petals on the Wind, her flaws were so deep I wished for her to meet the same fate as her many lovers. Vain, self-centered, needy, bitter, and angry--why any man would fall in love with her is beyond understanding. In addition, the scenes between her and her brother were nothing short of nauseating. To compare this book to the far superior Flowers in the Attic, in that novel there was a compelling reason as to why two confused children would be drawn together by their burgeoning sexuality, trapped in a attic with no one but each other, their hormones, and their two younger siblings which they \\"parented\\". In this novel, there is no understandble reason other than Catherine's vanity for she kept leading her brother on. The characters are untrue to life, and the dialogue is stilted and overdramatic. In gothic novels you do have to suspend some reality, but this novel was so unrealistic as to be laughable.If it was so bad, why did I continue reading? I ask myself the same question. To use the car accident analogy again, it was horrible but I had to keep looking simply to see how it would play out. Do yourself a favor and don't pick it up so you don't end up ensnared in that inane book like I did. I wish I had been warned--I believed all the positive reviews here and I was so disappointed. Read Flowers in the Attic and use your imagination as to what happens to the Dollanganger children once they escaped. Anything you can imagine is better than the trash in this book."},{"Title":"Petals on the wind","review":"I never dreamed V.C. Andrews could write another book as wonderfully eerie as Audrina's disfunctional family, but Cathy in Petals on the Wind is so real! Although she feels a need for such revenge, I loved the Christmas Climax at Foxworth Hall when her mother is confronted and even Bart Winslow sides with Cathy! I feel that Bart was the dark, handsome man Cathy always dreamed of...I didn't like her marriage to Julian at all...and thought it inappropriate for her to marry her guardian, Paul. In the end, I'm glad it seems that she and Chris and her two sons, Jory and Bart will lead a normal life of happiness. I felt Cathy's revenge on the invalid grandmother was a bit gruesome and harsh, but the book is the most exciting one I've ever read... full of unexpected outcomes!"},{"Title":"Petals on the wind","review":"Love this book. It picks up right where Flowers in the Attic left off and it doesn't dissapoint. There are a few annoying things about Cathy as she proves to be very selfish in many ways, but we still have a gripping tale of betrayal, and revenge. No matter how annoying Cathy may get in her selfish ways, it is more appalling to read of her mother Corrine just living it up as if her children never existed so its easy to root against her especially if you read the first book. However, in many ways Cathy resembled her mother and not just in looks. The selfish ways, the vanity, the way she made every man fall in love with her was the exact ways of her mother, who she criticized for doing the same thing. So what if she could dance while her mother only crocheted? She too winded up depending on a man and never wanted to live without one again like her mother. One can't blame Cathy for wanting revenge for the horrible things her mother and grandmother did, but in the end Cathy wasn't really that much stronger than Corrine even if we could say she was in some ways especially in the ways of confrontation. She was superior there no doubt. Still a great book and i could read it over and over again.A.M Torres author of Love Child - (sold here on Amazon)"},{"Title":"Petals on the wind","review":"This is my favorite book in the Dollanger series. Its the most heart-breaking, tragic, and interesting in the series int hat we see that the children from book one have grown up and now trying to face a world that was shut off to them for most of their adolescence and childhood.The protaganist is daring in her revenge, seductive in her romantic choices, and bold as she unleashes her full wrath. If you're a genuine smut reader, then this book (and the third one, Seeds of Yesterday) will wet your appetite.I don't want to ruin the book for those who haven't read it. But, if you picked up the first book, finish the series. Its never ending tells of deception, lies, and incestry will have you wanting more.I also reccommend another series if you liked this one: The Casteel Series, which begins with Heaven."},{"Title":"Petals on the wind","review":"I loved this book every bit as much as I loved flowers in the attic but in a very different way.This book is not a horror story like the first one is.Its still very sad though.This book picks up where the other left off and tells the story of what happend to the \\"Dolls\\".If you fell in love with the kids in the first book this is a must read.Its good to able to see what happened to them and fall in love with them all over again."},{"Title":"Petals on the wind","review":"I must say that this novel was quite good. I absolutely love Flowers in the Attic since it's a tragic tale that I truly hope no person would suffer. Petals on the Wind did a great job of describing some of the real consequences that happens to people when they are mistreated during their childhood. Childhood traumas, especially that of Catherine's, is something that I'm glad VC Andrews was able to explain in truth. VC Andrews did such a good job in describing each character that I too felt as if i were part of the novel. For example, I couldn't help but pitty Carrie, I wanted to tell Chris to just grow up, I desperatly wanted to yell at Cathy to just get her revenge over with, and I really wanted to kill Julian (he was really annoying). But hey, that just shows that Andrews knows how to get her readers involved.This is a book that should not be missed!"},{"Title":"Petals on the wind","review":"\\"Petals on the Wind\\" is not your average sequel - - mainly because it surpasses the first book in the Dollanganger series, \\"Flowers in the Attic\\", in both literary merit and story.\\"Petals\\" picks up where \\"Flowers\\" left off, with Chris, Cathy and Carrie having just escaped the attic and their formidable Grandmother. It follows the fractured family for the next twenty-five years - - through the kids finding a home with the lonely widower Dr. Paul Sheffield in South Carolina, to Chris attending medical school, Cathy becoming a ballerina and Carrie adjusting to life being the sole surviving twin. \\"Petals\\" is full of sadness and agony, in some cases even more so than \\"Flowers\\". \\"Petals\\" also introduces the reader to a veritable encyclopedia of new characters and locales.The constants throughout the story are Chris' continued love for Cathy, Cathy's desire for revenge on the Grandmother and her own mother and the extremity of Cathy's bad decisions. As Chris says in the book, it is amazing how intuitive Cathy was while locked up in the attic, but how damned dumb she became once they got out. And that was no small exaggeration - - and that is perhaps my only gripe with this novel. Her continued bad choices are legion - -whether it's in the area of romance, marriage, children or work, she leaves a path of destruction in her wake.But overall, I enjoyed the book and plowed through it. I was disappointed when the story ended, even knowing that a third installment would await me.If you are anxious to continue with the Dollanganger saga, dive right in."},{"Title":"Petals on the wind","review":"Petals on the Wind kept me intrigued until the end. I won't review the story's plot because that will give up too much of the story but I will say that everything I wanted to happen did. The only compliant I had is that Chris didn't get his happy ending described in more detail in the end and I don't think I can go through the trauma of reading it in the next book. I was always rooting for him, even if he was her brother. Just read this book if you still felt trapped in the attic by the first one. You won't regret it. It wears true to humanity, even if it isn't how we would want things in reality to be. People are definitely shades of gray..."},{"Title":"Petals on the wind","review":"Cathy's revenge was great.At first it was a bit boring.Cathy's love life was a disaster.But when Cathy starts planning how to make grandmother and mother pay, revenge couldn't taste better.Great story,great ending and hoping Cathy still continues to torture Corrine untill death comes her way.It's just as good as Flowers in the Attic."},{"Title":"Petals on the wind","review":"This book is amazing, perfect second half TO the original!!I loved it.

After finishing it, I donated it to the libarary so that they would have a lendable condition book for others to enjoy."},{"Title":"Petals on the wind","review":"After reading Flowers in the Attic, I always wondered what became of the children after they escaped from Foxworth Hall. In Petals on the Wind, the kids escape and take Carrie to a doctor, who has an office in his own home. The doctor eventually adopts all three of them and they settle down and try to adjust to a normal life, which is difficult because they are haunted by their past. Cathy ultimately starts an affair with the doctor (her legal guardian) when she is only sixteen, which I found repulsive. But I guess very few things in life are free and the doctor had to be repaid somehow.Cathy sees her mother from time to time throughout the book. As always, her mom pretends she doesn't know her. She's a selfish woman, who loves her money more than her own children, and to acknowledge the existence of her children would mean losing everything she inherited from her father. Cathy marries twice in the book. Both times her husbands die, and ultimately she winds up with Chris. The love that was first spawned in the shadows of the attic has stood the test of time.In the end, Cathy goes to Foxworth Hall to confront her mother, after having starting an affair with her mother's husband. The other two books that come after this book aren't worth reading. This book is good, but I feel that she could have split it into two separate books and gone into a little bit more detail."},{"Title":"Petals on the wind","review":"Instead of writing another long-winded review or giving a fully-detailed synopsis, I will simply state my profound joy I experience while reading (or re-reading) VC Andrews' works of art. These novels are like a juicy soap opera in printed form. Easy to read, detailed descriptions, perfectly paced with great character development. Not to mention, dramatic twists in a wonderful story line. This second book in the Dollanganger Series is no exception. Although, part of a series, it easily stands to be a novel read by itself. But if you're a fan of this author's work, I don't think you'll be able to just stop with one. Highly recommended. These books will go down in history as they have already stood the test of time and will continue to do so, I'm sure.

Finally Cathy knows she has to do something about her mother. She has to make her feel the pain she and her syblings went through. This is a wonderful book to read, because it shows human emotion so realistically. It displays what children who are neglected and abused go through. Though a very long book, it keeps you hooked the whole time, bringing more and more interest to the story. I personally recomend this book to anyone who enjoys realistic fiction, and explorying the feelings of others."},{"Title":"Petals on the wind","review":"I have read this book so much that I could quote you a couple of chapters. This book is very captivating and the plot doesn't get old like Flowers in the Attic. After reading this book, you will have a mental picture of all the main characters. The only things that are annoying the use of the word &quot;thousandfold&quot; over and over, and the fact that Cathy stays with an abusive husband. I won't say anymore and give away the story. ENJOY!"},{"Title":"Petals on the wind","review":"&quot;Petals On The Wind&quot; is one of my most treasured books. This tale has it all: romance, drama, death, heated debates, fame, and revenge.Cathy's need for revenge against Corrine colors all her actions, and prevents her from ever attaining the love she dreams of.The characters are richly drawn and beautiful: Paul, a tragic figure, saintlike and giving, yet very real. Julian, the tortured dancer who is more like Cathy than she cares to admit. Bart Winslow, an interesting man who seems to be Cathy's soulmate, and Carrie, Cathy's sad frail sister.This is one of the best of the Dollanganger series, and fans of Flowers in the Attic will not be disappointed by the continuing saga of the family. A must read."},{"Title":"Petals on the wind","review":"This tale is the best! I do like Flowers in The Attic more but I like this one second best! I love Cathy and Chris's relationship and Cathy should stop running from it!"},{"Title":"Petals on the wind","review":"Chris and Cathy escape, and Chris still can't get over Cathy. Not that I think Cathy is over Chris but at least she's trying. She keeps running from guy to guy trying to forget him but she is just like Chris. She should never have married Julian! She shouldn't have married Paul either. I would have done the same thing to her mother and grandmother! This story has touch me deeply!! I really think that her and Bart should have lived on happily but Its regretful!!"},{"Title":"Petals on the wind","review":"I loved this book and Flowers in the Attic. I loved that Cathy finally got revenge with her mother. But the ending was freaky. It sounded as if cathy was really going to lock up Bary and Jory? I can't wait to read the next one! May V.C. Andrews Rest In Peace:("},{"Title":"Petals on the wind","review":"Petals on the wind...a revenge packed rampage to the bitter end. A very well put together book that carries the &quot;Dresden Dolls&quot; into their adulthood years and Cathys building tower of revenge and hate for her mother and grandmother. I read this book within a matter of 3 days knowing that with each turn of the page I was one page closer to the confrontation and destruction of Foxworth Hall. Even though it was an exceptionally well written masterpiece and still a must read, it's not as good as the first book...but then again nothing ever is."},{"Title":"Petals on the wind","review":"Hmmmmmm . . .I have read every single V. C. Andrews book out, I only wish I could read the Gods of the Green Mountain, her first novel that was never published. But this book, Petals on the Wind was her second published work. I can still remember when I was sitting on my parents sofa and I picked up Flowers in the Attic, a book I saw laying on the table, I opened it up unsuspectedly, not knowing what I would find in these pages. What I found was the voice of my passion, every chapter, ever word, held such meaning for my soul. I never thought I would find a book that I adored as much as Flowers in the Attic, I was wrong, and twice! Then came along Petals on the Wind, now sequels are normally not that great, with the exception of Anne Rice's witch and vampire books, and ofcourse the V. C. Andrews' series, but this novel was far more outstanding than Flowers in the Attic, it goes into the deep motivations of Cathy's hatred towards her mother, Corrine. You sensed that majorly in Flowers in the Attic, but it is so clear in Petals on the Wind that it definityly places this book and all of V. C.'s books into the horror category, and they are horror, yet they're told in romantic fairy tale tones, they're absolutley incredible. And I said I was wrong twice about Flowers in the Attic being the best novel, with Petals on the Wind being my absolute favorite, Dark Angel comes in second. I wrote a rather lengthy review for Dark Angel, but that's another story, it goes into the brilliance of the Casteel series and how it is 99.8% in comparison to the geniusly written Dollanganger series. All in all, Virginia Cleo Andrews had an extraordinary talent and she gave me the opportunity to travel to different worlds and into the minds of incredible characters. Cathy will always be my most favorite fictional character. But if you want to know, my second favorite is The vampire Lestat. But this isn't about Rice, it's about Andrews's amazing skill.~Tom Nordlum"},{"Title":"Petals on the wind","review":"Petals is an adequate sequel to Flowers in the Attic, and given that the first book is not exactly a classic of contemporary literture, this doesn't say much. In a word, this book is disturbing.Hardened by her experience in the attic, Cathy is hell-bent on revenge. She wants her mother to pay for her brother's death (murder?), the pyschological problems her sister suffers, and the consequences the experience has had on her and her older brother, who wants to be more than a brother to Cathy. The only way Cathy seeks to achieve this goal is become a complete trollop, which to me makes her character the least sympathetic in the book.Cathy is a user. She abuses the kindness of the gentleman who takes in her family after their escape, she uses Julian to forward her dancing career, and she uses her mother's current husband as a tool for revenge. Looking back after reading this novel, I realize Ms. Andrews could have used this story to create a truly psychological work of horror and revenge. For example, how Cathy torments her mother with letters is the only fascinating thing about the book. Petals might have made for a better story had Cathy sought her revenge in this manner, slowly driving her mother insane. Instead, Ms. Andrews goes for sensationalism, and lots of needless sex.Cathy's promiscuity is disturbing. The incestuous overtones are disturbing. The climax with the destruction of Foxworth Hall is silly and melodramatic. The only character I liked in this book was Paul's mute maid, who might have served as a good moral compass for Cathy. It's a shame Ms. Andrews did not develop her character better."},{"Title":"Petals on the wind","review":"VC Andrews has wrote an exceptional followup book to 'Flowers in the Attic.' I read the book in two days, glued to each page as the Dollanganger's finally escaped the attic and began an adventure in the outside world. Chris was obviously infactuated with his sister, Cathy and although we all turn our noses up to incest, VC Andrews seems to make it appear normal with her writing ability and way with words. When Carrie becomes extremely ill on a bus, Chris and Cathy realize she needs a doctor pronto and that is when they end up meeting Doctor Paul Sheffield. After this meeting, all kinds of things start happening for them. I turned each page with exciting anticipation as to what would happen next. Although Andrews will never be able to write a book as fantastic as the first Dollanganger horror of being locked in an attic for four years, this followup is very good none the less. If you do decide to read this book, you must read Flowers in the Attic first so you understand the whole story."},{"Title":"Petals on the wind","review":"In this sequel, the Dollanganger/Foxworth children finally manage to escape the hellish prison of the attic. However they are not equipped to deal with the &quot;real world&quot;. As Cathy gets older, she is obviously more affected by the loss of her father then she knows, because she seeks out and seduces men (especially older ones) left and right! Poor Christopher hangs on to his &quot;sinful&quot; lust for his sister and refuses to find another girl, even though he is quite a catch. And Carrie slowly wastes away, living in Cathy's shadow, thinking (probably rightly so) that no man will ever look at her as long as her sexy sister is around. If any kids ever needed a psychiatrist, it's these three! This book isn't that great, I would say that &quot;Flowers in the Attic&quot; is the only book in the series worth reading, because the other ones get deeper and deeper into soap opera territory."},{"Title":"Petals on the wind","review":"This is a strange book and, if you get into the characters and situations like I tend to do when I read a book, it's a disturbing book. I've reread different parts of the book several times, and I find the characters too much over the psychological edge.It supposedly took place in the 1950's and \`60's. As someone suggested in one of the less-than-favorable reviews, the kids needed psychological help to get adjusted to their new situation now that they were out of the attic and to deal with their feelings about being abandoned by their mother.The doctor seduced a vulnerable teenage girl, and legally it would have been statutory rape. Also, he should have guided Cathy's need toward revenge to getting the mother and grandmother reported to the authorities; even though that was not the route she wanted to take. He could have treated Carrie with Human Growth Hormones, at least to give the kid a little hope. In addition, V.C. Andrews has Cathy drinking alcoholic drinks in public restaurants while she is still a teenager without being carded. In real life, this would not have happened during those times.I know this is not \\"real life\\"...it's fiction. I think I have been reading too many self-help books which are still half-read to give this book an adequate review. I've researched the plots of the other Dollanganger books by V.C. Andrews and I don't think I will pursue them any further."},{"Title":"Petals on the wind","review":"There is another book I couldn't put down! It was excellent stories that I had trouble breathing to read!! LOL!! Thanks!"},{"Title":"Petals on the wind","review":"I loved flowers in the attic and I loved the Dresden dolls!! Cathy is so much like me - we both like being independent and we can both be very unforgiving. I even have the actress's short haircut from the movie of f in attic!! but if i were cathy i wouldnt wait three and a half years i reckon id have waited a week then busted out by beating up the grandmother or my mother when she visited!!! Also i would have tried to forgive my mother i wouldnt seduce her husband"},{"Title":"Petals on the wind","review":"This book was very good, but it was a bit far fetched. I was like she started writing this book in a dream state. I d also didn't like how they grew uup so fast in the book. It was like one mnute there fifteen, and the next she's thirty-six. It was very hard to keeo track of the age. But nonetheless it was still a very good book. A very intersting novel."},{"Title":"Petals on the wind","review":"This book is a HORRIBLE read!!!! I wouldnt attempt it unless you want to fall asleep!!! Its sooooo far from real it makes me want to scream!!! I cant even finish it im half way through and its going to the used bookstore as a trade so i can hopefully get something better!! Dont waste your time!!!"},{"Title":"Petals on the wind","review":"I've read the other reviews on here...I can't believe anyone can dislike this book! I thought it was so good I cannot decide my favorite between it and Flowers in the Attic! I thought it was an awesome sequel. This series is the BEST of V.C Andrews in my opinion and I'll never get tired of reading them."},{"Title":"Petals on the wind","review":"Having seen the movie when I was younger, I was a fan of \\"Flowers in the Attic\\" before I finally read the book this past year. It is a fast-paced thrilling read of terrible deeds and the destructive actions those deeds cause. Naturally I was curious to continue with the Dollangers and to know what happened to them after they fled from their attic confines. \\"Petals on the Wind\\" is a disappointment on the grandest scale - smut (and badly written smut at that) loosely disguised by the overarching revenge-driven plot.When Chris, Cathy, and Carrie finally escape from the attic, they take a bus south heading towards Florida, but are forced to stop in South Carolina because Carrie is desperately ill. They are taken in by a charming and enigmatic doctor who adopts them as his wards, falling in love with Cathy along the way. He helps Chris achieve his dream of becoming a doctor, and helps Cathy fulfill her desire to be a ballerina, but there is little that can be done to help Carrie, whose small size is a constant worry to her. Yet despite all the good that fills their lives, Cathy is driven to seek revenge upon her mother, sending threatening, blackmail to Corrine as she flees her past all over the world, but Cathy will stop at nothing to get even with her mother. Even as she achieves her dream, Cathy's desire for revenge affects all of her success - she seems to destroy every man she comes in contact with (and since she is so overwhelmingly beautiful as Andrews has to constantly point out, all the men in her life (including her brother) are continuously after her). There is so much that Andrews could have done with these characters that she had given such an interesting back story to in the first novel, but she seemed more content to fill these pages with unnecessary (and horribly written) sex scenes just to stretch out the novel.The story is somewhat redeemed towards the end when a grown-up Cathy can finally inflict some damage one those who have wronged her, namely her grandmother and mother, but for readers who have stuck through the rest of the trash, it is too little, too late. There are too many deaths (eight at last count), too much crying, way too many descriptions of Cathy's beauty and Chris's lust for her, and far too little actual story that moves this plot forward. I know this is a work of fiction, but for anyone who lives in the real world, the ending is extremely disturbing. I am not sure what Andrews intended, for Cathy is an extremely uneven character - at times smart and efficient and in charge, and at others crazy and dependent upon a man and unable to make decisions. If she had treated these characters the way she had in \\"Flowers in the Attic\\", this would have been a much better and more readable book. As it is, I will not read any of the other books about the Dollangers."},{"Title":"Petals on the wind","review":"I'm officially a VC fan. I read FITA and two more books in between before started Petals. I remembered every detail and everything connected well-an excellent sequel. I read some of the 1 star ratings for their perspectives. Most were disappointed in the \\"adult Cathy\\", but to me, it was very honest. brutally honest. the end result of such childhood.the twists and turns at the end kept me gasping. i loved it. appreciated it. great read."},{"Title":"Petals on the wind","review":"Awesome book, ive been looking for this book to complete my collection, and they knew just where to find it!!"},{"Title":"Petals on the wind","review":"FYI, this book is the best in the series. It is more scandalous than the others, more eventful, and is narrated by an adult (Cathy) versus children (book #3)."},{"Title":"Petals on the wind","review":"After reading Flowers in the Attic, I was happy to continue the story. If I were Cathy, I'd be supremely pissed off at my own mother, and want to plot revenge. It was sad in some parts, but a satisfying read overall.The trio that managed to escape the Foxworth mansion after the death of their brother are forever scarred by their traumatic experience, especially Carrie, who constantly struggles with the physical and mental scars that are left on her. Despite being adopted by a man who treats them well, the children can't quite get over what happened, though Chris is more quick to move on and start a productive life in medicine. Cathy desires revenge - perfectly justified - but makes some stupid decisions along the way. However, her thirst for revenge comes to fruiton as she lashes against the evil grandmother and her mother.All in all, this is a worthy continuation of Flowers in the Attic, with things coming full circle, so to speak (at least in some aspects, since this series still has 3 more books to go)"},{"Title":"Petals on the wind","review":"After being locked up in the attic for 4 long years in the book \\"flowers in the attic\\" Cathy and her two siblings finally escape the clutches of foxworth hall.

What can i say he's one terrific guy to do all those generous things for his sister cathy. Also I should mention he's madly in love with her too! In this book I cried because it made me so sad that poured his heart out for cathy, but yet somehow she doesn't feel that she should be her brother's girlfriend. chris was protective of cathy when he had his bad feelings. it's just so sad knowing a guy like chris get put down. This book was a romance-suspense kind of novel. If anyone whom is into books with a good combination like this I would reccommend it for you. Hey I like it yay!"},{"Title":"Petals on the wind","review":"After experiencing the horrors of Flowers in the Attic, would you expect anything less? This is a riviting sequel to Flowers in the Attic. this is just as good as the first book, and just propels you further into the series.

I felt as though the characters really did exsist once! God i felt so attached to them, it was amazing. This was one book that totally mesmerized me and i just couldn't put it down and if i had to it would pull me back as soon as it could. Its a rollercoaster of emotions! A must read!

I found that there was not one dull moment in the book and it got even more exciting when Cathy took her revenge on her mother the only complaint i do have is Chris' obsession with his sister and would have liked to see the both of them move on, however I am looking forward to reading the rest of the series."},{"Title":"Petals on the wind","review":"Somehow, this book is even creepier than Flowers in the Attic. It's not as good, but it's a very entertaining read. After the abuse that the surviving Foxworth children suffered, readers will want to know if they can ever lead a normal life. It's a good examination of how a family might deal with the legacy of abuse if they've finally escaped from the perpetrators. Will they try to forgive and continue with their lives? Will they become obsessed with revenge? Or will they find themselves completely incapable of continuing with their lives because they were utterly emotionally destroyed?Each of the children deals with the trauma in different ways. While Chris appears to have recovered the best, his obsession with his own sister is the most startling and enduring result of his isolation during the \\"Attic\\" years. He does not \\"give up\\" waiting for his sister to respond to him romantically. Predictably, Carrie, who never really had a chance to enjoy life on the \\"outside\\", and who lost her twin at such a young age, is the most drastically scarred of the children and her story is the saddest and most tragic. She remains emotionally and physically stunted.For her, Cathy, and Chris, we remain riveted to the story and want to know what happens, because we suffered with them in \\"Flowers\\" and cried for little Cory. Now we want to know what happens to them even if a lot of the plot and secondary characters are boring and one-dimensional. I liked Henny,the warm nurse who cannot speak; even if one literary critic suggested the large black woman was reminiscent of \\"Aunt Jemima\\", I don't think that's fair. I think Andrews wrote her as a sensitive and intelligent woman, and including her gave us some respite from everyone in the story having \\"flaxen hair and cerulean eyes\\".Much weaker characters are Paul, who we are supposed to like because he takes in Chris, Cathy, and Carrie, but it's hard to like someone because he took in a beautiful fifteen year old girl who was orphaned out of the goodness of his own heart. I'm sorry, but the affair between him and Cathy was somehow even worse than that between Chris and Cathy, and very exploitive. The abandoned Cathy's gratitude toward Paul for taking in her and her siblings is something she feels she must repay sexually and Paul is ok with that despite being more than twice her age, rewarding the teenager with negligees etc. I'm not sure if Andrews wants us to find this exploitive or if we're supposed to sympathize with Paul. Her Ballet life is also an unwelcome diversion as are Julian and his mother. You can't figure out why someone as strong as Cathy, and as willful, would waste time with the abusive Julian, whose arrogance is ridiculous.The real center of the story, which make sense because she was the focal center of \\"Flowers\\" and the narrator of these two books, is Cathy's plans to resolve past injustices committed against her. She is mad with plans of revenge, which is understandable since Corrine, after what she did to Cory and then Carrie, is enjoying the life of luxury that was more important to her than her own children.This is the most thrilling aspect of the story and what we're reading it for, and these are the best scenes of the book. Everyone who read \\"Flowers\\" will enjoy when Cathy has an opportunity to confront her grandmother and mother. The best scene in the book is undoubtedly when Cathy, who is in her late twenties (Corrine was in her mid-thirties when this happened) dresses exactly as her mother did for the Christmas ball and looks, not surprisingly considering the lack of diversity in the Foxworth gene pool, every bit the double of her mother several years earlier.There are those at the party who saw Corrine years prior and immediately realize that something is terribly wrong when Cathy appears in that most dramatic scene, a great guilty pleasure. The ending is very haunting and sets the stage for the next book, suggesting the \\"legacy of evil\\" cannot be overcome."},{"Title":"Petals on the wind","review":"&quot;Flowers in the Attic&quot; was my first step into this genre, and I found it one of the best books I've read. I looked to &quot;Petals on the Wind&quot; with great anticipation, but a short ways in, my enjoyment nearly flatlined.Bad points of the story:The story jumps around a bit too much, and what there is of the story seems to be too many people trying to get into Cathy's tutu. It seems half the time she's sobbing, a word used a bit too often throughout the book. And if she's not sobbing, someone is gripping her to them and telling her how exquisitely beautiful she is and that she belongs to him. Another annoying habit in the story is the placing of an exclamation mark behind Chris' name, as if Cathy is surprised her brother actually shows up. Chris himself doesn't seem to have much personality outside of studying and trying to convince his sister that his love for her isn't wrong, and if it is, oh well. Through some pieces of the story you have to wonder if Cathy left her brain in the attic. At one point I was so disappointed in Catherine, I really didn't want to finish the story, as she thought to herself &quot;Life seemed to me nothing without a man.&quot; Lastly, I felt there was excess character killing, with eight deaths (that I counted) throughout the story.Good points of the story:Carrie gets some more attention in the story, but it's mostly bittersweet. The only real redeeming part of the story was settled in the last fifty or so pages, with an excellent revenge set loose on the mother and grandmother. Which almost makes the rest of the story worth reading.In conclusion:Between &quot;I sobbed.&quot;, &quot;You're beautiful. You belong to me!&quot; and &quot;Chris!&quot;, the author manages to create a mildly entertaining story. But if I had it to do over again, I would have stopped at &quot;Flowers in the Attic&quot; and let my prior image of Cathy's character be."},{"Title":"Petals on the wind","review":"Sequels are a tough nut to crack. Especially when the original source material is as revered as Flowers In The Attic. And yet, with Petals On The Wind, V.C. Andrews achieved the near-impossible. Despite the sequel being completely different from the work which came before, it retains the same spirit and tone.Chris, Cathy and Carrie have finally escaped the horrors of the attic... and yet life will not be simple for them, as the attic has left a harsh impression upon them. Chris finds it impossible to move beyond the unholy love born in the attic. Cathy burns with a desire for revenge against those who took so much from her. And Carrie... well, let's just say the fates aren't kind to poor Carrie.As with most of the early works by VC Andrews, the tone is most definitely gothic. The descriptions are lush and lavish, and lust often permiates the air... especially whenever nubile young Cathy, our narrator, begins speaking of her sensual exploits. To say that Cathy has a well-defined sense of self and sensuality would be an understatement, to be certain!Perhaps the best reason to read Petals On The Wind is to finally know the answer to the age-old question any good book (aka Flowers In The Attic) leaves the reader asking: What happened next?"},{"Title":"Petals on the wind","review":"Oh God. I got trapped in a car with this book playing on tape and I truly had to scream out loud several times, \\"Why are we listening to this crap!!!?!???\\".'Flowers in the Attic', while somewhat beyond belief (who acts like these people?) was able to hold my interest out of curiosity. 'Petals' on the other hand is so horribly inconsistent, whiney and uninteresting that I almost bailed at 75 mph. If they erased all Cathy's sobbing crying and lust, all of Carrie's fears and attacks with tiny fists, all of Chris' ultra dull personality, lust and jelousy, this book would be 3 pages long. IT IS INTERMINABLE! Who writes this crap? Oh yeah, the dearly departed VC Andrews. At least there won't be any additions to this balderdash. Of course, women love this fantasy, \\"Let's fall in love\\" drivel, and I guess it was written by a woman for women, but at least learn dialogue that will interest both sexes and anyone over 13 years old. People just don't talk this way. I mean what do you do with a love scene where \\"he touches her in that wonderful place\\" and \\"she touches him in that wonderful place\\". Arrrrghh!I had a dire wish for the grandmother to show up with a machete and put this sad group out its misery. Men, grab whateven gonads you have left and flee this book or they will be taken from you. Be warned. This is tripe like you can't believe."},{"Title":"Petals on the wind","review":"With the glut of teen-geared, posthumously-published, ghostwritten V.C. Andrews paperbacks that have been flooding the book world of late, it might be easy to forget that Virginia Andrews had the ability to create wrenching drama and unique characters who struggle to open the door to happiness even when the key is placed right in their hands.In \\"Petals on the Wind\\", the second volume of a five-book series, the three remaining \\"flowers in the attic\\" - Cathy, Christopher and Carrie Dollanganger - escape Foxworth Hall and certain death by poisoning at the hands of their gold-digging mother.As they heal, Chris, the sunshine of Cathy's heart, continues to try and care for his sisters while pursuing his dream of becoming a doctor. Through Cathy's adoring eyes, the reader sees him grow into a man who is handsome, protective and giving, with the flaws of an occasional temper and an inability - and unwillingness - to love any woman except his younger sister, who yearns to be a prima ballerina.And it's here that the book hits a snag - in Cathy's tortured relationship with her ballet partner Julian, a selfish brat who beats her, cheats on her and allows her no privacy. Given the singular experiences she has endured, it is plausible that Cathy would be torn between her love and gratitude for Dr. Paul Sheffield, the man who takes the children in and becomes their guardian angel, and her forbidden adoration for her brother Chris.However, it seems unfathomable that Julian, whom Cathy accurately calls a \\"nasty, inconsiderate brute\\", would fit into the equation. She and have both fiery natures and good physical chemistry that allows them to dance well together, but Cathy has been written to have too much fierce self-preservation (if not self-esteem) to put up with such horrendous treatment.A little more understandable is Cathy's later passion for Bart Winslow, the stepfather who never knew she existed. After all, her infatuation for him has slept inside her since she was fifteen and came across him dozing in Foxworth Hall's infamous Swan Room.V.C. Andrew's books are not for everyone. Readers who want stoic realism and sensible characters that find it easy to live by society's rules might have a hard time swallowing these stories. Some of their events are as fantastic of those that unwound in the soap operas Chris and Cathy watched while locked up in Foxworth Hall. Also, Cathy's deep romantic feelings for her brother, her mother's husband and the man who becomes her surrogate father might certainly be disturbing to some.But for fans who enjoy the struggles of Andrews's characters to find inner peace, artistic fulfillment and true love, \\"Petals on the Wind\\" is undoubtedly one of the best choices."},{"Title":"Petals on the wind","review":"Normally I would not read a book that is narrated by a fifteen-year-old seductress, but the plot intrigued me, so I gave it a try. I must admit, I did read this book for hours on end, but in those hours I could not help but notice a few faults. The book was so repetitive that I began keeping count of some of the following- how many times Cathy has sex, how many times her lover dies, how many times someone touches her breasts, how many times she damns her mother to hell, how many times she tells Chris not to love her after kissing him, how many times the author uses the phrases &quot;as in a dream...,&quot; &quot;as in an unhappy dream...,&quot; and &quot;as in a nightmare...&quot;,and how many times her eyes &quot;met and locked&quot; with a male character.A sign of bad writing? Maybe so? But I did feel involved enough with the characters so that I would not accuse the author of writing bad literature.I might not go so far as to read another one of her books, though. But I must congratulate her on an original plotline."},{"Title":"Petals on the wind","review":"After three years, four months, and sixteen days, Cathy, Chris, and Carrie Dollanganger have escaped Foxworth Hall. &quot;Petals on the Wind&quot; begins with the three children on a bus destined for Florida. However, their travels are cut short because of Carrie's poor health. They are assisted by a mute woman (Henrietta Beech) who takes them to her boss, Dr. Paul Sheffield, their soon-to-be guardian.The three children have a new chance at a &quot;normal&quot; childhood. They attend school, and Cathy and Chris even begin pursuing their personal goals: Cathy joins a ballet school; Chris later enters medical school.At her ballet practices, Cathy meets Julian Marquet, the son of her instructor. He is attracted to Cathy and pursues her until she agrees to marry him. All the while, Cathy is torn between these three men: her older brother Chris who never abandoned his love for her since they left Foxworth Hall; her much older guardian Paul who becomes her first lover; and Julian, her abusive new husband, who she married out of desperation rather than love. One of them fathers her first son Jory.Carrie, on the other hand, doesn't have as much success as her older siblings. She's constantly teased by her classmates because of her short size and large head, which makes her become more withdrawn and miserable. Then one last encounter with her mother leaves Carrie on the brink of suicide.Throughout the book, Cathy strikes out at Corrine, trying to ruin her mother's life any way she can. At the height of her revenge, Cathy steals her mother's husband away from her, becomes pregnant by him with her second son (Bart Jr), and publicly announces her imprisonment in Foxworth Hall.&quot;Petals on the Wind&quot; is the second book in the Dollanganger series, preceded by &quot;Flowers in the Attic&quot; and followed by &quot;If There Be Thorns&quot;, &quot;Seeds of Yesterday&quot;, and &quot;Garden of Shadows&quot;.This was the first V. C. Andrews book I ever read and is still my favorite. If no other Dollanganger books had followed this one, I would have been satisfied with the series. As far as I'm concerned, &quot;Flowers in the Attic&quot; and &quot;Petals on the Wind&quot; are the only two books worth reading in the Dollanganger series. Although the other three all have their significance to the Foxworth-Dollanganger storyline, I was only interested in the lives of Cathy, Chris, and Carrie; no other characters captured my interest very much.Also, for being a sequel, &quot;Petals on the Wind&quot; is very successful and true. The effects of their imprisonment in the attic are life-long scars: Carrie's dwarfism; Chris's desire for Cathy; Cathy's bitterness. If you've read &quot;Flowers in the Attic&quot;, &quot;Petals on the Wind&quot; is a must-read. It's the aftermath of the children's stay in the attic and how they choose to forget or remember what happened."},{"Title":"Petals on the wind","review":"SPOILER WARNING!This is a very disappointing follow up to Flowers in the Attic. The character of Cathy completely changes from a protagonist you sympathize with to someone you just don't care about anymore. She becomes so self destructive that it makes the \\"climax\\" of the book; her revenge plot against her mother anti-climatic. Also, Chris becomes almost one dimensional, as if he has no personality of his own. All you read is about how he studies, has a heart of gold and pines for his sister...not matter how dumb and heartless she becomes. I get that Andrews wanted to make a point about the \\"cycle of evil\\" continuing but I think that's a cheap ploy. There is no rule that says once a cycle has begun you have to remain in it. Perhaps that was enough to stretch the first book into a series but I never bought it. I would have found it a far more interesting read if Cathy had made at least a few smart decisions in between her dumb ones. At least then I would have actually cared when things didn't go her way. By the end of the book I was left feeling Chris was a fool... why would he still want her after all she had done? The worst was that she always blamed her mistakes on her mom or her past. She never faced up to what she did or had become."},{"Title":"Petals on the wind","review":"I read this book because I wanted to know what happened after Flowers in the Attic, which was a good read. This book, however, was a disappointment. 70 percent of it was Cathy having sex with someone (which she does a lot of in this book, with more than a few partners) or starting to have foreplay and then slapping him in the face and storming out. This book was bad. I'm glad I checked it out from the library and didn't buy it. I really do not care enough about Cathy's sex life enough to read about it in every chapter of a book. Not to mention her incessant self-doubt, worrying, and wimpy questioning of herself on whether or not she is the &quot;Devil's issue.&quot; Get over it! And the revenge against the mother came much too late in the book. Furthermore, I was really turned off by the way Cathy is constantly telling the reader how beautiful she thinks she is. If you are looking for a good sequel full of interesting plot, substance and content, this one is not it!"},{"Title":"Petals on the wind","review":"Cathy runs from man to man, trying to escape her brother's love and from the fact that she returns it.She wants revenge against her mother and her grandmother. Most of all, she runs from herself, the horror and the guilt that taint her childhood.This series is excellent, fabulous and poignant.Carrie is given a lot more attention in this book and she well deserves it. Cathy's breaks hearts left and right without healing her own. Julian the cruel and wounded dancer and Paul, the doctor with a scarred past. Bart Winslow also is quite the character, bewitched by the beautiful woman who looks so like his wife, untimately entangled in the web of the Foxworth clan. I somehow find it impossible to hate Corrine as much as I once did. And Chris, quietly waiting his turn because he knows, as Cathy does not, that he and his sister belong together.I have read this particular book about seven times and I still cry when one of the characters dies. Every time, without fail. And I still love it!Cathy wants peace, but the evil of Foxworth Hall won't let her go and she drags everyone she loves along with her on her path to revenge."},{"Title":"Petals on the wind","review":"This is the second book in the very famous Dollanganger series by V. C. Andrews, and it definitely rivals the first. The kids are heading out into the world after escaping their heartless mother and evil grandmother. Helpless and nowhere to go, a kind doctor takes them in with a very dark past of his own. Things seem to be looking up. Carrie finally gets to be with other children, Chris is going to be a very sucessful doctor, and Cathy is headed toward ballet dancer stardom. But, like before, their world will come crashing down. Chris's vision is clouded by his love for Cathy, Carrie is destroyed when she can't find acceptance from her classmates because of her differences, and Cathy can't get past the dark need for revenge against her mother. It all comes to a very amazing and surprising climax. This book is GREAT! Very tear-jerking in certain parts. Especialy the scene with Carrie. You will love it!"},{"Title":"Petals on the wind","review":"In this book, Cathy, Chris and Carrie have managed to escape from Foxworth Hall. They have new lives living with Dr. Paul Sheffield, who has adopted them. But, Cathy longs to get revenage on their mother. Will Cathy get her revenage?"},{"Title":"Petals on the wind","review":"They escaped after three years and some months of imprisonment. A continuation of a story with a tragic beginning and an even more tragic continuum. Three kids, Chris, Cathy, and Carrie escaped Foxworth hall, a large mansion which now belonged to their mother. Poisoned with arsenic, tortured, and desperate, the three remaining children boarded a bus that would take them to Sarasota, Florida. They never reached Florida because Carrie,the youngest of the three became very ill aboard the bus. Led by a kind woman they went to a doctor in South Carolina who helped Carrie heal, and then took the three kids in as his own.The doctor, happy to forget his own tragic past welcomed them into his home and traeted them as his own. They lived with Dr. Paul Sheffield who helped Chris, achieve his goal of becoming a doctor and Cathy her dream of becoming a ballerina. I would definetely recommend this book because it shows how cruel and unfair life can be. It shows reality mixed with fiction as well as a kind of fictional romance that most people could only dream of. Aside from being romantic it is also spellbinding. Ther are parts that will make you laugh and parts that will make you cry, but overall this book can teach you a lot of enthralling things about the real world and its many injustices."},{"Title":"Petals on the wind","review":"&quot;Petals On The Wind&quot; Is definetly my favorite novel, not just from the series, but my favorite book since. There are all kinds of emotion in this book, I mean, you'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll think 'yes!'.. Flowers is a sad novel, but Petals is the revenge! I definetly recommend it..."},{"Title":"Petals on the wind","review":"The first time you read this book, it seems to be another&quot;daughter's revenge&quot; horror story. Upon re-reading it,you will discover how many levels of human frailitiesit transcends. The main character'sobsession with revenge leads her to give up love, fameand happiness just to see her mother fall. While mostauthors give the protagonist a challenge to rise above,VC Andrews' Cathy sinks lower and lower into self-hatewhich manifests itself ultimately in her becoming hermother, the very object she hates the most. A psychologicalthriller that makes the reader wonder, &quot;What price wouldI pay for revenge.&quot; What price, indeed. Read it twice,at least!"},{"Title":"Petals on the wind","review":"Petals on the Wind picks up where FitA left off. The three remaining children are running for their lives. They're taken in by a kind (but lecherous) man who does everything he can to help them fulfill their wildest dreams. Cathy takes ballet lessons, Chris goes to medical school. It's almost perfect! Everything would be perfect, except for the fact that the past still haunts them. To personalize a cheesy clich&eacute;, you can take the kids out of the attic but you can't take the attic out of the kids.Perhaps in large part due to all the abuse and neglect and starvation she suffered, Carrie is very small (with a head that doesn't quite fit her tiny body), and the kids all tease her at school. And she still lives in fear that she is as evil as the grandmother always told them they were. Chris is still madly in love with Cathy. He can't imagine loving any other woman. Cathy is desperate to make it as a ballerina and prove that she is better than her mother. She doesn't want anyone, and especially Chris, holding her back. She feels ashamed about her relationship with Chris and she does all she can to escape her feelings for him and make him turn away from her.I assume that if you are truly interested in reading this book, you have already read FitA. So I think we can skip the \\"INCEST WARNING\\" and move on, right?Yes, Petals on the Wind contains incest. It kinda has to. There's no way that Cathy and Chris could do what they did in FitA and not have it affect their relationship for the rest of their lives. The question is, will they move on? Will they heal and find love again in more appropriate places? Will they renounce sex altogether and live the lives of nuns and priests (lol)? Or will Chris try to drag Cathy down with him and pester her until she gives in? A morbidly interesting dilemma, indeed, as we see Cathy hopping from one man to the next as she tries to escape her brother's smothering lust. Three men in particular catch her eye and make it into her fantasies---her much older guardian, an abusive danseur named Julian and her mother's husband Bart.Cathy is not exactly a player. She has a few lovers but not an exorbitant amount. The thing about Cathy's sexual life is that it is just so darned inappropriate that we can't help but shake our heads at her and think, \\"That girl is out of her mind.\\" For example, right off the bat, she decides it would be interesting to seduce her (lecherous) guardian. And, somehow or other, it only goes downhill from there. For many, this will be very off-putting. She's not as sympathetic as she was in FitA. But she's hurting and she's traumatized, so, at times, I couldn't help but feel pity for her, despite her foolish, even downright cruel, ways.There is a lot of sex in the book. It is written in a way that gives the novel a trashy feel. Cathy is out to cause her mother pain and suffering, and one way she does this, in particular, is so incredibly sick and wrong that it makes one want to smack her. Many of the other characters are extraordinarily selfish and abusive as well, and yet still, Cathy comes across as a manipulative, abrasive, extremely vindictive woman who does what she wants at any cost to her self and to others. It makes for a tense and interesting plotline (and maybe that's why so many fans seem to like this book). I certainly don't think it's ever boring. And the characters are quite multi-dimensional for a book of this kind. They will do things that will greatly frustrate the reader, yet I think fans of the first book will be entertained. I think it's a decent sequel, so long as you know what to expect.So read this book if you were frustrated by the end of FitA and want to see the grandmother and mother pay for their horrible crimes against defenseless little children. I don't think the conclusion is completely satisfying but it's a decent revenge story. Read this book if you want to know more about Cathy and Chris and their day to day lives and struggles---though keep in mind that the incest doesn't go away but only becomes worse. The book does feel a bit like a soap opera with all that's going on, but if you're just looking to be entertained, give it a try. I think that, chances are, if you loved FitA, you'll at least enjoy PotW. But keep in mind that Cathy's changed. She's not the responsible little 12 year old anymore. Everything that was once good about her has gone out the window. She's an emotional wreck. And she's out there in the world now, intent on getting back all that was denied her. And she's hungry for blood!"},{"Title":"Petals on the wind","review":"I decided to take a go at reading a genre I wouldn't normally &amp; started with V. C Andrews &quot;Flowers in the Attic&quot;, this book totally changed my mind about the things I had been reading previously, as it was so good. I went onto reading &quot;Petals on the Wind&quot;, I wondered whether like most series it would be a let down, but it was nothing close. It was full of emotions most books can't portray. It gives you deeper insite into the Dresden Dolls growing up, the now older &amp; seductive Cathy, the painfully depressing Carrie, and the handsome, intellectual Chris. All with their own new issues entering adulthood. It is full of entertainment. I wasn't once bored with this story, I read it in a couple of days. Yes, it was depressing in places, but it made up for it in others. The only downside I thought was that the story made them all grow up to fast, there wasn't much youth &amp; vibrance left by the end like in-Flowers in the attic. I think the fact there was so much loss &amp; change made the story all the more interesting.I would recommend this book to anyone wanting a good entertaining, hearty read. I can definitely say it is on my top of the list for good reading material."},{"Title":"Petals on the wind","review":"I don't think any of V.C's books could be better than Flowers in the Attic but this one came close. It's definately full of shocks and surprises. Like the first in the Doll. series it's very depresing. It's very nicely written with twists turns, and a few deaths. It's basically all about Cathy finding a man she can love and hang on to and getting revenge on her mother. She eventually does but it's at a price. Like I said this series is VERY DEPRESSING! Because I might have nigtmares. istilll haven't read Seeds Of Yesterday, the last in this series. But a good read and a GREAT CLASSIC."},{"Title":"Petals on the wind","review":"Please tell me it's a lie! This is the most immoral book I've ever read. Cathy is simply sick. She had to have been mentally ill to do the things she did in this book. She went way to far. Sleeping with your MOTHER'S HUSBAND is NOT the way to get revenge. BEATING YOUR GRANDMOTHER despite her earlier cruelty is NOT the way to get revenge. All it took to get revenge was to tell the people who she was, make her sick mama go as broke as a bag lady and maybe Bart Winslow would break up the marriage as the real Corrine was revealed. That was all it took to stir a controversial uproar. And after the last paragraph, I'm too afraid to know what happens in the next book."},{"Title":"Petals on the wind","review":"This book shows how money can ruin even the best intentions and the lengths to which some people will go to have money, even to the point of putting there own children into harms way. A story of strength, courage and determination to live against all odds."},{"Title":"Petals on the wind","review":"I don't like Cathy. She is truly monstrous. First off, I don't like the way she seduces Bart, Sr. I also don't like Julian Marquet or his pushy mother. They are a pair of dancing fools. Cathy was a fool to marry Julian and an even bigger fool to take up an uxorial role with her brother, Christopher. V.C. Andrews (this was the REAL V.C. Andrews and not the GW) has run that tired theme of brother-and-sister incestuous relationships underground. The stories are all more or less predictable.The V. C. Andrews has never been at a loss for monstrous females, starting with the grandmother Olivia, the shallow, stupid mother Corinne who locked the children in the attic for over three years and killed her youngest child, Cory, and of course, Cathy the Fiend. Cathy is singularly horrific. Forcing Carrie to leave Paul's comfortable house where she was loved and happy, was the height of stupid and unfair. It was too bad Carrie didn't just point blank refuse to go with Cathy when the latter insisted they head north, near the Foxworth estate. When Carrie commits suicide, one can easily feel that Cathy was to a large extent responsible for Carrie's act. If she hadn't pressured Carrie to leave Paul's, Carrie would have been spared the horror of revisiting the Foxworth years. Cathy belongs in the toilet with the other sewage."},{"Title":"Petals on the wind","review":"ive read FITA years ago after watching the movie(which i feel should be redone and remade correct). For the longest time i wanted to know \\"what happens next?\\" and finally, now that i have more time to read i bought Petals on the Wind.i finished this book in a week and enjoyed it very much. i dont think its fair to judge Cathy,being a prisoner for 3 years in the attic affected the 3 of them differently. I feel as though she went from man to man to erase her feelings for her brother. The fact that Chris wanted her so badly scared her, she didnt want to be a sinner and her feelings for him scared her.When you are treated as if you are nothin but \\"attic mice\\" for Years and treated this way by your mother you are scarred.Cathy wanted love she wanted comfort.As for the revenge, it began too late into the book. And i wish she woulda played with her mother a bit more, like REally torment her.I love the way the author arranged these books, FITA we go from a happy family, to sorrow,to horror @ the Mansion, to anger @ the mother, to YEARS later, mom has a new life and the kids exscape. Then we have Petals where Cathy is 15, they are all so ill, to being happy again, to cathy in NY, being abused,finding her moher having kids being married 2x....etc. SO much in 2 books i feel as tho these characters are REAl :)Very good book and i highly reccommend it but FITA is a classic in my opinion and was a VERY hard book to go up against with a sequel. But the author did an amazing job"},{"Title":"Petals on the wind","review":"While I trully enjoyed this book, it is in no way as good as Flowers In The Attic. However, the last four or five chapters are SO worth it. The books has perhaps one of the best climaxes that I've ever read and it twists and turns just about as much as the first book did.If you have to read these novels, I'd have to say stop after this one. The next three books in the series just aren't as good as the first two.Petals On The Wind delivers, but just as good as Flowers In The Attic."},{"Title":"Petals on the wind","review":"Cathy really make somethig of herself. From being an attic child, to a mature ballerina. It was cool that she finally go back at her mother Corine. But it was sad how most of her relationships end in tragedy. Julian believed he was nothing without the dance, Bart died in an alleged fire that Corine started in Foxworth Hall, and her foster father died of old age. This is a good book, and it is worth reading in the series."},{"Title":"Petals on the wind","review":"I dont think the man who watched her in the shadows in her dreams was Bart Sr. I think it has been Chris all along. Chris was the one always there, watching her, yearning for her. Julian, Paul and Bart Sr. were insignificant (well, maybe not Paul.. but i mean in Cathy's life).What Chris and Cathy feel for each other is not sick. At least, i dont find it sick. Their love story is one of the most saddest love story that I ever read. Im glad that Paul died and had Cathy accept Chris. It's the way its meant to be. Cathy and Chris belong together, therefore they should be with each other."},{"Title":"Petals on the wind","review":"I like Cathy, except the way she treats Chris. It really isn't his fault. Most people say it's a &quot;sick, sad relationship. &quot;, but I say it's just sad. Sad that Cathy won't admit that she, too, has sinful feelings for her sibling. She runs from man to man, trying to fight off Chris, but only ends up in his arms (my favorite part). I don't think Jullian was useful, I personally hated his guts for what he did with Carrie and other younger girls, and then ran back to Cathy, claiming he was lonely. He's a sick, sad jerk, and I hate him for ruining her like that, and hating Chris and Paul, becuase he knew Cathy had feelings for them. Cathy annoyed me in her relationship with Paul, that's worse that the Cathy/Chris relationship, which is sweet and sad, but hers' and Pauls' is disgusting! She's his legal DAUGHTER! Hello! Her affair with Bart was stupid, I think he's a loser, cheating on his wife for Cathy, and then refusing to marry her, even when he knew she was carrying his only child. I loved the way she confronted her mother, and grandmother. Yessss! But that thing with Carrie.... oh, how I cried! It was sooooo sad. Corrine was still the evil, disgusting, revolting person she became in Flowers In The Attic, and it was annyoing with her denying Cathy, Carrie, and Jory. Ohhhh, how I wish to punch that woman! Take my advice, read this book if you like twisted, interesting stories, but make sure to read Flowers In The Attic first, because you'd be lost in the plot. Then, you can finish the series, and take it from me, it just gets better, crazier, but better!"},{"Title":"Petals on the wind","review":"i was looking for something to read on a plane ride. really loved the book. a lot of diffrences in the movie flowers in the attic. gooooooood book!"},{"Title":"Petals on the wind","review":"V.C.

For some reason, I never read the Dollanganger saga before, but now that I have, it has to be the best series out of all of them! I got through the first three books in 4 days, completely unable to put them down. Andrews hits it right on the nose for me, putting everything I love to read about in one novel, including angst, drama, love. I don't seem to mind the incest either. I think Chris' and Cathy's love is beautiful. The only flaw in this book, and in If There Be Thorns, is that Cathy sometimes seems very selfish and self absorbed, too focused on getting even with her mother than what is going on around her. Even so, the books are fantastic and I can't wait to get started on the fourth one!"},{"Title":"Petals on the wind","review":"Part Two of Flowers in the Attic.Carrie, Chris and Cathy have escaped the attic at last. Now we get to see how messed up their lives will be.Incase you missed Flowers in the Attic, it's about a greedy woman who decides to hide her kids in a attic from her father. He won't let her inherit if she had any kids from her uncle she was married too. This kids spent four years in the attic waiting for escape as they hit puberty together and commited incest.Now in Petals, we find Chris and Cathy trying to get on with their lives. We watch Cathy try to pull away from Chris, but he knows his sister is his soulmate.Petals is ok at best through most of it as it skips around a lot over several years of their lives. What kills me is Cathy. Just when you think she's going to be ok, she makes the dumbest decision in the world. Things seem ok, then Cathy gets lied too. The author skips a couple chapters of progression, and out of nowhere, Cathy is making the most idiotic decision ever. I won't spoil it, but this disgust me and makes Petals my least favorite under the name. If good writing is making a character so moronic that you can never forget her, then V.C Andrews is the best!But she's not the best. Remember the progression missing? Missing chapters? It's almost like she just decided to do what we won't expect just to tick us off. She tries to correct it later by saying Cathy is impulsive, but she's not. Not enough for this decision. No, this is the worst writing mistake of all time.These first two books are creative and one of a kind, but overall nothing special. They are average, but grabbed our attention as we hoped they would escape the attic and avoid incest. These two books get credit for the fame of the V.C Andrews name and get a ghost writer hired to write in her honor. It's important to remember how she got famous. She writes about tragedy. Usually a family member will do something unspeakable that rips everyone apart. Secrets, incest or forbidden romance, and main characters who are ok, then make a decision that will wreck their lives.The reason to remember this is because that is what the ghost writer is getting paid to imitate.In every book I can think of, he copies at least one of the area's that made her famous. And usually does it better. He gives us a hint of forbidden romance, but thankfully we don't actually see it. He makes us a good main character then has her make one decision that messes everything up. Usually his character decisions are a lot more realistic than Cathy's. He writes four series after this one that are all better. After reading them, I believe he's the reason the VC Andrews name is so popular. He writes some darn good books, then ruins them by the bad character decisions usually. He needs to write like her, to be under her name, but he doesn't have to ruin them. Like she did. If he'd only write for himself, some would be best sellers.Most V.C Andrews books cover tragedy and romance. Their not really a romance, but most have strong secondary romance plots. All most all of them grab us within the first chapter and keep us glued. The ghost writer gives us some amazing stories, but usually leaves us feeling sick as tragedy strikes. Just like this one, except better written."},{"Title":"Petals on the wind","review":"The book itself was good, but I couldn't get past the repeated typos in the text.

I hope it's only the kindle version, but I have a suspicion even the new printed editions will be the same.Someone, presumably the ghastly ghost writer, has changed this story all through. Though much of it remains the same, scenes and dialog have been edited, a whole lot of ummecessary things added, and even words changed to appear more modernized!The original was a fantastic sequel which more than lived up to the first. This version has been made cheesy, ridiculous and I resent mostly that just enough has been done to make Cathy appear beyond shallow and Carrie like a dumb hillbilly. In the original she had a proper grasp of the english language!It's as though the ghostwriter has sought to make the original novels more like his own - cheesy and cringeworthy! Enough of the original remains that the story was still ok but why did they ruin it when it used to be so much better! Shame on the publishers for doing this!To those who haven't read it yet, try to find an older copy printed in the nineties. You won't regret it.

In &quot;Flowers&quot; V.C. Andrews gives us strong, beautiful characters. However, in &quot; Petals on the Wind&quot; I found myself thinking how annoying the main character, Cathy, was. V.C. Andrews has us reading a cat and mouse game all throughout the book with Cathy and all of these men which got quite tiring after awhile. I still plan to read the last three books in the series but I would have enjoyed this book sooo much more if V.C. Andrews didn't repeat the same dialog, the same events with Cathy and Chris, with Cathy and Julian, with Cathy and Bart, with Cathy and Paul, etc. Do you kind of sense a pattern? Also V.C. Andrews creates so many times when Cathy sits and sobs a river when Cathy is the one that creates all the drama. I think V.C. Andrews could have written Cathy as a stronger character, anyways I do reccomend it if you have patience and if you are a die hard V.C. Andrews fan.Small summary:Cathy, Chris, and Carrie finally escape from the dark attic where they were hidden for over three years. They get on a bus where Carrie becomes very ill. With the help of Henrietta Beech, the siblings are introduced to Dr. Paul Sheffield who generously takes them in and gives them a place to say. Cathy soon enters a ballet school and follows her dreams of being a professional dancer, while Chris goes to school to become a doctor. Carrie, however, is very miserable and wants to be excepted and isn't because her head is to large for her body... the story basically just follows them throughout their lives.

The plasma parched girl is thristing for revenge but takes forever and a day to get around to it (this book would have been a short novel if she had done it sooner). What made the first book so good was its timelessness, the aura of a fairy tale gone horribly bad. In this book the characters move about a very real and time placed world and this weakens the book. While it may have its moments, they are so few and far between they don't merit looking for, and abuse is not a sign of true love. Soap opera fans might want to give it a look, others should skip it."},{"Title":"Petals on the wind","review":"I started off with Flowers in the attic, being as it is the first book, and I really enjoyed it, so I decided to get the follow up, v.c. andrews is a great writer, but sometimes its a bit confusing.

As we approach the ending of the last book (flowers in the attic) Cathy and Chris set out with a high attitude that things will work out for the best. However, in the outside world, things get even more complicated and twisted then you can imagine. Chris can't seem to let go of his love for Cathy, and Cathy can't seem to let go of her revenge on her mother. Carrie also suffers in this book, for being locked up in the attic for many years, her health seems to suffer and the poor little girl can't grow. In this book Cathy suffers with several relationship issues, Carrie gets teased at school, and as for Chris, he can't seem to move on. With the traumatic experiance of the attic in their minds, it seems to follow them and effect them everywhere they go. As disturbing and sad as this book is, its unpredictable. It's a totally different world compared to part one, but the suspense and drama continues to get more and more interesting."},{"Title":"Petals on the wind","review":"I really enjoyed reading this book, i stole it from my Engl. teacher who was goin to throw it away, im glad i got it.

At the end of it, I wanted more! How was the mother going to &quot;pay&quot; for her sins? In Pedals in the Wind, she paid -- but so did everyone else. How I wanted Cathy to get her revenge; knowing revenge only destroys. At the end, it was only experiencing &quot;true love&quot;, from where ever she could find it was going to save Cathy's soul. Or so I thought. How was she to know what love was all about when she had only her brother's love to measure it by? They all would have died in the attic if love for each other hadn't made them survive their ordeal. This story hurts to read it. It made my tears flow when Carrie died and when Paul and Chris loved so strongly but weren't loved in return. If you decide to read this book, you won't soon forget it."},{"Title":"Petals on the wind","review":"The book in which the four Dresden dolls finally escape was disappointing. Yes, I was expecting horror galore, but this was ridiculous. I understand that Cathy had to experience terrible things in order to prove she could overcome them, but this girl turned into a conceited psycho. I'll admit she is strong, and was a good mother to Carrie and her children, and I understand her feeling of revenge (who couldn't?) but she who supposedly cared for Chris so much and wanted him to have a normal life, really broke his heart and would not let him find another. I really did not like any of the weak male characters either. The pattern of this book was odd--but I will give it this it wasn't boring, and the Flowers series really makes you think."},{"Title":"Computer Analysis and Qualitative Research (New Technologies for Social Research series)","review":"Nice!

It (he) helped me understand what it means to be a West Virginian and had a lot to with my choice of career. I had the good fortune to have lunch with him twice in his final year. As I was driving to Richwood I worried he would fall off the pedestal I had put him on. He put those foolish fears to rest and regaled me with 4 or 5 hours of one-on-one stories.

It's wonderful. We spent nearly all of our time in the Peloponnese and enjoyed it very much. The book gives the mythology of each area in a lively style, which added to my pleasure in what I was seeing. We would know what to watch out for before we boarded the bus, train, or taxi. For example, between Nafplio and Epidaurus we saw the bridge from Mycenaean times, after being in Mycenae two days earlier. The Peloponnese is the setting for a great many of the Greek myths, and this guide made it easy to match the story to the place. Also the maps by area - sort of like our county - were excellent.I would not use this for practicalities of travel, but instead to get you excited about going and about being there. If you pair it with a guide to hotels, restaurants, and transportation, you can have a fabulous vacation. I'm hoping to go again, since there is much that we didn't have time for in 13 days."},{"Title":"GREECE: THE PELOPONNESE","review":"An absolute absolute must for anyone going to the Peloponnese, 'the garden of Greece.' Facaros and Theodorou have obviously been up every little by way and thanks to their guidance we found at least a dozen stunning little villages and ancient sites and quirky old churches that no other guides even mention (and we had the Rough Guide and Blue Guide in the car as well). Their in depth knowledge and humour helped us get so much more out of our holiday, and even we who have lived just outside Athens for the past eight years were surprised at all the stuff we didn't know. The restaurant and hotel recommendations were spot on, too, and led us to some places (especially in the mountains) that we never would have found on our own, where nightingales serenaded us to sleep. The only complaint is that there were n't enough site plans, but it's a minor gripe. An excellent guide, and a great read."},{"Title":"GREECE: THE PELOPONNESE","review":"Although Greece is thronged with tourists, most of them spend a few days in Athens and then head for the islands. Only a few cross the Corinth Canal into the wild and fascinating island of the Peloponnese, and then only to visit the ruins of Olympia or Sparta. Yet beyond these is a barren, beautiful, and friendly land, heretore neglected by guidebooks. Facaros' &quot;Greece: The Peloponnese&quot; fills this gap, constituting a complete guide to the attractions, accommodations, and geography of this area. It is complete, covering virtually every village, full of historical tidbits, and packed with useful information about hotels, restaurants, good beaches, and, of course, the many ruins dotting this home of ancient Greece. Geared to the independent tourist, its recommendations for food and lodging are tailored to all budgets. This book is the one to read before you go, and take with you; it was invaluable on a recent trip to the region. Go to the Peloponnese before it's discovered (a recent New York Times blurb will hasten that) and take Facaros' book with you. (Note: ancient-history mavens will also want to take &quot;The Blue Guide to Greece&quot;, as &quot;Greece: the Peloponnese&quot; does not go into excruciating detail about the many ruins of the island.)"},{"Title":"GREECE: THE PELOPONNESE","review":"This is a really good guide for travel in the Peloponnese.

This book is not one of the better cookie books, and I suggest that you avoid it.There were a few bright spots. Each recipe is generously formatted on one page, so you will not need to break out the reading glasses to read the recipes. Each recipe also comes with a full color picture so you can see what the end result will be, which is a nice editorial decision that I wish more cookbooks would emulate. I also noted that the recipe procedures have all been standardized (virtually all cookie recipes call for ungreased cookie sheets), so that if you can do one cookie, you can do all of them. Interestingly, although I got a couple of really good chocolate chip cookie variations, the non-cookie recipes were actually more interesting than the cookies, viz: White Chocolate Pudding (a new twist on a venerable classic), Rum-Soaked Chocolate Malibu (layered chocolate cake, rum syrup, ganache frosting), White Ivory Cream Cake (white chocolate cake and white chocolate ganache frosting), and Caramel Fudge Mac Tart (pate sucree, ganache, caramel, toasted nuts). Were it not for the paucity of recipe steps, this book would make a fairly interesting chocolate cookbook (tarts, assembled cakes, pudding, ice cream cakes, and candies).The problems are many:1) the book title, as only half of the recipes are for cookies2) there are no basic instructions for beginners (or anyone else, for that matter) on how to actually make and bake cookies3) the book only refers to \\"electric mixer\\", and does not specify hand-held or stand, but one infers from the procedures that the author intends the latter, one picture of a hand held not withstanding.4) the method of flour measurement is never specified (scoop and sweep, spoon and sweep, etc.). This will significantly alter the cookie texture.5) it is often difficult to tell if the cookies will be thin and crispy, thick and cakey, toll-house like, etc. You can sometimes tell from the picture, sometimes not, and there are no descriptions of the end cookie result.6) interestingly, most of the cookies specify an ungreased cookie sheet, but many of them spread considerably in the oven.7) many of the recipes do not specify how to tell when a cookie is done baking. Some specify and time range only, while others give vague descriptions: \\"until set\\", but the author does not tell what this means.8) the recipes are often lacking in important steps or sufficient information on unusual or difficult steps. For example, the author expects you to already know how to make and fold meringues, and how to use a pastry bag.9) some recipes are difficult, but the procedures give no warning, and even here the steps are casually tossed off in a few sentences.10) the introductory information is ambiguous: are you suppose to use a regular cookie sheet, or an insulated one? The end cookie will be dramatically different, depending on which one you use.Here is the recipe count: drop 50, filled 15, decorated 15, bar 25, non-cookie (pie, cake, pudding, ice cream, candy, etc.) 110."},{"Title":"Mrs. Fields Best Ever Cookie Book!: 200 Delicious Cookie and Dessert Recipes from the Kitchen of Mrs. Fields","review":"This book has the most wonderful pictures of cookies ever!

Of course, the downside is that kids love repetition and it was almost always the Blue Ribbon Chocolate Chip Cookies (he never picked the malted milk ones).As mentioned in another review, the recipes are each on one page so you don't have to worry about turning the page which can be quite annoying, particularly when you have your cook book in a plexi-glass holder, and the type is big so with this book, I don't have to search for my reading glasses to find out the next step in the recipe."},{"Title":"Mrs. Fields Best Ever Cookie Book!: 200 Delicious Cookie and Dessert Recipes from the Kitchen of Mrs. Fields","review":"I've tried a BUNCH of recipes from this book and they have all been delicious and several have made the roster on my annual Christmas cookie baking marathon (eggnog cookies, chocolate mint cookies, pecan pie bars, triple lemon bars, brown sugar shortbread cookies, white chocolate macadamia cookies, mini chocolate chip macaroons are just a few of the many I have tried).

The stances and techniques are recognizably from each and the bulk of the curriculum appears to be genuine chinese kung fu that any kung fu practitioner would recognize. Glenn Wilson, Don \\"The Dragon\\" Wilson, and Steve Jungman have proven the training as effective in tough fighting competitions and Lei Tai tournaments for years.I found this book to be informative and a jumping-off point for further research into Pai Lum Tao; it inspired me to want to learn more.

Pai that refuse to associate or acknowledge him or openly call Wilson a fraud.So let's please not confuse Pai Lum and Pai Lum Tao because for the most part they are operating as two very separate organizations.Knowing how quite a few Pai Lum practitioners felt about Wilson, I got a copy of the book (cheap, as a used book). It has a few things from Pai Lum that I recognize, but a lot that I don't and even some of the forms and exercises that I did recognize, Wilson gives them different names, or uses them for different defenses.Yes, Wilson did have some training under Daniel K.

Enlarged Edition, and a more \\"readable\\" distillation isThe Changing World of Mormonism: A Behind-the-Scenes Look at Changes in Mormon Doctrine and Practice.The Tanners begin this short (31-page) booklet with the statement, \\"One of the chief differences between the Mormon Church and the RLDS Church centers around the question of who was the successor to Joseph Smith. While the Utah Mormons claim that Brigham Young was the true successor, the RLDS maintain that Joseph Smith had bestowed this right on his son Joseph Smith III. Although the Utah Church has always disputed this claim, a recent discovery by Mark Hofmann proves that Joseph Smith actually did designate his son as successor.\\"(Mark Hofmann, of course, is a forger of documents, who murdered two people with bombs in 1985 when he was about to be discovered, and is currently serving a life sentence. The Tanners tell the story of their experiences with him in their booksTracking the white salamander: The story of Mark Hofmann, murder, and forged Mormon documentsand \\"Confessions of a White Salamander.\\")Here are some other quotations from the book:\\"On January 19, 1841, Joseph Smith gave a revelation which said that ... Joseph Smith should build a house (the Nauvoo House), and that his descendants should 'have place' in the house forever.... The Mormons, of course, left Nauvoo after Joseph Smith's death and the Nauvoo House was left unfinished... Because the Mormon Church has lost control of the Nauvoo House they are unable to fulfill Joseph Smith's prophecy concerning it.\\" (Pg. 6)\\"Lorenzo Snow, who later became President of the Mormon Church, was questioned concerning Brigham Young's appointment: 'Brigham Young took the Presidency of the Church after the death of Joseph Smith. He was appointed to the position and accepted by the people. That was one way he was made President. He was not appointed by Joseph Smith as the President. I do not understand that Joseph Smith designated him as his successor, and Brigham Young never claimed that he did.'\\" (Pg. 22)\\"It would appear from the evidence presented that if the Mormon Church ever had any 'priesthood,' it was lost when Brigham Young took the presidency unto himself.\\" (Pg. 31)"},{"Title":"Playboy Adult Magazine:October 1987","review":"Playboy November 1997 is one - hundred and eighty - four pages and sold for back then $4.95; Suzen Johnson is on the front cover.

It started with introductory notes written by the Man himself &amp; his wife (Lonnie Ali), Bill Cosby, Nelson Mandela, Henry Cooper (just to name a few), mainly discussing the bond between the photographer &amp; the man himself, how they percepted the great boxer on &amp; off the limelight. Muhammad Ali wasn't simply the loud mouth, the lover, the Islam, the winner, the loser, but truth to be told, he's also a devoted son to his parents, a loving father to his children, a dedicated husband to his wives, the charitable one to the downtrodden, the funny bone, the generosity one towards humankind, a courageous fighter who's fighting the greatest battle of his life against the Parkinson Disease, but mostly, he's like one of us, a mortal who needs a friend during his most fragile hour and that friend he found in Howard Bingham. Thru his lens, &amp; without censorship from the Man, we caught a glimpse of Muhammad Ali that we rarely saw from other footage &amp; only then, we realised he's not that icon that we grew up with but he's simply one of our kind. This journal is compiled with much thoughts &amp; sensibility &amp; it's such a joy &amp; heart warming to browse thru. A complementary journal that goes well with the book, King of the World written by David Remnick. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Muhammad Ali: A Thirty Year Journey","review":"Howard Bingham's wonderfully intimate photographs tell a fine story not only of the life of Muhammad Ali, but also of the tightly-woven texture of his friendship with &quot;The Greatest&quot;. The photos capture fresh visual perspectives on events already familiar to many Ali fans, and provide welcome peekaboos into other, perhaps lesser-known occurrences (such as Ali in a leg cast looking none-too-pleased after an ill-fated match with a Japanese wrestler). One of my personal favorites is a photo of the champion standing together with three women, each of whom would be his wife.

The structural approach considers neural morphology and synaptic connectivity. It is noted that pasterns of reciprocal interaction are common, binding structural units together. The functional approach considers functional decomposition of skills or behavior. Computational neural networks are used in models but are constrained by neuroanatomy and neurophysiology. 'Schemas' are functional entities. The dynamics approach allows analysis of spatiotemporal neural phenomena, and provides another bridge between structure and function. The reference begins with three chapters, each an overview on structure, function and dynamics.

( Of course I have only read until Starless Night.) Salvatore has yet done it again! This is the perfect introduction to the series and it wonderfully relates Drizzt's past. I have to say that this is the book that started me on Salvatore and his works. This book lays out to readers who and what Drizzt exactly is. ( There isn't a word for it so don't try to describe him.) For any of you out there that haven't read this book, READ IT! BUY IT! TREASURE IT! This is a must read for all Drizzt fans I recommend this to everyone and anyone. For those of you who want to start on Drizzt, this is the book to read! (This was how I started.) I hope that Salvatore continues to write about his wonderful drow. LONG LIVE DRIZZT!!!!"},{"Title":"Sojourn: The Dark Elf Trilogy, Part 3 (Forgotten Realms: The Legend of Drizzt, Book III)","review":"I have been a great fan of Salvatore's novels ever since I was given a copy of Homeland about six years ago. It was the first book I recieved in now what is a complete Forgotten Realms Novels collection. So, when I heard a collectors edition was being released I was very pleased. After I bought it however, I wasn't impressed. How can someone not be impressed with these books after loving them for many years? One word: Typos. Some may say this shouldn't detract from enjoyment, but I say it very much does. It is distracting to see word, spelling, and punctuation errors. It takes away from the enjoyment of the novels. Also I believe the changes from Lloth to Lolth were unnecesary. At a point in Exile it caused a major problem with the wording. (P. 353 Full paragraph three in the hardcover. P. 92 in the paper backm where it reads correctly) So, in short, while the story telling, character developement, and plot is all worthy of five stars, the errors make it lose two of them. These are things that could have been fixed if they had been careful.On a side note I know there are errors in this review, but I'm not getting paid to write it, nor are there people paid to edit it."},{"Title":"Sojourn: The Dark Elf Trilogy, Part 3 (Forgotten Realms: The Legend of Drizzt, Book III)","review":"This book is very similar to the previous Exile. It consists of a series of vignettes of Drizzt travelling and fighting of course. However this book takes place on the surface and without the very interesting setting of the Underdark and the complex Drow culture it is nowhere near as interesting.Drizzt has made it to the surface and he tries to find a home amongst the surface dwellers. At this point in his life he is seemingly far too naive in his attempts at interacting with the other races of the Forgotten Realms. For a villain we have essentially a redneck bounty hunter who continues to pursue Drizzt to receive more punishment in each meeting.The action is still good, but the lack of the Underdark as a setting, the lack of the Drow culture and a buffoonish villain rather than the future Artemis Entreri or Drizzt's own kin make this inferior to the previous two novels in the trilogy."},{"Title":"Sojourn: The Dark Elf Trilogy, Part 3 (Forgotten Realms: The Legend of Drizzt, Book III)","review":"This one ends up exactly the way you'd imagine, but i won't ruin it for any potential readers.This is a must read tie in, i'll give it that. You learn how Drizzt became a ranger, what became of his piwafwi, and how he met up with some important characters from Icewind Dale and so forth. So, don't expect any harsh stuff like the confrontations with Zaknafein, or the evil family undertones, cause they're not there. But do it read it if you're two books into the series, just dont expect Homeland quality stuff."},{"Title":"Sojourn: The Dark Elf Trilogy, Part 3 (Forgotten Realms: The Legend of Drizzt, Book III)","review":"The product arrived with perfect timing as well as in impeccable condition!

The day I picked up this book happened to be one of those days however. Here is an example of one of the most superb writing styles that I have ever encountered. There is a masterful balance of action, adventure, and character/plot development that is rare to see. Typically, heavy action detracts from everything else, but not here.The characters are so well described and developed that they practically come to life.The book takes place in the Forgotten Realms, a world for Dungeons and Dragons. You don't have to be a gamer to read and enjoy this book or the other two in the trilogy although, if you are familiar with the world, you'll have that much more description going in. It is a collection of 3 books: Homeland, Exile, and Sojourn.This book starts from the nitty gritty beginning with the birth of Drizzt Do'Urden, one of the most famous characters in Forgotten Realms. A drow (dark elf) by birth, he is born with strange lavender eyes and a good, moral heart that is extremely rare amongst his kin. In drow society, males are subservient to females so he is already at a disadvantage due to his gender. As the time goes by and he is exposed more and more to the evils and brutality of his kin and their evil deity, the Spider Queen Lolth, he realizes that he will never fit in with them. Eventually, he decides to leave the underground Drow city of Menzoberranzan and all of the evil that is there, much to the dismay of his family. When he figures out that his fellow Drow will never stop pursuing him, he decides to travel to the surface.Throughout you get to really see the internal workings of Drizzt and his turmoil and struggles with his heritage as well as his desire to fit in with those on the surface that fear him for being what he is. If you enjoy fantasy, I am quite sure that once you pick this book up you won't put it down until you are done or you are in desperate need of food."},{"Title":"Sojourn: The Dark Elf Trilogy, Part 3 (Forgotten Realms: The Legend of Drizzt, Book III)","review":"have to say this is absolutely the weakest of the three. i found the characters quite boring and lot of stuff was kind of meaningless. i skipped a lot of pages after middle because everything got so boring. oh well. i think 2nd one was my favorite of the series. this one was not good."},{"Title":"Sojourn: The Dark Elf Trilogy, Part 3 (Forgotten Realms: The Legend of Drizzt, Book III)","review":"Book II of this trilogy was amazing, so its a hard act to follow.Also, technically speaking Book IV was written before this (just like the star wars trilogy) so the author was somewhat \\"boxed in.\\"In the end, this book serves as a \\"transitional piece\\" which in places feels forced and contrived.I recommend buying it anyway, and sticking with it, as the following trilogy is amazing."},{"Title":"Sojourn: The Dark Elf Trilogy, Part 3 (Forgotten Realms: The Legend of Drizzt, Book III)","review":"This was where I started in the Salvatore world. It was written after Icewind Dale but the events happen before. It basically chronicles the origin of Drizzt Do'urden. The 3 books that are combined here are: Homeland, Exile, and Sojourn. Homeland is mostly about Drizzt's upbringing in Menzoberaranzan, the home of the drow elf. It chronicles his notorious rise to fame amongst the drow houses and sets in motion Drizzt's need to find a \\"better place\\". Drizzt and possibly Zak (his father) are the only drow characters with an ounce of humanity and that shakes Drizzt to his very core. The next book, Exile, chronicles his various adventures in the Underdark after he flees his home. He partners with a svirnebli (some sort of dwarf-gnome critter with an affinity towards mining) and an enchanted Hook Horror (used to be a Pech I believe) as he continues to avoid his would be assassins. This book was also very good. Sojourn chronicles his initial adventures outside of the Underdark and while enjoyable, it was not as compelling as the first two in my opinion. All in all, an enjoying read."},{"Title":"Sojourn: The Dark Elf Trilogy, Part 3 (Forgotten Realms: The Legend of Drizzt, Book III)","review":"Once again RAS does it agin with another solid Drizzt story.

The whole world would agree with me if they just gave these books a chance. This book was stimulateing in all levels, it made me cry, laugh, shiver, and scream in rage in every chapter. And the essays that R.A. Salvatore put in between each part of the books was one of the most creative and fantastic ideas I have found in the many books I have read.

The journal entries of Drizzt Do'Urden which first appear in Homeland are so eloquent and deep that they leave the reader pondering them for quite some time.

In the previous two books, Homeland and Exile, Drizzt could defeat every enemy and got an occasional friend. He was nearly invulnerable. Here he faces prejudice, and with the prejudice he faces shame. His materials don't work. Everyone thinks he is evil. He starves for companionship, but he knows no one will except him. This book, above all, shows hardship in Drizzt, something difficult to find in a world where his scimitars rule. This book provides a better view of the road then do Streams of Silver and The Halflings Gem. It is more realistic, and makes this strange fantasy world believable.

For me, he has given his characters such depth and feeling that I truly watched the stories unfold as I turned the pages.

Salvatore novel I ever read. (Yes i started reading book three first. not sure why but i did) Drizzt's odyssey through the physcial world and mentally through the drow elf's mind's eye is deep, complex, and brilliantly written. The inner conflect within Drizzt is real and convincing. R.A. Salvatore writes a vivid adventure with strong character development and epic action scenes as adeptly as any author out there today. After reading this one I immediatly went out and bought book one to find out how the series started. I am now on book 7 of the Drizzt series and loving every page. This is perhaps the best novel i have ever read! I finished it in only four days. A must read! 5 stars!"},{"Title":"Sojourn: The Dark Elf Trilogy, Part 3 (Forgotten Realms: The Legend of Drizzt, Book III)","review":"I have been thrilled with the Dark Elf Trilogy and the third book definitely did not disappoint. It has a bit of a different \\"feel\\" to it than the first two because it now takes place on the surface. Drizzt finally has left the Underdark but he knows next to nothing about the surface world. He quickly discovers that there are many dangers that lurk and there is an existing prejudice against Drow.He is fortunate that important surface dwellers identify his unusual good nature and he is taken in by an old Ranger who teaches him not only about the surface, but what it is to be a Ranger.Despite facing gnolls, giants, and a whole host of other rotten surface dwellers, his worst enemy remains himself and the haunting of his past."},{"Title":"Sojourn: The Dark Elf Trilogy, Part 3 (Forgotten Realms: The Legend of Drizzt, Book III)","review":"This is an amazing story! The whole trilogy was great, each book having very distinctive changes in setting and the mentality of the main character. Many trilogies seem to have this \\"middle book\\" syndrome with the second entry, where it really just feels like a bridge between the first and the third. In this trilogy, each entry stands very well its own and ends with a solid conclusion.R.A. Salvatore does a wonderful job of developing Drizzt as a character throughout the series and allows the reader to really feel like they \\"know\\" him. He also does a phenomenal job of describing the Underdark and creating a vivid picture of the dark world to the readers.Sojourn is a wonderful story of the trials Drizzt must go through on his quest to be accepted in an unfamiliar world, where he can only hope that the principles of its inhabitants are more in line with his than those of his evil kin. A fun comparison can be drawn between Sojourn and Mary Shelley's Frankenstein with the beginning of Drizzt's adventures on the surface. I just happened to read Sojourn right before reading Frankenstein for an English class and had a great time relating Drizzt to Frankenstein's monster in the beginning of his tale.I highly recommend this whole trilogy to any avid fantasy readers. You'll find it hard to stop reading, even after the third book. Fortunately, there's plenty more in the saga, so have fun with it!"},{"Title":"Sojourn: The Dark Elf Trilogy, Part 3 (Forgotten Realms: The Legend of Drizzt, Book III)","review":"Drizzt Do'Urden is an enigma of his race of Dark Elves. He carries inside him a conscience. Something that none of his people can claim, even his father Zaknafein, but at least he knew the things he did were evil and vile. He hoped that in his son, Drizzt, he could make right his wrongs, and amazingly enough, he did. He instilled in the few short years he had in training him in the art of weaponry and fighting, morals and to think for himself, rationalize and know right from wrong. But in so doing, Zaknafein's tutelage sentenced Drizzt to a very lonely solitary existence. For having a conscience within the drow society is a death sentence.In book one of The Dark Elf trilogy, Drizzt is born, and as he grows he sees how disturbing and cruel his people are and eventually it's his death they want. In book two, Drizzt is alone and on his own with his panther companion. They travel the tunnels of the Underdark alone, until he makes a few unusual friendships. But Drizzt soon realizes that there is nowhere he can go to escape the wrath of his family. The underworld is no longer his home. Drizzt heads to the above world, a place he's only seen once, and under terrible circumstances.For months Drizzt watches from his cave home. And one day he spies a farm and the family that occupies it. He wants what he sees. The teasing, the rough-housing, the friendships. The love. But it would seem that Drizzt is not destined for those things yet. Oh and how badly I felt Drizzt's longing to belong. To find a place in this new world, but due to his dark elf appearance (because really in all other aspects of the drow, Drizzt is nothing like them), he is condemned and hunted. His people are feared in the above world, and all the humans and other creatures see is the terror and violence and hatred that the Dark Elves have created with their behavior.\\"If only he could find acceptance among those who so hated-as he himself hated-the ways of his dark people, then Drizzt Do'Urden would be at peace.\\" Sojourn, 1991~Throughout the course of this trilogy, Drizzt has became an exceedingly vivid and amazing character. He has faults, but he stands for all that is good. He is brave. He is strong. He wants acceptance and to be at peace within himself and with the above world inhabitants. Drizzt has become one of my favorite characters. I loved reading about his trials as he journeys in search of a place to call home through the wide world of pain and joy, so says the wise old blind ranger. The trilogy eneded on a happy note, after so much fighting and death.This first trilogy in the Legend of Drizzt may have come to an end, but I have the next three boxed sets to get lost in. And get lost in I plan on doing over the course of the year!"},{"Title":"Sojourn: The Dark Elf Trilogy, Part 3 (Forgotten Realms: The Legend of Drizzt, Book III)","review":"Say what you will about R.A. Salvatore, that he killed Chewbacca, that he's spawned an infinitude of Mary Sues, or that his novels are overrated but the fact remains that he is very popular. So, it stands to reason that R.A.'s novels must have merit to them, that they can't just be hack jobs as some have been said to say.So I checked them out, starting chronologically rather than in order of writing (in which case The Crystal Shard would have been first. By the time I got to Sojourn I had read both of the first two parts of the Dark Elf trilogy, Homeland and Exile, both of which had been mildly entertaining, but nothing special. I wasn't sure, as I turned on to the third novel, how much I'd enjoy it. But I was pleasantly surprised and Sojourn is easily the best of this prequel trilogy.A bit of backup here for those who don't know anything about what I'm talking about (this is the third in a trilogy after all, which is itself a prequel trilogy). The Dark Elf trilogy follows the early life and origin story of Drizzt Do'Urden. The first novel, Homeland, charts his life from birth into adolescence as he's trained to be a deadly warrior for his clan. Eventually Drizzt's moral leanings put him at edge with his cutthroat family and he is forced to leave in order to save his life, which leads into the appropriately-named second book Exile. In this novel Drizzt hones his skill through the horrors of the Underdark, evading the pursuit of his family. In the conclusion he finds he must leave the Underdark and head for the surface world.This brings us to Sojourn which demonstrates how Drizzt deals with this new world which is as unfamiliar to him as the treacherous Underdark would be to us. His immediate encounters are, of course, unpleasant as his race has earned a reputation of horror and hatred. So Drizzt is again forced from place to place, hunted now no longer by his dark elf compatriots but instead by well-intentioned rangers and vengeful hunters. The novel proceeds to follow Drizzt's attempts to earn a reputation based on his actions rather than those of his fellow drow and his training and transformation into a ranger.The plot was, although so repeated and rehashed since, actually somewhat original when it was originally published in 1991. At the time Salvatore was writing the idea of the outcast good man from an evil race was a little novel and the writer ran with it for what it was worth. That said, the first two novels of the trilogy are dragged down by the fact they have little story and are more or less recollections of Drizzt's early life with little organization into a recognizable plot structure with a beginning, middle, and end. Exile improved on that somewhat and Sojourn more so, making it the best plotted of the three.Considering that I was terribly unimpressed with the cast of Homeland, many of whom were cheesily evil, and the characters of Exile were more or less only there to fill out the book Sojourn managed to present characters who were both interesting and important to the story. Drizzt is, of course, the main player here - the center of the story - but other characters are also important. The character of Roddy McGristle, for instant, is not replaceable by just anybody and his quest for vengeance is rather Ahabish, though in this case the twist is that he is hunting someone who is innocent of wrongdoing and who happens to be a sapient being.It would be terribly tempting for a writer to turn a character like Drizzt, who has a tragic past, is almost ridiculously good-hearted in spite of his upbringing, and is an expert swordsman into a complete Mary Sue / Gary Stu. Somehow, however, Salvatore manages to make him only into a character who skitters around the border of a balanced character and a Stu, never quite falling into either. While Drizzt is still clearly among the most skilled of the characters in the story he's not perfect and, in fact, his almost childish navet&eacute; and desire to do good often get him in more trouble than he can comfortably handle and actually lead to consequences that hurt him both physically and emotionally. In the case of a true, downright Stu, this wouldn't happen. The Stu always comes out on top, no matter how stupid they act. This is not the case with Drizzt.And while the concept of \\"the hunter,\\" the alter-ego that plagues Drizzt, was even in 1991 a bit cliche it adds a nice edge to Drizzt whose temper, as much as his goody-tissueness, gets him in trouble. In many cases it's only because other characters are smart enough to realize Drizzt isn't as evil as his brethren that he manages to get away, rather than because of anything he does.There's another character introduced later on, a Montolio DeBrouchee, who becomes and important figure in Drizzt's life. Unfortunately, Montolio, unlike Drizzt, actually does ring of Stuish quality. Somehow, for instance, we are to believe that Montolio, in spite of the fact that he's blind and doesn't even have a cliche \\"second sight\\" of arcane or otherwise supernatural form, is an archer of Robin Hoodish proportions and who has survived in the wilderness for years on his own, aided only by whatever animals he happens to pick up. The fact that he's blind and people underestimate him becomes very important to the story but unfortunately, it rings completely false and he's never believable as a character though his philosophical ideas to become mildly interesting as the story proceeds.However, it is the prose, in fact, that is Salvatore's strongest point. While the plot is a bit predictable and some of the characters uninteresting Salvatore manages to grab the reader's attention as he reads, particularly during action scenes which I find consistently to be some of the hardest to write or read in a written form. It is a true gift to be able to project an image of combat through only words in such a manner that it is an engaging an interesting as a series of panels in a comic book or a action scene from a movie. Salvatore actually does this. In fact - he does it quite well.In non-combat sequences the prose is a little less interesting but still manages to hold the reader's attention. Unfortunately Salvatore tends to reuse adjectives throughout his stories so that scenes, even if they're in different places, end up sounding and looking the same. But altogether Salvatore remains descriptive, and in a manner that is not at all dull or overwinded.Overall, Sojourn isn't exactly a fantasy classic, but reading it it's easy to see why Drizzt became a household name among fantasy fans."},{"Title":"Sojourn: The Dark Elf Trilogy, Part 3 (Forgotten Realms: The Legend of Drizzt, Book III)","review":"When I first read Homeland, I immediately fell in love with the dark elf character Drizzt. In some ways he is like me, so I felt really connected to him. Homeland and Exile are my two favorite books in the series so far, because Drizzt is in the Underdark and I love this creative world R. A. Salvatore created. These books have a lot of excitement and action, magic and swordfight, the perfect recipe for a fantasy trilogy. This is a must read for anyone who is a fan of this genre!!!"},{"Title":"Sojourn: The Dark Elf Trilogy, Part 3 (Forgotten Realms: The Legend of Drizzt, Book III)","review":"SOJOURN was an excellent conclusion to the Dark Elf Trilogy, which tells the story of Drizzt's childhood and how he came to leave the Underdark. His challenging early years on the surface are fleshed out in SOJOURN which explores Drizzt's character from a decidedly different perspective. While the first two books, HOMELAND and EXILE are non-stop, action packed swordplay, SOJOURN slows down to let Drizzt come to terms to what he's lost and discover what new strengths he may gain. Some readers may grow impatient with the break in the action (there's very little swordplay and suspense in this novel), but its a well-written and worthy conclusion to an excellent trilogy!"},{"Title":"Sojourn: The Dark Elf Trilogy, Part 3 (Forgotten Realms: The Legend of Drizzt, Book III)","review":"Hard to say much without ruining the story but this is one good book. Basically Drizzt is on the run always looking for a place of peace to call home. In this book he ventures out onto the surface world and learns a lot about life on the \\"outside\\". But he still has to deal with the prejudice that has haunted him through the first two books. Can't say for sure whether this book or number two is my favorite but Drizzt continues to grow and grow on you. The guy is a classic!"},{"Title":"Sojourn: The Dark Elf Trilogy, Part 3 (Forgotten Realms: The Legend of Drizzt, Book III)","review":"Sojourn is a dramatic sequel of Exile that follows our hero Drizzt as he finally makes a courageous decision to abandon his home and find a new life above the surface. The most challenging and even depressing factor in the beginning was Drizzt's ability to adapt his new home. The transition from staying underground to the surface was memorable and inspirational due to the risk of losing everything in a world so unfamiliar. Reading this novel taught me that no matter what turn one makes in life, sorrow is inevitable but how one copes with it is the key factor.Drizzt also finds racism and becomes a black sheep out of the flock, even though that black sheep had performed several heroic deeds. This scenario here really much resembles the real world where most people are judged by their reputation, not character or deeds. Eventually, Drizzt stoically accepts that doing good for the community was more important than making people love him. People will learn to follow many new ideals once they read Sojourn. One of them is giving mercy even to the enemies he hated most, which some people might not do so.Apart from that, Drizzt was not the only solid character in the novel. Montolio De'Brouchee (Mooshie) was a highly charismatic individual. Mooshie was dynamic and philosophical in a way that I was extremely saddened at what happened to him. Salvatore again continues to impress readers with a solid plot and character development by introducing another mentor to Drizzt Do'Urden. Definitely a must read as well!"},{"Title":"Sojourn: The Dark Elf Trilogy, Part 3 (Forgotten Realms: The Legend of Drizzt, Book III)","review":"okay, third book. Develops the plot and characters very nicely and still adds more innovative ideas on the way. It is hard to fault the style of writing of Salvatore - it drags you into the story, makes you feel for the characters (good or bad), and leaves you wanting more. Not a predictable series, not a put-downable series. Worth the money and time investment over three books. Certainly look out for any more Salvatore work. Normally I try not to rate in the Fives, but this is worthwhile. Not only for people who play role-playing games, these are not books that cannot be read by outsiders to gaming fantasy. These stand up well against such classics as Wizard of Earthsea and Lord of the Rings - but don't expect the same style of writing. Easier to get into and through."},{"Title":"Sojourn: The Dark Elf Trilogy, Part 3 (Forgotten Realms: The Legend of Drizzt, Book III)","review":"What would you do if you lived underground for centuries and then decided to show your face to the sun's warming rays? How would you feel? What if the sun blasted away all your material objects and stung your eyes? If you ever wondered this or now do, then Sorjoun is the book for you. Sojourn is the third book in R. A. Salvatore's Dark Elf Trilogy. This book and the whole trilogy has an excellent story-line, and the characters are ingenious. Not only is the story is great, but R.A. Salvatore also presents a very real situation, a society totally evil. The story-line is great. It is straightforward, easy to understand, full of great twists and a lot of fun to read. Throughout the entire book, the author never allows confusion. I understood everything. R.A. Salvatore explains every event in great detail shortly after that specific event happens. This allows the book to be both easy to understand and easy to read. One of the most interesting twists was when , Bruenor ( a grisly dwarf) met up with McGristle ( a gruff mountain man). McGristle was trying to explain to the dwarf that Drizzt (the mysterious Dark Elf from below) was evil. However, the dwarf knew otherwise and chopped one of McGristle's dog's legs off. And ate it. Obviously, this book is a lot of fun, and I really enjoyed reading this book. I don't know why Salvatore's Drizzt is so much fun to read about, but I had the most fun reading this book than any other I have read. Because he is such an outcast, and he displays feelings and emotions common to many humans today, people feel a natural affinity to him. For example, Drizzt is very lonely. He fled his evil kin and their narcissistic, malevolent, destructive society. As a result, he feels alone in the world because people ignore him and shun him because of his ascribed reputation. Of all the characters in the story, I think that, besides Drizzt, Montolio is my favorite. Montolio depicts the sagacious mentor. He is a blind ranger (man of the woods) who has an owl friend and shoots a bow more accurately than Robin Hood. If this person were real, I know I would look up to him as my hero. He is calm, collected, wise, and strong. Not only is he strong physically, but he has strength of character as well. He portrays the mysterious, knows-more-than-he-should type. He slowly and carefully teaches Drizzt in the way of the ranger and gives Drizzt new hope. He also helps Drizzt to define his thinking and gives him reassurance that Drizzt is not alone. This illustrates his wisdom, and his other strong characteristics. Overall, Montolio is just what the doctor prescribed for Drizzt. The world in which Drizzt lives in is very complex and intriguing. Like all other civilizations, this society has laws. However, by law, the laws can be broken, if the criminal is not caught. In fact, doing so brings the scofflaw in favor with Lloth the Spider Queen, Goddess of the Drow people. To get ahead in the Drow society, all the dark elves have to do is eliminate the person above them and take his or her rank. Also, in this society houses constitute the nobles. These houses wage war on each other for a higher rank in society and ultimately to have a seat on the ruling council. However, if a house fails at eliminating another...well, lets just say, read the book. Probably the most intriguing aspect of their society is that women dominate men. This is mainly because their goddess is female. Also, many other aspects of society help contribute to its evil label, such as greed, murder, narcissism, arrogance, ethnocentrism, hatred, war, and pretty much anything that in some way is corruptive, chaotic, or evil. Most Drow are brainwashed to conform to their society at a very young age. Very few are like Drizzt. Overall, Sojourn is a great book to read for any action readers, sociologists, fantasy novelists, or anyone else who wants a good book to read. At first, Sojourn may seem like the typical hero-saves-the-world type book, but after reading Sojourn compassion and love for Drizzt will fill your heart. I guarantee all will fall in love with Drizzt and have a better appreciation for the society they live in. This book is a great piece of literature. Hats off to R. A. Salvatore."},{"Title":"Sojourn: The Dark Elf Trilogy, Part 3 (Forgotten Realms: The Legend of Drizzt, Book III)","review":"I pledge not to spoil anything, as you are likely trying to decide whether to read the book. More Amazon.com reviewers need to learn the difference between a review and a summary (spoiler). Frustrating.If the first two books were sufferable, then this book truly is the fantastic and satisfying payoff. The first two books left me less than satisfied, unhappy with the constant stream of misfortune plaguing our good-hearted protagonist. Here, however, we finally find ourselves with a conclusion well deserved by Drizzt and all of his good actions.The writing style is still excellent, if not better than it was in the first two. There is a very genuine appeal to the genre in the beautiful descriptions of fantasy landscapes, page-clenching fight scenes, and intriguing abstract characters.Finally, in this book, the trilogy comes closer to the fun and excitement of a Tolkien book, while maintaining a middle ground of the fantasy D&D; style action of an original DragonLance novel.The book is divided into 5 books within, and there is a definite \\"introduction - rising action - climax - resolution\\" plot all within the first 4 books that leaves you ready to put the book down and be contented. Yet, the 5th book, which feels more like an addon-story, fits very nicely and gives you an even greater conclusion on the life thus far of Drizzt Do'urden.I give it 4/5 stars, deducting one only because there is a certain level of thrill reserved for true 5 star books that Sojourn just doesn't quite achieve; it's worth every minute of reading nevertheless."},{"Title":"Sojourn: The Dark Elf Trilogy, Part 3 (Forgotten Realms: The Legend of Drizzt, Book III)","review":"The graphic novel adaptation of R.A. Salvatore's monumental Dark Elf Trilogy comes to an exciting conclusion in Sojourn from Devil's Due Publishing. Drizzt Do'Urden has fled from his home deep under the surface with his faithful companion Guenhwyvar, the magical black panther, always on the run from his Drow who wish to kill him. Despite the sun weakening him, Drizzt cannot help but stare at each new dawn in his strange new world. He comes upon a village of peaceful farmers, observing them from afar, and even killing the Gnolls who want his aid in attacking the small settlement.But when a family of farmers is murdered, Drizzt is blamed sending a vengeful hunter named McGristle on his trail. Drizzt slays the real killers, two Barghests from the lower planes but finds himself on the run from McGristle, and a party of adventurers led by the Ranger Dove Falconhand. When Drizzt aids them in battle against a group of stone giants, Dover realizes that Drizzt is a friend and ends the search for him. McGristle, though, is driven by hatred and presses on, trailing Drizzt all across the Forgotten Realms. Will Drizzt ever find acceptance in a world that is conditioned to believe that all Drow are evil?Devil's Due sparkles with the final part of Salvatore's trilogy. One of the main themes of his story was that pall of isolationism. Drizzt is not only an outcast among his own kind, but he's an outcast among all kind. He's constantly harassed and driven away by those who fear him for no good reason often times other than the (much deserved) evil reputation of the Drow. Andrew Dabb's script does a great job of keeping this a focal point of the tale.The pencils of Tim Seeley, a great team of inkers, and colors by Blond are once again a strong point to the book. Outside of the confines of the Underdark the artists are given a little more freedom to open up their expanse and create a more vivid and rich setting for Drizzt. Fans will be happy to know that Drizzt's adventures will continue in The Crystal Shard and Devil's Due will be presenting more of Salvatore's work with their adaptation of his DemonWars series.

What makes this book so great is the fact he knows nothing about the surface and its surroundings, seeing him as he develops and learns the processes of weather conditions or how he learns to build a fire to survive those harsh conditions is intriguing.

It was so good, in fact, that I read the entire trilogy in two days!

This final installment brings us, more or less, to where the Icewind Dale trilogy picks up, and helps us to more clearly understand the trials that Drizzt has gone through, which have helped shape his character.Drizzt has emerged from the Underdark, at last free from the evil machinations of his mother, Matron Malice, the dark elven society and their twisted deity Lloth. He is, but for Guenhwyvar (a magical cat), alone. However, lonliness drives him to seek contact, yet being unfamiliar with surface races, is unsure as to who is good, and who is evil.He defeats some gnolls who are intent on attacking a small farm, yet this attracts the attention of their leader, a barghest whelp (a magical creature from another plane of existence). While Drizzt is not around, the barghest whelp murders the inhabitants of the farm, leaving behind clues pointing to Drizzt, framing him for their murders. Even though he kills the monsters responsible in revenge for the family's death, Drizzt is unjustly chased. While most of the trackers stop, concluding that Drizzt is innocent, a mean bounty hunter continues on, seeking vengeance on Drizzt for the death of one of his dogs, and the scars he sustained in a fight with Drizzt (even though the bounty hunter was responsible for it himself).After surviving his first winter, Drizzt is befriended by a ranger, who teaches Drizzt the ways of animals, introduces him to Mielikki (the deity of rangers) and teaches him skills to actually live, rather than just survive. The bounty hunter has not given up, though, and convinces a local orc king to attack Drizzt and his ranger friend. Unsurprised, the two friends, with the aid of Guenhwyvar and the ranger's woodland friends, repel the attack.After the ranger passes, Drizzt sets out once more, yet this time with hope in his heart that he may truly find a home...yet the bounty hunter is not so easily deterred, and the heritage of his dark elven race proves a difficult barrier to overcome when confronted by fear, prejudice and loathing.Salvatore does well in helping us understand the psyche of Drizzt, a character beloved by many fans, the battle he must face against prejudice, and the motivation for clinging so tightly to his ideals and beliefs in spite of it all.My only criticism is that he spends time training Drizzt in the woodland arts and empathizing with creatures, yet Drizzt never really uses those skills thereafter.Still, it's a difficult book to put down, and a worthy conclusion to the trilogy.I highly recommend this book (although I would recommend reading \\"Homeland\\" and \\"Exile\\", the first two books in the trilogy, beforehand)."},{"Title":"Sojourn: The Dark Elf Trilogy, Part 3 (Forgotten Realms: The Legend of Drizzt, Book III)","review":"This book is part of the Legend of Drizzt series, a great series.

This book introduces us to some great new characters, I particularly enjoyed Fret and Montolio DeBrooche, and tells us how he ended up in Icewind Dale. This book is a great note to go out on and leaves you wanting more."},{"Title":"Sojourn: The Dark Elf Trilogy, Part 3 (Forgotten Realms: The Legend of Drizzt, Book III)","review":"This is the last book in the Dark Elf Trilogy that tells the tale of how Drizzt fares in the surface world. I think its a great follow up to Exile, and really puts into perspective the challenges a dark elf faces in the eyes of surface dwellers that do not want to accept him. Once again, Salvatore creates memorable characters that heavily influence Drizzt's life. He learns and gains much wisdom in this book and I think its a necessary bridge to Icewind Dale.Although I admit I missed the underdark, Sojourn is still a very enjoyable read. Salvatore presents the material in a very believable manner and we really get to see inside the struggling character Drizzt Do'Urden. By the end of this book, he finally comes into his own and moves onto bigger and better things in the Icewind Dale Trilogy. Welcome home :-)"},{"Title":"Sojourn: The Dark Elf Trilogy, Part 3 (Forgotten Realms: The Legend of Drizzt, Book III)","review":"I had never heard of R.A Salvatore before i picked up \\"Homeland\\", instantly within a few pages of reading i was hooked on what was the best Trilogy of books i have read since \\"The Lord fo the Rings\\", in my own opinion. He managed to captivate my mind by exploring a world of complete darkness, but with such intricate detail i sometimes forgot that i had been reading for a few hours. Its a great story about finding your own path in life no matter who stands in your way. A story about love, even if its completely useless where you come from. Drizzt Do'Urden is character that will forever live within, and prove what a true author can do."},{"Title":"Sojourn: The Dark Elf Trilogy, Part 3 (Forgotten Realms: The Legend of Drizzt, Book III)","review":"Salvatore dosent stop at anything to give us another great novel. His descriptive scenes and moving images had instilled many thoughts of the land of faerun and other worlds... Buy it... its really awsome."},{"Title":"Sojourn: The Dark Elf Trilogy, Part 3 (Forgotten Realms: The Legend of Drizzt, Book III)","review":"Drizzt has now made one of the most critical decisions of his life, to leave his entire world behind and seek out a new life upon the surface. Here he must deal with the fear, hatred, and prejudice invoked by his heritage, as well as continue to face his own personal demons. Violence and killing especially haunt him, and he must come to terms with their necessity in his life. Underneath the sun he must learn to accept himself before he can possibly be accepted by others, and through his learning and struggles he makes new friends, heals old wounds, and undertakes the training to become a Ranger.Salvatore does a great job showing the hardships Drizzt faces in leaving the Underdark behind. The narrative is fast moving, and does a nice job tying in Drizzt's history with his eventual settlement in the remote region of Icewind Dale, the setting of the next phase of his life. Salvatore has made Drizzt a very complete and complex character, beloved by his fans, and a true fantasy hero."},{"Title":"Sojourn: The Dark Elf Trilogy, Part 3 (Forgotten Realms: The Legend of Drizzt, Book III)","review":"This is part three of the Dark Elf Trillogy and by far the best book of the three part series.In &quot;Sojourn&quot; Drizzt finally steps foot on the surface world to live. The story tells of Drizzt meeting a blind Ranger that changes his life and turns the unlikely Dark Elf into a Ranger himself.Also, this is the book where we meet the beloved Brunor Battlehammer and his orphan daughter of 7 years old (and the girl to this day we wonder if Drizzt loves) CattiBre.This is the best book in the Trillogy. Wonderful."},{"Title":"Sojourn: The Dark Elf Trilogy, Part 3 (Forgotten Realms: The Legend of Drizzt, Book III)","review":"The third book of the Dark Elf Trilogy keeps every ounce of the quality of the previous two in the series. The book begins almost exactly where \\"Exile\\" left off, with Drizzit just discovering the many wonders of the surface world. As the book begins, Drizzit decides he should find a place to call home in the strange new world, armed only with the knowledge that his race is hated by almost all the other races of the surface world. As Drizzit goes from settlement to settlement (mostly human), he is constantly turned away simply because of the color of his skin and the the infamous reputation of the entire drow race. However, during his search he manages to find a handfull of people that are willing to look beyond his heritage and see him for the honorable person he truly is. One of these, an old blind ranger, takes him under his wing and teaches him all about the world, the races that inhabit it, and all the skills of a ranger. Overall, this book is a very powerful story that deals with many themes such as friendship, hatred, and racism flawlessly. Anyone that wants a fantasy novel that deals with more than the usual hack 'n slash mindset should read this (as well as the other two in the series)."},{"Title":"Sojourn: The Dark Elf Trilogy, Part 3 (Forgotten Realms: The Legend of Drizzt, Book III)","review":"I came across my first &quot;Salvatore&quot; novel, actually, by mistake when I was sixteen years old. It was Streams of Silver. I didn't know that it was the 2nd book in a trilogy until half-way through the book. I decided I wouldn't read it until I had read the first of the trilogy, which was The Crystal Shard. After that, I discovered there were 3 books that preceeded the IceWind Dale Trilogy. Reading those I became familiar with the character Drizzt Do'Urden, who quickly became my hero! His style of writing pulls you into the book as if you have become a part of the story, while looking on and observing. Salvatore gave me words that became mental images and played like a movie in my mind. His words scroll by and allow you to be in-sync with the characters. I wrote Mr. Salvatore to thank him for sharing his imagination with his readers, and was amazed to receive a letter from him telling me about his next book, which was Starless Night. I think he is a genius and as long as he keeps writing, no matter what subject, I'll keep reading them!"},{"Title":"Sojourn: The Dark Elf Trilogy, Part 3 (Forgotten Realms: The Legend of Drizzt, Book III)","review":"I read this book first, so I didn't have a lot of background, but I figured out the plot from the book pretty much- and without having to wade through laborious retellings the author put in to make sure a reader could pick up from anywhere in the story. A good thing! Also, even though the storyline is quite impractical- yes, almost never does such a radically moral hero show up when raised in such an evil environment- hey, guys, lighten up a little. It's a FANTASY novel. Also, I said, 'almost never,' which is is to say that there's a very slight chance. Besides, it makes for a great story, as the reader follows Drizzt through his search for acceptance from the rather prejudiced surface world. I thought it nice that the author realized the kind of difficulties Drizzt would face in such a different world, from the changing seasons to firemaking. That kind of attention to detail is what makes a good book even better. This is really a great book, and Drizzt makes himself a real hero by the hope he never lets die that somewhere someone will realize that he's different from his evil kin. I found myself wishing him the best of luck."},{"Title":"Sojourn: The Dark Elf Trilogy, Part 3 (Forgotten Realms: The Legend of Drizzt, Book III)","review":"This book was awesome. Exciting and emotionally moving the entire way through. While some of the other Salvatore books are pretty basic hack and slash fantasy, this book provides much more than that.The story is of Drizzt's first experiences on the surface world away from the Underdark in which he lived the first 40-something years of his life. He encounters many difficulties and pains, but also learns to appreciate the beauty and the wonder of the world around him. Drizzt is confronted mainly by misunderstanding and distrust of those he meets, but does find some friends, including an old blind ranger that shows in the truth of his destiny: to be a Ranger. My favorite character of the book has to be Roddy McGristle with the mean yellow dogs, an obsesive bounty hunter that is determined to get Drizzt if it costs him everything.I highly reccomend this book to anybody."},{"Title":"Sojourn: The Dark Elf Trilogy, Part 3 (Forgotten Realms: The Legend of Drizzt, Book III)","review":"I honestly thought the third book would be all about Drizzt' struggle through Menzoberranzan to the surface, however this book starts on the surface. I miss one guy from Exile. Ok so the book is kind of weak by the end. The beggining is good, then once we meet Mooshie it is alright. The big battle is fine, not too great for my tastes, but it has some fighting. Drizzt doesn't do that much sword to sword fighting. Homeland had alot of it, Exile didn't have alot, now this book seems to have basically none. I mean, Homeland had the most detailed fights, and Exile had some but they weren't intricately detailed like Homeland. This book seems to have some sword to sword fights, but it is more, &quot;Drizzt and the giant fought many minutes, the drow's swords parralleling numerous blows while Drizzt searched for an opening.&quot; The only thing I really saw described vividly were Mooshie's arrows. Them, and mabye the first Roddy McGristle encounter.The story lacks any purpose, there are a few small plots, but nothing is really suppose to happen. The first book was Drizzt growing up, the second, finding a place in the underworld, and survivng. This book is about Drizzt coming into contact with a new race, but basically that lasts about the first 50 pages, then the plot is about Drizzt learning to be a ranger, then a dragon, then a town, then a home, then it is over?I started reading the crystal shard, but I am not as intrested in it as I was in Homeland, hopefully though once I get past the first 100 pages i'll be more intrested."},{"Title":"Sojourn: The Dark Elf Trilogy, Part 3 (Forgotten Realms: The Legend of Drizzt, Book III)","review":"This book sometimes feels like it is just bridging Homeland and Exile to Crystal Shard, which Salvatore had written before these prequels.

The action sequences are fantastic."},{"Title":"Sojourn: The Dark Elf Trilogy, Part 3 (Forgotten Realms: The Legend of Drizzt, Book III)","review":"This is a great read for anyone--like me- who are curious about the background of how this person, this Drow, came into being and upon the surface for the world."},{"Title":"Sojourn: The Dark Elf Trilogy, Part 3 (Forgotten Realms: The Legend of Drizzt, Book III)","review":"What an awesome ending to this book. I am glad once again that I read the Icewind Dale Trilogy first because of words of wisdom given by Drizzt at the beginning of each part and especially the epilogue of this novel.

Salvatore's books for quite some time, and there isn't one that I haven't liked. The Dark Elf Trilogy being the same. An excellent trilogy based on the trials and tribulations of Drizzt Do'Urden's life. His growing up in Menzoberranzan, his friends, etc. A must have for anyone who enjoys R.A. Salvatore's work or the Forgotten Realms fantasy books."},{"Title":"Sojourn: The Dark Elf Trilogy, Part 3 (Forgotten Realms: The Legend of Drizzt, Book III)","review":"R.A. Salvatore's Dark Elf Trilogy is a fairly entertaining piece of work. Albiet, the tale of a man torn by conscience and a sense of morality in the midst of a cruel society sings a very familiar tune. Elric of Melnibone, the albino emperor from Michael Moorcock, brought the same theme with him for example. In fact, Melnibonean society and the Underdark are very similar environments.To Salvatore's credit however, he did craft well made fighting scences and a very loveable character in Drizzt. Indeed, most of Salvatore's readers feel a sense of empathy with the drow, and that speaks well for the progress of the fantasy genre.Whereas Elric is a brooding and dark character, Dizzt feeds off an inner sense of optimism. This perhaps, is what distinguishes the two. Drizzt is AWARE of his mission for &quot;good,&quot; however relative that term may be. While Elric constantly reminds himself of his place as both pawn and protagonist in some cosmic game of chess.All in all, the Dark Elf Trilogy will please most readers of fantasy. If you can overlook minor mishaps, like lousey names and relatively stale minor characters,the world of a young Drizzt Do'Urden offers little in terms of disappointment."},{"Title":"Sojourn: The Dark Elf Trilogy, Part 3 (Forgotten Realms: The Legend of Drizzt, Book III)","review":"I've been a fan of R.A. Salvatore's work for a long time now. I started with The Crimson Shard and I can tell you that the character Drizzt has evolved considerably with each novel. I was always inspired after reading about Drizzt's adventures. To me, THAT'S what reading is all about. Kudos to R.A. Salvatore."},{"Title":"Sojourn: The Dark Elf Trilogy, Part 3 (Forgotten Realms: The Legend of Drizzt, Book III)","review":"During my course of reading Homeland, I often find myself as Drizzt playing the character. How different is this plot then and now (of course without the ugly monsters)? I was to believe when growing up is to discover your true self, not by enforcing something to you by others. Yes, we do look up to our parents, brothers or sisters, friends, and relatives for guidance. Ulitmately in the end it's up to you and you alone. So, enjoy the book, because I can honestly say &quot;I did!&quot;"},{"Title":"Sojourn: The Dark Elf Trilogy, Part 3 (Forgotten Realms: The Legend of Drizzt, Book III)","review":"I realy liked this book and couldn't put it down.

My curiosity was piqued by some comments I read in a BG news group and so I bought &quot;Homeland&quot; to learn more. The way Drizzt is repelled by the wickedness of his kin and maintains his principles even after all that he has witnessed and been forced to do, demonstrates the qualities of a true hero. Bravo, Salvatore, bravo!!! I have not been touched by a character like this in a long time.

They have adventure, suspence, emotions, and a lot more! Drizzt's adventures are wonderful and I loved The Dark Elf Trilogy as well as The Icewind Dale Trilogy. I also read The Legacy, Starless Night, and Seige of Darkness. R.A.Salvatore is wonderfully brilliant when he writes these books and I wish I could just read and read and read! I may be only 11 years old right now but I really like these books. All of these books plus Daughter of the Drow and Tangled Webs by Elaine Cunningham I read in only about a week.

I really do!"},{"Title":"Sojourn: The Dark Elf Trilogy, Part 3 (Forgotten Realms: The Legend of Drizzt, Book III)","review":"A friend recommended this series and once I started reading I was totally unable to put it down. This is the most engrossing fantasy series out there. Drizzt is a character most people can highly identify with; someone completely surrounded by evil yet still trying to overcome his heritage. If you haven't read this series start with Homeland and you'll be hooked. I have 9 Drizzt novels and for sure I'll get the rest. I also recommend the game Baldur's Gate for any fan of Salvatore's, Drizzt is a character in the game."},{"Title":"Sojourn: The Dark Elf Trilogy, Part 3 (Forgotten Realms: The Legend of Drizzt, Book III)","review":"On the action scale, with Janny Wurts's &quot;Curse of the Mistwraith&quot; and Isaac Asmimov's &quot;Foundation&quot; series at the far end of &quot;Introspection&quot;, Salvatore pegs the needle on &quot;All Action, All the Time.&quot;For my tastes, action is usually better.Drizzt rubs elbows with all manner of evil creatures, in a dangerous underground world. Fantastic."},{"Title":"Sojourn: The Dark Elf Trilogy, Part 3 (Forgotten Realms: The Legend of Drizzt, Book III)","review":"Reading this trilogy was the best thing I've done in a long time. The action is amazing and it keeps you holding your breath for the most of the pages. It is the way I knew Drizzt and now I have to know everything about him and his adventures.

I strongly recommend it!"},{"Title":"Sojourn: The Dark Elf Trilogy, Part 3 (Forgotten Realms: The Legend of Drizzt, Book III)","review":"If you like fantasy fiction, you will not be upset.

Now, I am a true believer. I finished this book in the course of one night, I couldn't put it down. I found myself drawn to read more and more. The way he writes in &quot;racial&quot; tension, prejudice, and overcoming these obsticals is just brilliant, and could give a lesson to people today.

As is the dark elf series itself. In Sojourn Drizzt is beginning to learn of Toril's harsh surface, so very different from the world from which he has come. There are many obstacles that Drizzt must overcome in this book, one of them including the sun itself.

Now, I've read all of Salvatore's books about Drizzt! Like I said, I'm hooked"},{"Title":"Sojourn: The Dark Elf Trilogy, Part 3 (Forgotten Realms: The Legend of Drizzt, Book III)","review":"As a trilogy, it was fun, light and fast reading. Salvatore's best side, perhaps because of his expirience in script writing, are the battle descriptions. They are indeed very much alive and very detailed. However, this series is nothing more than a nice action film. The characters are shallow, the plot is naive and unoriginal, the attempts to give some meaning or philosophical thought, or to make the reader somehow identify with the characters are weak and get lost because of the shallowness of the plot and characters. The literary tricks and metaphors are odd and clear. Overall, Salvatore cannot make his book be more than a DnD based book. His writing is not good enough to make the books have a literary value of their own.However, Salvatore did create one of the coolest characters in Fantasy history, one that will be written in the annales of Fantasy next to Gandalf, Bilbo and Frodo and Raistlin Majere. Even though Drizzt is not the deepest character around, it doesn't matter. Like any good action hero, his life are merely a background, just because you can't have a character that comes out of nowhere. What's important about him is what he can do with his hands. For that, and only for that, Drizzt is worth your money and time."},{"Title":"Sojourn: The Dark Elf Trilogy, Part 3 (Forgotten Realms: The Legend of Drizzt, Book III)","review":"Drizzt had finally made the decesion to leave the Underdark altogether.

His only companion, a mystical panther Guenhwyvar, by his side assured him that he wasn't truely alone. All the characters Drizzt meet are confusing to him especially humans...soon enough he begins to learn what true friendship is all about."},{"Title":"Sojourn: The Dark Elf Trilogy, Part 3 (Forgotten Realms: The Legend of Drizzt, Book III)","review":"This novel concludes the Dark Elf trilogy. The series was quite good, not amazing but not terrible either. The most interesting part of the series was the first book (Homeland) where Salvatore laid out the entire world that Drizzt lived in.The second book shows how Drizzit rejected his society and struck out on his own. However, his race is so widely hated that finding acceptance was quite difficult. Indeed, this theme continues to be of importance in this novel and in &quot;The Crystal Shard&quot; (book 1 of the Icewind Dale Trilogy).The reason I liked this novel was for the final change in scenery; Drizzit finally emerges from the Underdark to see the daylight. He finally finds some measure of acceptance in this world; but it is hard won and not without misunderstandings. Indeed, this novel brings back the inner turmoil that is a feature of many of Salvatore's protagonists. Dealing with violence continues to be a problem for Drizzit. When should he use his swords? Why does he still feel guilty if he kills someone in the name of self-defence?As I mentioned in my review of \\"Exile,\\" there are typical fantasy elements in this novel in addition to Drizzit's problems and struggles. There are battles, fantastic monsters and other such staples of the fantasy genre. While reading these novels is enjoyable, I've been looking for something that it is in the same epic vein as, \\"The Lord of the Rings.\\" I remain open to recommendations.The series was reasonably interesting. This is my eighth Salvatore novel that I've read in recent months. I've started the Icewind Dale Trilogy, but I don't know how much of it I will read. I may switch to reading a different genre for a while for variety."},{"Title":"Sojourn: The Dark Elf Trilogy, Part 3 (Forgotten Realms: The Legend of Drizzt, Book III)","review":"Drizzt is such an awesoe character.

Great fight scenes, friendships, murder, false accusations, and of course, an AWESOME CAT! Yeah! Go Guenhwyvar! This book only furthered my interest in Drizzt Do'Urden! Also, Homeland was a thrilling book! It was awesome to see how Drizzt grew up and overcame all of the evil drow things that happened in his life!"},{"Title":"Sojourn: The Dark Elf Trilogy, Part 3 (Forgotten Realms: The Legend of Drizzt, Book III)","review":"Well, I enjoyed the fast paced action of the first two books and the wonderful, dark world of &quot;the Underdark&quot; and Menzobarrenzen. Unfortunately, I do not think Salvatore did as good a job with the surface world. It seemed that Drizz't is now such a fantastic warrior that none of his opponents in the story caused him to break much of a sweat, as opposed to Zaknefein in &quot;Exile&quot; and &quot;Homeland&quot;. On the plus side, I think the blind ranger Mooshie was a terrific character and I enjoyed Drizz't's trial and error method of learning about the surface world.

I am pleased to say that while Salvatore wasn't able to immerse me in his world of fantasy as completely as he did in Homeland, he was able to get the bad taste of Exile out of my mouth with this final installment in his wildly popular trilogy detailing the early, formative years of the Forgotten Realms' most famous drow elf, Drizzt. By removing Drizzt from the Underdark, and his close proximity to the fascinating drow city Menzoberranzan, and depositing him on the surface world, Salvatore was able to abate (somewhat) my yearning for the focus of the storyline to return to the city of the drow (with which I am admittedly enamoured). Drizzt continues his do-gooder ways on the surface as he once again tries to find a niche. The misunderstood drow is faced with adversity and rejection at every turn as he tries to prove that he is not like his devious and murderous kin. Drizzt's resolve and faith are sorely tested as false accusations are leveled against him and he is relentlessly pursued by a brutal, revenge-driven human bounty hunter. Only by adhering to the tenents of the Ranger and keeping faith in the goddess Mielikki will Drizzt be able to survive and prove his worth on the surface."},{"Title":"Sojourn: The Dark Elf Trilogy, Part 3 (Forgotten Realms: The Legend of Drizzt, Book III)","review":"This book was definitely better than the others even though the others were great also.

The ability of the author to cloak the innermost desires of the heart in such a way that the reader is drawn into the story so quickly and completely that only when the story is complete does he realize the social implications is what determines the quality of fiction.Salvatore openly challenges the traditional cloaking of intent and encourages the reader to be a better person by using the philosophical notes at the beginning of each chapter which reveal Drizzt's continual struggle for good over his innate evil. Ontologistic at best, paganist at least, you decide.Calvin Howell"},{"Title":"Sojourn: The Dark Elf Trilogy, Part 3 (Forgotten Realms: The Legend of Drizzt, Book III)","review":"Sojourn, continues the story of drizzt do'urden, a dark elf who chose after learning of his evil race to leave his homeworld of the underdark and write his own story. This book tells of the many adventures and battles drizzt faces while trying to survive on the surface. It is by no means less dangerous to live here as it was to survive in the dark, silent tunnels of the underdark. But drizzt soon learns that the stereotypical nature of his evil race, will haunt him wherever he wanders, and he travels many miles trying to find a place to call home. There are more wanderful creatures and characters drizzt comes across here. He has his first encounter with humans and learns of more, sinister races also. He meets montolio dabruchee, a ranger who lives in the wilds of the mountains, and this ally teaches drizzt languages, hunting, and tracking skills he will need to survive on his own. This book is a fantastic ending to the dark elf trilogy, telling of the beginnings of the long life of drizzt do'urden. Its hard for me to pick a favorite in this trilogy, but now that i'm done with it, i would say its very good as a combined story arc. I think it testifies the confusion and wander anyone would have in drizzt' position, and also the feeling of compassion and respect for this great fantasy hero. This novel will always be one of my favorites i've ever read. You'll enjoy it!!!!!"},{"Title":"Sojourn: The Dark Elf Trilogy, Part 3 (Forgotten Realms: The Legend of Drizzt, Book III)","review":"These books brought back memories; and I fondly remembered. why this is one of my favorite fictonal characters.

As you may remember from the Exile, Drizzt has left the city of his people, the evil drow and has now emerged from the Underdark into the surface world. This is perhaps the most challenging part of his journey since leaving Menzoberranzan, as all he knows about the surface are the stories he has been told by his people - stories which he has come to suspect are perhaps all lies. Either way, he must find out about his new surroundings on his own. ...\\"For full review, please visit me at Here Be Bookwyrms on Blogger!herebebookwyrms dot blogspot dot com"},{"Title":"Sojourn: The Dark Elf Trilogy, Part 3 (Forgotten Realms: The Legend of Drizzt, Book III)","review":"This was an awesome experiance to read, and it would be a solid 5 stars, save for one oversight.

If you're a big fantasy buff, and have read any other works of R.A. Salvatore, this is a must read. A lot of people really enjoyed the character Drizzt from the Icewind Dale trilogies, and this three part epic compiles everything that ever happened to him before you first met him in the earlier book. The characters beside Drizzt are amazing and dynamic, bringing their own unique touch to the story. This book is suitable for anyone over the age of ten, yet isn't a kid's novel. The world Salvatore creates in The Dark Elf Trilogies is fantastic, and quite immense also. Ranging from the delving caverns of the Underdark to the over world, the setting plays a major role in the story, just like in other fantasy books, except more so in this one. This book is loaded with detail, and the plot will be sure to keep the reader wondering what's going to happen next. Some parts may seem a bit predictable, but they aren't as important as the major events. Overall, this has got to be one of the best fantasy books I have ever read, and I personally enjoy it more than the Lord of the Rings and other epics. I definitely recommend to anyone interested in the fantasy genre to read this book, otherwise you'll be missing out on a great opportunity."},{"Title":"Sojourn: The Dark Elf Trilogy, Part 3 (Forgotten Realms: The Legend of Drizzt, Book III)","review":"I started this series a couple of years back when I picked up Homeland, book one of the series in paperback. At that point I became a Salvatore and Drizzt fan. I've read all the books up to 1000 Orcs and I can tell you this, I can't put one of his books down. They are indeed very good. Meeting the man in person was a special bonus. He is very kind and likes to put names to faces. I talked with him on and off on his message board at rasalvatore.com and when I met him and told him my handle on the board he immediately knew me. I would recommend this book and series to anyone reading fantasy or anyone wanting to start reading fantasy. You'll get hooked. I did."},{"Title":"Sojourn: The Dark Elf Trilogy, Part 3 (Forgotten Realms: The Legend of Drizzt, Book III)","review":"Definitely a great fantasy epic and one of my personal favorites, The Dark Elf Trilogy-Homeland, Exile, and Sojourn, brings to life the story of a good hearted dark elf ranger named Drizzt Do'Urden and his adventures in the Underdark Drow city of Menzoberranzan in the World of Faerun. The books are so incredibly well written that the reader feels that they have been transported to another universe and are actually present among the characters, seeing what they see, feeling what they feel, sensing what they sense. RA Salvatore has truly outdone himself and has presented us with a masterpiece of literature the likes of which we have seen only in JRR Tolkien's work and in authors Margaret Weis and Tracy Hickman's Dragonlance Chronicles and Legends trilogies. Duty, honor, bravery, magic, and swordfights are all about. A great trilogy indeed and a &quot;must read&quot; along with RA Salvatore's The Icewind Dale Trilogy!"},{"Title":"Sojourn: The Dark Elf Trilogy, Part 3 (Forgotten Realms: The Legend of Drizzt, Book III)","review":"Sometimes you wish you could just write a review about the author rather than the book. R.A. Salvatore is one of those....With the popularity of Science Fiction and Fantasy books today, the truely &quot;excellent&quot; authors often get lumped in with the just &quot;good&quot; ones. If Salvatore had written these novels 20 years ago, he would probably be viewed today as one of the masters of the genre -- with the likes of Tolkien, Zelazny, and Asimov. The books are THAT good! Salvatore knows how to bring detail and life to a story without miring it in wordiness. His writing is clean, powerful, and evocative. You find yourself quickly drawn in to the characters, rejoicing with their successes and having sorrow for their failures. You feel what they feel...Oh, and (without saying too much so as to spoil anything), kudos to an author who is not afraid to kill-off major characters in an epic-style adventure! The good guys don't always wear white, and the heroes don't always win...Read every Salvatore novel you can get your hands on; I haven't found one yet that I didn't enjoy!"},{"Title":"Sojourn: The Dark Elf Trilogy, Part 3 (Forgotten Realms: The Legend of Drizzt, Book III)","review":"R.A. Salvatore here brings his superb \\"Dark Elf Trilogy\\" to a close. This novel is without a doubt the best of the series. This novel is different from \\"Homeland\\" and \\"Exile\\" in that it takes place out of the Underdark, on the surface of the world. Because of this Salvatore's writing is explored in a new way as he describes the nature and surroundings around the main character, Drizzt Do'Urden, where in the first two books of the series Salvatore's descriptions were not as used as they were in this novel.Drizzt has reached the world beyond the Underdark, which turns out to be an interesting place for Drizzt. From the beginning of the book when Drizzt is spotted he is thought to be a villain with the intention of making the world a bad place. Drizzt is accused as the murderer of a whole family and is being chased by a ranger, Roddy McGristle. Meanwhile, the orcs are considering Drizzt a threat and are about to make war against him. While Drizzt is out in the wild of the worlds he meets Montolio (or Mooshie) who is a ranger. Montolio teaches Drizzt history and skills to survive in the world and shows Drizzt how he is really a ranger. Montolio is a great friend and advisor. Together Drizzt and Montolio battle an army of orcs. This is not the end of the story as there is much to be told by Salvatore, but I won't tell you about that; go ahead and read the book.This book is not a clone of J.R.R. Tolkien's works as it offers an original plot and great characters. This book does, however, include many of fantasy's creatures, such as orcs, goblins, dwarves, giants, and much more. You get the idea. This didn't bother me, though, as all of the creatures took on interesting characters.Not many trilogies in the fantasy genre have kept me as entertained, as moved, and full of wonder as R.A. Salvatore's \\"Dark Elf Trilogy.\\" To get the full impact of the story that is told here I advise you to go ahead and read the first two books of this trilogy before getting on to this one. This is a fantasy novel to read over and over again.Happy Reading!"},{"Title":"Sojourn: The Dark Elf Trilogy, Part 3 (Forgotten Realms: The Legend of Drizzt, Book III)","review":"The last book of the series...It was fantastic.

I think.Initially, Drizzt gets himself into some shenanigans by getting framed for slaughtering a bunch of kids. While it was quickly determined he was not the murderer, some jackass kept on trying to kill him because he lost his ear. He lost his ear when a tree fell on him. Shouldn't this guy go buck-wild on the tree instead? I think that would take less effort than tracking him for so long.Drizzt then takes out the real murders, who apparently need to eat people, I guess to gain XP in order to go back to its alternate universe. I related to this on a personal level.Between these events, some female ranger tries to track him down with an obviously metro-sexual dwarf and an elf I couldn't really care about. Their story ends when some rock-monsters started barraging them with boulders. Drizzt of course saved them, but then those characters became non-existant in the continuing plot. Where did they go? Who were they? Should I really care? Probably not.Then Drizzt meets up a crazy dude who is like Dr. Doolittle meets the Terminator. Except he's blind, which if you kinda think about it, makes him even cooler. The story turns into the Karate Kid for a while and Drizzt comes out being even more badass than in previous books.Other cool stuff happens. Conclusion: read it, dammit."},{"Title":"Sojourn: The Dark Elf Trilogy, Part 3 (Forgotten Realms: The Legend of Drizzt, Book III)","review":"read this book. Obsessed with Drizz't?

His scimitars carve out the way, along with his strong ideals.

Many people had heard about this drow, but haven't seen him until he comes down to the towns to see what the surface world is really like.I think that R.A. Salvatore is a great author who wrote an amazing story about a drow elf going on a journey in his book Sojourn. It was a great story which pulled me in with practically every paragraph. It also put a great picture in my mind as it explained what things looked like. For example: he explained what a 'hook horror' looked like, by explaining the feeling of its armor, and the weight of its body. My favorite part in his book was when Drizzt went to avenge a human family's death. He never knew this family very well, and they thought him to be a threat, but Drizzt knew not to hurt them. He tried to protect them from everything, until a demon finally came and killed them all, which made Drizzt very angry.Drizzt Do'Urden starts up in the middle of his adventure, standing on the surface of the world. He fights to protect himself, and other surface creatures such as elves, humans, and dwarfs from creatures that shouldn't be there. During his adventures he meets many friends that saved him from the surface by teaching him things he didn't know. Drizzt went through a few hardships, and he finally began to realize who he was.I think Sojourn was a great story, because it gave specific reasons to why Drizzt is such a good drow elf. It made me want to help other people and animals, and it also inspired me to go out and find some animals and make them my friends."},{"Title":"Sojourn: The Dark Elf Trilogy, Part 3 (Forgotten Realms: The Legend of Drizzt, Book III)","review":"Hurry up and get some in stock, I check often yet the message stays the same: OUT OF STOCK....What must I do to get my very own copy of my second favorite trilogy of all time in hardcover.

It moves into the conflicts Drizzt encounters with the people, the elements, and even himself. Salvator leads the reader into the very depths of Drizzt's soul, as he questions his decision to leave his homeland and how different the surface world truly is. The story follows his thoughts and has so many twists and turns to keep the reader guessing. The only dissapointment I found in the book was I wondered what was to become of the remainder Drizzt's family in Menzoberranzan. Besides that, this has been yet another excellent book from Mr. Salvator."},{"Title":"Sojourn: The Dark Elf Trilogy, Part 3 (Forgotten Realms: The Legend of Drizzt, Book III)","review":"Well, after finishing the other two books in this series (after being almost turned off to the entire forgotten realms saga by the horendous books in the Avatar trilogy) I've decided that I like R.A. Salvadore as a writer. I have, however, one major grip about all of the books in this series, I want to read more R.A. Salvadore. Things that could be elaborated, such as the blind fighter in the forests past, are left dangeling, and I understand that Drizzet has a natural skill with his blades, but did he really have to be good enough to kill everything and everyone in his path. One other thing that irked me is the lack of a reason for the villans, and especially lack of menace, in this book. Roddie McGristle was hardly the kick but final to a series challange to the opnipitant drow that the villan of Sojurn should have been. But at least he had a good reason to go after Drizzit for halfway around the world, throwing orcs and god knows what else at him, yep, drizzit....killed his dog. I have the same grip with Masoj and Anton from the first book, they really had no chance whatsoever of foiling drizzit. After characterization throghout the entire book Anton confronts Drizzit and..... blows himself up. Masoj, however important he is to forming Drizzits personality, manages to break Drizzits finger before he's skewered. The only really menacing villans are the Do'Urndrens themselves, and Drizzit never confronts them after he's run away more then once. But these are minor grips R.A., your books are the perfect pageturning serialized fantasy novel, to expect more or less would be foolish."},{"Title":"Sojourn: The Dark Elf Trilogy, Part 3 (Forgotten Realms: The Legend of Drizzt, Book III)","review":"This book was amazing...I read the first two and this one was by far the best of the series.

But don't get me wrong, it was wholly enjoyable."},{"Title":"Sojourn: The Dark Elf Trilogy, Part 3 (Forgotten Realms: The Legend of Drizzt, Book III)","review":"This book concludes the \\"Dark Elf Trilogy,\\" which tells the saga of the early years of the drow ranger Drizzt Do'Urden. The previous volumes, \\"Homeland\\" and \\"Exile,\\" took place almost entirely in the Underdark, the gigantic underground world where the evil drow make their home with multitudes of other unusual creatures. \\"Sojourn\\" brings Drizzt, forever cut off from his society because he rejected their evil values, to the surface of the Forgotten Realms. The story traces his journey that leads him the Icewind Dale, and the start of the \\"Icewind Dale Trilogy\\" (\\"The Crystal Shard,\\" \\"Streams of Silver\\" and \\"The Halfling's Gem\\"), which R. A. Salvatore wrote before this series.But because \\"Sojourn\\" is principally a linking novel that connects Drizzt's life in the underdark with his later adventures with his companions, it is the weakest of the trilogy. It is still an enjoyable read; Salvatore is a clear, vivid writer who excels in actions sequences. However, it doesn't have the imaginative spark or strong plot line of the first two books. The Underdark provided a fascinating, bizarre, and dangerous setting. Without it, Drizzt's solo adventures seem a bit more...well...ordinary. Most of the story is episodic, resolving itself every seventy-five pages or so. It follows a distinct pattern: Drizzt tries to fit in various places, finds himself in danger from misunderstandings or aggressive foes, and then must move on. There are various villains, but no central strong bad guy who carries the whole story. The closest the book comes is a grizzled vengeful bounty hunter named Roddy who has a grudge against Drizzt, but he doesn't measure up to many of Drizzt's other adversaries.The strongest sequences in the book deal with Drizzt's loneliness and his moral bind of proving to himself that he is a good guy who is not responsible for the deaths that seem to follow him. The center of the book deals with Drizzt's encounter with a kind and wise blind ranger, Montolio, who becomes Drizzt's mentor. (We finally discover how this underground dweller learned about tracking in the wilderness!) The best action scene also takes place here, with Drizzt and Montolio cleverly defending their home against a raid of orcs, giants, and evil wolves.\\"Sojourn\\" is very readable, but slips a notch below the early two books in the trilogy. Fortunately, Salvatore has other great adventures in store of Drizzt and his panther Guenwhyvar.

The role-playing section of my local bookstore wasn't one I was in the habit of visiting (even though I did play Dungeons &amp; Dragons as a teen). I always assumed that the TSR books were nothing more than pulp, not worthy of a second glance.Boy, was I wrong. Salvatore effectively uses TSR's Forgotten Realms world as a backdrop for a story that is as unique as it is readable. He creates a society whose members thrive on evil, and breathes life into his creation like a dark god. If you've ever played D&amp;D, and want to know exactly what the term &quot;Lawful Evil&quot; means, look no further for an explanation. Salvatore's antagonist characters are truly despicable, and lend a great deal to the Drow society's plausibility.Throughout the series, Salvatore brings to light many social and moral issues that easily translate to real life, while keeping the pace of the read fast with breath-taking swordplay and action scenes that will have you running around your kitchen with a broom handle (assuming you don't have a scimitar lying about...).All in all, a HIGHLY recommended read for anyone who enjoys the fantasy genre."},{"Title":"Sojourn: The Dark Elf Trilogy, Part 3 (Forgotten Realms: The Legend of Drizzt, Book III)","review":"Have just re-read The Dark Elf Trilogy for what must be the 20th time and I am, as ever, amazed by how fantasy can be used in such a spell-binding way to deliver messages relevant to todays society."},{"Title":"Sojourn: The Dark Elf Trilogy, Part 3 (Forgotten Realms: The Legend of Drizzt, Book III)","review":"R.A. Salvatore is by far the best writer of all the Forgoten Realms writers! This series is one of the best and most interesting sets I have ever read. Salvatore ties each book together from Homeland to Sojourn, tightly and neatly it is just amazing. Drizzt's trials begin as a youth and follow him through the academy, his morals and integrity severly tested the whole way in Homeland. The &quot;Hunter&quot; in Exile is one of Drizzt's best written roles he struggles to become and stay an elf while fighting the underdark's worst ememies, and what courage he showed to approach Belwars people.Exile is the best of the three books that make up this series. In Sojurn Drizzt is tested and finally accepted by diffrent people but I found it sad the way even when it was obvious that he was trying to help, people still chose to reject him. The story is a good one I think that it may have moved a little quick on his journey to Ice Wind Dale. If you get a chance read the Ice Wind Dale Trilogy first it sets a better story for Drizzt, also you won't be turned off by the dark story lines produced by the Drow, they are kind of heavy,"},{"Title":"Sojourn: The Dark Elf Trilogy, Part 3 (Forgotten Realms: The Legend of Drizzt, Book III)","review":"As I read throw the reviews of other readers I discovered a Fact About the dark elf trilogy, you can not put the book down and as You stay up all night. one has to admit the briliance of Salvatore. I think his books must be banned for they tend to keep his readers up all night. As it did me. Sincerly thought I do hope that we will read more of Drizzt's adventures And why not for he has the life span long enough to make more of those sleepless nights adventures. I hail Salvatore and wish him good fortune with his life."},{"Title":"Sojourn: The Dark Elf Trilogy, Part 3 (Forgotten Realms: The Legend of Drizzt, Book III)","review":"Magnificently written. Wonderful characters and a ruthless writing style made this book one I couldn't put down. Salvatore's style and characterization were masterful. well worth the price to ANY avid fantasy reader."},{"Title":"Sojourn: The Dark Elf Trilogy, Part 3 (Forgotten Realms: The Legend of Drizzt, Book III)","review":"The Dark Elf Trilogy is by far the best series that Forgotten Realms has ever released. R.A. Salvatore really has a way of expressing the obvious and unleashing the unknown in a manner to not be forgotten."},{"Title":"Sojourn: The Dark Elf Trilogy, Part 3 (Forgotten Realms: The Legend of Drizzt, Book III)","review":"The surface is no place for a drow, all except the the hero Drizzt. Prejudging and fear was what he got but his courage was his strengh. This book in some ways can show how real life prejudism exists and the strength of courage and others can help. Another great book. Just to warn you, if you read this, you better have The Crystal Shard because you are gonna wanna pick it up right away."},{"Title":"Sojourn: The Dark Elf Trilogy, Part 3 (Forgotten Realms: The Legend of Drizzt, Book III)","review":"Let me start at the beginning. When I first read Salvatore's HOMELAND (The first book of DET), I was captured by his lyrical style of writing. All characters seem to have a purpose and a destiny. It's an interesting concept in writing, a complete story. That's what the Dark Elf trilogy is.Homeland introduces a powerful family line, similar to that of the Godfather. In fact, throughout the whole trilogy experience I'm surprised at all of the similarites between the two. Drizzt Do'Urden is a classic hero, and a tragic one... a great twist."},{"Title":"Sojourn: The Dark Elf Trilogy, Part 3 (Forgotten Realms: The Legend of Drizzt, Book III)","review":"This series ranks up right up there with The Lord of the Rings and Dragonlance. Fantasy doesn't get much better than this.

The author, R.A. Salvatore, concocts a character so thick in emotion and heart almost all too real and imagineable. With his superb story telling abtributes and feel of plot flow and story structure, Salvatore catches both the imagination and the love of the reader with his mastery in character creation and scene basing. I can't wait to check for his future writings and publishings!"},{"Title":"Sojourn: The Dark Elf Trilogy, Part 3 (Forgotten Realms: The Legend of Drizzt, Book III)","review":"R.A.Salvatore iss the author that hooked me in the begining to fantasy.

Salvatore. His indepth descriptions of the characters and battle scenes make this book extraordinary. Only Salvatore can bring a Dark Elf from the Underdark to the surface and be accepted by anyone. Salvatore deserves great credit for the hard work he has put into this book. I have read all of his Drizzt books about 5 times each and they keep getting better every time. I own them all and would not let go of them for any price. Hopefully Passage to Dawn will not be his last writing he does on Drizzt."},{"Title":"Sojourn: The Dark Elf Trilogy, Part 3 (Forgotten Realms: The Legend of Drizzt, Book III)","review":"Classic fantasy at its best and a character you really fall in love with.

Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Sojourn: The Dark Elf Trilogy, Part 3 (Forgotten Realms: The Legend of Drizzt, Book III)","review":"This character is one of the most well rounded characters in literature. His compassion and gentleness are equaled only by his skill in the art of swordplay. Drizzt also opens our eyes to the problems in today's society such as racism and discrimination and shows us that people of any colour can be true friends. There will be no other character who will match the class of Drizzt Do'Urden. Thank you R.A.

All the wonder and excitment, all the adventure and scenery, all the characters and dialogue that makes Fantasy so enticing to readers is written at its peak. To write Fantasy means to capture that part of human nature that involves the unyielding spirit, the unquenched desire to explore, to go forth and see what lies just beyond the horizon. No book captures that more than Sojourn. No book probably ever will."},{"Title":"Sojourn: The Dark Elf Trilogy, Part 3 (Forgotten Realms: The Legend of Drizzt, Book III)","review":"It displays how a person with enough determination and perseverance can overcome prejudice, hostility, and violence without using his scimitars.

The first story is how Drizzt attempts to befriend some humans and all the things that go into fighting some new creatures, defending his good nature, and learning to survive on the surface. The second story commences when he leaves the initial place where he found sanctuary and attempts to find a place to call home. In a way, it felt a little like Tolkein's final story where the ring is destroyed, but the book continues back to the Shire for a little adventure there.I enjoyed this book and the subtle religious undertones. Drizzt comes to realize that Lolth, the Spider Queen, is not the only deity in the world, and that by following his heart he was following after a deeper calling. It was also comforting to follow Drizzt's journey as he sought out true companions that would accept him for who he was and not just make decisions based on his race."},{"Title":"Sojourn: The Dark Elf Trilogy, Part 3 (Forgotten Realms: The Legend of Drizzt, Book III)","review":"Love the Drizzt line of stories.

The first book is the best because it is unexpected however the books continuing his story provide the satisfaction of knowing there's lots more characters to meet, more suffering to endure and savor every battle that Drizzt will hopefully win. It's nice to have a long continuing storyline. Worth reading if you're looking for a fantasy to just enjoy!"},{"Title":"Sojourn: The Dark Elf Trilogy, Part 3 (Forgotten Realms: The Legend of Drizzt, Book III)","review":"Good stuff.

In the last 150 pages is where we get a feel of something important about to happen (keep in mind i havent yet read the icewind dale trilogy).I wished that the D'urdon family were in this one. But Salvatore did well with the characters he chose to use in this one."},{"Title":"Sojourn: The Dark Elf Trilogy, Part 3 (Forgotten Realms: The Legend of Drizzt, Book III)","review":"This book really puts down all the last remaining questions about Drizzt. Warning, though. There is no Regis. Roddy McDowell (I'm sorry if I got his name wrong.)was my top 3rd favorite charecter. I really liked Montolio the ranger. And, this gives a good moral:Do not think war heroes are good for battles. They have to be good for their courage, love, and understanding. People say R.A. Salvatore's books decline with each passing book. I disagree. I've read 6 of his books, and they don't disband at all. I look forward to reading The Legacy."},{"Title":"Sojourn: The Dark Elf Trilogy, Part 3 (Forgotten Realms: The Legend of Drizzt, Book III)","review":"Sorjourn was a good book about Drizzt's advenures on the surface world and how he meet Catti-brie and her dwarf father Beurrane (if I spelled it wrong I'm sorry, I don't have the book in front of me) all you people who read the book know who I'm talking about. Plus throw in the bounty hunter and you have a good book with a interesting story. The only thing I'm sorry about is that we didn't get to see Drizzt and Cattie- brie and her father(I won't try spelling his name again) meet earlyer in the book. But I enjoyed it just the same. I highly recommened this book and series."},{"Title":"Sojourn: The Dark Elf Trilogy, Part 3 (Forgotten Realms: The Legend of Drizzt, Book III)","review":"Drizzt Do'Urden must be one of the most vivid and well fleshed out characters in all of fantasy. There are many depths to the character...he's a warrior, a philosopher, and a humanitarian. It's Salvatore's characterization that makes his books so compelling. If you haven't read any of them, you're missing out."},{"Title":"Sojourn: The Dark Elf Trilogy, Part 3 (Forgotten Realms: The Legend of Drizzt, Book III)","review":"a friend lent this book to me, and i've been avidly following drizzt do'urden's escapades and adventures for the past two weeks. the story is so finely detailed, so exactly described that you can see in in your mind as clearly as though you were watching it unfold before you. the story is amazing: inspiring and thought-provoking...my outlook on the world will never be the same after reading this! i recommend this book to everyone, and can't wait to start on the Icewind Dale trilogy!"},{"Title":"Sojourn: The Dark Elf Trilogy, Part 3 (Forgotten Realms: The Legend of Drizzt, Book III)","review":"Ok, to start off, I own every forgotten realms novel by salvatore, and I have to say that he is one of the greatest writers alive. He is even a match for the God of fantasy, J.R.R. Tolkien. I always look forward to reading Salvatore's new books. Anyways, The Dark Elf Trilogy was one of the best trilogies he has written. there was an immense amount of suspense, mixed in with adventure, and the struggles of Life. I found the Books VERY inspiring. I suggest that if you haven't read all of his books, you need to."},{"Title":"Sojourn: The Dark Elf Trilogy, Part 3 (Forgotten Realms: The Legend of Drizzt, Book III)","review":"Don't stop at the trilogy!!! Salvatore his added six books since! I have been a solid follower of Drizzt through the Icewind Dale trilogy, the Dark Elf trilogy, The Legacy, Starless Night, Siege of Darkness, Passage to Dawn, and the current book I have been reading The Silent Blade. Even after I complete this book which I am half way through and can not comment on for fear of ruining the previous books for those of you who need to catch up. After the completion of this book there is The Spine of the World due out in September 1999 in hard cover. Why should you spend your time reading these books? There are so many hidden moral lessons in life amongst the pages. In the meantime you are drawn into a world that brings the illumination of battle and fantasy hurling towards the reader in a never ending story filled with intrigue and action like no other book I have ever read. I was out of the circuit for a while until a friend I recommended the trilogy to informed me of the release of The Silent Blade. Without hesitation I ran to the store and have been unable to put the book down. Beware!!! Once you begin with Homeland and move on to the Icewind Dale trilogy, before you even know what happended you'll be reading the Legacy and wonder where you were able to make all that time."},{"Title":"Sojourn: The Dark Elf Trilogy, Part 3 (Forgotten Realms: The Legend of Drizzt, Book III)","review":"This book has a fulfilling storyline including vivid discriptions of the world surrounding Drizzt Do'Urden. Mr. Salvatore has a way to make fanasy writing more than just a read: he makes it an experience. He places you in the mindset of Drizzt. You feel as if you are the one behind those whirling scimitars, the one who is tring to ovecome the boundries of hate forged by your evil kin. This was an excellent book, a read I would suggest to all."},{"Title":"Sojourn: The Dark Elf Trilogy, Part 3 (Forgotten Realms: The Legend of Drizzt, Book III)","review":"This book is wonderful! He describes things with such detail that it seems like a movie in your mind. You don't feel like you are reading a story, it seems like you are seeing the story unfold before you. The story is deep and intelligent, but easy to understand. The characters are amazingly well designed. I love these books and recommend them to everyone! My compliments to the author."},{"Title":"Sojourn: The Dark Elf Trilogy, Part 3 (Forgotten Realms: The Legend of Drizzt, Book III)","review":"Sojourn is the conclusion of the Dark Elf Trilogy which began with Homeland, continued in Exile and ends here. If you've not read the first two books then I suggest you do so now because the third book is a direct continuation of the other books and you'll be missing out quite a lot by starting here.Exile was a notch below Homeland. It suffered from poor characters and a very predictable storyline and Sojourn isn't much different. None of the characters from the first two books remain(besides Drizzt of course) so the reader has to deal with a whole new cast. For the most part, these new characters are very one dimensional and similar to the characters in Exile in that there's no attachment to the characters. They're just stage props that Drizzt interacts with before moving on to yet another part of his journey. Characters leave or die out of the blue and they're not very fleshed out. The only decent character Montolio receives almost no development besides a page or two about his past. The author could have spent more time on the characters instead of writing overly long, 10 page battles that go nowhere.The action returns here in quantity as in the books before. Again, it feels that more of the book is spent in fights than anything else and the battles themselves are completely too long and are littered with many unnecessary descriptions.The writing too is the worst yet. There are many sentences that just don't read well at all and show a very amateur style. The book itself is very simplisticly written so it will appeal to the younger crowd but if you're looking for some deep, well written fantasy then look elsewhere.The poor writing, weak and boring characters, and overly long battles are the main downfalls of the book. The world still remains rather interesting with interesting creatures and a lush, although not fully developed world. The story is rather weak too as it just continues on the course exile took. The story is uninspired and nothing much really happens throughout; Drizzt just moves from one place to another with a few small stops and adventures. It's probably the worst part of the Dark Elf Trilogy although the ending does introduce some new characters that may bode well for the Icewind Dale trilogy."},{"Title":"Sojourn: The Dark Elf Trilogy, Part 3 (Forgotten Realms: The Legend of Drizzt, Book III)","review":"Sometimes, writing about certain books and topics is much easily done in English, than in my mother tongue. There are themes, ideas and phrases, which come from long history of genre-writing that are just not present in certain discourse. Writing about Drizzt in Croatian, definitely wouldn't look like this. For instance, you couldn't use words like \`elf' or \`dwarf' with the same background that they imply in the context of heroic fantasy. But, all of this is just rambling without apparent reason except for the obvious one. I don't have much to say about Sojourn that hasn't already been written elsewhere. So I'll use these few remaining lines to share with you my thoughts of this book, whatever you might think about them. I have one picture of the reader in my mind and if it happens that you qualify to be in this picture, than you'll probably understand my sentiments. If not, well, figure it out for yourself.Sojourn is the third installment in the Legend of Drizzt series, written, if I remember correctly, as a prequel to popular Crystal Shard book. One in which Drizzt was nothing more than a secondary character. Success of that book, and subsequent titles in the same run, opened up the space in which one of the most beloved and, at the same time, most obnoxious character of heroic fantasy could walk into. Rest is, as they say, history. Now, I have long way to go through this legend, and I sincerely hope that in later books Salvatore managed to do something more with his writing. Forgotten Realms changed since the end of 80's, D&D; players, those who grew up on Drizzt's adventures, grew up as well, so I have reason to suspect that something must have changed. If it remained in this form, you have to visualize twenty or so books, it would be redundant, simplistic and, overall, sorry excuse for cutting down trees. Then again, people always loved dime novels, so my guess could be wrong.Anyway, in Sojourn Drizzt finally managed to escape shackles of his Homeland, vile underground cavern filled with spiteful and hateful opportunists skilled in magic, plots and swordplay. Life would have been too easy for him if he could just dance about, running naked around forest and everything else that your average elf does. It had to become complicated. On one level, which in a way resembles allegory, this is the story about the Other. About Algerians in France, Indians in UK, or Communists in McCarthy's US. It is the story about prejudice, and struggle for identity in anachronistic world filled with people who never managed to look farther than their noses would let them. On that level, there wouldn't be any problem, though one might argue that there can be no prejudice in a fantasy universe in which notions of good and evil are strictly identified, caste and class roles are set in stone and practically unchangeable. Glenn Cook with his low-fantasy doesn't abide there. Problem arises elsewhere. This time, it comes from the structure of the novel itself. Novel which rarely tries to be something else than your average book about funny creatures stabbing each other to death. Salvatore imagination rarely ventures outside the boundaries of this genre. We have a wise (and of course old) mentor, we have an Enemy who blocks the path of our hero, we have unexpected friends who come to aid in the time of need, we have rough dwarven kings with bad language and good heart and all that lot. Somewhere inside all that rubble, lies our Hero, romantic warrior-poet with all his troubles. But as soon as we catch a glimpse of the character, Salavatore provides us with 50 pages long description of the battle. Otherwise our brains might melt of all that existentialism Drizzt embodies I guess. This kind of structure continues throughout the book, and soon becomes like some nagging friend that just can't take a hint and go away. There are other things that sort of defy logic in here (like behavior of this book Arch Nemesis of Drizzt's) but because of all that was mentioned you won't even notice this.So, suffice it to say that, for now, the best book in this Legend is the second one called Exile. And that one wasn't very good. Sojourn repeats the concept of Exile, and tries to hide it by taking it all out in the sunlight. Cheap tricks like that rarely work. To conclude, Legend of Drizzt is miles away from fantasy that I would recommend to you, but if you're looking for some mindless fun and simple joys it might be just the thing for you. Provided you can find your way around amongst elves, dwarves, orcs and rest of that sort."},{"Title":"Sojourn: The Dark Elf Trilogy, Part 3 (Forgotten Realms: The Legend of Drizzt, Book III)","review":"I would say that this is the worst installment in Salvatore's series so far. Why?The style is too choppy. Scenes that would deserve much more attention - the impact of Kellindil's death, the death of Tephanis - are glossed over and very rushed while other scenes, like the completely nonsensical adventure in the dragon's lair, drag on and on and on.My second complain would be that the book is too preachy. It tries to tell the reader what's right and what's wrong but it's too heavy-handed and definitely not subtle.And the way Bruenor met Drizzt? Well, lets just say that if I read this book before the 2nd trilogy, I wouldn't like the dwarf much."},{"Title":"Sojourn: The Dark Elf Trilogy, Part 3 (Forgotten Realms: The Legend of Drizzt, Book III)","review":"I've been reading sci-fi/fantasy books ever since my parents gave me LOTR for my ninth birthday. After that, I read most of the Dragonlance and Forgotten Realms books, plus countless others--including the FANTASTIC \\"Chronicles of Prydain\\" series by Lloyd Alexander. I'm always on the lookout for a new read, so I came to this series hoping it would live up to the hype. Sadly, in my opinion, it just doesn't.All too often, fantasy novels--ESPECIALLY Forgotten Realms books, it seems--contain a lot of action and creativity mired in stilted prose and, frankly, near-plagiarized imagery. I'm all for authors borrowing from past authors' styles, story lines, races, etc., SO LONG AS as they make those elements their own. One obvious example would be George R. R. Martin. His stories contain dragons, giants, and obvious allusions to British history, to say nothing of betrayal, incest and political intrigue motifs (things that could be considered cliche) but he makes his stories unique by giving us complex characters that we can care about.That's exactly what I liked about \\"Homeland\\", the first book in this trilogy. Reading it, I felt like Salvatore actually cared (at least a little) about Drizzt and Zaknafein, not to mention the book's villains. He had a story he wanted to write, a story that mattered to him--even if it was \\"just fantasy\\".Moving on, I enjoyed \\"Exile\\" somewhat, but I got this sinking feeling when I saw Salvatore's rampant exposition--not to mention his amateurish habit of repeating adjectives, often in the very same sentence! \\"The horrible monster cried out, filling Drizzt with horror as....\\"And please, let's address R.A. Salvatore's absolutely tone-deaf names! C'mon... Clacker?! A jewel-loving city called BLINGdenstone?! The gnomes whose racial name sounds a lot like \\"Fierce Neblee\\"?! Belwar's oft-repeated curse that basically translates to \\"BIG CAMERA!!\\"?! Then there's Drizzt himself, whose name should actually be spelled \\"Drist\\" to avoid giving us the impression that Salvatore accidentally coughed up some letters on a page and decided its unpronounceable nature could be explained away as \\"foreign\\".Also, I'll bet every cent in my bank account that R.A. Salvatore has NO IDEA what the term \\"POV violation\\" means. Well, I'll tell ya. It means that when you begin your chapter in Third Person Restricted point of view, i.e. telling the story from one specific character's perspective, you CAN'T suddenly jump into another character's head! The only way you can show multiple characters' inner monologue is through Third Person Omniscient, which Salvatore clearly doesn't use. Now, that may seem technical to some, but in terms of unprofessional mistakes, it's basically the equivalent of a doctor going to remove your appendix by sawing into your shoulder. An 18 year old who's taken a creative writing class would know better!\\"Sojourn\\" unfortunately continues these trends and takes them up a notch. Never mind the repetitive sentences and cliches; Drizzt's main antagonist is actually named Roddy McGristle!!! Haa haa haa! What?! RODDY MCGRISTLE?! That sounds like a name from an Adam Sandler routine!! But at least in a Sandler routine, it's SUPPOSED to be a dumb name! How could any reader actually give five stars to a book that contains such an unintentionally funny, bastardized Irish name as RODDY MCGRISTLE?!And don't even get me started on the fact that Salvatore named a magical panther after the Celtic spelling of \\"Gwenevere\\". Why not call somebody Arthyr or Lancylot while you're at it?*sigh* OK, then there's the story itself. Yes, there are a few interesting scenes from time to time, but I can't help thinking--as with \\"Exile\\"--that what we're reading is just Salvatore's ROUGH DRAFT. He's clearly a writer who can do better, but he got sloppy. Sadly, we've seen this with so many other established fantasy authors. After so many books written and copies sold, they stop caring and the editors stop editing, because everyone knows that a book filled with typos and grammar errors will still sell if it's written by a popular author.That tells us something about Salvatore, though. It tells us that he doesn't take writing very seriously, and he doesn't fully appreciate the time, money, and attention given him by his faithful fans. That's really disappointing. I can afford to shell out twenty bucks or so to give one good and two mediocre books a fair shake. But what about young adults?As a writer myself (although I'm sure I'll never sell a fraction of the books Salvatore has), I apologize for getting on the soapbox here, but ANY serious author should have a healthy respect for the craft of writing. It's not just a meal ticket; writers have a golden, almost sacred opportunity to their entertain readers, yes, but also to enrich readers' lives (and show respect for past authors) through solid, lyrical prose. Nothing infuriates me more than \\"successful\\" authors who just dash off a few stories between smug book signings, to the delight of well-meaning fans who simply haven't read anything better and don't know what they're missing.If this sounds harsh, it's only because I sense in \\"Sojourn\\", and in Salvatore in general, the makings of a truly good author--if somebody would chain him to his computer and make him do his homework!!"},{"Title":"Sojourn: The Dark Elf Trilogy, Part 3 (Forgotten Realms: The Legend of Drizzt, Book III)","review":"well , this is gonna stick out. Personally I thought the Dark Elf trilogy and the Icewind Dale trilogy were both sorta dumb. It started off cool with Drizzt fighting to escape the corruption of his society , but then it rapdily went down hill with cliched fantasy scenes and horrible names (clacker,cyrsith tirith etc) Being a big fan of the dragonlance seriies I had thought this would be about the same level.I was sorely dissapointed. The scene was either boring, cliched to death , or just outright stupid. The characters (besides Drizzt) were old and two dimensional. Salvatore seemed to have some osrt of fear of killing off his characters, making them ridiculously immortal like. In dragonlance Flint and Sturm both die in the first trilogy , adding to their nobility. Wulfgar and Zaknefien were the only two characters besides Drizzt which weren't ripped out of a D&amp;D players guide. Seeing how everyone gave it 5 stars I may try and read it again , but If your looking for fantast go read the Coldfire Trilogy, Lord of the Rings, Dragonlance or Wheel of Time. Dont waste your time on reading drivel more apt to being printed in a goosebumps book."},{"Title":"Sojourn: The Dark Elf Trilogy, Part 3 (Forgotten Realms: The Legend of Drizzt, Book III)","review":"God, this book was awful! Not just the story, it was the construction that turned me off. The storyline is weak and the writing immature. Characters seem to sprout and wither with all the imagination of a photocopier. There is nary a connection between personalities and their responses to events. I can go on but I guess I need to be more concrete.A sprite introduced within the first 45 pages suddenly develops ventriloquistic abilities for just one scene. Nary a mention before or later of that ability. While it is the prerogative of the author, a little more finesse would have been nice.There is an unnecessary page or two of pontification before each of the five parts that comprise the book. For a work so shallow in its content, this essentially has a \\"insult-to-injury\\" aura.Guenhwyvar is totally wasted/domesticated in the book. There was some evocation of majesty associated with the panther in the first book. In this third book, he had all the majesty of a tomcat. Also unbelievable is a battle towards the end where the panther is unable to dispose of the pet dog of the bad guy.Then there's Montolio, what can I say....for a couple of chapters I thought this might be a promising character, especially with the blind archer bit. He even defeats the great Drizzt in battle, seemingly teaching him a \\"valuable\\" lesson. Then dies a few months later of old age. C'mon!!With this book I give up on Robert Salvatore, never mind the ringing endorsement given to him by Margaret Weis in the 'Introduction' (strike one for her)."},{"Title":"Sojourn: The Dark Elf Trilogy, Part 3 (Forgotten Realms: The Legend of Drizzt, Book III)","review":"Forget Tolkien!

He seems to have total recall of that time, as if he had just lived a lifetime there and has come back to tell us all about it.Told from the Loyalist perspective, this is a fascinating acount of the period from 1775 to 1783, a viewpoint that you won't find anywhere else. The Amazon reviewer did a good job of explaining what is in the book, I need only add that it is a real page turner. I read this book 20 years ago, but the impression it made upon me then is still with me.I found that this book, like all Robert's books, communicates to me not only a history of the period, but also a feel for the period. That is a very difficult thing to do! In Kenneth Roberts we are in the hands of a master.This is a very entertaining and informative novel that will serve to give you a more balanced perspective of the Revolutionary War period."},{"Title":"Oliver Wiswell","review":"Story of the American Revolution from the Tory point of view. Very unsettling to those who believe our founding fathers were perfect politicians. Read about Ben Franklin's interesting affairs, about how John Hancock wanted the revolution as Harvard was about to indict him for embezzling funds. Learn how the British in America really did not want to win the war as it would make their political English counterparts look good. Very true accounts - Roberts is one of the best historians. His fictional characters are funny, real, and make for a good history lesson."},{"Title":"Oliver Wiswell","review":"I just finished this book, and I believe it to be Kenneth Roberts' best book. I have enjoyed all of his storys since I read Arundel years ago. He was a masterful storyteller, and his knowledge of the history and culture of the times is unequaled. I have long felt that his books are timeless and should be required reading in both high school and college. He wrote fiction, but you cannot get a similar feeling for the times and people in any history book. He brought to life the great leaders of this period such as Arnold, Schyler, Roberts, Thompson, and so many others in a way no history book could. All of his books are great reads and worthy of our attention. Oliver Wiswell is unique to Roberts and perhaps to American literature. I had never considered \\"the other side\\" of the revolution. We were taught about the great patriots, but loyalists and the likes of Benedict Arnold were always traitors. This book reveals the fallacy of that teaching. It also shows the great tragedy that was the American Revolution. I had never considered it to be another civil war, but that was precisely what it was. The \\"patriots\\" were not that different from the \\"loyalists\\", and in many cases they were worse. The darkest and most ugly part of that civil war was the division that was borne between people who equally loved their country. There are reflections of all of that in our times as politicians in the name of freedom and democracy seek to divide us. The lessons of history are for all times. Anyway, you MUST read this book."},{"Title":"Oliver Wiswell","review":"Oliver Wiswell is the story of the American Revolution discussed from the perspective of those who chose to remain loyal to Britain. Finally, we have the opportunity to gain a more balanced and truthful view of American History. We learn that not all American patriots were noble and not all English generals were brilliant. The reader will be rewarded with a greater understanding and appreciation of American history."},{"Title":"Oliver Wiswell","review":"There's a boldness to &quot;Oliver Wiswell&quot; that shines forth to this day, some sixty-odd years after its first publication, an assertion that (despite what we've likely been taught in our textbook histories) neither side in the Revolutionary War had a monopoly on either truth or right; that thoughtful, honorable men (and women) could likely -- in all good conscience -- find themselves supporting the &quot;Tory&quot; (loyalist) cause in opposition to their equally motivated &quot;revolutionist&quot; neighbors. And consequently be made to suffer horrendously for their acts of conscience.There is also the equally bold assertion that not all &quot;revolutionists&quot; (any more so than all &quot;Tories&quot;) were motivated by entirely &quot;high-minded&quot; or &quot;patriotic&quot; principles. Pettiness, long-held grudges, envy, even a profit motive or two, were just as likely to come into play . . . as they do here, convincingly, in the pages of this novel.In many ways, &quot;Wiswell&quot; is a cautionary tale of the dangers of mob rule (as opposed to reasoned consensus) that is every bit as timely today -- in Roberts' unparallelled descriptions of mobs mentalities in action -- as it was in 1940 . . . or, for that matter, as it would have been in 18th century Massachusetts.Filled with three-dimensional characters (many of whom you'll likely find yourself coming to at least admire, despite their sympathies), a passion for history that is matched only by Roberts' unique ability to make it come alive, &quot;Oliver Wiswell&quot; probably won't cause you to conclude that the &quot;wrong side&quot; prevailed; but then, that wasn't his intention.I leave it to you -- after you've read this novel (a hint here: read it in conjunction with Roberts' equally impressive &quot;Rabble In Arms&quot;) -- to determine that intention for yourself."},{"Title":"Oliver Wiswell","review":"I moved to Washington DC two months ago and decided to bone up on my American history. Reading Oliver Wiswell has given me a new perspective on the American Revolution and the people who shaped our country over 200 years ago.

Can't wait to read more of his works."},{"Title":"Oliver Wiswell","review":"I ordered a used, in good condition, hardcover edition of the book for my son in Arizona, and it came through in good condition, he said. I had just read the book myself before, one of the few Kenneth Roberts' books I had not read. I think it was one of his best. It was an eye-opener to me on the Revolutionary War times, from start to finish, from the point of view of the Loyalists. I lived in the Boston area much of my life. What Roberts had to say about places in New England where I had been (like the Blue Hills and Milton and Boston itself) was fascinating. But then it was equally fascinating to learn about the peoples of that time in the other colonies. In one part of the book, Roberts distinguishes between the rebels who, from the Loyalist point of view, were rabble rousers (Samuel Adams and John Hancock, for example) and those who were nobler (George Washington and John Adams, for example). I had had no idea the extent to which the British squandered away their chances of winning the war outright, including on the part of my namesake (and forbear) General William Howe. A man named Buell (probably fictitious), whose life Wiswell saves, is like a brother to him throughout the book. Buell is a master of ingenuity and full of great humor. There is also a beautiful love story woven throughout. Oliver Wiswell is a wonderful, informative, exciting, serious, humorous, and poignant read."},{"Title":"Oliver Wiswell","review":"This book has its fervent admirers and detractors - often for the wrong reasons! Those who accuse its author of slanting history in favour of the \\"loyalist\\" argument disregard the diaparaging, contemptuous even, manner in which the British forces and authorities are depicted, as well as the extent of the atrocities committed by the latter during the campaign. What comes through very clearly is that the hero of the narrative has opted for the unionist camp, not out of love or admiration for the British, but out of fear of a collapse in law and order and stability. From a purely literary point of view, the work is not immune from criticism, and some of the more long-winded passages could well tolerate a modicum of pruning."},{"Title":"Oliver Wiswell","review":"I began my journey with Kenneth Roberts when my mother bought me a copy of Northwest Passage when I was ten. I was lost. Never so captivated in my life. I went through every work Roberts ever wrote and loved them all. And then I began Oliver Wiswell. I don't know that I have ever read a book that was so well researched, so accurate and yet also presented a cast of characters so utterly well drawn and believable. Roberts' gift is to capture the reality of war and history, the venality and cruelty that are an inseparable companion to bravery and nobility. Oliver Wiswell presents a needed counterpoint to the standard presentation of America's founding; that it was something desired and nobly fought for by every colonist, that Tories, or Loyalists as they thought of themselves, were traitors, that every motive of the Founding Fathers was pure. He does this and still gives you an understanding of just how it was possible for both sides to consider themselves as patriots to a cause worthy of victory, both sides showing bravery and resolve. I learned more from his books than from the utter tripe that formed most of the history texts of that school time.I have reread most of Roberts' work recently with my eleven year old daughter who is a voracious reader with an appetite for history. It has been an incredible joy to see how well the books hold up. There are minor items but the power remains undiminished. I wonder that this author is not more widely known."},{"Title":"Oliver Wiswell","review":"The first thing that struck me was that the book was very well-written. When I started this book I expeceted an adequately written historical novel that would be just a loose plot surrounding the major events of the American Revolution, with of course a politcal slant toward the Glorious Cause, etc. At first I was slightly irritated by the pro-Loyalist outlook. I wasn't even sure if I would finish. But as I read on the anti-Rebel bashing was so persistant that I began to see their side. Not only did I begin to see their side but I couldn't help but agree with it. Since 2005 I have limited my reading to largely nonfiction of what I call the Founding Fathers' Era, with an occasional historical novel---of the same era. No one book has effected more me than this one which forced me to see another viewpoint. I hope not all of the American rebels were as miserable and mean as Kenneth Roberts portrayed them. And I assume not all the Loyalists were as noble and kind-hearted either. But still, this book forces you to take a look at the other side and I for one will never feel the same as I did."},{"Title":"Oliver Wiswell","review":"\\"Oliver Wiswell\\" is, in my view, Kenneth Roberts greatest and most courageous work. The story of the majority of the citizens of the American Colonies who did not favor the use of force and demagogery to wrest needed governmental reforms from the British Crown stands as a rare literary corrective to much of the patriotic mythology that surrounds the teaching of American History at the primary and secondary levels.

Opening in 1775 and coming to a close in 1783, the story is a panoramic view of a hero's life as he tries to deal with fealty to the British crown while living during a young America's revolution against Parlimentary rule. Because they are Loyalists, Oliver Wiswell (recently graduated from Yale) and his lawyer father are persecuted by rebels and hounded from their Massachusetts home. This is all the more bitter to Oliver because he is determined to marry his childhood sweetheart Sally, the daughter of a rabid insurgent. Forced to seek shelter in Halifax, Oliver ends up on Long Island where he witnesses the Battle of Bunker Hill from a bedroom window and in the Brooklyn Heights sees the battle of Kips Bay from a hillside. (While the rebels are escaping in retreat, General Howe has tea with Mrs Murray, she of Murray Hill fame. The stupidity of the period's British military is examined in this novel ruthlessly.) Later Oliver is sent as a spy to Paris and London and meets many of the historical persons of the time; and then, much later, he is assigned the duty of locating the fated Convention army after Burgoyne's defeat at Saratoga, which means that he travels through the Cumberland Gap and comes to rest at the Loyalist stronghold Ninety Six. When it becomes obvious that the Loyalist cause is lost, Oliver is one of the founders of the refuge in Nova Scotia which eventually becomes New Brunswick. All this is dream fodder for a skillful historical novelist, and Roberts makes the most of it in a story packed with colorful events and characters. Yes, Oliver encounters people who really lived, but not the obvious ones. George Washington is only seen at a distance, while George III and Louis XVI are talked about but are never introduced, and General Howe's mistress Mrs Loring (sort of a Colonial version of Emma Hamilton) is seen in the shadows, so to speak. On the other hand Oliver deals directly with the chameleon Benjamin Thompson (later Count von Rumford) and the cultured Indian chief Alexander McGillivray, who quotes in Latin. All this is conveyed with a great deal of panache, Roberts obviously under the influence of James Fenimore Cooper (who of course was under the influence of Scott), so that the exciting depiction of the Ninety Six siege is like a description from \\"Ivanhoe\\" or \\"The Pathfinder\\". Rarely does the story lose focus, as it does in the Wilderness Trail section when Oliver becomes involved with a young widow, both her character and her motives much too vague. For the most part this 800 + page epic kept my attention till Sally's last wistful sentence, and I'll be looking forward to another Kenneth Roberts adventure."},{"Title":"Oliver Wiswell","review":"Oliver Wiswell is another of Kenneth Roberts great historical novels, featuring his meticulous historical research. It tells the story of the American Revolution from the Loyalist point of view. Oliver Wiswell and his father are driven from their Massachusetts home into British occupied Boston by a mob, along with many others who have counseled moderation and not subscribed to the stance that war with Britain is inevitable. The British General Gates takes no action against the Colonialists and is driven out of Boston. Oliver goes to Long Island where General Howe misses several opportunities to attack the Colonialists and end the rebellion. Oliver goes to England and tries to tell the English that they do not understand the Americans and their strategies for winning the war will not work, but he is met with the same contempt the British have for all Americans, even those loyal to England. He then travels to the south where he watches the British make mistake after mistake until Cornwallis is finally forced to surrender.The book has two themes. The first is how the British, despite overwhelming military strength, lost the war through arrogance, lack of understanding of the Americans, and being more interested in their social life than in fighting a war. It also shows how little they supported the Loyalists who would have eagerly fought for them and perhaps tipped the balance of the war. The other theme is how the Colonials had little sympathy for anyone who believed rapprochement with England was possible, and how mob rule came to dominate, mercilessly persecuting most people of property and education and driving them from their homes. In this it graphically shows that the Revolution was not simply a rebellion against England but a civil war and a class war as well, with the population more or less evenly divided between the two sides. It is quite an antidote to the popular view of the heroic freedom-loving fighters against tyranny which we usually associate with the American Revolution."},{"Title":"Oliver Wiswell","review":"Wow. I wish I could give this book six stars. I wish I could demote every five-star rating I've given to a book or a CD or a DVD so that I could give OLIVER WISWELL a unique five-star rating, thus marking its place as one of the best books I've ever read, period. Reading this book was an epiphany. Having an undergraduate history minor, and having taken courses in historiography, I was used to the idea of reading history while keeping in mind that it was written by the victors and by people with their own agendas; but never has that principle been so real, and so vivid, as in the reading of this book. In all my years of school I never learned so much about the Revolutionary War, never cared so much about the war, and never read a book that made me want to visit New Brunswick, Canada.The novel begins in April 1775, when the protagonist is ejected from his home by American rebels, and ends in 1783, when the war has ended and he and other Loyalists leave their home country to establish roots in Canada. In between, the author manages to have Oliver plausibly meeting some of the most interesting characters involved (General Howe, John Vardill, John Cruger, etc) and at the scene of many of the war's most interesting events (the Battle of Bunker (Breed's) Hill, the rebels' surrender of New York, the intrigue-ridden courts of Paris and London, the trek to Kentucky by fleeing Tories along Boone's Wilderness Trail, the siege of Ninety Six and Benedict Arnold's campaign in the south, and the Loyalists' post-war settlement in New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Gibralter, Bermuda and the Bahamas). Furthermore, we become involved in the personal lives of several main characters: the young Mr. Wiswell, his resourceful and loyal friend Tom Buell, Sally Leighton -- the rebel girl Oliver leaves behind, and the irascible Mrs. Belcher Byles. In the course of the novel we come to have genuine affection for these characters.I hated for this book to end. I teared up through the last ten pages, more fully comprehending the pain and torment of America's first civil war and more fully appreciating the suffering and loss of people on both sides of this horrible ordeal.If you are willing to read 800+ pages you will be rewarded not only by a remarkable personal story, but you will undoubtedly know more about the Revolutionary War than you dreamed possible. Kenneth Roberts was a remarkable author."},{"Title":"Oliver Wiswell","review":"If you enjoy historical fiction or are interested in early American history, then I would recommend this book, because of its unusual (and neglected) subject matter, and because Roberts is a very fine writer. But for other readers the book would likely be too long.The title character is a well-educated New Englander who is disgusted with the rabble-rousing politics of Boston agitators like Samuel Adams and John Hancock, and when forced to pick sides when fighting began, chose to side with the crown. He is recruited as a spy / intelligence gatherer and sent on various missions to Long Island, London, Paris, and South Carolina, accompanied by an extraordinarily resourceful and clever jack-of-all-trades named Tom Buell.The book is essentially a fictional autobiography, covering the entire American Revolution through the perspective of a person actively involved in the events of a tumultuous period. Therefore a long book is necessary. Nor does the action move slowly. But Roberts's dialogue often lapses into long-winded speech-making by the loyalist characters (especially Buell) as they express their reasons for opposing the rebellion, and their frustration with the hardships they experience. The account of Wiswell's mission to London and Paris might well have been omitted, although it provides the reader, through Wiswell, an inside view of the confused workings of the King's government. Without understanding or ever speaking a word of French, Wiswell is deployed to capture diplomatic papers from Ben Franklin, the American plenipotentiary in France. Two of Wiswell's friends from America appear in Paris as extremely implausible fellow spies for the loyalist cause.Wiswell's adventures in the South, which include a vivid depiction of a fortress siege, are the best part of the book. Incidentally, it is a useful corrective to the Hollywood baloney in The Patriot (the Mel Gibson movie), which had its setting in the southern campaigns of the Revolutionary War.The author seems to have intended the book mainly to serve a didactic purpose: the illustrate, with fair comprehensiveness, the reasons and extent of loyalist opposition to the Continental Congress. He does this very well, while making clear, through depictions of several incompetent and stubborn English officials - General Howe is targeted especially - how intelligent and respectable Americans could decide that independence from Great Britain had become necessary."},{"Title":"Oliver Wiswell","review":"Once again I'm admitting to bias in my review, but this is another solid novel by the premier novelist of the colonial American period. Roberts writes of young Wiswell as he faced the struggle of a world he did not wish to see changed. Wiswell was a Loyalist and suffered much for his beliefs. Too many novelists (and indeed some historians) write off the tribulations of the Loyalists because of so-called &quot;patriotism.&quot; But patriotism is not so clearly defined. Wiswell believed he was acting out of patriotism when he made the desicions he did.This book is another offering from a writer who can literally place the reader into the pages of his book and keep you there until the last page. The characters of the several books are cross-referenced enough so one gets the impression of a larger historical community. This allows Roberts to maintain continuity yet keeps him from writing in a historical vacuum. The reader will follow Wiswell's journey from New England to the southern colonies and ultimately beyond the borders of the United States.With any luck, this and the rest of Roberts' books will never go out of print."},{"Title":"Oliver Wiswell","review":"Oliver Wiswell is an excellent historical novel that, along with Rabble in Arms, Arundel, and The Battle of the Cowpens (all by Roberts) provides a comprehensive view of the American Revolution. Reading all 4 books, one learns a tremendous amount of history about some of the battles fought first in the North at Quebec, Lake Champlain, and Saratoga, and then in the South at the Cowpens and the implications it had for the final American victory at Yorktown.The reader also gets an excellent insight into the viewpoints of the British, Loyalists, and Patriots during the conflict. So, I strongly recommend that all 4 books be read together (indeed, back in 1976 they were issued together as \\"A Reader on the American Revolution.\\")So, why did I add \\"But...\\" to my review title?Because I emphasize that the only way to fully understand Oliver Wiswell is to first read the other novels. In the book, Oliver is the Loyalist son of a well-to-do son of a rich Boston attorney. The society he comes from is the country's aristocracy of the time... rich, well educated, supremely disdainful of the \\"rabble\\" that is fighting for the American cause during the war. First read Rabble in Arms to get an understanding of the tremendous suffering and deprivation the Patriots suffered during the Revolution with incredible selflessness. Learn how they fought against all odds for their country, with little or no pay, often times with poor leadership and little food, and no personal gain while facing thousands of professional, well trained and armed soldiers and foreign mercenaries (not to mention Indians that were capable of quite savagely killing and scalping entire families or defenseless women like Jennie McCrae).Then read Oliver Wiswell; I guarantee you that Oliver's constant disdain for the \\"scarecrows,\\" the \\"rabble,\\" the \\"pseuodo-soldiers\\" will grate on your nerves the more often he repeats such terms.Of course rich Loyalists had no time for the idea of American independence; they benefited from the the British way of running the colonies. It were the \\"rabble\\" that suffered under the trade and settlement restrictions that the British sought to impose on the colonies for the benefit of their own economy, and to see to it that they and not the Americans controlled the settlement of the West. If men like Hancock were \\"failed\\" businesmen and \\"smugglers,\\" it was due to British control of America's international trade that insisted that America not manufacture its own goods, and purchase only British made goods. If there was ill-clothed, un-shod \\"rabble\\" in America, it was because of such policies. Men like Hancock and Sam Adams recognized the eternal poverty many Americans would suffer unless those policies were overturned. They gambled their very lives on the behalf of the \\"rabble,\\" when they could just as easily have settled comfortably into the upper classes along with Wiswell simply by continuing to smuggle goods. Hancock's signature on the Declaration of Independence would have been as good as signing his own death warrant if the Revolution had failed. On the other hand, men like Oliver Wiswell refused to see the consequences of the \\"good government\\" they believed Britain provided.The American Revolution was more than just a \\"civil war,\\" as Oliver keeps calling it... it was indeed a REVOLUTION, of the \\"rabble\\" that were so poor they went into battle without shoes and decent clothes and food because they were on the short end of a Colonial social system that benefited the likes of Wiswell. It's not an accident we call it the Revolutionary War.Another reviewer dismissed Gibson's \\"The Patriot\\" and pointed to Oliver Wiswell as proof that it was just anti-British Patriot propaganda. I strongly suggest that readers also peruse \\"The Battle of the Cowpens\\" by Roberts. It's a short work, written shortly before Roberts died and meant as the core of a much longer historical novel he never got to finish. However, anyone who reads it will instantly recognize that \\"The Batle of the Cowpens,\\" along with Robert's other works, is in fact the literary source for \\"The Patriot.\\" In that book, Roberts aludes to \\"the almost unbelievable savagery\\" of BOTH the Patriot and Loyalist sides during the Revolution. In the South, the Loyalists and their Indian allies in fact did slaughter Patriot families unmercifully on the frontiers, and the Patriots responded in kind to put them down. For all the deprivations that Oliver Wiswell mentions, the fact is Oliver was deported to Boston ALIVE. The loyalist Tom Buell is tar and feathered, and literally ridden out on a rail, but he was ALIVE. One can well wish Loyalists at Simsbury Mines were better treated, and deplore the excesses that occured on Long Island... BUT, just a peek at the news out of Iraq each day today and the horrors perpetrated there by terrorists even now will show that Americans 230 years ago behaved in a far morally superior manner than others do even today in many places in the world.As Steven Nason puts it in Rabble in Arms: If the Revolution was lost, and the Loyalists had not been driven out, it would have been the Loyalists like Wiswell that would have pointed out the Patriots for hanging. Wars and Revolutions are hard things, and it may seem like a hard-hearted thing to say: But, in fact America WAS better off winning its independence, and ridding itself of people like Wiswell that saw the likes of remarkable men like Washington, Jefferson, Hancock, Madison, Franklin, Hamilton, and Adams as nothing but socially inferior \\"rabble.\\"Think of it this way: in World history there have been a few periods of incredible social and cultural \\"golden ages\\" when an amazing collection of great men that usually appear only one at a time per generation or two suddenly come on the scene together and change the course of civilization. The Golden Age of Athens was probably the greatest of such times. The Renaissance, with its Leondardo, Michelangelo, Raphael, and others was another. And, in the political sphere, the American Revolution - with the Founding Fathers - was arguably the most recent. And that is the group that Wiswell dismisses as \\"hypocrites\\" and \\"incompetents\\" and \\"rabble\\" worthy of only his disdain.Oliver Wiswell is a great read, and allows the reader to share in the mindset of the Loyalists. It doesn't sugarcoat history and is frank about Patriot excesses - as Roberts' other books are frank about British and Loyalist excesses. Just be sure to read those other books, to remind yourself why, after all, Oliver and his kind were wrong and The War of American Independence was profoundly right."},{"Title":"Oliver Wiswell","review":"Unlike most books about US history, this one is told from the POV of a Loyalist and the terrible injustices suffered under the hands of the &quot;Rabble In Arms&quot; in their fight for Independence. Kenneth Roberts preciseness in researching US history adds all the color and background necessary for even the most inscrutable history buff while weaving wonderful characters whose every word hangs in the readers minds months after the book has been closed. It clearly illustrates the way neighbour turned against neighbour, even brother against brother, all believing in their cause, all willing to fight to the death to win. The opening scene shows the senseless brutality committed by many when obcessed with a cause and blind to justice. Tom Buell is my favorite character because of his resourcefulness and precousesness. Oliver Wiswell has the true character motivated by truth and honor that should be a roll model for all Americans. This book is a MUST READ on anyone's list and should be required reading in all schools. BRAVO, KENNETH ROBERTS! and, THANK YOU."},{"Title":"Oliver Wiswell","review":"Without doubt, this is one of the best historical novels I have ever read. Since there is always 2 sides to a question, this book gives you the other side of the American Revolution -- the side you never read in history books or are taught in school. Roberts doesn't have an axe to grind -- he just tells the story like a &quot;Tory&quot; or &quot;Royalist&quot; sees it. This information is long overdue."},{"Title":"Oliver Wiswell","review":"Roberts has done it again but this time he takes the point of view of a Tory who is run out of the country by the revolutionaries. The book covers the entire American revolution from April 1775 to the settlement of Canada by the war's losing side. Reading this book you know his characters and how they felt and why they made the decisions they did at a difficult time in this country's history."},{"Title":"Oliver Wiswell","review":"I'll be brief. I am puzzled by the reader who downgraded Oliver Wiswell for its sympathetic portrayal of middle-class loyalist Americans in the Revolutionary period. Roberts has written sympathetically about all classes in his opus, and Wiswell states frequently in the book that he is, after all, an American. Is that insufficently PC?I've read other books by Kenneth Roberts and continue to read history and biography of the Revolutionary period. Judging by that material, Roberts' insight (remember he wrote over 70 years ago) is astonishing.Although Roberts does not seem to have enjoyed the literary acclaim given Fitzgerald, Faulkner, even Hemingway and the like in contemporary criticism. I believe his works will and should endure."},{"Title":"Oliver Wiswell","review":"Briefly, Kenneth Roberts filled out his treatment of the American Revolution through this novel providing a Loyalist's view of the Revolution. It was fascinating to follow the Revolution from the \\"other side\\" of our standard histories. The descriptions of events, people and issues were done nicely and rounded out the heroic viewpoints we usually learn in school. The effect did not detract from the facts or heroics of the rebel's side, but did round it out with balance and perspective. The tale and the romance are a bit tortuous, but this style of writing was to entertain, not read like a 60 minutes TV program action script. As such, this book continues to be a great read 65 years after it was first published. There is an interesting set of observations or subtext by Roberts on the futility of armed conflict, and that war solves nothing. That is interesting in the context of the American 1940s political setting. I am not sure of how Mr. Roberts viewed the possible American involvement in the struggle with Nazi Germany. Perhaps he was an adherent of the isolationist theory that was very popular with a number of prominent Americans in the years just before Pearl Harbor. Again, this novel is a great balance with the Robert's classic American Revolution novels that create the historic records of the American patriots."},{"Title":"Oliver Wiswell","review":"Most people would be surprised to know that there were many &quot;heroic&quot; conservative young American men who, at least at first, did not want the guerrila fighters of the American Revolution to win against the established order (and significant economic benefits) that friendliness toward Britain signified. This novel follows the American Revolution from just such a perspective. It should be high in everyone's &quot;must read&quot; list."},{"Title":"Oliver Wiswell","review":"\\"OLIVER WISWELL\\" certainly demonstrates that there are ,indeed, two sides to every story! This book tells the story of the revolution from the Loyalist side--those colonists who did not wish to separate from England ! We all learned in school, or at least I did, that our forbearers were all saints, caring only for true liberty! As with most conflicting stories---the true lies somewhere down the middle. A fine read and quite an eyeopener!"},{"Title":"Oliver Wiswell","review":"I've read this book twice, and I don't do that often. Incredibly entertaining, and historically informative. You're not sure where the fiction begins and the fact ends. The writing is superior to most books written today. The perspective may be hard for an American who is passionate about their history, but it is a real perspective that was shared by many, and besides his frustration with the Brits...well enough of that. Great book, one the, if not the, best historical fiction I have read."},{"Title":"Oliver Wiswell","review":"I last read this book in 1950 when I was ten years old. I bought a used copy in excellent condition to re-read at 69. It tells the story of the American Loyalists who fought for the British during the American Revolution. They were considered the enemy by the rebels and were tortured, their house burned, and ordered out of the area. Some of my ancestors were part of this group who experienced the rejection and moved to Canada, settling in Ontario. Kenneth Roberts is a brillant writer who makes the past come alive with vivid detail, lively narrative, and the ability to make you yearn for the \\"good old days\\""},{"Title":"Oliver Wiswell","review":"A novel set during the American revolution in which the main character hates the founding fathers and struggles to prevent all they believe in.This is the story of an American loyalist in Massachussets who finds himself on the wrong side from the beginning.I forget whether I was ten or twelve. My father thought it would be a good exorcise in looking at history through both sides. It hasn't changed my views though it did teach me to view history in a more balanced approach.Though the book I read did fall apart and disapear, I have since acquired another copy which I keep at hand for the purpose of refreshing my mind in keeping history in balance to see with both eyes from all possible angles.I found the main character and his friend both quite sympatetic and quite likable. I found their travels fun reading and though the ending isn't what I would have it is still a good one."},{"Title":"Oliver Wiswell","review":"Written at a time when it was trendy to debunk the revolution, it still makes the reader consider what had been taught at irrefutable in grammar school. Roberts takes the extreme opposite position of the Arundel and Rabble in Arms books and the truth is somewhere in between. If you like the quintessentially American tradition of building up our heroes then cutting them down to size, you'll like this book. I reccomend the earlier ones though because he uses the same formulas here but more effectively in the others."},{"Title":"Oliver Wiswell","review":"This book was perhaps one of the most boring I've ever read. The only redeeming quality of this book was that it's a great source of accurate information regarding both sides of the revolutionary war that you would not get from reading a textbook. However, the novel reads like a textbook, following a predictable series of historic facts. The love story in this book is hardly enough to keep someone interested. The side stories are bothersome and unnecessary. This book could have been compressed from the lengthy 783 pages, into a much more managable 300 pages. The wasted adjectives, similes, and series's make me wonder if Roberts had been paid by the word. I wouldn't read this book unless you were required to."},{"Title":"Petals on the River","review":"I have been a fan for many years. I have read all her previous books many times over and each time enjoyed them immensly!&quot;Shanna&quot; has by far been my favourite-but there have been many, many others that were on the same level-ALL in fact-except &quot; Petals&quot; . After having waited so long for it to be published-I felt really let down. I kept waiting for something to happen-the spark, intensity of the characters, a good story line -simply wasn't there. -What happened? -It seems to have been writen by someone else? ...."},{"Title":"Petals on the River","review":"I have read only seven books written by Ms. Woodiwiss, and I liked most of them very much (I\`m a very big fan of Kathleen\`s romances), but this is the worst. Where has the old Woodiwiss\`s style gone? Where is tension, adventure, tenderness and love? The perfect characters, unique atmosphere? And what about tender sex scenes? I was really insulted, when I read about &quot;making love&quot; of Shemaine and Gage. It sounds so dirty! Forget &quot;Petals on the river&quot; and read &quot;The Flame and the Flower&quot;. That\`s real Woodiwiss! And I want her back!"},{"Title":"Petals on the River","review":"KEW, without a doubt, has done it again! Because of her articulate descriptions of the characters, surroundings, and events, you are nearly there! Everything was so unpredictable. I loved how this book was different from the others. How? Usually the man is filthy rich, living on a huge plantation(Shanna, Flame and the Flower, Elusive Flame), but this one was a humble story of a man working hard for his son, and what hopes he had left for a life. I felt so much compassion for both characters, and was deeply moved by the ending. You must read this book!!!"},{"Title":"Petals on the River","review":"I have read this book and found it a little hard to swallow. It was okay but KEW has written much better, Flame &amp; the Flower, Shanna etc. Shermaine is accused of murder gets shipped away and she calmly accepts this. She is bought by a man and doesn't seem to mind, she doesn't even try to fight for her freedom. Gage is a little boring nothing like any of the other male characters in KEW books. He buys this woman who is accused of murder and lets her take care of his son, not a very responsible parent."},{"Title":"Petals on the River","review":"Ms. Woodiwiss is a talented author who has the ability to write thoroughly entertaining, romantic books. When a friend gave me A Rose In Winter several years ago, I liked the book so much that I went on to read several other Kathleen Woodiwiss novels. What I'm wondering after reading Petals On The River is, WHAT HAPPENED? This book was very disappointing. It contained too much whining and too little romance. Also, it was very tedious to hear Shemaine continually referred to as a bond slave, and there was way too much baby talk. The story was predictable and trite, and lacking in humor and suspense. It was difficult to finish the book, but I kept hoping that the story would improve. Unfortunately, even the ending wasn't a surprise. Altogether, this book was a big disappointment. I hope Ms. Woodiwiss's next offering has more going for it."},{"Title":"Petals on the River","review":"I loved this book when I was in middle school, and I remember fondly of sneaking off to read this book behind my mom's back. This was the book that got me into writing romances when I was starting to decide on a genre when I was around 15~17 years old.Shemaine O'Hearn is almost what fanfic writers would call a Mary Sue due to her over described good looks, kindness and backstory. Shemaine used to have the perfect life as she was the daughter of a wealthy merchant, and she used to be engaged to one of the most handsomest men in England. Unfortunately the man Shemaine was engaged to had a grandmother who hated Shemaine enough to make up a story to get Shemaine shipped out of England as a convict.The second man she meets is Gage Thorton, who needed a nanny for his son. He hires Shemaine, even though she doesn't know how to run a household. For a good bulk of the novel, there is a lot of shipping teases of their budding romance.After reading some other Woodiwiss novels, I think the purple prose isn't that bad. It's still there, but it mostly just slows down the plot a little bit. I still loved the romance making love scenes in between the main characters and think that it was tastefully done."},{"Title":"Petals on the River","review":"I first read this book in 1998 when I was in middle school. Of course being young and naive, I thought this book was one of the best books I had ever read. It was perfectly cheesy and romantic with a very predictable plot.I kind of liked Shemaine a little, but now I find her just annoying. She was fiesty as a main character, but she felt a little Mary Sueish. Any character that hated her was treated as one of the worst people ever, and that they were given terrible treatment.I really liked Gage and Andrew's characters. Gage felt almost like a real person, and he was mostly just awesome as a father. Andrew, like two other minor characters, was far more likeable than most of the character cast. Some scenes between Shemaine, Gage and Andrew were so cute as a family.The main part of the plot felt like everyone was trying to drive Shemaine and Gage apart by rumors or by trying to kill Shemaine. Some parts of the plot felt like they were implausible or historical inaccurate, but overall the story flowed. Compared to other Woodiwiss novels, the plot wasn't very forced; however some parts of the plot were kind of forced."},{"Title":"Petals on the River","review":"I have read and re-read every one of K. Woodiwiss's novels. My favorites are Ashes in the Wind and A Rose in Winter. Petals on the River could have been almost as good as the rest of the books if the story had started with Shemaine and Maurice's engagement, then her abduction, imprisonment, then deportation to the American Colonies where she meets her true love, Gage. K.E.W.'s old writing style was a more complete long story about the hero and heroine's trials and tribulations, and that was definitely lacking here. Also, Shemaine's lack of an immediate apology to Maurice was rather cruel. He is treated almost as a villian instead of the man who was her former betrothed. K.E.W. needs to read her older books and return to that style of writing!"},{"Title":"Petals on the River","review":"I loved this book! The story was a sweet one, that didn't have so many emotional ups and downs that it makes it hard to believe. There was a lot of action and the combination of Shemaine, Gage, his son, a woman who's been after Gage for herself, Shemaine's fiance, her parents, Gage's father, and all the rest make it a very fun and light book to read."},{"Title":"Petals on the River","review":"A charming story about a widower who needs a nanny and a falsely accused convict fresh off the criminal boat who needs a purpose in life. The two come together as society requires, and the story line follows the development of their mutual love and respect, despite outside influences."},{"Title":"Petals on the River","review":"This is the first Kathleene Woodwiss book I've read and if any of her earlier books are half as good as &quot;Petals on the River&quot; I will certainly be reading them. From the first chapter I found it impossible to put this book down, you can relate to Gage &amp; Sheramine and understand the passion and love they feel for each other. Woodwiss makes you feel like you're inside the book from start to end and captivates you with her brilliant style of writing and story line. An excellent read and I would recommened it to anyone!"},{"Title":"Petals on the River","review":"Kathleene Woodiwiss needs the help of an English teacher! Kathleene's gramar is soooo poor that it makes the reading of any of her books, at best, difficult. There are too many dangling participles to count! And when a character says, &quot;I want for you to...&quot; it makes a reader CRINGE! Other than the poor grammar, the plot is nonexistent. The best thing about this book, and any other Woodiwiss book, was the cover illustration."},{"Title":"Petals on the River","review":"It's one of the greatest romances ever written. It has everyhting, action, romance, and comedy."},{"Title":"Petals on the River","review":"I have read all of Kathleen E. Woodiwiss novels, my favourite being 'the Wolf and the Dove'. She has since been my favourite author and I did buy every new book that came out here of hers. I was very excited when this book came out as I had been waiting for nearly two years over here for a new book! I read the summary of the story and thought it had great potential but was deeply disappointed in the end. The story turned out to be light fluff with no development of the main characters inner passions or personality. Has she lost the touch, I now wonder, and now will peruse the next book very carefully before buying. I hope the old passionate sparks come back soon!"},{"Title":"Petals on the River","review":"I've avidly awaited and read all of Kathleen's books. I saw sparks of the old intensity but was disappointed that &quot;Petals&quot; fell short of the standard that she has always exhibited. I found myself not really caring about Shemaine because I knew so little about her. The charaters that were developed the best were the supporting charaters. She made mention that this book was dedicated to and that Andy was patterened after her grandson. I expected a more developed charater in the little boy. Over all I would say that it was as average read but certainly not what I would expect from Kathleen Woodiwiss"},{"Title":"Petals on the River","review":"I really liked the enemies of Shemaine. In some of her other books, they lacked human qualities. They all seamed unreal to me. I really liked the way they were all potrayed in this book."},{"Title":"Petals on the River","review":"Very good romance novel from start to finish. Once you start reading it, it is hard to put it down to take a break. This book is very much equal to some of Mrs. Woodiwiss' earlier books such as Shanna and Ashes in the Wind. I enjoyed it thoroughly!!!!"},{"Title":"Petals on the River","review":"I have read every book that Kathleen Woodiwiss has written and have enjoyed every one of them. I enjoyed this story very much but I think the 'love making' was draged out. It seemed to go on for several chapters. The story line would have been just as good if those chapters were shorter. It is also interesting to me how quickly the innocent young maid leans exotic love making."},{"Title":"Petals on the River","review":"This was the first Woodiwiss book that I ever read. At the time, I was so surprised by the heartwarming story that it told and was spurred into reading more. I have now read all of the books that she has written and I can say with honesty that this is the best of all. If you like a story that will make you laugh, cry, scream, giggle, and just amke you feel good, then you must read this book. And as for those readers that think that this book was shallow and pathetic, here is my thought for you: get a life. This was a good book and if you were too dense to enjoy it, then I feel very sorry for you because you must have a very boring life!"},{"Title":"Petals on the River","review":"Kathleen Woodiwiss captures you from the first page. Here romances are what dreams are made of while still retaining a certain amount of innocence. Ms. Woodiwiss has spoiled me to any other writers, she can not be matched or beat. I anxiously look forward to her next work. The character Gage was just another in the long line of perfectly wonderful leading men in her novels."},{"Title":"Petals on the River","review":"I liked the book. The love scenes were a little brash, but the courting was fabulous. Where else than in a romantic novel could you find such beautiful people with such Energy and Love. I love K.W.'s style. Makes me long for yester-year when men actually courted women. I also liked meeting the pre-SHANNA characters. It's like visiting old friends."},{"Title":"Petals on the River","review":"In my opinion this book doesn't deserve 1 star. This book was so disappointing and often I doubted if Kathleen has written this book on her own."},{"Title":"Petals on the River","review":"I have been reading Woodiwiss since her first books, Flame and the Flower and Wolf and the Dove. I find her to be the very best of the genre and judge all other books by her. Her stories have substance and character and you find yourself actually involved with the characters so that you don't want the book to end. I find myself re-reading all her stories. This book was a little short of that. Although still highly readable and enjoyable I don't know it just didn't seem to be enough. However the characters were still likeable and I would recommend the book."},{"Title":"Petals on the River","review":"The author seems obsessed with the word &quot;orb&quot;. The character's eyes are referred to as orbs and the breasts are referred to as orbs!"},{"Title":"Petals on the River","review":"The last book so worthy my love left a lot to be desired. But I figured it was just a fluke and that her next book would be better. WRONG!! It was way too sappy. I wanted to strangle the characters. Every other sentence was &quot;I love you, my sweet.&quot; &quot;I love you too.&quot; Give me a break."},{"Title":"Petals on the River","review":"I want to add a mitigating word to all the negative reviews. I should go back and re-read one of the older books by Ms. Woodiwiss, because I'm wondering if the problem with this one is that it is written very much like a book that would have been published 15 or 20 years ago. I found it kind of refreshing, but it is definitely slow- paced compared to today's typical best-seller. Also, I think the whole &quot;women in capitivy&quot; theme has less appeal today."},{"Title":"Petals on the River","review":"If you're looking for a charming story with a hopelessly romantic happy ending: look no further. Gage, the bold and rather heartbroken hero, is almost perfect. And Shemaine...what can one say? You will cheer her on from your first meeting. She has class, spunk, kindness, and (as usual) outstanding beauty. While a rather small amount of dialouge is fairly unbelievable, and the plot is every ONCE in a while predictable (i.e. you don't have to think to read this book, hence the 8 not 10 ) this is a darling tale of love conquering all. And...if you read this book for no other purpose: the Beauchamps are back in it! The mystery of Garland's husband is solved...and you meet a pre-Shanna Raurk!"},{"Title":"Petals on the River","review":"This book was another one of my favourites from KEW. I have read allmost all of her books except for Shanna, Come Love a Stranger and Forever in Your Embrace. I hope to get these ones soon and read them because i never feel right unless i know i can slip into my bed at night and read one of KEW's books. I highly reccomend this book to read allong with THE Birmingham books and A Rose In The Wintertime."},{"Title":"Petals on the River","review":"I was terribly disappointed with this book. I'm surprised that KEW wrote it. I would highly recommend Shanna (named my daughter after it), A Rose in Winter, and The Wolf and the Dove - all of which are classics worth reading again and again. Kathleen E. Woodiwiss will always be my favorite romance novelist because of the outstanding quality of the aforementioned books. Skip Petals on the River, though. As much as I loved the other books, I hated this one. Really the worst romance novel I've ever read."},{"Title":"Petals on the River","review":"I don't understand how KW can write such classic material in most of her previous novels, then ruin the book by droning on and on with boring dialoge and settings. By that point, who cares about these otherwise memorable characters? This book, however didn't even get that far. It was totally boring, lifeless, if you will, which aggravated me as I'd waited a long time to read it."},{"Title":"Petals on the River","review":"This is the first Kathleen Woodiwiss book that I have read, and I can't believe the other reviews have been so negative. I really enjoyed it - both the first and the second time through! I can only look forward to her other books!"},{"Title":"Petals on the River","review":"This is the first Woodiwiss book I have read, and I am reading it a second time. A co-worker introduced me to this book. I got to feel for the characters, and they're like old friends to me already. I can't wait to read more!"},{"Title":"Petals on the River","review":"This is the first Woodiwiss book I've read and enjoyed to very much. A very good change from the ordinary romance novels. The charaters are believable and I like the fact that some of the family did like each other in the end. It is a change to see that the woman in the story can enjoy and like sex without being a &quot;slut&quot;. Can hardly wait to read another of Ms. Woodiwiss' novels."},{"Title":"Petals on the River","review":"I wish I could give this book 0 stars. This is the first Woodiwiss book that I absolutely could not finish. Neither could my mother, or a good friend of mine; both of whom are also big Woodiwiss fans.I can hardly believe this is by the same author who wrote The Wolf and the Dove, Shanna, etc. I am not a romance novel fan, but I have always enjoyed Kathleen Woodiwiss' books.This book was so boring and the characters so flat that I didn't even care what happened to them. I highly recommend that you skip this book, unless you just absolutely have to read everything this author writes."},{"Title":"Petals on the River","review":"I must say that I have been reading Woodiwiss books for over twelve years. I started with &quot;A Rose in Winter&quot; and this is not even in it's league. I am and always will be an avid fan of her books. I always look forward to her newest novel, though this one nearly put me to sleep at several points. It took three tries just to sit down and read the book. I had trouble getting past the first couple of chapters. I was expecting much more from this work than what I received. It was a pleasant story, though altogether too drab. The characters were pretty dull, not alot of life to them at all. Shemaine was too meek for her own good and far too afraid of her own shadow. I give this book an overall score of two stars because instead of a book which I couldn't put down, I received a book which I was loath to pick up!"},{"Title":"Petals on the River","review":"I found this book unusual for Kathleen. I have read all of her books at least twice...except this one. I could not even finish it. I know I am hard to please. I think &quot;Ashes in the Wind&quot; and &quot; The Flame and the Flower&quot; and &quot;So Worthy My Love&quot; are some of the best ever written!"},{"Title":"Petals on the River","review":"As others have mentioned, Woodiwiss' earlier books (Shanna, Ashes in the Wind, The Wolf and the Dove, The Flame &amp; The Flower and A Rose in Winter) keep me hoping for the rich and sensuous sagas we know her to be capable of. I think the problem is that Woodiwiss is deviating from an earlier and very successful formula - boy meets girl, something keeps them apart and heightens the tension-filled attraction between them, and then they truly and fully fall in love. It may sound hackneyed, but it works for those five mentioned, incredibly wonderful novels (although The Flame and the Flower would be the lowest rated on that list). At the end of Petals On the River, too many &quot;rich and powerful&quot; people started crowding things a bit too much, until it was like a circus. The characters in Woodiwiss' early work are not just physically beautiful, they have a complexity of emotions and motivations; Shemaine &amp; Gage could be engaging if Shemaine had a bit more fire and wasn't so &quot;saintly.&quot; I preferred Shanna's bitchiness and Alaina's rough &amp; tumble tomboy to such a smarmy miss. Gage, while no doubt physically perfect, could have been more masterly (Brandon Birmingham at his most wicked still oozed masterful appeal). All in all another disappointing work."},{"Title":"Petals on the River","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this long awaited story from Ms. Woodiwiss.

This one just lacked any character depth. I kept waiting for some drama, but it never developed."},{"Title":"Petals on the River","review":"The sex scenes. Honestly, has anyone ever experienced sex like this? Kathleen Woodwiss's graphic descriptions were nauseating, not because they were perverted, but because they were simply too unrealistic. In this book, the heroine is beautiful beyond belief, and our hero, Gage, is handsome beyond wildest imaginations. Boy meets girl, they fall in love, there's a threat to their love, they overcome it ho hum.......Sorry, but the author needs to GET REAL."},{"Title":"Petals on the River","review":"This book was good in the end; however, it took me a couple of months to read and I typically read a book in a couple of days!"},{"Title":"Petals on the River","review":"This is a romance rather typical of what we see more and more of nowadays- heroine befalls some ill-fortune, meets a hot hunk, gets married, and has lots of sex. The execution of events was excellent, though, and the characters a great improvement from THE FLAME AND THE FLOWER. I liked the heroine, spirited Shemaine, and Gage, the sensitive hero. Mary Margaret, a fiesty old widow who pops up now and again is funny and the interaction between characters is believable. I thoght it a bit of quirky humor that made Shemaine one of the most sought-after women in the colony and Gage one of the most sought-after man come together. Also, the book cover was in good taste, unlike some horrid ones I've seen. A good effort and story."},{"Title":"Petals on the River","review":"I enjoyed this book, couldn't put it down until I finished it.

I was shocked that someone who wrote A Rose In Winter and Ashes in the Wind could turn out such a crushing bore. I'm listening on cassette (which is well done, by the way), and it's better than the radio, but if I were reading the book, I would have set it aside unfinished long before now. I still reread A Rose in Winter. Where is the humor in this one? Ms Woodiwiss should read some Amanda Quick, and get her heriones back to being real people. Shemain is ridiculous. Good grief! I roll my eyes every time I hear how &quot;comely&quot; she is. BORING is the only word for this book. I wish I could get my money back. Not just because it was a bad book (you take your chances), but because I expected better. If I help anyone else save their money, it will be worth the time to write this review.

I have reread those two books at least once every year since written. DO YOU THINK MS. WOODIWISS READS OUR THOUGHTS? Please, I would like more stories like your first ones. I always enjoyed the way your words flowed almost like poetry. You could feel the love between the chacters and the sexual tension would build.

Thank you"},{"Title":"Petals on the River","review":"A student of mine recommended that I read Petals on a River. I didn't like the first 10 pages. It's what my female friends would call a &quot;chick&quot; novel. At any rate, after about the 10th page I became mesmerized by it. Woodiwiss' writing is so vivid, I forgot I was reading a book and felt more like I was watching a movie. For example, I found the description of the cuts, pain, and healing of the leg irons so vivid, pictures emerged in my head. I found much of the novel like that. Kathleen E. Woodiwiss creates pictures in my head."},{"Title":"Petals on the River","review":"This is definetly not one of her best, but I think it captures Kathleen's feel quite well. Her books are breathtaking, riveting, and fanciful, not excluding \\"Petals on the River\\". The characters are a bit two-dimensional and fake for my taste, but I was still intrigued. The plot line was different, considering the main characters were living in the same quarters from day one, and how she managed to keep them from making love until 3/4 of the way throughout the book is a phenomenon. Keep it up, Kathleen, I will always read your novels, whether they are one or five stars!"},{"Title":"Petals on the River","review":"Well, that's basically how I felt after finishing _Petals on the River_. The story was great, I loved the characters, and the setting was a nice change from England or Scotland. Although it was a well written book, towards the end, I was starting to get a little bored. But, this taste of Kathleen E. Woodiwiss is enough to have me looking for more. I started reading her books with _The Flame and the Flower_, and I will definitely be snatching up her books in the future.Shemaine O'Hearn had the perfect life. She was the daughter of a wealthy merchant, she came from a loving family, she was beautiful, and she was betrothed to the heartthrob of England. This all changed when the whim of an overjealous grandmother had her captured by a theive taker and carried to America on a convict boat. Shemaine knows that her life will never be the same, and all she can hope for is that a kind soul will take some pitty on her and that she will be sold into indentured servatude to a nice family or person.In the town of Newport Newes lives Gage Thorton, a man haunted by his past. A year ago, his wife died, leaving him with a son to take care of. And, even though Gage loved his wife dearly, there is supiscion in the town that he killed his lovely wife. So, when the convict ship, the London Pride, docks in the town's port, he is desperate for a nursemaid for his son, and maybe some company. As soon as he sees Shemaine, he knows that he must have her, no matter the cost. She can educate his son and provide him with some company.Shemaine is at first wary of her knew job, but soon settles into it nicely. Andrew, Gage's two year old son, is a complete doll, and Gage is the kindest, most handsome man she has ever met. The two get along famously, and a love blossoms between them. But, awful gossip and lies threaten to rip the two apart. Can they survive?Kathleen E. Woodiwiss is really a great author. Some people complain about her purple prose, but I think it makes her books fun to read, and it is easier to imagine the historical setting that way. Her use of adjectives really brought the book to life, and you have no trouble picturing the drama in you head. Gage and Shemaine were the type of heros and heroines that I love reading about. Yes, they were perfect, so what? The whole point of romance novels is to get lost in them and to wish that someday you could be like that too. It is nice to read about people who don't have to lather on makeup to look decent. Shemaine was the woman we would all like to be. She's kind, loving, and she has a spine. When she sees something that is not right, nothing can stop her from fixing it. Gage is the man we all want. He's handsome, understanding, and doesn't let his pride get in the way of telling the woman he loves how he feels. So, all in all, _Petals on the River_ is a book that you should take the time to read. Although it does get slow at times, you will be happy you read it after you finish it. I know I am."},{"Title":"Petals on the River","review":"Petals on the River was not a bad book but it was certainly not the best written by Kathleen E. Woodiwiss. The two main characters tend to gush over each other WAY too much and that gets really boring really fast but it had a semi-decent story to it. I would recommend reading the Flame and the Flower, A Rose in Winter and the Wolf and the Dove first. The stories are better and the characters aren't as annoying. Read this one after those only if you have nothing better to do."},{"Title":"Petals on the River","review":"Twenty-five years ago I was given The Flame and The Flower by Kathleen E. Woodiwiss...and I fell in love !!Such descriptive writing..you could almost be there. Each successive book was eagerly awaited, and Ms. Woodiwiss became my scale upon which all other authors were compared.Her new book, Petals on the River, has renewed my faith in this authors writing. She is back, and back on track with the style, the characters and the story line that all her true admirers will relate to. Shemaine and Gage are delicious characters, both caught in a situation that leads to interesting conclusions. Throughout the story there are elements of suspense, romance and humor. There is also a very enjoyable and surprising &quot;visit&quot; from characters from one of Ms.Woodiwiss' previous books. Do yourself a favor..READ THIS BOOK..it's terrific!"},{"Title":"Petals on the River","review":"This book is where I first noticed the decline in quality of writing good love stories by Ms. Woodiwiss. Purchase and read &quot;A Rose In Winter&quot; by Mrs. Woodiwiss to understand what I mean. &quot;A Rose In Winter&quot; had plausible characters(meaning for a story with historical setting it was believable-believable behavior and speech of the characters, AND it was just a great love story). &quot;Petals in the Whatever&quot; is not intrigueing. Reading about a widowed farm boy-WITH A KID- who purchases a SUPERMODEL as a bride who learns to be content to make the farm boy biscuits and gravy is a tough story to swallow, and it's boring."},{"Title":"Petals on the River","review":"I used to be a fairly loyal KW fan, but I won't take the chance that she'll write another book this bad. I couldn't finish this. The plot was unbelievably predictable and the heroine was so unbelievable perfect that I found her unbelievably boring."},{"Title":"Petals on the River","review":"It was hard to believe that this was a Woodiwiss book. I made it only half way through and gave up. I had just re-read &quot;Shanna&quot;, her very best book ever, and was expecting more from this author. Actually, the reason I did buy this book was because of one of the reviewers mentioning she re-introduced Ruark Beauchamp. The characters (not the Beauchamps) are uninteresting wimps, totalling boring! Save your money. I did not like this book at all. Not what you would expect from Kathleen Woodiwiss."},{"Title":"Petals on the River","review":"It is very rare that I can't finish a book, but I couldn't finish this one - it put me to sleep!

I thought that the story line was slow, and predictable. It was all I could do to finish it. This is the first book I've read by her, and doubt I will read another."},{"Title":"Petals on the River","review":"Kathleen Woodiwiss wrote some of the finest historical romances in the genre beginning in 1972 with her first, the Flame and the Flower, that sold over 2.5 million copies, but there was a period from 1984-2002 when what she wrote fell short of her own standard of excellence. Oh the writing is still good but sometimes the stories dragged a bit and the plot was not as exciting or as intriguing as the rest. I've listed her novels below with an \\"*\\" behind those I think are her best (and you can see my separate reviews of them).PETALS N THE RIVER falls into the \\"dark\\" period. It is an American Colonial romance that takes place in mid 18th century Virginia. It's the story of beautiful Irish lass, Shemaine O'Hearn, who was born to loving wealthy parents in England and who was betrothed to the Marquess Maurice du Mercer. Though Maurice loved Shemaine and was committed to being her husband, Maurice's grandmother did not want the Irish twit in their family genepool so she plotted to have the girl falsely arrested and thrown into Newgate prison without her family's knowledge. Faced with a choice of being a bond servant in the Colonies or possible rape in prison, Shemaine sets sail for Virginia with other prisoners. Once there she is \\"bought\\" by a widower, Gage Thornton, a prosperous cabinetmaker and hopeful shipbuilder who has need of a nursemaid for his young son, one who can teach the lad to read and write. He instantly sees that Shemaine is no ordinary prisoner. Soon Gage and Shemaine find they are attracted to each other and Shemaine, believing her betrothed has likely moved on, and knowing she faces 7 years of servanthood, agrees to wed Gage when he asks her. And they soon fall in love. But there are those who would see her dead, either out of jealousy or because they are in league with Maurice's grandmother who still seeks the girl's end. Several attempts are made on her life. Then one day her past catches up with her and folks start arriving from England.It's a sweet romance and there are no dramatic twists and turns, though there are a few altercations and narrow escapes. Gage is a man of character and a droolworthy hero. Shemaine was a bit too sweet and without apparent faults. Unlike some reviewers, I did not think the characters two dimensional. As usual, Woodiwiss paints a vivid picture of the world she has created. It is a very realistic portrait of life in the Colonies at the time and I found it believable. I just did not find the story compelling enough for more than 3 stars and that's a disappointment from such a master of historical romance.Here's the list of her novels so you can see where this one fits in. I've divided them into the Birmingham saga trilogy (omitting related short stories) and then in the single novels, I've drawn a line when I think the work went from 5 to 3 stars. Though I know some would disagree with me, I gave 4 and 1/2 stars to \\"Everlasting\\" as I really enjoyed it. Again, those with an \\"*\\" are her best.Birmingham Family Saga Series1.

This book is on my list of exceptional reads.As others has said yes it does get a little to descriptive at times but for anyone who knows the witting style of KEW it doesn't matter a bit that's what makes a book worthy of the time you spend reading it. KEW always takes the reader on a journey through time with her explosive descriptions she makes you feel that your are there in the colonies right along with Gage and ShemaineI loved this book for many reasons one being the author of the book she is by far my favorite and I love reading all her stories that she has written, second the characters are lovable the desire they are forced to abstain from was written well how two gorgeous people living together in close proximity was beyond me most books they would have already done the deed waiting til the right moment was a great additive it made the story a true love classic, thirdly the suspense of what really happened to Gage's first wife and the loose lips of the town gossips was worth the length of time it took to finally have the truth out and the culprits put to restI could go on with the reasons why I loved this book but I won't bore you with such a lengthy review but I will share one more thing this book is a Classic love story between two people who are so equally matched with the unending love in their hearts that they share with each other will have Shemaine and Gage etched in my memory for a long time to come"},{"Title":"Petals on the River","review":"What a wonderful story! A fell in love with Gage and Shemaine. I was enthralled from the first page until the last page with their story.Although some have given this book a bad review for one reason or the other, I have to say that the story was very vivid for me. I could picture little Andrew in my mind and completely fell in love with the little tyke. What a cutie!Another character that was \\"real\\" for me was Cain. I ended up crying for his fate and wished it had been different from what it turned out to be. In fact I kept saying to myself (or rather to the character)\\"Don't do it,\\" but of course the dye was already cast and his fate was sealed. I ended up crying.A wonderful story. There was also a surprise in this book that had me running to one of Woodiwiss's early books...Shanna. I wanted to be sure that the four Beauchamps mentioned later in the novel were the same ones that were in Shanna...They were! The characters mentioned?...Ruarke, Nathaniel, Gabrielle and Garland. So although this book was written 10 years AFTER Shanna, one could read this one first to be introduced to a younger and more carefree Ruarke."},{"Title":"Petals on the River","review":"I am a long time fan of Kathleen Woodiwiss.

I couldn't put it down once I started reading this book. I really liked the plot and characters. Woodiwiss kept me guessing until the end.

This was the first book I have read from her and I would definitely read more."},{"Title":"Petals on the River","review":"Kathleen Woodiweiss seems to believe that, despite the fact that this book has no plot development, if she simply puts in enough attempts on the life of her heroine the story will be exciting. Unfortunately, this isn't true. Instead, the story simply becomes preposterous. If that weren't enough, Woodiwiss' prose soon becomes painful. Not only is her sentence structure embarassingly incorrect, her language never rises above buzzwords and cliches. Nobody loves a child when they can &quot;nurture&quot; him, nobody talks when they can &quot;communicate&quot; and her attempts to give a colonial flavor to the language never rise above substituting 'tis for it's.

I think I would have rather kept waiting than settle for this book, which was very predictable with very little tension or suspense (romantic, sexual, or otherwise). I was originally pleased to see that the book came out as a more affordable trade paperback (rather than a hardcover) but $10 is too much to spend. I'd rather re-read The Flame and the Flower. In short, I was very disappointed in this novel. Frankly, when I finally reached the end, I found I didn't even care what happened to the characters."},{"Title":"Petals on the River","review":"I have always enjoyed reading Kathleen Woodiwiss's books. Unfortunately, I cannot say that about her latest, &quot;Petals on the River.&quot; I think what it lacks is sexual tension between the main characters, Shemaine and Gage. I believe sexual tension between the hero and heroine has been one of the primary forces of her books. In this story, there is practically none, and it takes over 300 pages before the main characters make love. I, too, have skipped over chunks of the book I found to be boring. And why did she wait until the last couple of chapters to introduce the Beauchamps? I believe they would have enlivened the book if they had appeared sooner."},{"Title":"Petals on the River","review":"Petals on the River is a beautiful love story fashioned as only Ms. Woodiwiss can.

I was waiting for her new novel to be published and I must say it is very disappointing. I still haven't finished the last 50 pages. I don't understand how such a gifted writer could have missed the mark. The characters were one dimensional and the story was very lame and predictable.

For the person who said that Shemaine was convictted of murder, did you not read the book? She was convicted of theivery!!!

This author has a way of pulling you in while you're wondering why you're still reading this drawn out and a little over the top story. Don't misunderstand me this was a really good book, but I swear if I'd heard Gage call Shemaine \\"bondslave\\" one more time I was going to scream in frustration. I had to keep reminding myself that back in those days women were not respected and they did have obey there husbands/owners. This novel was definitely a break in the whole routine of Lords, Dukes, Vampires, and Shapeshifters...

Some of the details are a little sketchy now, but I enjoyed this book. It is my first book by this author and I look forward to reading more of her works. (I don't understand the reasons for the one-star reviews.)The setting is in Virginia in the colonies prior to the Revolutionary War. Shermaine and Gage have good charisma as the heroine and hero. There is a fair amount of intrigue in this book from various people who depise Shermaine. Some of the hatred is unrealistic and questionable. After months of suffering cruelty on a prison ship (for a trumped-up charge), Shermaine finds a wonderful man and nice life in the backwoods of Virginia."},{"Title":"Petals on the River","review":"This book isn't remotely worth the high price tag. I would rather read a Harlequin Romance novel by Tara Taylor Quinn for romance, intrigue and above all a PLOT LINE! Kathleen, get back to your sweeping epics with heroic warriors and strong fiesty heroines! I still love &quot;A Rose In Winter&quot; and &quot;The Flame and The Flower&quot; but will borrow any future books from now on to save from bitter disappointment if this is your new style of writing."},{"Title":"Petals on the River","review":"I'm giving this book a 5, though I don't have a lot of &quot;romance novel&quot; experience to compare with. I bought my 1st romance novel on the recommendation of a friend. I had a preconceived notion of what they were like. Since then I've read 3 and I love them! What I like about this author is the romance, the courting, and the way she describes the seduction. It's not real smutty (like I expected)! I think I'm hooked on them now. I hope this might convince any other 'beginners' to give this author a try. I'm hesitant to add, but it's improved my own sex life - since romance is on my mind so often lately ;-)"},{"Title":"Petals on the River","review":"The love shared between the main characters is very touching.It doesn't start off very well but picks up later and turns out to be quite entertaining."},{"Title":"Petals on the River","review":"I have been listening to this book on cassette tape, and the only redeeming quality I could find about it is the narrator. How she managed to breathe life in Shermaine and Gage, I'll never know. But, alas, even the narrator's wonderful way of reading just couldn't get past the words! I found it to be boring and predictable. That is the last Kathleen Woodiwiss book I'll ever buy! Too bad...I loved her previous books."},{"Title":"Petals on the River","review":"Sorry to say, I have to agree with some of the other reviewers. I kept wondering through out the book if this was truly written by Kathleen or by someone else who may have found her notes. Doesn't seem to be Kathleen's style. What a shame if my thoughts are true. It would be a tragedy if someone was trying to fill Kathleen's shoes by writing her ideas, under her name. I hope it's not true. This book was never ending mushy. No action to speak of, no humor, NO EXCITEMENT. Bummer. Still I will keep my copy. I will continue to collect Kathleen's books. They are treasures I hope to pass on to my daughters and granddaughters. Especially the early ones. Thanks Kathleen, for your wonderful stories."},{"Title":"Petals on the River","review":"I have always loved Kathleen Woodiwiss and when I saw this I snapped it up and I have to say it was a waste of my time! This didn't even read like it was written by her. Very poorly written. It was like watching a bad B movie. Rather than letting the plot unfold in interesting ways the story teller has the characters telling the plot in excruciating detail. Felt like I was reading something written by a first-timmer. I will be cautious of here stuff in the future. If really want to read it - borrow it - don't waste good money on it!"},{"Title":"Petals on the River","review":"I believe that Woodiwiss fans are very spoiled by her excellent writing. Indeed, in the area of romance novels, no one can touch her. The only exception is her last two novels. I believe that it is time for Kathleen to begin to draw upon the incomparable excellence of her past novels. She has hinted at doing this with Petals On The River, by introducing the Beauchamps into the plot. However, it was too little and too late. This book had the potential to rank with the greats (i.e. Shanna, Ashes In The Wind, Flame and Flower, Wolf and Dove) had it been a little less &quot;predictable&quot;. Shemaine started off showing lots of spunk and was a ready reminder of past Woodiwiss heroines, however, she lost some of her bite after Gage &quot;purchased&quot; her. I got the feeling that Gage was just as bold as past heroes, but he really never was put in the position to prove this. Even though this book was not one of her great classics, she still holds her own with all other historical romance novelists. I eagerly await her next work of art and hope that she will return to her magnificent and thoroughly enchanting tales of delicate yet intense heroines and wonderfully gracious and honorable heroes all mixed together with suspense, exciting twists and unending humor."},{"Title":"Petals on the River","review":"I first read THE FLAME AND THE FLOWER in 1971. I was riveted from page one. THE WOLFE AND THE DOVE and SHANNA were also terrific and I've read them countless times. It seems she's gone downhill from there. The one about the Russian princess I didn't even finish. PETALS ON THE WIND has a lot of the same character types as FLAME but was not near as captivating. I kept thinking Roxanne was Louisa. The book is predictable, no real tension even though the main characters lived in the same house and don't make love until 3/4 through the book. She should also try to make her female characters a little more 3-dimensional and realistic. All her heroines lately are petite and the most gorgeous thing walking the face of the earth. No one should be THAT perfect even in literature. She used to be my favorite author, but not any more. Maybe I've outgrown her. (sigh!) I hope THE ELUSIVE FLAME with a grown up Beau will recapture her former glory!"},{"Title":"Petals on the River","review":"This is the first romance novel I have ever read and I thought it was great! I felt like I was right there in the book. I could very well relate to Shemaine. I really like the setting of the book because I live in the area that it took place in. I have been to the places that are mentioned in the book!"},{"Title":"Petals on the River","review":"This was the worst Woodiwiss I have ever read. I really enjoyed her first few novels, and was kept spellbound by them. I have not outgrown Woodiwiss, as I still occasionally re-read her older novels, and still enjoy them. This novel was severely lacking. To me, the characters were cardboard, the storyline very ho-hum. The publishers had to buy this one on name recognition alone. This is the second Woodiwiss I was sorely disappointed with, and has taught me to never again purchase a book of hers without at least reading the first chapter. If I would have done this, I would have saved my money! Doesn't her publisher have readers who pre-read these books before they decide to publish?? I think I will pack my copy up and send it back to them demanding a refund. Sorry Kathleen, but the price was steep and the quality was sorely lacking."},{"Title":"Petals on the River","review":"It was Wonderful! It made me go get my old Woodiwiss books and read them over...I really admire an author who can write a great romance without the use of money, betrayal or greed!!!! I've already read it twice...and some parts 3 or 4 times. Thank you, Kathleen...you ARE one of the elite!!"},{"Title":"Petals on the River","review":"Everybody who have read Shanna will inmediately fall in love with petals on the river. I think K. Woodiwiss is the BEST AUTHOR of these kind of novels, and I have read lots of them, please believe me, so I can say that it is a little jewel I didn't feel disapointed at all, but people who think that this book is no good perhaps should think first that she is a human being and can't create marvels like Shanna or Ashes in the wind every day. One more thing. I'm sorry for my English, I'm argentinian."},{"Title":"Petals on the River","review":"I some how missed this one when I was reading KW books years ago and was in the mood for a REAL romance. I wasn't disappointed. Yes, you can tell this was written years ago. But it is still a good one. Shemaine O'Hearn has been falsely accused of thief, put in prison, and sent by ship to the colonies to remove her from her prestigious fiance's life (inwhich his family didn't think she was good enough). She is sold as an indentured servant to the highest bidder - Gage Thornton, widow and local ship builder who needs a nanny for his toddler son. Rumors have it that Gage killed his wife by pushing her off his ship during a fit of rage due to an angry temper. But Shemaine can't imagine such after seeing him handle his son with love and her with respect and kindness. Desires begin to grow between Shemaine and Gage but they work at dealing with them honorably while a few in the community try to stir rumors up about their living conditions and her past. There is one in particularly that just knew Gage would turn to her to replace his deceased wife. Jealously strikes out between her and Shemaine. Then Shemaine's family show up from Scotland in search for her, along with her English fiance - but it is too late. Shemaine and Gage couldn't ignore feelings any longer and got married. Tempers flair and - by the way - just how did Gage's first wife really die? It was true Woodiwiss style of writing with romance and suspence (that, yes, you could probably guess at but was still good). I enjoyed it and felt the love between Shemaine and Gage. Yes, I recommend it!"},{"Title":"Petals on the River","review":"This is my first book by K.W. and it may be the last. There were some nice parts, but most times you felt like it was dragging on and on. And why the heck was everybody and their dog trying to kill Shemaine all the time? It became ridiculous after a while. The author could have easily shaved off 75 pages of worthless information."},{"Title":"Petals on the River","review":"instead of the gifted author. I was very disappointed in this latest book compared to earlier ones written. Everything was a little too perfect for the heroine Shemaine. She was just too perfect as a character. (I guess she wouldn't know what a bad hair day was...) The most believable scenes were ones that involved Gage's young son Andrew. Since she dedicated this book to her young grandson Seth then we at least understand why Andrew's words and behavior were realistic although predictable. The book left a bad taste in my mouth, everything fell together too neatly, as though it was wrapped up like a nice clean package. There was absolutely no suspense or guessing or tantalizing chemistry and sex scenes between the characters. I had a hard time visualizing the characters and if that happens it is a sign that the book isn't worth the read. A huge disappointment when compared to what I feel to be her best book &quot;A Rose in Winter&quot;."},{"Title":"Petals on the River","review":"I LOVED IT- This is one of my favorite books- I just love Kathleen Woodwiss' point of writing. She really gives you a visual image of what the characters and book is about. Very realistic and it is worth the buy. My favorite altime book so far that I have read is Kathleen's book &#34;Shanna&#34; (which I give 10) but this book I would give a 9."},{"Title":"Petals on the River","review":"I just love this author! I've read all of her books and they never seem to disappoint. If you like historical romance with accurate details, a torrid romance, and a book that you just can't put down, you will love Petals on the River."},{"Title":"Petals on the River","review":"A good solid read. A little drawn out at the beginning, but it moves along nicely after that. I recommend."},{"Title":"Petals on the River","review":"This is a great book - have everyone by her. I know that there will never be anymore books by her but the are great."},{"Title":"Petals on the River","review":"This was the second of Katleen Woodiwiss book that I found and read. I really loved this one as well. It was sort of bittersweet because *spoiler alert* her fiance that she was torn away from sailed all over to find her and when he did she was married with a baby on the way but I still loved it because she was in love with the man that essentially saved her from her fate. But you can't help but feel for the \\"other guy\\" and wonder what could have been. Great story with lots of action. You will not be disappointed by this one. Trust. This is another one of her books that will have you reading it over and over. :)"},{"Title":"Petals on the River","review":"Loved it from beginning to end. Beautiful characters and wonderful settings. It's easy to be carried away in this story."},{"Title":"Petals on the River","review":"I've read one book before by Woodiwiss, one that was really good, so when I started this I was expecting good romance. Wrong! The plot was too predictable, the characters too boring, and the book itself too long. I didn't believe that I could finish it, but I guess that miracles do happen once in awhile.I think the book might have been a little better if the author had started the story with Shemaine's arrest in England, rather then her arrival in the colonies. That may have developed her as a character and brought us more into her frame of mind. I must say that I couldn't understand while the townspeople were so against Shemaine. Indentured servants were a huge part of colonial population, that it was not uncommon to any colony in America. This was not new, so the people in the book shouldn't have been so against it. They didn't seem to mind the other servants that came in on the ship. So, in short, certain things were just not believable, making it harder and harder to keep going. This review is too long for a bad book. Don't read this! Read \\"The Wolf and the Dove\\" by Woodiwiss instead."},{"Title":"Songs and Prayers from Taize: Accompaniment Edition for Cantor & Instruments","review":"When I was searching for Taize materials, I was frustrated by not being able to see what songs were included in this book so I decided to list them for others to see once I got my copy. Everything on the CD of the same name will be in here as well as several others. There are a total of 50 songs with hymn-like piano parts. Many also contain brass quartets, flute parts or verses for cantors to sing, etc. The listing below includes alternate names in other languages, for example Ubi Caritas and Live in Charity are the same song. I hope this will be helpful to others. I highly recommend this to anyone interested in playing or leading Taize songs.Adoramus te ChristeAdoramus te DomineAdoremus te Jesu ChristeAlleluia 4Alleluia 7Alleluia 11BenedictusBleibet hierBleib mit deiner GnadeBlessing and praiseBless the LordBonum est confidereBy nightBy your crossCantate DominoChrist JesusCome and fillCome and pray in usConfitemini DominoCrucem tuamDans nos obscuritesDa pacem cordiumDe noche iremosDomine DeusDona nobis pacemEl SenyorGive peaceGive us your peaceGloria 3Gloria tibi DomineGlory be to youGlory to GodGospodiHoly is the name of GodHoly Spirit, come to usHoly Spirit, loving SpiritIn God aloneIn the LordIn the Lord rejoicingIt is good to trustJubilate DelJubilate, seviteKyrie 1Kyrie 10Kyrie 13La tenebreLaudate DominumLaudate omnes gentesLet us praise your NameLive in charityLord of all goodnessMagnificat (canon)Magnificat (chorale)Mon ame se reposeMy soul is at restNada se turbeNothing can troubleO Christe Domine JesuO Lord, hear my prayerO Lord, your crossOstende nobisOur darknessPer crucemPsallite DeoRaise a song of gladnessSanctum nomen DominiShow us your mercySing out my soul (canon)Sing out my soul (chorale)Sing, praise and bless the LordSing praisesSing praises to the LordSpirit of Christ JesusSpiritus Jesus ChristiStay with meStay with usThe Lord is my lightThe LOrd is my songThis is the dayUbi caritasVeni Creator SpiritusVeni Sancte SpiritusVieni, Spirito CreatoreWait for the LordWe adore you, Jesus ChristWe adore you, Lord Jesus ChristWhen the night becomes darkWithin our darkest night"},{"Title":"Songs and Prayers from Taize: Accompaniment Edition for Cantor & Instruments","review":"This book accompanies the smaller paperback version of the same title, which is the book the people attending a Taize service would be using. It contains wonderful accompaniments to the songs in the smaller books, and these aren't just for paino, but also for flute, violin, recorders, oboe, clarinet, etc. The accompaniments for each song vary, but there is always a piano accompaniment and almost always a flute accompaniment. Two songs have a recorder duet accompaniment and a few have flute duet accompaniments. These accompanimnets are beautifully written and truly add to the worshipful atmosphere created by the simple beauty of the songs as they are sung. There are many cantor parts included as well, which are also beautiful. The words the cantor sings are often additional verses that are not in the people's book."},{"Title":"Songs and Prayers from Taize: Accompaniment Edition for Cantor & Instruments","review":"If you are serious about using Taize chants as prayer responses in your worship services (how we got started), or as the basis of entire services of worship,prayer, and healing, this is the book you want. Music for C-Instruments (recorders, oboe, flute, violin, cello) is all interchangeable, and B-flat trumpet music can be used for any B-flat instrument(clarinet,etc.) The keyboard accompaniment is basic, and can be used by musicians to help create different accompaniments for harp, autoharp, guitar, lute, etc. Chord names are also given that help your more advanced musicians create parts of their own. A marvelous resource; a must-have for doing this music at any level."},{"Title":"Songs and Prayers from Taize: Accompaniment Edition for Cantor & Instruments","review":"OK - I say this is one of the best Taize books because I'm not only a singer, but also a pianist, guitarist, harmonist, percussionist, improvisationalist, etc, and yes -- I do read music. I appreciate that this book has a *very* good balance of elements for musicians of different persuasions (although not so much for percussionists).What I especially like about this book is that it has a good variety of Taize songs set out clearly in melody, chords, and parts for other instruments (or descant/cantor/etc.)What I DON'T like, however, is that some of the \\"other\\" parts, for example Cantor verses, do not have the chords listed above them; only the melodic lines themselves.While this may be just fine if you have a sizable choir plus dedicated Cantor and instrumentalists -- and then everyone can just look at their own individual part -- in a small church like mine (where I'm the Cantor + Director of Music + pianist), it would be helpful for me to have at least some chordal hint as to the accompaniment printed along with the Cantor (or other) part. Not a huge deal, as I can write in the chords and still achieve my needed goal, but it would be nice if it had already been anticipated, and provided, in this particular publication.But, overall, this is the best Taize book I've seen so far, for my somewhat multi-faceted needs. So, I still give it five stars. (Partly because 4-1/2 stars wasn't a choice from Amazon!)"},{"Title":"Songs and Prayers from Taize: Accompaniment Edition for Cantor & Instruments","review":"This is the good book for Taize songs lovers.

This book covers the German fighter groups assigned to defend Germany from the British and American bombers. By 1944 the numbers of bombers had grown significantly from the early days. At the same time, the long ranged P-51's were now available in quantity as well.Germany was now using the FW-190's in the earlier A models and the later inline engined D models. Their pilots were told to ignore the fighters and attack the bombers. Following orders, the German pilots attacked the bombers and were shot down by the fighters who soon learned that they were relatively safe from attack.Then in the middle of 1944 came the invasion and a new set of problems as the allies were quick to build fighter strips in France and brought over huge numbers of planes.As with the other books in this series, this book is mostly photographs and drawings of the planes used by the various German units on the western front. A considerable amount of research went into determining the actual colors, markings, and other details of aircraft used by individual units.Two points jumped out at me as I read the book. First, at the beginning of the book some aircraft are shown being towed around the airfield by trucks. By the end of the book aircraft are being towed around by oxen, reflecting the extreme measures being taken to conserve fuel. Second, as the east and west fronts got closer, a number of eastern front aircraft are shown where the pilot deliberately flew to the west and surrendered to the Allies.If aircraft color schemes are of interest to you, this book will be invaluable. If you are merely interested in the history of the Germans defending on the western front, the photographs shown here present a story themselves that would be an excellent accompanyment to any written story."},{"Title":"Jagdwaffe Vol 5 Section 3: Defending the Reich 1944-45 (Luftwaffe Colours)","review":"Robert Forsyth wraps up the Luftwaffe Colours series with this volume covering the desperate air combats fought in 1944 and '45 over the Reich. As with the other volumes in the series, a comprehensive text is combined with dozens of photos, including rare color shots, and Tom Tullis' marvelous profiles.Forsyth's book makes for compelling reading as Luftwaffe units are steadily ground down by Allied airpower. Ill-served by their leader Goring, the various Jagdgeschwaders kept flying and dying till the last days of the Reich. Despite improved aircraft like the FW 190D and development of new tactics such as the Sturmgruppen assault units, the steady loss of Experten coupled with shrinking fuel reserves doomed German air defense operations.All in all, a very readable summary of the dying days of the Luftwaffe and a treasure trove of photos and artwork. Luftwaffe fans will want this book. Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Jagdwaffe Vol 5 Section 3: Defending the Reich 1944-45 (Luftwaffe Colours)","review":"In the same series, I bought \\"war in the east\\" which I found a bit disappointing in term of original documents. The nature of the conflict in the East may not have helped to gather that many first hand pictures.This volume on the contrary has a wealth of interesting photographies and the corresponding color profiles. It makes this volume of particular interest to the collector and aircraft hunter.Without being over enthusiastic about the book (I am more a mid level \\"enthusiast\\" looking for plenty of color profile) I find this book a good source to place me in a friendly way at an advanced level in luftwaffe history, and I am grateful for this because it does it totally painlessly."},{"Title":"Jagdwaffe Vol 5 Section 3: Defending the Reich 1944-45 (Luftwaffe Colours)","review":"This is one of the wonderful Jagdwaffe series, published by Classic Publications. In a large thin format, these books have a nice balance of history and high quality color profiles with extensive notes on camouflage schemes. This book is profuse with details of Luftwaffe operations in 1944-45 pertaining to the fighter arm. Details of operations and personnel are handled concisely and well. The reader will find good coverage of the Sturmgruppen, and most of the color profiles are of Focke-Wulf products, including Dora 9s and Ta-152s. The Me-109 fan will find sparse coverage in this volume.

His work is always entertaining and I appreciate how he brings his characters to life. Bob is an evil troll, no two ways about it, and it's hard to find any sympathy for him when everything unravels. On the other hand, it's easy to laugh when divine justice serves him up a plate of just desserts. Definitely worth the time to read!"},{"Title":"The Man Who Loved Working Women: A Screenplay","review":"This work offers a suspenseful yet funny look at the dangers involved with relationships and secret keeping. Lindsay has painted a humorous picture of Bob Hule's chaotic and topsy-turvy love life, and the walls and barriers that it presents him and others with.

Playboy Bob finds himself in quite a predicament when the all three women in his life decide to pay him a visit the same day. Confessions spill and the tension builds as the women realize they've been caught in a web of womanizing lies. I was especially entertained by Bob's downward spiral and Lucy's voyeuristic tendencies. This play encompasses a type of adolescent humour that made me giggle like a schoolgirl. However, it sadly reminded me that there are three men in my life just like Bob. I actually feel sorry for them sometimes, but not Bob. He deserves what's coming to him."},{"Title":"The Man Who Loved Working Women: A Screenplay","review":"I should have done this ages ago, the first time I read it. Alas, I did not, and now I've read it again I've remembered to pay homage to it. It pleases me to see that a local writer can produce works such as this. I have to say that I first read this as a comparison of what local authors were producing, and am pleased that the calibre of the writing is comparable to the range of professionals that it is. I was a fan of the stageplay, and am glad that this version has lost nothing from the original. It has all the enjoyable parts one would expect and Chris Lindsay also creates a compelling conflict to be resolved in here.

I checked page 33, and it's still true!"},{"Title":"How To Photograph Landscapes (How To Photograph Series)","review":"The author covers the necessary subjects of composition, lighting, exposure, equipment, and other items specific to landscape photography. My complaint with the book is with the photos. Mr. Lange makes extensive use of an enhancing filter, and I quickly became tired of looking at the world through rose colored glasses. The objective though, is to be able to make the photographs come out the way YOU want them to look, and this book can help you learn that. The book is definitely a good purchase, if only for the expertise that the author shares with the reader. For me the book paid for itself within the first few pages though, as I learned to save the cost of purchasing an enhancing filter."},{"Title":"How To Photograph Landscapes (How To Photograph Series)","review":"Joseph Lange did a wonderful job with this book. He explained the techniques as well as the equipment used to make the pictures that illustrate this book. Knowing what filters were used to get the picture is helpful if you want to do some experimenting of your own. The only thing I sort of disagreed with was the &quot;shoulds&quot; and &quot;shouldn'ts&quot; that the author used. For example, the author mentions that arches should ALWAYS have some sky appear below them so that they look more impressive. I believe that the picture should be an expression of how the photographer wants the image to appear and if that means photographing a subject differently, then so be it.Other than that, it's a very good book to read in order to find some good techniques."},{"Title":"How To Photograph Landscapes (How To Photograph Series)","review":"I purchased this book while in Wyoming when I first started taking Landscape Photos, and this book gives you more information then most College level books, I have taken some great photos using Mr Lange Book and if you want to take some great shots I would suggest purchasing it for your libary."},{"Title":"How To Photograph Landscapes (How To Photograph Series)","review":"Sure, go ahead, stack a polarizer and enhancer on. Why not an 81B and a UV/haze as well? Maybe Mars looks like this but not Earth! There are situations in which A single filter is appropriate, but rarely together, and CERTAINLY not on every single shot.An annoying experience.Check out any book by the late Galen Rowell or by any member of the Muench family or John Fielder.

The author uses film only, but the concepts on composition - the major parts of the book - are applicable to either film or digital. I especially appreciated his 25 page section on \\"Specific Techniques for Different Landscapes\\" which included mountains, waterfalls, streams, oceanscapes, thermal areas, celestial patterns, etc. The author lives in CO and shoots on the CO Plateau. He shares his tips of where to go and when; so, for residents of the area, as I am, or those planning a vacation there, the book is a useful resource."},{"Title":"How To Photograph Landscapes (How To Photograph Series)","review":"I first saw this book in the Visitor Center of White Sands National Monument, NM. After some quick pages, I determine to buy it since most scenes are national-park-related. I've been there and would like to see how author photography, or feel about these places. Fortunately, I can use $1.99 to buy a used one in Amazon after that trip and this is one of mt best decisions.I agree with some of the reviewers that I am kind of tired of so many red-planet like photos in this book after I've finished a certain amount of pages. But then I realize I don't need to copy his enhancing/polarizing style. He also provides very helpful guidelines and non-camera information and knowledge. with these, you can get good photos with your own style. In addition, not using digital SLR may be another reason. Some of the technical parts in this book becomes more flexible by the digital darkroom. So I regard those red-planet like photos as his love in Colorado Plateau rather than show-off ones. And I find it more helpful to see these photos using artist's view, not scientist's view.In addition to learning practical and useful stuff from this book, I also confirm something I regard important but not so addressed in other landscape photography books. Perhaps I've been most of the scenes illustrated in this book. I get better and deeper comprehension about the common knowledge such as composition, lighting and exposure. They are just vivid to me.I can feel the author is a photographer with strong personal style. I can also feel he writes this book with passion (or maybe complaints since he was in freezing cold weather thousand times waiting for the correct condition to get a shot). For example, he said it clearly that he shoots for beauty, not reality. I guess in the photography society, people either love him or hate him, like New York Yankees.This book is to inspire every one to develop his own personal style. So don't be bothered by those red-planet like photos or enhancing/polarizing filters. I won't shoot those scenes in his way. But I know I have some habits to shoot certain scenes in a certain not-so-realistic way. I don't know if this is the artist's way but I have more confidence to do it this way after reading this book.It's so sad that previous review on this book is almost 4 years before. I really think this is a good book regardless of my $1.99 bargain.One thing I don't like about this book is lack of the index. So I can't find the exact words he used in this book as the ending of this review. The meaning is:Althought certain scenes do require specific techniques to get the shot, usually, the most difficult is to find the scene."},{"Title":"How To Photograph Landscapes (How To Photograph Series)","review":"This is a great book to teach basic and intermediate tips for landscape photography.

Mark Brandon Read (Chopper) is a highlyintelligent witty man who had a who had one hell of an up bringing - developed a hatred for bullies and became one of the the most dangerous men alive (If you are a low life). This book was written at a time when Mark had nothing to lose. He takes you on a journey to the dark side of the underworld and Prison Life. He is like a friend showing you the way the world really is. This is quite a journey - You will not be the same after it. You will gain a respect and understanding of people different from yourself which will make you a better person."},{"Title":"Chopper from the inside: Confessions of the Australian Underworld's Most Feared Headhunter, Mark Brandon Read","review":"If you have just stumbled upon this book, you might be interested to know that there is now a movie about \\"Chopper\\" Reade, which is what got me to buy this book. Frankly, as between the book and the movie, I prefered the movie but that was entertainment afterall, and this is reality, presumably. 'Chopper, From the Inside' is the autobiographical reminiscences of one of Australia's most notorious criminals. This book actually helped to make Mr. Reade into something of a celebrity if not quite a hero in his native land. One may ask oneself how a sociopathic brute of a man with decidededly homicidal tendencies could attain such status? Well, I suppose that it helps that Mr. Reade has both the talent for telling a good story and a well-developed if dark sense of humor. It helps too that the war Chopper wages is primarily directed at other members of the criminal world and the flotsam and jetsam that float into and out of this world. In other words, he seems perfectly harmless so long as you, personally, don't cross him. In addition, if he is to be believed, he is loyal to a fault, a romantic when it comes to the honor of his mates and lady friends, and just generally the type of fellow you would want around if it ever came to a bit of bother. This isn't the kind of book that one walks away from with deep insights into the humanity that lies within all of us. Rather, it is a well told tale of murder, mayhem, casual violence, friendship, loyalty, love, and honor, by and about a fellow who knows better. It is this knowing better, that helps to explain why even when his activities go beyond the pale, the depravity seems logical and, in this protagonist's queer world, somehow fitting. This book was an interesting read, but not quite good enough for me to pay full retail for the second installment of his story, if that tells you anything."},{"Title":"Chopper from the inside: Confessions of the Australian Underworld's Most Feared Headhunter, Mark Brandon Read","review":"Mark &quot;Chopper&quot; Read, Austrailia's most Notorious Criminal Character!

Of course this is what he wants us to believe. In reality, he is a murderous thug with delusional albeit grand ideals.This book can be read on many levels. As readers, however, we are positioned from the outset to see the book in a particular way: \\"From a civilized view, Read is a monster. The question is: What made him like that? Was he born or made that way? These are interesting points to ponder.\\" After reading these lines from the editors, apart from the anemic nature/nurture theory they propose we ponder, I couldn't help returning to the word \\"civilized\\". As a so-called civilization, we are conditioned to see violence as something separate, an aspect of ourselves that is somehow unnatural, but can be unleashed when it suits us. As Read says in his book, \\"Posh people love gangters.\\" What I find curious is Chopper (with a little marketing help) has positioned himself squarley in this tradition; and has made the image fit firmly in Australian popular culture.In a way this book is a paradox: on the one hand it exalts violence to romantic proportions, then, weakly, condems it. \\"Don't do as I do, do as I say.\\" \\"Don't live a life of extreme violence and crime like me, kids, but aren't I a really cool gangster?\\" Dangerous.For those of you who would like to gain greater insight into Melbourne's underworld and prisons, then this book is for you. If you're the kind of person who enjoys graphic violence in the extreme, buy and read this book.Otherwise, skip it."},{"Title":"Ghosts of the Abyss: A Journey Into The Heart of the Titanic","review":"Decent enough, but it's too much to imagine it being considered an indispensible Titanic book that one would want to own anymore, especially as it's already nearly a decade since it was originally published. Unfortunately, one noteworthy omission involving this new collaboration between James Cameron and Ken Marschall to point out is that there is NO new artwork from Ken Marschall included in this edition, even though he accompanied the 2001 expedition and made a number of dives to the wreck site. Whats more, new discoveries involving the breakup of Titanic as it was sinking have since been made involving another later expedition to the Titanic in 2005 as presented in the History Channel video entitled, \\"Titanic's Final Moments: Missing Pieces\\". This new information is obviously not addressed one way or the other in Cameron's 2001 expedition. Overall, I'd consider this a good book to perhaps want to borrow or to browse through once or twice, but not necessarily one that's good enough to want to own."},{"Title":"Ghosts of the Abyss: A Journey Into The Heart of the Titanic","review":"Hats off the Don Lynch, Ken Marschall, and James Cameron for once again taking those of us that love this ship, back to the Titanic.This book is not only beautifully written and documented, the photos are above par.If you are a Titanic fan...you must own this book!!Best Regards,Geoffrey Bennett"},{"Title":"Ghosts of the Abyss: A Journey Into The Heart of the Titanic","review":"This book is an excellent tribute to those who designed,built and sailed on the world's most famous ship. It is also a fine tribute to those who sacrificed so much to find the ship laying on the ocean floor,at a depth of 2 1/2 miles below the surface,375 miles SE of Newfoundland,and 1,000 miles due East of Boston; and bringing back to us, in unimaginable detail ,how this magnificient ship, in all her splendor, looks today in her final resting place.For many decades ,there was wild speculation of how the ship would look after so many years under such great pressures and even if she could ever be found. All that speculation has been resolved,thanks to the efforts of these determined and talented people.Not only have they found her,visited her,returned with fantastic photographs;but have also done a superb job of sharing it with us through Motion Pictures,Documentries, beautiful,haunting and imaginative drawings and keepsakes such as this dazzling book.Where this book shines is that it shows what things originally looked like ,using actual pictures at the time;and then showing what they look like now,after over 90 years of ravages by time and elements.While the photos alone would make this an exiquisite volume,the text covers much information on the ship,how events unfolded and why things happened the way they did.The painting by artist Ken Marschall of the Titanic, majestically forging ahead ;while she is being fatally ripped open by the iceberg shows the spirit of man against all odds of nature;and even though man is often set back,he refuses to be defeated. This scene in History is reminiscent of the spectacular explosion and loss of life with the Challenger Spaceship.We all owe a gerat debt of gratitude to the artists who portray images such as Marschall and who have the imagination and talent to paint such a picture as is on page 35, showing the Titanic breaking up,the many unfortunate passengers and crew heading with the ship to their watery graves;while a few fortunate are saved.The lifeboat with its few survivors ,where the artist shows that while some look on,others can't even bear to watch.While photographers can produce excellent images of events,if they get the opportunity;it takes an artist to record events like this.The book is dedicated to those who perished on April,15,1912,and on September 11, 2001. As the world watched the events of 9/11,the crew who gave us the scenes in this wonderful book,were actually at sea ,diving on the Titanic.We need books like this to remind us of the hopes, struggles and endurance of Man against both the forces of Nanure ,as with the Titanic and and the Evils of Man, as we saw on 9/11."},{"Title":"Ghosts of the Abyss: A Journey Into The Heart of the Titanic","review":"This book is by far the best written about the wreck since Ballard's \\"The Discovery of the Titanic\\".

Its not just history but of the crew of the deep sea submarine. The Titanic always captures ones imagination. This book shows the wear, and tear that nature is bringing the wreck of the Titanic. Its sad how much has changed since her discovery by Bob Ballard. The book goes into depth through pictures, and artwork of famed painter Ken Marschall. What is happening to the liner is awful.

Incredible pictures of inside staterooms, the reception room, wireless room, landing vestibules, the Dining Room, Cpt Smith's bathroom and other rooms deep withing the wreck of the broken ship.Some sheer horror will also be met with pictures of the boat deck collapsing slowly into A deck; a testament to the power of age.The only downside to the book is there is not enough photos of inside the wreck - you really just want MORE."},{"Title":"Ghosts of the Abyss: A Journey Into The Heart of the Titanic","review":"That Don Lynch and Ken Marschall have produced yet another great Titanic title is not a surprise but the beauty of this volume surpasses any book on the subject previously published and the sensitive approach the authors take is matchless. The incredible undersea photos, culled from James Cameron's 2001 expedition, are at once stunning and disturbing, revealing the unexpected, illuminating not only the life of this once proud vessel but the lives of the men, women and children who sailed on and were lost with her. Titanic has in fact never been seen in such an intimate, immediate way.The text is Don Lynch at his story-telling finest. His comparison of the 1912 sinking to the disaster of September 11, which occured while the Cameron dive was in full swing, is especially powerful.This book is likely the best that will ever be published on Titanic as she is today - alone, rusted and dead on a seabed, yet wonderfully alive, lost but fantastically found, inhabitated now only by ocean life and, yes, as one is convinced from the extraordinary images, by a great many ghosts."},{"Title":"Ghosts of the Abyss: A Journey Into The Heart of the Titanic","review":"Since its seabed location in 1985, the Titanic has been explored and photographed extensively, culminating in many books flooding the market. The Titanic community relishes these volumes, and yet these books offer little fresh material into the wreck whose untimely demise has fascinated millions around the work.Enter James Cameron. In 2001, he and his expedition team, along with unequalled historians Don Lynch and Ken Marschall, sought to bring the story of Titanic to the reader in a way that had not been accomplished with satisfaction. With his high-tech 'bots', Cameron and his expedition explored the deepest caverns of the Titanic, creating an awesome photo record of the ship's interiors, as well a visual update of the sad decay that is consuming the once-great ship.What the reader will discover is nothing short of awesome in this book - a combination of 'then-and-now' photos, computer-generated recreations of rooms based on the team's discoveries, and items explored and photographed that would not have been known to exist on Titanic otherwise. The talents of James Cameron, with his tenacity, Ken Marschall with his knowledge and artistic expertise, and Don Lynch, knowing the personal tales behind the death of White Star Line's legend, come together in this book that will be difficult to surpass.The only way to improve upon this offering is to add more pages of the wreck's interior."},{"Title":"Ghosts of the Abyss: A Journey Into The Heart of the Titanic","review":"While not a very big book at just 143 pages this is one of the nicer Titanic books I've seen. Dedicated to both those who died during the sinking and those who died September 11, 2001 (while the film project was underway)the fist chapter gives a quick but detailed history of the Titanic folowed by several chapters devoted to the crew's exploration and filming of the shipwreck and it's aftermath.I really liked the photos of the wreck as it is now, especially when compared with similar period photos, and the computer graphic reconstructions were amazing. Many of the photographs seemed very familiar, I was surprised to see so many of things that had somehow survive breaking and kind o depressed to see the signs of collapse that the wreck is now going through.I sure wish I could've seen the movie, hope it comes out on video soon and I'd like to see much more work of this type doen before it's too late."},{"Title":"Ghosts of the Abyss: A Journey Into The Heart of the Titanic","review":"In 'Ghosts of the Abyss', Ken Marschall and Don Lynch have done what the Titanic community has invisioned for years and compiled a photographic record of views from inside the Titanic wreck. The images of the Titanic's interiors are truly amazing and lay reference to the beauty of the ship's former glory. Views of the Reception and Dining Room, as well as several first class staterooms give a truly passionate and humane view of the Titanic. Never before has the ship been reached on such a personal level. Nothing like this has ever been seen before, it is truly an incredible achievement of a book and a must have. My congragulations go out to the authors, Mr. Marschall and Mr. Lynch, with thanks to James Cameron. Well done!"},{"Title":"Ghosts of the Abyss: A Journey Into The Heart of the Titanic","review":"This book is a must for any TITANIC collector.

Their obvious love and dedication for the subject matter shines through on every page. The publishers are also to be commended for the fine job of assembling this lovely book. While there may be less and less to see of the TITANIC with every passing year, it's apparent that her lessons and legacy will go on forever."},{"Title":"Ghosts of the Abyss: A Journey Into The Heart of the Titanic","review":"I just finished reading my copy of Ghosts of the Abyss, and as I expected, this book did not disappoint. the book is a tie in to the cinamatic release of the James Cameron documentary Ghosts of the Abyss which showcases the August to Septemeber 2001 expedition to the Titanic. As it happens, this is the most thorough internal survey of the wreck of the Titanic accomplished by anyone, and the wealth of information recovered has had the community of Titanic researchers...particularly the &quot;techies&quot;...talking ever since.Anyone who picks up this book will soon see why.This is not just another recounting of the Titanic saga, but a photographic documentation of what the saw inside the broken wreckage of the ship. From the present condition of the light fixture dangling above the Grand Staircase stairwell first seen by Dr. Ballard's expedition in 1986 (It's still there.) to the photos of spaces seen by no living human since 1912. This work also documents the on going decay of the ship which is clearly accelerating and has been for some time.The vivid and sharp photography includes, to name a few, the Marconi Room, the Reception Room on D deck, and crews quarters, the collapsing shell of the gymnasium, the promanade deck, and is accompanied by period photographs which show how these and other rooms would have looked like in happier times. There are also some CGI recreations of the Grand Staircase and the Marconi room. It also explores spaces that were far from the public eye even in 1912. Page 126 for example has the only photograph I've ever seen of the circular staircase which led down to the Firemen's Tunnel, and which made it possible for the firemen to get to and from the boiler rooms without having to transit through passenger and crew spaces. A feature unique to the three Olympic class liners.To go along with all of this are the expert commentaries of the authors, both of whom are well known and respected authorities on the Titanic. With hundreds of books out on the subject, there are few that I would ever call a &quot;must have&quot;Ghosts of the Abyss are one of those few that anyone serious about the Titanic needs to have on available on their bookshelves. There's information to be had here that simply cannot be has anywhere else."},{"Title":"Ghosts of the Abyss: A Journey Into The Heart of the Titanic","review":"\\"Ghosts of the Abyss\\" features a collection of the greatest Titanic Wreck images to date. Cameron has wandered into areas of the ship inquiring minds like my own have often wondered about. The contrast of the Titanic then to what she is now reveals the tragic aspects of this signifciant historical disaster. What was by far catching were several 3-D models present here and there such as the Grand Staircase among other locations within the ship. The angles of the images taken and lighting of the wreck were brilliant. If anything, the rare images of the D-Deck vestibules make the book worth the price. A must have for anyone who is captivated by the former elegance of the ship of dreams."},{"Title":"Lambing Out and Other Stories","review":"This is one of the best collections of short stories I have ever read. The settings for the stories is Montana and the inevitable impact of the harsh environment on the people living there. In seven short stories and less than one hundred pages Blew has managed to combine the effects of an unforgiving climate with the turbulent lives of so-real characters that experience conflict, brutality and heart breaking violence. The environmental effect on the characters in the title story &quot;Lambing Out&quot; is stark and readily apparent. However, the impact in &quot;Paths Unto The Dead&quot; and &quot;Monsters&quot; is more subtle and will give the reader pause and, upon reflection, insight into the incredible talent of the author. This blend of human and natural landscape into the written word is powerful and unforgetable. If you ever wondered why anyone would live &quot;out there&quot;, try these stories. For anyone interested in first-rate writing about the interrelationship between a regional environment and the people that inhabit it, this is as good as it gets. Don't be surprised if you end up with the impression the characters are real, that somehow Blew is not making these stories up. She is that good. These are powerful, thoughtful, moving stories that come very close to transcending region."},{"Title":"Kashmir in Conflict: India, Pakistan and the Unending War","review":"This book is exactly as the title leads you to believe. This is an excellent historical account of the facts done in a balanced and very readable way. It's a shame some of the reviews written here are very ignorant about this author.

Bush presidency detailing the persons, organizations and events that have made the conflict in Kashmir so difficult to get a handle on. As a history, the book is meticulous and well written, but this also makes it a battle to slog through the relatively brief 259 pages. It took me several minutes just to slog through a page or two and then i'd lose track of who exactly people where or what events had precipitated y. As a history, it's top flight as a readable and understandable account of the conflict it loses a little something."},{"Title":"Kashmir in Conflict: India, Pakistan and the Unending War","review":"This was one of the books I used for for my dissertation and it was certainly among the most useful sources I came across. In this book, Schofield gives a succint history of the dispute and then vividly describes how it has evolved over the past half century while presenting a detailed analysis of the many wars fought on both the military and diplomatic fronts.As an outsider and a neutral observer, Schofield very successfully presents a balanced viewpoint in describing both the Indian and Pakistani sides of the dispute. This, I felt, was very important because it is not common to come across a book on Kashmir which hasn't in any way been influenced by either side. Among the most important aspects of this book is the fact that Victoria Schofield has carried out a lot of field work research in Kashmir itself and gives a voice to the Kashmiri people, an extremely important source which is often ignored in similar research work carried out on Kashmir.I recommend this book highly to anyone who wants to use it for academic research work."},{"Title":"Kashmir in Conflict: India, Pakistan and the Unending War","review":"Looking for historical facts about Kashmir? Look somewhere else.Schofield completely ignores the history of the region that points an accusing finger towards islamic terrorism responsible for forcible conversion of Hindus and Buddhists to Islam.She has not given importance to the fact that Pakistani terrorists tried to infltrate the region in 47 and then again in 65 but were beaten by the Indians.She again ignores the curse of terrorism, Al Qaida and Taliban active in the valley today, all with the help of rogue elements in Pakistani army.This book is certainly a good attempt at writing history of the troubled region but Pakistani terrorism is a part of this history. Thousands of people have been killed by these Pakistani terrorists.

Even though the author of this book has its main sources in India and British Libraries, it still gives a unbiased account which is a hard balance for many people related to this topic to maintain."},{"Title":"Kashmir in Conflict: India, Pakistan and the Unending War","review":"The author is a pan-Islamist, and hence is influenced by her friend the disgraced and corrupt Ms. Benazir Bhutto. Incidentally it was Bhutto's regime that supported the ISI (Inter Services Intelligence - a spying organization of Pakistan, that was radicalized by General Zia-ul-Haq) which made terrorism and Islam boil in the same cauldron. I don't believe that Ms. Schofield can be objective.The reasons are not hard to seek:1. Pakistan has no identity by itself. It is a failed and garbage state. Pakistan has thrived by its anti-India campaignand nothing else since 1947. If this anti-India (read anti-kafir) agenda vanished, Pakistan would simply collapse. The various parts: Sindh, Punjab and the NWFP are at each other's throats since Pakistan's inception. Islamic fundamentalists parties play a major role in the political process. Thus, how can the author (Ms. Schofield) base an \\"objective\\" account of the Kashmir insurgency - which has become a \\"Islamic problem\\" ? What Ms. Schofield cannot fathom is that how can a secular democratic republic (India), regardless of how imperfect it may be, can accept the theocratic demands of a separate state, to be governed by the Sharia law?2. The history of the \\"majority\\" (Muslims) in Kashmir is a relatively recent phenomenon. Kashmir has had its roots in the Hindu culture. Recently, the Hindus have been gunned down, killed, raped and brutalized beyond the pale of any sense by the Muslim terrorist groups like Harkat-ul-Mujahadeen, Lashkar-e-Toiba anbd Hizb-ul-Mujahadeen etc. The ethnic cleansing has changed the demographics; under the changed demographics achieved by ethnic cleansing it is possible to claim a \\"Muslim majority\\" state. If India allowws Kashmir to walk into Pakistan's lap, the the other Muslim-majority parts of India would be emboldened to engage in ethnic cleansing of non-Muslms and create a \\"dar-al-Islam\\" (Land of Islam). (In recent times, thanks to Al-Qaeeda this apparatus is very effective.) I cannot understand what moral obligation the author (Ms. Schofield) may have in propagating such \\"ethnic cleansing induced secession claims\\" as legitimate political demands ?In brief, the political status attached to Kashmir through the works of Ms. Schofield are disingenuous and polemical at best."},{"Title":"Kashmir in Conflict: India, Pakistan and the Unending War","review":"This book is a good read. It does show some very important highlights about the conflict.Dont read Kafir's comments. He sounds like a disgruntled hindu radical who only survive because of hating somebody. Kashmir is a part of India and I think should remain so.Kashmir is not based on any hindu culture. India itself was ruled by muslims for over thousand years. Kashmir was well liked by the emperors and has a deep history of muslims.The problem with India has been the fact that the first prime minister of India was a pandit himself and during independence he had an agenda of keeping Kashmir being a pandit himself. This has caused problems for over 60 years now.The Indian government made some wrong decisions as far as kashmir but also some wise ones. Kashmir has the highest concentration of troops per square inch anywhere in the world. The Indian army commits many crimes there as they are ones in power there. Many kashmir women are raped on a regular basis and innocent civilians killed. This happens even more because Indian army has more hindus in it and the kashmiri people are muslims. They see the kashmiri people not as indians but just some muslims. And because of this attitude you cannot blame the kashmiri people for wanting to have a separate state.I think instead of spending so much manpower and money on India, the Indian government should focus more on the terrorist organizations like RSS, VHP and SS.

I was fortunate that my father allowed me to read anything I desired. As a child in the early 1940's I didn't know what a lesbian was and had to ask my father. He explained that they were women who prefered the compamy of other women. I could understand that and it was enough of an explanation for a 12 year old. Over the last 50+ years I have often returned to the book. I am, in fact, on my third copy. I am heterosexual, a widow, mother of four, grandmother of nine. It took me many readings to realize why I identified with the character in the book. It is the relationship between the girl and her parents and not the sexual aspect, that drew me. I reccommend this book to anyone interested in family dynamics. Many of us have experienced loneliness, the feeling of not &quot;fitting in&quot;, of not conforming, not measuring up to someone else's ideals and this is why I consider this book timeless. Sure, it is dated both in dialogue and in the experience of homosexuals today but that doesn't negate to feelings expressed in the book."},{"Title":"The well of loneliness (Permabooks)","review":"I read this book 50 years ago and was enraptured with it.

You see, I was aboard ship with a battalion of fellow Marines and I knew that such a book would find nothing but patent denigration by &quot;all hands.&quot; So,I read the book to last page of this beautiful book, closed it, and with tears in my eyes, dropped it into the Mediterranean Sea. I've never forgotten this book in all these years."},{"Title":"The well of loneliness (Permabooks)","review":"This book is to be recommended not only to the lesbian or &quot;invert,&quot; but to all sensitive souls who have felt themselves &quot;outcast from life's feast,&quot; to borrow from Joyce. The prose itself is rich and beautiful as few books are today, and if this style is long winded as one reviwer has dubbed it, then modern literary culture needs to open its doors to let in some fresh air, regardless of the season. This style of this book, oddly, resembles more than anything that of the contemporary &quot;straight&quot; Bildungsroman by Thomas Wolfe-Look Homeward, Angel. But Hall is more effective at bringing home &quot;the pain of all beauty&quot; and I found myself laying the book down several times to wipe the salty blur from my eyes, such is its poignancy. The storyline and character, oddly again, of Hall's book and of her protagonist Stephen Gordon remind me of nothing so much as Rousseau in his Confessions. Yet, these similarities should not be surprising after all. All three were sensitive geniuses who suffered much through their own spiritual tenderness.-This book is for all who have felt, like Hall and Stephen, &quot;...like a soul that wakes up to find itself wandering, unwanted, between the spheres.&quot;-Or as Shelley would have it in his fragment &quot;To The Moon,&quot; &quot;Art thou pale for weariness of climbing heaven and gazing on Earth, wandering companionless?&quot;-It will ease your struggle and perhaps bring you rest."},{"Title":"The well of loneliness (Permabooks)","review":"The first thing I noticed about Radclyffe Hall's \\"The Well of Loneliness,\\" was the beautiful descriptive exposition. Before the novel delves too far into modernism, it is apparent that it is hedging out the Victorian. Descriptions of the English countryside, of London and of Paris are some of the finest written in English. Not only this but the painstaking care the Hall takes to describe her characters, though even Stephen remains a bit fuzzy to me, are lovely and purposeful. Her sense of loss, loneliness and love are extremely powerful and extremely well conveyed.That being said, the bravery it took to write the first English- language novel that addressed \\"invertedness,\\" in Stephen's case butch-lesbian identity and, overall, homosexuality, is incredible. It is hard to be absolutely disappointed with the author for the ending of the novel, particularly since it seems to be semi-authobiographic. Given the time period, the ending was likely collateral in exchange for being published. Without giving it away, I'll simply add that I felt sad for the world and defiant, and these not unexpected emotions after a 500 page journey that included happiness and hope, depseration and anxiety. To be cliche, it reminds one of how far we've come with civil rights and yet how very far we still must go.Like some of fellow modernist writer Fitzgerald's characters, Hall's character is wealthy and priveledged and yet likeable. One is inclined to empathize with her situation at most points, and when not, it is easy to become enraged at the world and not Stephen. It's amazing that book was published in the late 20's, and yet problems like those the characters encountered in \\"The Well of Loneliness\\" still exist -- we are still fighting to be able to \\"protect\\" and \\"provide security\\" to those we love.This book is an amazing journey. If it is slow moving, it is only because it encompasses over 30 years, years which are necessary to fully understanding the social world that \\"freaks\\" like us are still only allowed limited access to. This is worth reading no matter what type of outcast you consider yoursel to be. There is much comfort even in feeling one is not alone. So, thanks, Radclyffe."},{"Title":"The well of loneliness (Permabooks)","review":"The Well of Loneliness is called the first undisguised lesbian novel in the English language, which makes it required reading for a women's studies class or scholarly lesbians. Yet, though written in 1928, it is still relevant to all people interested in issues of inclusiveness and diversity. Also, with its arguments based on Christian morality, it should get serious consideration by the religious right before they condemn homosexuality.The novel is a fictionalized biography of a lesbian born in the 1890s to a well-to-do couple on a country estate in England. They were desiring a son and name their only daughter Stephen, the name they had selected for their heir. Her mother finds it difficult to get close to this girl whose favorite game is dressing up as Admiral Nelson, but her father treats her like the son he was denied. He teaches her horseback riding, and takes her on the local fox hunts where she excels.Yet as she reaches puberty and young adulthood, her mannish behavior and dress starts to cause her problems. But this is Victorian England and certain things are just not spoken about, so Stephan grows up ignorant of what she is and how society feels about people like her. When her father dies her protection from the prejudices of society also disappear. She is ostracised and eventually forced out of her home by her mother.This isn't an easy book to read. With such a title, you know that it isn't going to be a lot of fun. Yet Hall wonderfully represents Stephen's life and the adversity she faces because of a situation beyond her control. She argues that \\"Inversion\\" is natural because lesbians exist in nature. Since nature is God's creation, so are lesbians and all other inverts of society. She is morally strong and wants to take her inherited place in society, but is blocked by mean-spirited and close-minded people. The book would be like Pride and Prejudice if there was only one daughter and she was gay.The social turmoil and change in society that takes place because of World War I is well portrayed by the author. Stephen becomes an ambulance driver in France, and stays on in Paris seeking a community of like-minded people. Yet even there she cannot find peace and acceptance.This is an important book because it takes a serious look at the role of gay people in society. All the issues that face this community today are raised by Radclyffe Hall. Social and religious condemnation, internalized oppression, and even the question of gay marriage are all addressed in clear and persuasive prose. The style is a bit formal and introspective, yet this glimpse into the individual is superbly portrayed and excellently developed. I found it slow moving, but with great emotional and intellectual impact."},{"Title":"The well of loneliness (Permabooks)","review":"Regardless of one's orientation, this work should be read - if for no other reason, to ensure oneself that we all are, most beautifully, outside the mold, whether it's in our sexuality or in our particular preferences for coffee or tea. An extremely insightful view of class division, of the courage (and grief)in living one's beliefs, and for those who have been there, a description of the Midlands that one can reach out and touch."},{"Title":"The well of loneliness (Permabooks)","review":"If there were a dictionary of queer literature Radclyffe Hall would certainly have a place, somewhere between \\"Hall, Maurice\\" and \\"Hallward, Basil\\". She deserves this for having written a taboo-breaking novel. She does not deserve this for writing a particularly good one.When I started reading this book I thought I was going to like it a lot more than I did in the end; I thought Stephen as a child was an adorable little gentleman and I liked the relationship between her parents and how it influenced her life. When I reached her first girlfriend, however, a married woman named Angela Crossby, I was at the edge of the abyss without knowing it.I realize this book is a product of its time, but never in my life have I heard so many cliches and stereotypes about lesbians - sorry, inverts - from a woman who was a lesbian herself. Inverts have terrible nerves. Inverts wrongly cling to religion. A \\"real\\" female invert is masculine and a \\"real\\" male invert is feminine, whereas their \\"normal\\" lovers are truly heterosexual.More drama and angst are crammed into the last few chapters of the book than I would have thought possible, and the ending - which I will not reveal - comes out of nowhere and contradicts the personalities of Stephen and her lover Mary as they have been previously established. Anyone with an interest in queer literature should read this to satisfy their curiousity, and to deepen their appreciation for better-written and more realistic fiction. Someone who wants a good novel with an intense romance should not."},{"Title":"The well of loneliness (Permabooks)","review":"~I'm not quite sure whether to love of despise this book. It's so wrong in it's truthfulness and yet seems so dellusional. I mean being a lesbian I know how it feels and I can understand the fact that this story takes place it the very beginning of 20th century when the society was a lot less tolerate of homosexuals than now, but still it seems to me that Radclyffe Hall sometimes exaggerated the feelings of loneliness and despair felt by Stephen. Still in other moments during the book one is~~ made to wonder how some things still haven't changed while so many others have during the course of all these years. Some of the emotions the author describes are infinitly truthful. The one thing I would definitely change though is the ending because it just serves to add to the despair and show that so called &quot;normalicy&quot; (and many people still think of it this way) should always prevail in this world. I knew what was coming for many chapters ahead of the actual ending and yet couldn't~~ help but cry when I finally finished reading the last words.~"},{"Title":"The well of loneliness (Permabooks)","review":"If you're studying lesbian literature, obscenity trials or queer history in general, this book has unfortunately become foundation stuff and might be worth trawling through. If you're a young dyke just starting to read queer writing, it'll just make you feel hopeless and there are far better writers around. Radclyffe Hall may have been a pioneer and a martyr, and she does at least get marks for courage considering the atmosphere of the time, but as a writer she was mediocre (and apparently as a person she was a nasty piece of work).Admittedly, the book is very much a product of its time. Sexual orientation was little understood, gender dysphoria even less so, and Hall appears to have got muddled up between the two. There is a mild stab at scientific explanation (Stephen's parents long for a boy, give her a boy's name, treat her as a boy to a certain extent - and surprise surprise, she grows up to like girls and dress as a man), and a very clear line drawn between \\"inverts\\" and \\"normals\\" that will make anyone grit their teeth long before they come to the depressing way in which Stephen \\"heroically\\" solves her final dilemma. The depiction of the relatively \\"normal\\" women Stephen loves as properly girly creatures, who are swayed by the perils of Sapphic passion but are still Real Women underneath, contains some pretty unpleasant stereotypes about bisexuals and \\"femme\\" women, and the characterisation throughout neither arouses sympathy in the reader nor particularly convinces.Despite the obscenity trial, there is nothing scandalous in this book beyond the idea that a woman could love women: the dirtiest it gets is the all-concealing line, \\"...And that night they were not divided.\\" (Sorry if that's a spoiler, but as a friend of mine said, \\"You mean I've read hundreds of pages about her miserable childhood for *that*?\\")If you want lesbian sex, there are plenty of writers offering that sort of thing these days, and some of them even write about it well (Emma Donoghue, for instance, who is, incidentally, a vivid, moving and very funny writer). If you're after lesbian literature of that period, go to Virginia Woolf and co. (there are also some excellent anthologies, such as the \\"Penguin Book of Lesbian Short Stories\\" and \\"Chloe Plus Olivia\\", that take a literary-historical perspective). If you simply want a well-written book about love between women, again there is far better on offer: the previous two writers and also the likes of Jane Rule and Alice Walker. And if you're interested in transsexuality and the boundaries between genders (not to mention the people who fall in the middle), I can recommend Anna Livia's \\"Bruised Fruit\\" and Rose Tremain's \\"Sacred Country\\". Spare yourself this."},{"Title":"The well of loneliness (Permabooks)","review":"i just translated the book into chinese so i guess i did some pretty close reading :). while the novel is undoubtedly a milestone in the history of english literature, lesbian culture, and the battle against censorship, its literary merits leave something to be desired. radclyffe hall's prose is ornate and even over-dramatizing at times, and i find the frequent insertion of french phrases and sentences redundant and affected. the situations and emotions are relevant, poignant, and often depicted with insight, but because the mood and the tone of the narrative is so persistently intensive it does tend to get tedious after a while--which can be well before one finishes the book.it seems quite obvious that stephen gordon, the heroine (or should i say hero?) of the book, would never have questioned the moral conventions and gender roles of her times, had she not been born to be what she was--in short, a male soul trapped inside a female body (though hall, true to her style, never just says so). for she totally identified herself with a (upper-class) society of so-called respectability, honor, refinement, etc., which constitutes a mentality not really, uh, let's say &quot;progressive&quot;. while crying out against the outrage against and persecution of lesbians and gays, stephen remained disconcertingly vague in her attitude toward effeminate males (such as the character jonathan brockett), feeling much more at ease with and indeed seeking the acceptance of straight (and presumably manly) men. i'm not exactly saying that it's &quot;reactionary&quot; to long for the very &quot;secure and happy&quot; life of &quot;the normal&quot;, but how she--and i wonder if also the author--repeatedly projected heterosexual marriage to be is way too idealized and dangerously so, not pausing for even one moment to reflect on what outrage and persecution that sort of marriage could also and did often turn out to be for perfectly &quot;normal&quot; women. one can't help feeling that she thought everything would've been just so fine, if only and only if she had been a man!so, while trying not to be anachronistic in my judgment of the novel and the characters in it, i suggest that it be carefully read *in context*, historically and ideologically."},{"Title":"The well of loneliness (Permabooks)","review":"Ok this book isn't for everyone, but then what book is?

I stumbled across the book in a used bookshop. My hardback copy was a 17th printing from 1933. So since the book was written in 1928, it had to have created quite a sensation to go through 17 printings in its first 5-years. When I bought this, I thought it was about paramedics in the early part of the last century. Of course, with Stephen Gordon's experiences during World War I, it was about paramedics, but not primarily as I soon realized.I found the writing to hold up remarkably well. The characters are fleshed enough to resonate. Sir Philip's love for his daughter and mother Anna's reserve and lack of attachment set the stage for a somewhat confusing childhood for Stephen Gordon. Bring to the picture her tutor Puddle who identifies with Stephen's struggle and understands her even before Stephen does, and add the flighty Angela Crossby as her first love interest against a backdrop of unfriendly townspeople; and Hall creates a quite interesting dynamic of unrequited love and betrayal. With Rafferty, she even writes a wonderful horse character! After Stephen's removal from Morton, the family estate, she begins a period of increasing self-sufficiency, assisted by the luxury of relative financial security from her father, and becomes a writer. The years in Paris after the war are an interesting period, peopled with more interesting characters from the parties and circles of outcasts. I found the subplot of the love relationship between Jamie and Barbara to be intensely dramatic, climaxed by Jamie's last act of despair. As for Stephen's letting go of her true love for that love's happiness, it was a rather sad ending. All in all, this is a novel that stands up as important for its sociological implications. It makes one long for a culture in which the pursuit of happiness is respected to be as individual as it is essential for all women and men."},{"Title":"The well of loneliness (Permabooks)","review":"I loved the way this book was written.

All three were sensitiive geniuses who suffered through much of their lives. This book will strike a chord of love in you, if you, like Hall and her protagonist, have ever felt &quot;...like a soul that wakes up to find itself wandering, unwanted, between the spheres.&quot;"},{"Title":"The well of loneliness (Permabooks)","review":"While this book has merit as a \\"literary classic,\\" it's value doesn't go much beyond that. For the most part, the story was interesting, though it certainly had its slow parts. But Hall's language and writing style is unrefined and leaves much to be desired.

When the child arrives, Anna is dispirited when she gives birth to a girl. Sir Phillip makes the most of it, but still decides to give her the name they'd already chosen: Stephen. And so enters into the world one of the most astonishing creatures of literary fiction.Young Stephen knows that she's different from the other children, but her father, noticing her difference also, allows her to grow up her own way: riding horses like a young man, sometimes dressing like a young boy. From a young age to her lae thirties, we watch as Stephen discovers herself, longing to love and to fit into a society that will not accept her or others like her. She puts her feelings into words, becoming a successful author and does find love, but that love is put to the test when someone who can offer her beloved acceptance steps into the picture.An astonishing book for its time that was banned upon initial publication, openly discussing what was considered taboo with much candor and respect. The characters of Radclyffe Hall's novel deal with the same societal pressures and beliefs which are still prevalent today: same-sex marriage, societal roles of male and female, wanting to fight for one's country during a time of war even when that country doesn't want you because of who you are. A truly remarkbale novel."},{"Title":"The well of loneliness (Permabooks)","review":"I have just finished reading \\"The Well Of Loneliness\\" and have mixed emotions about it.First of all, even though some of its melodramatic prose is definitely outdated, however some parts of the novel appeared to me amazingly contemporary.The character of Dickie West,the brash American aviator sounds very much like the young modern politically active Lesbians of today.As a man, I really sympathized with Stephen even though her sacrifice of Mary to Martin Hallam seemed to me more the action of a martyr than a lover.I thought that the most fascinating aspect of the book was its priceless description of the gay Parisian nightlife of the 1920's.That alone is worth the price of the book .The book is also permeated with memorable characters like Puddle,Mlle Duphot and the tragic Jamie & Barbara.Also Stephen's relationship with animals from her horse to the dog in Paris was touching.All in all ,a dated but fascinating and ultimately moving novel."},{"Title":"The well of loneliness (Permabooks)","review":"more than merely an amazing piece of literature, _the well of loneliness_ is one of the most significant pieces of history of the twentieth century. a frank portrayal of lesbian life at the turn of the century, it opened the floodgates for subsequent queer (and straight) authors to follow their muse, ambivalent to reproach. though some dismiss the language as stilted and the portrayal of the butch/femme relationship as stereotypical, one would do well to keep in mind the period during which it was published. as gender roles within lesbian relationships were prevalent through the 1950s and beyond, is it any wonder that they were addressed in hall's book? in fact, it would have been a betrayal of hall's own reality to portray her characters in any other fashion. for a classic tale of love, life and homosexuality, one need look no further than radclyffe hall's _the well of loneliness_."},{"Title":"The well of loneliness (Permabooks)","review":"Radclyffe Hall (1883-1943) spent much of her time in Paris in pursuit of her lover, Evguenia Souline, and in many ways it is very difficult to separate Hall's writing from her own life. She had to make a constant effort to endure misunderstanding, intolerance and ostracism -- all because of her sexuality. &quot;The Well of Loneliness&quot; is a classic tale of lesbian love, but 1928 was to prove an unfortunate year for Hall to issue this powerful &quot;crie de coeur.&quot; Like D. H. Lawrence's &quot;Lady Chatterley's Lover&quot; a few years later, Hall's novel was banned as obscene after a lengthy and infamous trial. Despite this, &quot;The Well of Loneliness&quot; commands our attention as we watch the lesbian protagonist Stephen Gordon -- a nonconformist, deviant, or to use Hall's own phrase, an &quot;invert&quot; -- stagger so beautifully and chaotically close to the edge of life. In Hall's story, Sir Philip and Lady Gordon crave a son and heir to Morton Hall. Strangely, when their only child is a girl, they name her Stephen. But Stephen's upbringing is a little unorthodox -- she learns to ride, fence and hunt, all so-called masculine pursuits, and before long she recognizes that she is being treated as an outsider by the people of Great Malvern. She stays away from society parties, resists all attempts at heterosexual courtship and, gradually, begins to fell the pain of isolation, venturing to understand herself in quasi-biblical terms as &quot;one of those whom God marked on the forehead...like Cain.&quot; Like a raven circling the heart, the social pressures become too much for Stephen. She sets sail for Paris. Without divulging the rest of this tender plot, I will close by saying that I read the last page of this novel and found myself recalling Oscar Wilde, another British homosexual who died of a broken heart, and the pertinent inscription on his tomb in Paris: &quot;And alien tears will fill for him/Pity's long-broken urn/For his mourners will be outcast men/And outcasts always mourn.&quot;"},{"Title":"The well of loneliness (Permabooks)","review":"I am usually a fast reader, however, it has taken me about a week to finish this book, simply because after reading a few pages, I begin to think about some of the deeper questions asked in the novel.

I've been looking into late 1800 and early 1900 lesbain literature for a while because it seems to be generally more well-written then the more recent novels.Earlier in the month I had read \\"Wild Heart: A Life\\" by Suzanne Rodriguez which is about Natalie Barney and her adventures in the early 1900s. Imagine my surprise when the main character, Stephen Gordon, began resembling Natalie! I was entralled in this novel. You can put it down or pick it up, but no matter what it has withstood the test of time, and it depicted a very real life for lesbians in the early 1900s.I would reccommed this book along with \\"Wild Heart: A Life\\" to anyone interested in the experiences of homosexuals in the past."},{"Title":"The well of loneliness (Permabooks)","review":"What a sad book. Unlike the other reviewers on this site I think it's very well written. After reading this book I couldn't help but think what it would have been like to live in a world as conservative as it was then - actually the world even 50 years ago.

It sounds like your life!&quot; And so I read about the tormented Stephen coming to turns with his/her gender and sexuality. Brought into the world with a silver spoon and cared for by a &quot;favorite&quot; nanny. Never quite fitting in with ones peers and yet having numerous friends of both sexes. A mother who resented her husband\`s devotion to you and a sister who fit in perfectly. It could be anyone\`s story or no one\`s. But it does reflect the times, then and now.

It gives one an idea of how far we have come in achieving equal rights for everyone regardless of sexual orientation. We still have a long way to go, but we need to keep in mind where we have been."},{"Title":"The well of loneliness (Permabooks)","review":"I read this book decades ago, I think I was in my teens, and was immediately caught up in it. I never once thought, either before or after I read it, that is was in any way \\"dated\\" (never did understand that complaint; a book written in the past is a product of the time it was written, obviously) the term \\"queer literature\\" I also found somewhat offensive and demeaning; to label any book with this reference is misleading and does not do the book justice in any way. Why relegate any book to a category of \\"queer literature?\\" Makes no sense. It is, simply, a book about a young woman who falls in love with another young woman and according to the social mores of the time, finds herself totally ostracized by her own family and so creates a new world of friends, a surrogate family circle comprised of people less censorious of her natural feelings. Also, criticising Hall's style as \\"unrefined\\" and \\"cheesy,\\" reflects more on the reading level/comprehension of the reviewer than it does on the abilities of Ms. Hall.Any work that comes from the heart, as this one so plainly does, should be read and appreciated in that context.As to comparison to other authors who write in similar veins, well, every writer is different, and this brings in the 3 blind men and the elephant parable.In my opinion, Ms. Hall is a fine writer, and her book very moving, even today, and if it weren't so, then no one would either be aware of or dicuss her book written so many years ago. It would be interesting to see which of today's writers will still be talked about some 70 plus years hence.The characters, the settings and the situations were all unique and I have seldom come across any book that compares to the heart and genuine pathos of \\"The Well of Loneliness.\\" So all you armchair critics take note: Write a book yourself and see how you fare; it is not as easy as you might suppose, but is really a labor of love and takes a lot of hard work, thought and emotion, and when real emotion and heartfelt pain are dismissed as \\"cheesy,\\" then we are all in trouble."},{"Title":"The well of loneliness (Permabooks)","review":"It was excatly what a friend told me about this book (read title) that made me wonder and hunt for the book. I read each page with great zest and was engrossed by it until I finshed the last line. I must say it is truely a classic. It is timeless.Through the words of Halls, it is like a journey with her back in time. From a lesbian point of view, on how she (Stephen Gordon) faced the society and like-wise, how the society sees her. The battle of acceptance and other issues along the way. Radclyffe Hall wrote it as fictional tale, not a autobiography even though many would still view so."},{"Title":"The well of loneliness (Permabooks)","review":"This book should be a must read for everyone. It is the story of a lesbian coming of age in the early 20th century who realizes early on that the love she feels for others is a love that will forever set her apart from the world in which she lives. Even within her own family, her father accepts her but cannot vocalize his acceptance of her sexual orientation, while her mother, feeling estranged from her daughter since birth for reasons she cannot pinpoint, eventually outright rejects the daughter when she learns the truth.As devastating as the facts of the story are, the awareness of the girl at an early age- and the undeniable reality that this character speaks for thousands upon thousands of girls worldwide, since of all eternity- makes the emotions and struggles described vividly real and painful. She cannot love because to do so is to risk ridicule and contempt from society, directed at both herself and whomever she loves.As Stephen (the purposefully \\"masculine\\" named female character) matures and enters the real world apart from her isolated English manor, she meets other lesbians and eventually finds a small community of like minded souls that helps her come to terms with her own identity. Unfortunately, this insular society is not strong enough to change the world nor successfully repel the hate that it directs towards those who are 'different', and thus even when Stephen does find real love with someone willing to shoulder the burden that such a love entails, she is unable to protect that special relationship from those who want to destroy it.This is a powerful book. Depressing, yes, but in a way that no matter how enlightened you may think you are, opens your eyes and hearts to the silent struggles of countless thousands, if not millions. Lesbian fiction, yes, but more importantly, it is human fiction, about the search for love that we all undertake."},{"Title":"The well of loneliness (Permabooks)","review":"With only heterosexuality as a guide, and lacking the modest freedom that male homosexuals were able to enjoy (usually as long as they did their duty by marrying), what is a woman to do when she longs to be with other women, in love and life? How can she not imagine herself at times to be male, queer, and alienated?I know many woman who won't read this book in spite of its historic importance, and it's always becaues they can't sympathize with the world view that Hall herself endured. When we can actually marry one another in some countries it is hard to understand why Hall only appeals for pity, for understanding and approval from the mainstream, mostly male society. But where else could she look? There was no &quot;community&quot; she could count on, no open lesbians in government to trust.I think if this book is read with the historical context firmly in mind, it is possible then to see the brilliance of the writing and the passion of the story."},{"Title":"The well of loneliness (Permabooks)","review":"About the Book:Stephen Gordon was never what you would consider a normal girl. Even at a young age, she dressed up as a man and took up hobbies such as fencing s tale, we follow her on an emotional journey as Stephen takes on the hardships of being an outcast.ReviewI was originally recommended this novel by my room mate, and I have to say I am glad she did. I, honestly, would have not picked this up by blurb alone, allowing myself to miss out on a wonderful read. Accredited as being a lesbian novel, part of me would have to disagree for it read more like a transgender novel to me. However, there are still plenty of relations between women, and it sure didn't make the book any less moving. Hall pens a brilliant tale that leaves your heart aching.This novel also seems to be known as a romance. Yes, there are romantic affairs, but the main lover isn't even introduced until about three fifths of the way in. If anything, I would say that this book journeys through the soul, not just the heart. I believe it is also important to note that even if you are not gay or trans, this book still speaks to the soul, especially to anyone who has felt like an outsider.Not only does the author do a phenomenal job of conveying emotions (which personally had me on the verge of tears), but Hall also lays out beautiful prose. Plus, her characters, even the minor ones, easily have a life of their own so that I wasn't only feeling for Stephen but others as well.Now although I gave this five stars, I would say it ought to be a 4.5. This is because Hall ended up writing a fair amount of French into her novel, causing me to either miss sentences (or at one point an entire conversation) or having to constantly translate the language. If it was just a few times, that would be different, but it happened more often than I cared for. However, even with this drawback, the emotion and message came through quite clearly. Another thing I disliked was Hall had a habit of changing focus from one character to another, which left often times confused and having to reread. I would also like to point out that since this was written in the 1920's, the writing may seem stilted and slow to some. However, I found this a brilliant and riveting reading experience that captured me both emotionally and mentally."},{"Title":"The well of loneliness (Permabooks)","review":"I came across this book last year looking for banned books to read and have on hand for my family. Two copies are in my home and both have been opened and read. From the beginning I felt a deep understanding of how the main character, Stephen, was feeling as a \\"sexual invert\\" or lesbian. There are many circumstances in the book that made me wish I could reach into the pages and intervene. Because, of the connection I had with the character, I put the book down often. The author captured the pain and wonderment of her situation well."},{"Title":"The well of loneliness (Permabooks)","review":"This is such a fantastic book. I bought it and read it for a literature class for school; otherwise, I probably would never have come across it. It's not a perfect book - it can get a little long-winded, but it's such a wonderful examination of gender and social status in the 20's.Don't get into it expecting to fall in love with the main character, though. Stephen is not a character, but a real, flawed person who deals with sexual confusion and gender dysphoria like most of us - that is, badly. Couple that with the time period, the early twentieth century, and you have a very realistic portrayal of a person born a girl, given a boys name, and essentially raised with male-driven hobbies by her father, but socially expected to conform to the feminine standards of the time. Stephen is not a saint, and she/he doesn't always treat people very well, but his/her struggles with gender and sexuality gives you, the reader, a sense of the difficulty that people had when psychologists labeled homosexuality a mental illness."},{"Title":"The well of loneliness (Permabooks)","review":"What a great piece of literature - she was a tortured woman who conveyed that on paper.

Most of it reads more like a travelogue -- \\"We went here, and they told us about their ghost; then we drove to Place Number 2, and they told us about their ghost...\\" and so on and so on. Only a very few actual encounters with ghosts, more just other people's stories.Holzer refers over and over to himself in the third person, as in \\"The Ghost Hunter must return to this site in the future.\\" It becomes pretentious and obnoxious quickly.It's an easy read, and if you just want to hear (unsubstantiated by mediums) stories about ghosts, it's not bad. But don't spend a lot on it."},{"Title":"From Versailles to Wall Street, 1919-1929","review":"This is the second book in a series of economic texts entitled 'The Pelican History of World Economy in the 20th Century' The series starts with 'The First World War, 1914-1918' and finishes with 'Prosperity and Upheavel: the World Economy, 1945-1980' The period covered by this book and it's title - 'From Versailles to Wall Street, 1919-1929' might lead you to believe that this is an insignificant period and that the book would be the least interesting of the series. Not so. It is full of interesting economic tidbits.The cost of WWI was astronomical - $260 Billion (in 1987 dollars I would guess since that's the date of the book). Only a small percent of this was financed by taxation and other revenues. The majority of wartime expenses were paid for by borrowing. (As an aside, this practice is as old as war itself. Barbara Tuchman writes in her book 'Distant Mirror' this was how wars were financed in the 14th century. It's also true then, for WWI and today that the financing of war can do almost as much damage as war itself). Anyway, the deficit financing of WWI didn't have to be inflationary, if it was derived from savings. It wasn't, it was financed largely by bank credit and was it ever inflationary! Price increases experienced throughout Europe in the years following WWI were unbelievable. The experience of Hyperinflation was made worse by the fact that people had no experience of even normal inflation for many decades. In the space of a few years prices had risen 14,000 times in Austria. They were lucky. In Germany prices rose 1 million million (no typo) times when compared to pre-war.Against this background the boom of the 'Roaring Twenties' in the US was a welcome relief. One of the biggest factors driving it (pun intended) was an innovation called the motor car. It stimulated other industries such as steel, glass, rubber, petroleum and metal fabricating. Highways stretched out over the US giving the construction sector a big boost. Unfortunately all this was only a short lived positive blip in a very unstable and creaking world economic system. The book clearly shows that the origins of the worldwide depression of 1929-32 began right here in the US. The world economic system was vulnerable and weak and was administered two shocks by the US. The first was the drastic cut in foreign lending. Most countries could have withstood this setback but it was quickly followed by the petering out of the boom. Things took a turn for the worse domestically in the summer of 1929. Investment opportunities dried up and there was a severe cutback in consumer spending and a decline in business confidence. Confidence evaporated following the Stock Market crash of October and we were on the way down.It's interesting history and interesting reading. It serves as a reminder of the responsibility that comes with ownership of the worlds largest economy. It speaks to the power of this economy to generate growth worldwide if properly managed but also to set in motion a downward spiral if we are careless."},{"Title":"Daniel: A Reader's Guide","review":"Bill Shea is a Seventh-Day Adventist and this commentary is in-keeping with their theology. Yet Shea is also a former professor of Old Testament studies, with a special interest in the book of Daniel. Shea has been responsible for some significant papers in conservative Danielic studies and have even made some critical scholars wake-up and take note. The great achievement of this book is to take that great body of scholarship and distill it into something accessible to the general reader.This commentary is a wonderful blend of history and theology - all told in a readable, conversational style - which is truly a pleasure to read. He clearly and reasonably explains his reasons for believing that the book of Daniel is an inspired work of prophecy, while frankly noting the current limitations of our historical knowledge (for instance, his admission that conservative scholars have yet to find conclusive evidence for Darius the Mede).There are only a few potential weaknesses of this commentary. Shea's zeal of Seventh-Day theology leads him to include a long discourse about why Christians should worship on Saturday rather than Sunday which stretches several pages and seems out of place. Also his interpretation is straight continuous-historic, which some may simply disagree with. Yet despite this potential draw-backs this is still a pleasure to read and an excellent guide to the book of Daniel from one of the greatest experts in the field."},{"Title":"Daniel: A Reader's Guide","review":"Very informative.

I've been fishing about in contemporary fiction, looking for something entertaining, enlightening, and superbly well written, but my search ended entirely when I finally read this novel, written in 1951. Set in the South, in the countryside, this story draws you in to its surroundings, which are so important to its impact. Its three main characters, Dolly, Collin, and Catherine, are real presences that emerge from the lush southern environs as complex, blooming beings whose lives take time to develop and understand. There is nothing slick about this writing; it's just elegant and clear. The story is filled with interesting characters, and proceeds as if inspired by Twain. It is entertaining, poetic, and meaningful all at once. I found myself rereading the opening pages, picturing the scene that Capote presents, and feeling how brilliant it is in its elegiac and inspired imagery. The story is simple enough: a young boy, orphaned, lives with his two eccentric aunts in a small town in the South. One aunt is controlling, mean-spirited, and selfish, and the other is sweet, other-worldly, and gentle. When the mean aunt tries to exploit the sweet one by mass producing the sweet one's folk medicine remedy she learned from a traveling gypsy woman, the sweet aunt runs away from home with the orphan boy and her best friend, a strange Indian woman. They don't run too far, however, just to a local tree house in a China tree. From that point on, everyone learns something about themselves, including the mean aunt. The world is a generous place to Truman Capote, and it has mercies to give, and lessons to be learned. In fact, it's something of a magical world that Capote gives us, almost a precursor of the magical realism of Marquez and others. But as the characters learn about themselves, so we the readers learn too, about what love is, about change, and about what we accept in life. For Capote to have written this book at the age of 26 is truly a miracle. This book alone puts him in league with the greats.

This sweet, eccentric, moving and decidedly southern tale is the leisurely paced story of the repercussions that ensue when three townfolk decide to up and run away to live in a treehouse on the outskirts of town. Three quickly becomes five and eventually swells to even more as the makeshift home becomes a sort of paradise and refuge where stories are shared, closeness is established, and love blooms....think FLANNERY O'CONNOR meets SWISS FAMILY ROBINSON with a dash of STEEL MAGNOLIAS. Themes of finding one's place and path and making oneself known are skillfully woven into the narrative. It has the feel of a fantastic and utterly charming myth. Primary assets are the \\"thick as molasses\\" southern mood and syntax as well as a bevy of unforgettable characters."},{"Title":"The Grass Harp: Including A Tree of Night and Other Stories","review":"This early Novella by Truman Capote clearly demonstrates his ability to put together a word portrait. As an example: \\"... I would hear the tantalizing tremor of their voices flowing like sapsyrup through the old wood.\\"The characters are richly portrayed in this gem of Southern fiction."},{"Title":"The Grass Harp: Including A Tree of Night and Other Stories","review":"Truman Capote was best known for Breakfast at Tiffany's and In Cold Blood. However, his real gifts to the world are among the less well known. When Capote writes stories that have their origins and influence from his childhood, his pen is like a magic wand that transports the written word into a thing of exquisite beauty that lifts a gossamer curtain so that the reader gains the miracle of the musical vision that this most gifted writer was able to create. His tale, The Grass Harp is simple and true, achingly revealing of the needs of the human heart. Give yourself the favor of reading this gentle and moving visit into the heart of one of our gifted legends: Truman Capote."},{"Title":"The Grass Harp: Including A Tree of Night and Other Stories","review":"Though I'd heard of this book for years, I never picked it up. I could kick myself for not reading it sooner. What a beautifully written jewel. The prose is as close to perfect as I've ever read, the characters are nothing short of wonderful, and the voice -- THE VOICE! If you haven't read this treasure, please don't wait a moment longer. I can't recommend it highly enough."},{"Title":"The Grass Harp: Including A Tree of Night and Other Stories","review":"Truman Capote's gift for the written word brings marvel even in comparison to great literary geniuses. While \\"The Grass Harp\\" may not be the best exhibition of his talent, it is a brush stroke in his overall masterwork.The centerpeice of this particular book is \\"The Grass Harp\\", an odd book which brings to mind Steinbeck's Cannery Row. As an odd tale about simple people in a small town, the main characters are merely looking for a place to lay their head at the end of the day. Even if living in a tree is the best possible shelter for a time, it is the ideal retreat from the forces that trouble them. The short stories that follow also have a few gems. I recommend a tale of disapproving in-laws called \\"My Side of the Matter\\", the mysterious \\"Miriam\\", and the tale of an idiot savant in \\"Jug of Silver\\". With some of the other short stories in the collection, I am not as sure of where Capote was going as clearly. Perhaps rereading the others at a later date will draw greater appreciation from me.Capote's ability to choose and arrange words alone makes reading his work a real treat. If only modern writers had half of his talent and insight. Even though this is not his best collection, it is a treasure to fans and admirers."},{"Title":"The Grass Harp: Including A Tree of Night and Other Stories","review":"This is one of several books I have read and re-read.

In my library this book ranks at the top of the list along with my other favorites."},{"Title":"The Grass Harp: Including A Tree of Night and Other Stories","review":"if you have not read it it is worth a look.i got this book because of his growing up with harper lee"},{"Title":"The Grass Harp: Including A Tree of Night and Other Stories","review":"The Grass HarpBy Truman CapoteReviewed by Maureen HuntingtonThe Grass Harp is a short story written by Truman Capote in 1951; set in the countryside of the Deep South. The hills in the small town were beautifully covered with Indian grass that change color with the seasons. The wind makes a sound the locals called the grass harp.When the eleven year old Collin Fenwick&#8217;s mother died, his father sent him to live with his cousins Verena and Dolly Talbo. Verena, was a whip-thin, handsome woman who was the richest person in town. Owning most of the stores in town had hardened Verena, who was actually younger than her sister. Dolly was a shy lady who could disguise herself as an object in the room, a shadow in the corner, whose presence was a delicate happening. She also allowed Verena to make all her decisions. Catherine Creed was Dolly&#8217;s only friend. Catherine had been hired out to Mr. Uriah Talbo and had grown up with the Talbo sisters. She lived in the back yard in a tin roofed house with sunflowers set among butterbean vines. She claimed to be Indian, which made most people wink because Catherine was dark as the angels of Africa. Dolly and Catherine were inseparable; reason being that Dolly was the only one who could understand Catherine. With no teeth in her head her lips flapped when she spoke, that is unless she had it packed with cotton. Dolly and Catherine gathered herbs in the forest every Tuesday so Dolly could stew and bottle her Dropsy cure. People in town bought Dolly&#8217;s Dropsy cure, but most of them died of natural causes any way.Collin lived very well with the sisters and Catherine. He was called a runt in school which angered him and the girls. Every day Dolly would get hold of his feet and Catherine his head and pull. At sixteen he had grown to the height of an average human being.Everything was going well until Dr. Morris Ritz; a shyster came to town and talked Verena into selling Dolly&#8217;s recipe for Dropsy to him. It was the first time anyone had seen Dolly rebuff Verena.Dolly, Catherine and Collin left Verena&#8217;s house and went to live in a tree house. Two huge China trees that grew together had years ago been made into a tree house by winding the limbs together. The tree grew in such a way that steps to the tree house could easily be maneuvered even for Dolly who was a little hippy. They each took all their belongings plus the leavings from Thanksgiving dinner. The adventures that followed, well, you will just have to read this delightful story.Mr. Capote based this story on his Aunt Sook Falk, another aunt and her servant. This is his second novel. In Cold Blood scared the daylights out of me so I have shied away from Capote books since. This was a mistake I am trying to rectify. The Grass Harp is a collection of his short stories and is delightful. A Christmas Memory is another fantastic story. I agree with one reviewer who said The Grass Harp reminded him of Steinbeck&#8217;s Canary Row. Both were very funny stories."},{"Title":"The Grass Harp: Including A Tree of Night and Other Stories","review":"Just finished reading Truman Capote's story collection &#34;The Grass Harp&#34;. I smiled throughout &#34;The Grass Harp&#34; and luxuriated in his adept images and mastery of colloquial dialect and dialogue. Four out of five stars."},{"Title":"The Grass Harp: Including A Tree of Night and Other Stories","review":"The Grass Harp is a loosely-spun tale coruscating with descriptions. Capote flexes his muscles (\\"her eyes were like blue cake-icing, her hair looked like she had mopped it around a cake barrel\\") but falls just short of overdoing it. Capote lards on the sentimental description of a Southern town, with no end of kindly folks done wrong by time and love. The depth of casual, principled and institutional racism is evident in every page - in the title stories and in the other short pieces - without ever seeming to merit becoming the subject. The Grass Harp includes a set of memorable characters, especially the Judge, Catherine the toothless Negro (blackface optional), Dolly the Faulknerian other-worldly white lady, but their backstories sometimes threaten to choke the main tale, especially in the case of Sister Ida's long narrative. Still, the denouement is tidy, no less praiseworthy for being so predictable.The collection of short stories range from Poe-ish grim (Mastery of Misery, about a dream-stealer; Miriam, about a waifish wraith who besets a widow; and several others) to more Southern nostalgia tinged with horror. Here Capote starts to explore how queer his fiction might dare to be, and some scenes seem stolen from miseries in his own New York life. For example, one caddish character strings along a \\"middle aged man, rather nice, very intelligent\\" who tries to pick him up in a bookstore. He lets the man follow him seven blocks before first looking at him, letting him thrill with anticipation, before jumping in a cab and turning back with a mocking laugh. \\"the look on his face, it was awful, like Christ\\". No doubt it was Capote on the sidewalk, whose anguish rumbles through most of the stories."},{"Title":"The Ruthless Yeomen (Bridges Over Time)","review":"Anand continues the story of Norman Knight Sir Ivon de Clairpont and his descendents that she began inThe Proud Villeins. This book opens in 1271 as Isabel of Northfield can't accept her lot in life as a villein and forever tied to the land and the Lord who owns it and everyone on it. Fueled by old family legends of a freeborn ancestor, recently widowed and not wishing to marry the new husband chosen for her, she thinks she can improve her lot in life by joining the church - but evil Abbess Christiana only covets the land Isabel can bring her and very nearly ends in disaster.The next part of the story continues as a relative of Isabel's, Nicola, is married to the ill tempered Thomas Woodcarver and begins a tenuous marriage as both chafe at the bonds that tie them to the land and their overlord. When plague strikes most of the countryside they grab at their chance to escape bondage and bluff their way into taking over the tenancy of Whitmead as the \\"distant relatives\\" of the previous tenants who also died of plague. Thomas and Isabel are able to pull off their bluff, although one close call that ends in violence threatens to expose their true identity and return them to Redesmarch and serfdom. The final segment of the story tells that of their grandson John and his involvement in The Peasant's Revolt, and then finally culminates in 1399 as the newest and wholly free member of what is now called the Whitmead family is introduced and ready to begin the next chapter of the story inWomen of Ashdon.While this is not the fastest paced book and might not appeal to all readers, I did find it very enjoyable and a fascinating look at the other side of medieval life. Most of the historical novels we find set in medieval times typically deal with the kings, lords and ladies and not with the lower born classes, and this was a refreshing change to see what life was like on the other side of the coin and a completely different way of life from the ruling classes.The series in order,The Proud VilleinsThe Ruthless YeomenWomen of AshdonThe Faithful LoversThe Cherished WivesThe Dowerless SistersSome of these books a bit spendy on the used market, but I'm giving my library's ILL program a whirl and see how lucky I am (or how good they are). The first one came from a Benedictine Abbey outside of Salem Oregon, the second from the Eugene, OR public library, book #3 is the only one my library has - let's see how much my luck continues with the last three. 4/5 stars."},{"Title":"Ricky Tims' Convergence Quilts: Mysterious, Magical, Easy, and Fun","review":"I found this book quite different to most of the quilt books I own. It shows quite clearly how to put together his style of quilt and gives many options on the theme.

It will be a step away from the traditional quilts that I tend to go for."},{"Title":"Ricky Tims' Convergence Quilts: Mysterious, Magical, Easy, and Fun","review":"Reading this book improved my sewing technique and also encouraged a new freedom and joy in my design work. After using it for a while, I treated a \\"nervous nellie\\" to a private \\"get over your fears\\" sewing lesson.

It is basic strip piecing and takes advantage of some of the fabulous batiks and hand-dyed fabrics available today. Most of my quilting friends who've used this book took their basic Convergence pieced quilt top and embellished/appliqued them to the nth degree. It is a contemporary look to say the least."},{"Title":"Ricky Tims' Convergence Quilts: Mysterious, Magical, Easy, and Fun","review":"This is the easiest assembly I have ever done.

The results of each quilt is a surprise. It is now my favorite type of quilt to explore. Every quilter should try this technique at least once. The book is easy and Ricky is very specific on the areas where you need to be casual and then areas that are to be very specific. LOVE IT, LOVE IT!. For the new and experienced quilter. Batiks are perfect for this style."},{"Title":"Ricky Tims' Convergence Quilts: Mysterious, Magical, Easy, and Fun","review":"Very good book which introduces some concepts I hadn't considered. Written in an easy to understand way with loads of colour examples."},{"Title":"Ricky Tims' Convergence Quilts: Mysterious, Magical, Easy, and Fun","review":"Some quilting books show gorgeous quilts that you know you'll never make. The techniques are complex and time consuming, or the writing fails to give you confidence that you understand the steps involved. Perhaps it'd make sense if someone showed you just once... but the instructions are confusing.Ricky Tims avoids these pitfalls, with a book that is *incredibly* well written -- and yields brilliant results.Just how easy is this? I made my first convergence quilt top in two or three hours, while I was also watching a baseball game, using 4 fat quarters that I already had on hand. And I'm no quilting wiz.Since then, I've made two additional convergence quilts, and I'm sure to make several more (the holidays are coming, after all). As a quilting instructor pointed out, these are like potato chips, in that you can't stop at one. I've loved every quilt I've made, and so has everyone who has seen these quilts.Do note that the basic quilt is very small -- perfect for a wall quilt but not much more. I think you could create several of these as blocks to turn into a bed quilt, but you'd be on your own to do so. The quilt is so easy to make and I like the results so much that I am tempted to give it a try.This would be a great book for someone who is fairly new to quilting. I wouldn't suggest it as your very first book (you should do at least a few small traditional projects first), but the forgiving nature of the techique is sure to give you a quilt to be proud of. It's all straight lines, and despite the appearance of the quilt it has no complex piecing. What fun! Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Ricky Tims' Convergence Quilts: Mysterious, Magical, Easy, and Fun","review":"After reading it I ran out and bought fabrics to make my own convergence quilt. Directions were simple and clearly written, with great pictures. My only complaint is there wasn't a resource given for the beautiful fabrics used. He is coming to present his workshop at our Guild and I can hardly wait!"},{"Title":"Ricky Tims' Convergence Quilts: Mysterious, Magical, Easy, and Fun","review":"Once again I will sing the praises of Ricky Tims and his \\"think outside of the box\\" tips & techniques. He understands we are not all degreed artists, and some us are a bit more creatively challenged than others. He, once again, shows some simple, yet at times a bit daring, techniques that will yield results to impress even the best artists. (I know because I was able to WOW a couple of pros with Masters Degrees in Graphic Art.) Anyone can do this, even children. You just need to be able to bring yourself to sew it together then cut it apart, a phobia you will quickly get over. Ricky actually shows you how to \\"break the rules\\" and live with yourself for doing so, because the results are amazing & totally unique every time! These techniques work with any fabric or color choice. (I intentionally put together 3 fabrics that normally would not work with each other- purple, orange, and green- just to see, and had fantastic results!) You can't go wrong, no matter what choices you make, and best of all, you don't waste fabric! It takes only a little to \\"test\\" your idea, and even that becomes a work of art all on its own.

He chronicles his life in music and how that translated to his magnificent quilting. He brings his Granny alive to the reader, just as he does in classes. The second joy is the display of full color quilts constructed by his students from across the country. It was amazing to read the names and home towns because I've met so many of them through Ricky's classes.I have never read a quilting book from cover to cover.... but this one I did... and will again....

In my opinion, this version of Jerry Thomas' book verges on fraudulent. I don't know how in good conscience this publisher (Classic House Books) can put that title on what they have published! First, the drawings in the original are as important to the book as the printed material - and they have left out all the drawings. I believe that omission, by itself, essentially creates a misrepresentation of the original. There were at least two typos in the very short preface, alone - a rather poor reflection on the publisher. I will, from now on, avoid any book published by Classic House Books. I am returning this version of the book for a refund and I have ordered what I hope is a more historically accurate reprint. If you really want to have a reprint of Jerry Thomas' book, get a different version of it; even if you pay a little more for it, at least you will know you have something a little more authentic."},{"Title":"Hurtling wings (Classic fiction series)","review":"Galaxy Press is a publisher specializing in reprinting the literary works of L.
