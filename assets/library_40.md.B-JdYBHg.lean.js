A deeply moving memoir of a child's recollections of life in one of Tito's concentration camps. A story not only of survival but of triumph over deadly adversity. This is a most valuable contribution to the too little known saga of the ethnic cleansing of the Donauschwabians after WWII. As a fellow survivor from another village I was often moved to tears as I read this memoir. Enriched by deeply evocative family photos, touching but never vengeful, A Pebble in MY Shoe deserves a wide readership. A triumph from a wise and generous survivor."},{"Title":"A Pebble in My Shoe","review":"This is a beautifully told (true) story that is both heartrending and inspiring. It is a journal of the author and her family's struggle to survive in the chaos of post-WWII Europe. Her story underscores the suffering caused by intolerant, despotic, insensitive government and the amazing power of hope, optimism, and the will to find a better life. Reading this book has opened my eyes to things I used to take for granted."},{"Title":"A Pebble in My Shoe","review":"This book gives a first hand look at what life was like for the German Donauschwaben who were victims of Tito's ethnic cleansing. At the age of eight, Katherine Flotz' world turns upside down. Through her eyes we learn about the brutal abuse that her family endured. This book also helps us realize that her story is not an isolated incident since she is only one of the 15 million Germans who were displaced (2 million of them murdered)during this time. My hats off to the author for having the courage to write about this difficult period in her life so that we may learn more about it."},{"Title":"A Pebble in My Shoe","review":"Want your life enriched? Read this book! Want to understand the value of perseverance, the resilience of children, the un-tethered endurance to survive? Read this book! As illustrated through their memoir, Katherine and George teach us more than just an unannounced accounting of post-WWII Eastern Europe. They teach us about family, about the will to live, about the soul and how one can survive anything while suspended by a single thread of hope.The trauma and pain suffered by the two families is unimaginable. Yet, the world knew little of what was happening to the thousands of innocent ethnic Germans left behind to fend for themselves in the wake of Hitler's crimes. Despite their families having lived in Yugoslavia for some 200 plus years, the ethnic Germans would face a death penalty for having German surnames. While they knew little of Hitler, and even less about his audacious adventures of domination, the German settlers of Yugoslavia turned baron land into the breadbasket of Europe. They were a very proud people demonstrating a strong work ethic as well as developing harmony among all living in Yugoslavia. Yet, their payment for their hard work was to be thrown into concentration camps, stolen from, starved, raped, and murdered; a complete people's way of life decimated. The world in the meantime, with a blind eye turned to Yugoslavia, convicted Nazi war criminals for similar crimes committed in WWII. I can only ask, how hypocritical was this?Their survival alone is miraculous. But, to learn that these two continued life after losing so much, then immigrating to America to become successful in a new life, is even more amazing. Many of us would have had to seek psychological counseling for life. Not Katherine and George. They pressed on, and found a life that was meaningful and fulfilling. They created that life by centering on family enabled by love. They are by any stretch of the meaning, models for all of us! In the context of a bigger story, they are but two who refused to kneel to tyranny. They are but two who refused to let the communist regime of Yugoslavia win an insane war against good and innocence.It is with great enthusiasm that I endorse A Pebble In My Shoe as a book that has changed my life. The lessons I have learned from this testimony are still being discovered...a full year after I first read it. You will most surely be rewarded by reading A Pebble In My Shoe!"},{"Title":"A Pebble in My Shoe","review":"In her inspiring and thoughtful memoir, A Pebble in My Shoe, Katherine Hoeger Flotz tells the story of her and her husband's separate escapes from persecution at the end of WWII. The story of Katherine and George were equally fascinating, moving, and disturbing. My overall sense, at the end of the book, is one of astonishment. The incredible strength, determination, sense of survival, hopefulness, and faith exhibited from this amazing couple is nothing short of unbelievable. But, what's even more mind-boggling is that their stories are just two of the thousands/millions of other \\"displaced\\" ethnic Germans--stories to which the public seems to be largely unaware. But, their story is fully representative of these brave people who left all they knew and loved to start over in a strange, frightening, and challenging USA.The experiences of Katherine and George are described in Katherine's spare and straightforward style. She doesn't embellish...because she doesn't have to. Instead, she takes the reader on both of their journeys, the Flotz family journey and the Hoeger family journey, and their related family journeys that were occurring simultaneously. I found her words to be emotionally engaging while maintaining an authentic believability and fittingly descriptive point of view. And, Katherine skillfully handles the changes in story line, time period, chronology of events, and character development.Katherine relates for the reader the searing pain of losing her home, her belongings, and, eventually, her parents and other family members. And, Katherine reveals an extraordinary awareness, throughout her development, of her loving and caring cadre of family members who didn't allow her to be an orphan--who refused to leave her behind. She engages her readers as she shares her story and her ongoing healing from the soul-tearing effects of losing her mother and father as well as other family members while being in constant fear of losing her sister.I thank Katherine Hoeger Flotz for this beautiful and moving story. I know I will use her words to inspire my own thoughts. And, I know I have learned from her the value of perseverance and faith.I found the book to be in my \\"couldn't put it down\\" category, and, actually, I read it one sitting. As a career educator, I truly believe the book should be required reading for high school students as it shines a bright light on a rarely discussed historical topic while teaching the lessons of strength, endurance, and compassion. Thank you, Katherine, for this amazing story!"},{"Title":"The Last Good Day: a Joanne Kilbourn Mystery (Joanne Kilbourn Mysteries)","review":"I love the Joanne Kilbourn mystery series for a few major facets:(1) The heroine is an independant widowed woman with a strong sense of family, and yet is not reduced to being a simpering victim or wailing emotional wreck. She handles things, and handles them as well as any one could.(2) The strong Canadian content to the stories: be it simple things like surnames that show a european background, or native rights issues, or any number of uniquely Canadian flavours, Bowen finds a niche for them in her books that adds to the story.(3) The mystery is always a good one, and hard to puzzle out any faster than her heroine.Joanne retires to a languid summer at \\"Lawyer's Bay,\\" where one power law firm seems to rool the roost. When a shocking suicide starts the vacation on a dark turn, Joanne once again finds herself in the middle of the lives of those around her, trying to dig out the dark secrets, and learn if the suicide was even that. When her ex-lover Alex Kequahtooway gets involved, things seem even more personal. The tension keeps rising, and as always, Bowen delivers a stunning finale. Well done."},{"Title":"The Last Good Day: a Joanne Kilbourn Mystery (Joanne Kilbourn Mysteries)","review":"Gail Bowen has done it again! She somehow manages to write an intriguing mystery plot and sprinkle in wonderfully normal family life elements to make for a comfortable and compelling read. With some authors, the end result would be choppy, but Gail Bowen makes it really work. Every time I pick up a new book in the series, I feel like I'm visiting old friends who will keep me entertained from start to finish."},{"Title":"The Last Good Day: a Joanne Kilbourn Mystery (Joanne Kilbourn Mysteries)","review":"The mystery novels of Gail Bowen set in Saskatchewan follow the lives of Joanne Kilbourn and her family. While all entries are enjoyable, this one is particularly enthralling.After receiving an invitation from her lawyer friend to rent his cabin situated in an area referred to as \\"Lawyers' Bay\\" for the summer, Joanne happily packs up her adopted daughter, her son and his girlfriend for what she anticipates will be a restful and relaxing vacation. While celebrating Canada Day, Joanne has a conversation with one of the partners in the \\"power firm\\" of Falconer Shreve and learns he is extemely depressed. By the end of the celebration though, he seems in better humor. So it is a shock when he commits suicide later that night.When she learns that a young female associate appears to have vanished after leaving Falconer Shreve, Joanne's investigation leads to troubling questions. As she is drawn deeper into the investigation, the answers have a devestating affect on those she loves.As I came to the conclusion of the novel, I said \\"oh no\\" out loud. It is a powerful ending to a very well written book. I cannot recommend this novel strongly enough."},{"Title":"The Last Good Day: a Joanne Kilbourn Mystery (Joanne Kilbourn Mysteries)","review":"This latest in the Joanne Kilbourn series gets off to a very slow beginning. At about 50 pages in, I almost set the novel aside. I had seen movies based on Bowen's previous mysteries and enjoyed them very much. So I was puzzled. But then the pace picked up. The apparent suicide of a lawyer who had confided in Kilbourn the night before is a signal that not all is right in Lawyer's Bay and,in particular,with the members of Falconer Schreve who all have lavish summer homes there. Joanne discovers that a young associate has gone missing from the law firm, supposedly to better job in Vancouver but that is a ruse.As the plot advances Joanne learns that her former lover,police inspector Alex, is involved with the wife of one of the lawyers and appears to be implicated in a coverup. After a slow start the story races to a shocking finish."},{"Title":"The Last Good Day: a Joanne Kilbourn Mystery (Joanne Kilbourn Mysteries)","review":"Joanne Kilbourne takes her son Angus, his girlfriend, and Taylor, her adopted daughter, for a restful summer on the shores of a lake not far outside Regina, Saskatchewan. She has been given use of a friend's cottage inside a gated community for the sole use of families of the law firm Falconer Shreve. At a Canada Day barbecue-beach party, she meets all the partners. Chris Altieri, one of the partners, confides in an oblique and confusing way that he has something for which he has to atone, then later that night commits suicide by driving his car into the lake and drowning. Was it really suicide, and if so why has he done this? Joanne cannot let these questions rest, as her former lover Alex enters the investigation. Fortunately, Joanne finds a new male interest in one of the law partners.I read five Joanne Kilbourne novels years ago, then lost track of Gail Bowen, a Canadian author whose books are not well-distributed in the United States. Due to the power of the Internet, I recently rediscovered her and am having a great time catching up with Joanne."},{"Title":"The Last Good Day: a Joanne Kilbourn Mystery (Joanne Kilbourn Mysteries)","review":"Gail Bowen has done it again!

Paul McHugh's ideas and understanding make for facinating and thought provoking reading. I have seldom seen such brave and independent thinking in this field of study. In an age where reality offends and professors are dulling themselves to the university \\"group think\\", this work will be an intellectual milestone within the neglected field of psychiatric ethics.Richard Howlin, Ph.D.Clinical Developmental Psychologist"},{"Title":"The Mind Has Mountains: Reflections on Society and Psychiatry","review":"There is so little written regarding psychiatry for the lay audience that makes much sense or is of serious value. While I am not necessarily one to toe the line with regard to Dr. McHugh's hard-line Catholicism, I will say that he is spot-on in lambasting the bad and standing up for the good within psychiatry and our very society, all in this compact little book. This is as indispensable as Strunk and White for all psychiatrists, psychologists, teachers, social workers, parents, singles, and patients. If you've ever wanted to drug children for being children or go to therapy over being dumped by a perpetual adolescent or alter oathes that have lasted millenia simply to please administrators, then there is an essay in here for you. Whether one agrees with him or not, Dr. McHugh's voice is too clarion to ignore."},{"Title":"The Mind Has Mountains: Reflections on Society and Psychiatry","review":"This book should be required reading in all the \\"helping professions.\\" Dr. McHugh takes on the \\"acceptable thought\\" of psychiatry and, in my opinion, gives it a beating. His moral beliefs are strong, and he outlines and defends them well on difficult topics like Jack Kevorkian and Terri Schiavo. I thought very differently until I read him; he has managed to cause me to have second thoughts, which is not an easy thing to do. His concern for the patient shines through everything he writes, and he writes brilliantly. He can be overbearing and arrogant in spots, but it is actually refreshing to hear someone in this field with the courage to put his clear convictions out there for the rest of us."},{"Title":"The Mind Has Mountains: Reflections on Society and Psychiatry","review":"In 1909, during a lecture at Clark University, Dr. Sigmund Freud, the founder of psychoanalysis, who was educated to be a neurologist, told his audience in Massachusetts that he was pleased and satisfied that psychoanalysis would only accompany medical doctors for a short distance but then \\"take leave of them.\\"Just how far this distance would grow and how unfortunate the consequences of the separation between psychoanalysis and scientific medicine would be for our culture, and indeed all of society, is one of the topics in this new, five-part book, \\"The Mind Has Mountains.\\" The author, Dr. Paul McHugh, former chair of the department of psychiatry at Johns Hopkins Medical School, has put together a collection of his scholarly articles.Harold Bloom in his column, \\"Why Freud Matters,\\" (Wall Street Journal, May 5, 2006) advised us that despite the fact that no one today believes that psychoanalysis is a science, it cannot be gainsaid that \\"Freud ... was the equal of the other major writers of his era, James Joyce, Marcel Proust and Franz Kafka.\\" Freudianism, along with its creative and imaginative platonic-like constructs (id, ego, libido, etc.) continues to impact society.A reader of \\"The Mind Has Mountains\\" will have a balanced, erudite critique of Freud's continuing influence. Unlike the work of Freud and his progeny, Dr. McHugh's \\"Reflections\\" are based not on personal opinions or unproven theses, but are the fruit of years of painstaking, empirically verified research coupled with the vast clinical experience of the author and his colleagues at Johns Hopkins and other major university hospitals.The book is not narrowly limited to psychoanalysis, but treats the whole range of issues which psychiatry faces today. From Part I, \\"Beginnings,\\" until the last chapters in Part V, \\"The Ethical Use of Embryonic Stem Cells\\" and \\"A Psychiatrist Looks at Terrorism,\\" the book covers a breadth of subject matter in engaging language that is accessible to the layman."},{"Title":"The Mind Has Mountains: Reflections on Society and Psychiatry","review":"This is a fantastic book that explores the depths that modern psychiatry has only recently rebounded from, and is in danger of relapsing into. McHugh is a fairly balanced thinker, and pretty well-informed. The article on sex reassignment surgery is an absolute gem that challenges psychiatry to look its dogma in the face. Occasionally, there is a tendency to be extremely conservative. The Terry Schiavo comparison to the Nazi's extermination is a bit hyperbolic, although his point that there was no fMRI, PET, or even conventional MRI to _scientifically_ enlighten the debate is a very good one. The slippery slope argument is valid, but I think focusing of the right to keep alive by tube-feeding is going to distract from more clear-cut issues. Finally, McHugh outlines where the future of psychiatry might lead and how we have to make crucial decisions at this point in history to keep the art in accordance with truly Hippocratic principles.In short, every psychiatrist should read it, but I am sad to say there are many who won't because they lack the capacity to be self-critical."},{"Title":"The Mind Has Mountains: Reflections on Society and Psychiatry","review":"McHugh provides biological,psychological,and psychiatric insights in a thoughtful, scholarly, and highly readible commentary."},{"Title":"The Mind Has Mountains: Reflections on Society and Psychiatry","review":"The book was in excellent condition and arrived quickly.This author was recommended as someone who truly understands the disease of schizophrenia. Reading his explanations regarding the lack of understanding concerning the distinctions between mood disorders, psychotic disorders, and addictions helps bring clarity to the dearth of treatment for those with schizophrenia today."},{"Title":"The Mind Has Mountains: Reflections on Society and Psychiatry","review":"Having encountered the fads of the 70's-80's,I had come to take a very dim view of the profession. It is a relief to see that change is in the air, science is back in the saddle (or nearly), and a refreshing practicality guides at least some practitioners."},{"Title":"The Mind Has Mountains: Reflections on Society and Psychiatry","review":"An excellent collection of essays by Dr. Paul McHugh. Having been a student of Dr. McHugh's, these essays reveal his thoughtfulness and incredible grasp of things medical, social, and psychological.

The future is bright thanks to the foresight and leadership of Dr. McHugh and his colleagues at Johns Hopkins, among others."},{"Title":"This Old House by the Lake","review":"the gifts and the defects of age have always fascinated me, and this gripping story of rebuilding and building a house, a life, a relationship and a loving restingplace, at a mature age, in the little-written-about society of contemporary Hungary, in a village little changed since medieval times, was a page-turner for me. It's one of those books which make you like people more - all the people in it, even the most tardy and inefficient workman. It is infused with the plucky, anxious, wonderfully open-to-happiness personality of its heroine, the writer, and has a strong, silent hero in her husband. A pro-life book, in every sense"},{"Title":"This Old House by the Lake","review":"THIS OLD HOUSE BY THE LAKE had me laughing and crying! It is a real and personal story of trial and triumph. And at its most important level, it is a story of love -- the kind of love for which we all hope! In an earlier age, the author's husband might have found a place in Carlyle's Heroes and Hero-Worship! An enriching experience in reading."},{"Title":"This Old House by the Lake","review":"This book is highly entertaining, and gives an insight about the sensitive soul of the author.

But few books cause falling down, tears streaming down the face, gasping for air laughter. This book had me giggling, then laughing, then roaring. Do NOT eat while reading this book, you may choke. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Neither Here Nor There","review":"To those of you who have not visited Europe, do so and this book will be even more funny than it already is. Amazingly recognisably and absolutely hilarious, Bill really captured the essence of Europe (J/K)! But to be serious, which even Bryson can do and in a very entertaining and interesting way, he seems to have experienced exactly those little things that you might not notice when you're doing the Europe-in-a-Week tour, but that are definitely there for the more observant traveller.I am quite sure most Europeans will recognise their own country in this book. I know I did! (The Netherlands) But even more interesting were the countries I visited, such as Norway, where the movies are quite a strange experience. One buys a ticket that has a preassigned seat, as theatres in europe often do. Naturally you just sit down wherever you like, who cares about the ticket? And even then the tickets are distributed so that people are evenly spread through the theater. However, in Norway, they have a mysterious system that, I'm sure for some strange incomprehensible reason, places everyone in the middle of the theater, stuck together in a small group. Now the system wasn't what amazed. What was truly strange, was that people actually abided by these &quot;rules&quot;! It wasn't until my Norwegian friend and I decided this was absurd, got up, and reassigned our own seats,m that some people suddenly managed to get the courage to get out of those seats and actually... move two seats over! Wow.Then of course there are the french. Whenever I tell people about Bill Bryson, I grab this book, and look up the story about Bryson going to the bakery's in Paris. (not exactly quoted, don't have the book with me, but pretty accurate probably) In French, he attempts to ask for a loaf of bread please. Of course he gets the &quot;who the hell are you and what the hell are you trying to say&quot; look first, then the woman reaches behind the counter, grabs something, and then slams a dead beaver onto the counter. In his very best french, he tries to explain that he did not ASK for a dead beaver, he wanted a loaf of BREAD. The woman looks at the other costumers and says, in french much too fast for him to understand, something about the stupid foreigner asking for a dead beaver, about her then giving him a dead beaver, and now he's saying he didn't want a dead beaver at all, he wants a loaf of bread. Of course the other customers then looked at him &quot;like he had just farted in their handbags&quot;, and he quickly leaves France for Belgium, where he'll hopefully get something to eat again.This is just a taste of what you'll read. Need I say more? Bill Bryson speaks for himself, wherever he travels!"},{"Title":"Neither Here Nor There","review":"You will laugh so hard you will embarrass yourself. Bill Bryson is the best. His experiences with the strange behavior of Europeans just brings me back to my days as a student abroad. This book, like all of Bryson's, is meant for the English-speaking public. I can't imagine it would translate. His prose is desperately funny. I think this one is my favorite."},{"Title":"Neither Here Nor There","review":"Once again Bill Bryson delivers. Despite much of his sometimes cynical humour - and some of it made me laugh loudly - one gets the impression through-out of a warm-hearted person making his solo journey in Europe. Bryson's enjoyment is contagious."},{"Title":"Neither Here Nor There","review":"Bill Bryson is so right on with the quirks of Europe. It's a great read for those who've traveled there, because he can take you back to those moments and make you laugh. I recommend to my friends who haven't been there to let them know how Europe really is. Even after being to Europe and reading his book, I'm still going back there on Vacation !!!"},{"Title":"Neither Here Nor There","review":"A hilarious madcap ride through Europe. Bill Bryson always makes me laugh out loud. Don't miss the chapters on France and Belgium; they are priceless, especially if you have ever spent any time in those countries. This book is a must-read for all those with wanderlust and a sense of humor."},{"Title":"Neither Here Nor There","review":"I really did laugh out loud at times. Bryson tells of travels in Europe both of recent times and flashbacks to a trip through Europe when he was younger. I especially enjoyed the parts on places of Europe that I have visited myself. I was a little disappointed there wasn't much time spent in Germany. In this book, Bryson seems to try and get laughs at the expense of people. I had to knock off a star for that."},{"Title":"Neither Here Nor There","review":"It helps to already be a Bryson fan, but if you are new to the joys of reading his books, settle in, and enjoy. Bryson has been an outsider himself, having lived in England for many years. He moved back to the USA after two decades, tried it for a while, and moved back to England. He knows about being a stranger in a strange land. When he makes observation on the eccentricities, endearing qualities, advantages, and frustrating foibles of the places he visits (including those in the USA), he does it with humor, intelligence, a satirical bent, a very precise eye,insight--and did I say, humor? You will laugh out loud at least once. The paperback is inexpensive, the enjoyment immense."},{"Title":"Neither Here Nor There","review":"Having been in a few places in Europe, I can relate to what Bill Bryson is talking about. But if I had never been, I still could relate. His humour, the way he has of connecting past musings with his present surroundings is skillful and funny. I sit by myself and giggle at the way he takes a thought and stretches it like PlaDoh into a ridiculous mental play with him playing the star fool. He does not spare himself and he does not disappoint. We are entirely there with him. A wonderful read."},{"Title":"Neither Here Nor There","review":"This book is hilarious.If you've ever travelled Europe or wanted to this book puts you into the passenger's seat. One of his earlier works, Bryson has the uncanny ability to distill what's funny about a people, place or situation and stamp his own brand of humour on it.I've read all his books, I reckon this is 'Bryson's Best' to date."},{"Title":"Neither Here Nor There","review":"Bill Bryson is to embellishment like a hammer is to a nail. They go together.Slamming his typical sarcastic wit to the sights, sounds, smells and situations throughout his European travels, Bryson rivets the reader with an imbibed smile. Swallow it down. This is humor at its sneering finest.I've never had a desire to go to Europe. Just never have. Still don't. But to read of Bryson's experiences and the way he details it, makes for a fun read. Sure there is exaggeration and ridicule, so what? This is what makes life enjoyable.Some can not take embellishment or fault-finding humor (evidently they missed out on the laugh chromosome when born or developed that way later in life). Sad. They are missing out. What a dull, gray existence if one can not laugh at themself or get a chuckle from observing others. Might as well live in a cave. Which nowadays many seem to do.Anyway, if there is anyone to bring a smile within the pages of a book, it is Bill Bryson."},{"Title":"Neither Here Nor There","review":"This was an enjoyable, undemanding read. At his best, Bryson is grouchily funny, though not as hilarious IMO as some other reviews would have you believe. He is better when describing the rough spots of travel than its pleasures. At times, an unattractive whining tone takes over - for instance, when he complains how a particular location, like Florence, is overrun by tourists. But I'd be lying if I didn't admit to finding his skewering of the Swiss and the Austrians pretty much on target.Three stars, because Bryson never approaches the level of a travel writer like Jan Morris, whose essays are infinitely superior."},{"Title":"Neither Here Nor There","review":"Bill Bryson has written so many hilarious books that it's hard to say which is the funniest, but when I meet someone who is new to Bryson's work, again and again I find myself recommending this one.The one-liners (\\"Italians park as if they've just spilled a beaker of hydrocloric acid in their laps\\") are funny no matter how well-travelled (or non-travelled) you are, and the prose is so descriptive and wonderful that you learn as you go along.As far as I'm concerned Bill Bryson is the finest non-fiction writer of our time."},{"Title":"Neither Here Nor There","review":"Although Bill Bryson books are very popular (and deservedly so!), what originally prompted me to read one was a comment in a review of John Donoghue's book called Shakespeare My Butt! which likened John's style of writing and humor to that of Bill's. Since I'd enjoyed John's hilariously funny book so much, which is in part about his own escapades around the strangely named places in the North East of England, I thought I would give one of Bill's books a go too. I was certainly not disappointed. What a great book \`Neither Here nor There: Travels in Europe' is.It chronicles Bill's escapades as a solo traveler around Europe in a hilariously funny way. Being pick-pocketed in Florence, food ordering dilemmas in Germany, hotel nightmares in Luxembourg, lethal motorists in Paris, and more - much more. It's all in there, and we've all been through similar situations too on our own travels. Bill's observation of Europe is spot-on, and the wit that he uses to relate his traveling experiences to his audience takes no prisoners. It's pure comic genius and certainly had me laughing.Now the only problem is that I can't decide who my favorite author is, John or Bill - so I guess they will both have to take joint pride of place on my bookshelf!"},{"Title":"Neither Here Nor There","review":"This may be the most funny book I've ever read. The best way to experience it is to have a glass of wine and read it aloud with a friend - certain parts will have you rolling. Seriously, it also turned out to be the most helpful book I had when I did my backpacking tour through Europe. His observations are not only hilarious but dead-on accurate most of the time. Visiting some of the out-of-the-way places he did will make your trip all the better, whether you agree with him or not. It's certainly possibly to satirize a place you love, as Bryson obviously does in all his books."},{"Title":"Neither Here Nor There","review":"I agree with several other readers in that this isn't Bryson's best book. However, that doesn't keep it from being a funny, quick read into how Bryson sees Europe.Throughout this book, Bryson recconects with a European vacation he took with his friend Katz after college. He wants to revisit the places he saw - now, of course, with a much more jaded eye. He visits some new places too, among them the Arctic circle and Rome. Rome was for me the funniest part of the book - particularly Bryson's take on his travel guides!Are his observations always on target, and always kind? No, of course not. But, it's still an interesting look at how an American (who writes humor for a living) sees a different culture."},{"Title":"Neither Here Nor There","review":"i simply cannot fathom how one would grow tired of this book, or so disgruntled with it as to give it a less than 5 or 4 star rating. i grew up as an only child, so there was never much need to laugh out loud at, say, the television, or a book i was reading. BUT this book had me laughing absolutely painfully and out loud. yes, it's a book-reviewer's cliche, but it's true. bill bryson has a cynicism by which his tales always border on the sarcasticly absurd, but not so negative that his love for life does not shine through, and also not so exaggerative that the truth is hidden. this book is a real find, and i have since read 2 more of bryson's books (walk in the woods, stranger here myself), and have yet to grow tired of his musings."},{"Title":"Neither Here Nor There","review":"I know that a few were turned off by Bryson's relentless criticism of just about every place he ventured. He rehashes many old stereotypes and prejudices. But, I guess that I should hate to admit, but I don't, I found it immensely amusing, and I know that much of it is based in fact. I think that many of his critics forget that he is trying to entertain more so than he is trying to educate - the point of this book is not to provide to the reader a travelogue with precise cultural detail - but to relate BB's impressions as he traveled Europe, and as BB is a humorist, you expect that humor to pervade his observations. I didn't find this particularly meanspirited."},{"Title":"Neither Here Nor There","review":"The first time I read this book I was on an Amtrack heading toward Seattle. I only made it to page 30 than I had to put it away. I was laughing so much, the people around me were becoming annoyed. Bill Bryson's work belongs right up there with Ted Simon and Sean Condon, all who have the ability to make you laugh, think and become a part of their adventures. I strongly recommend this book for anyone who has traveled, and for those of you that have not traveled, read this book, buy a ticket to anywhere and try living a bit."},{"Title":"Neither Here Nor There","review":"Neither here nor There was the first Byrson book I read, and have subsequently obsessively read all the others. This is by far the funniest. Avoid reading it in public, as others may find your sudden outbursts of hysterical laughter grounds for you being admitted to a mental institution. This book is not however for the easily offended"},{"Title":"Neither Here Nor There","review":"I'm a long time fan of Bryson, so picking up any book by him is like getting a warm email from an old friend. I've also traveled extensively through Europe, much of which solo, so I had a deep appreciation for his experiences. I wonder if this was my first Bryson experience, or I had not traveled to the places he visited (or had traveled much at all) would I like this book as much as I did? Perhaps not. But for Bryson fans, and world travelers, take this on the plane during your next 7+hour journey. It may be two decades old, but, well, not much has changed, shall we say."},{"Title":"Neither Here Nor There","review":"Having lived in the Netherlands for ten years, I found this book amusing and interesting. I had experienced a lot of what I read or knew the areas quite well, as author Bill Bryson told his humorous tales.At first I wondered why he did this without his wife and then realized it was to gather information for the book. This choice to go alone probably gave us better insight on his travels, as it was about his adventures rather than a family experience.It would take me reams of paper to tell the best parts of this book, because it is all good, and funny. I don't laugh at many books but I had tears in my eyes with some of the exploits I read about. Even to buying souvenirs Mr. Bryson made it a amusing situation, such as buying crucifix corn- on- the- cob holders or a Musical Last Supper toilet paper holder from shops in the Vatican City. Equally amusing was his rendition of using the Italian-English phrases in Fodor's guide to Italy. Not to spoil your fun, I won't elaborate, but run out and buy this book, now in reprint form. While you are at it, buy several copies for gifts for those of your friends and relatives who want to, wanted to, or will travel to Europe. Bill Bryson's Neither Here Nor There is the perfect book for armchair traveling."},{"Title":"Neither Here Nor There","review":"I purchased this book because I was looking for something \\"light\\" to read on my morning commute... The book has its moments and it is enjoyable- however, I did find it surprising how Bryson, who obviously travels frequently and extensively, seems not very sophisticated and frankly monotone... His descriptions sometimes are stereotypical (like when he describes Naples-when was the last time he actually went there???)...Certainly not a great travelogue, but entertaining at times. Despite the shortcomings, I still enjoyed reading it on my train : )"},{"Title":"Neither Here Nor There","review":"Bill Bryson has a great life. He gets to just set out galavanting through Europe at will, then scribble down his musings. But what musings they are. Reading this was an introduction to a different kind of travel writing. Most books set up a city, then give hotel and restaurant recommendations. Bryson never mentions any business by name. The book is more about his personal journey than being able to replicated it on your own trip to Europe. If only we could all have such carefree journeys as this."},{"Title":"Neither Here Nor There","review":"Bill Bryson is one, if not THE, funniest author of our time!I am now the proud owner (and protector) of ALL of Bryson's travel memoirs and have read and re-read them more times than I care to mention.There is one BIG PROBLEM though. They are TOO funny. The sudden outbursts of belly laughs. The loud snorts of hilarity. Sometimes loud enough to frighten little children and old ladies, not to mention spouses and strangers in a park.I was even accused of contributing to the delinquency of a highly educated adult by an annoyed spouse who was so disgusted by his wife's fits of giggles that he said...\\"why are you reading such a vacuous book?\\" He'll never, ever be able to understand unless he finally breaks down and reads a Bill Bryson Book.Now that Bryson has moved back to the U.K. after leaving New Hampshire and been appointed Chancellor of Durham University in the U.K. he hasn't chronicled a new travel memoir in quite a while.I've emailed him via his Facebook page begging him to \\"hit the road\\" but to no avail.I guess I'll just have to start all over again at the beginning and re-read one of my favorite Bryson books, \\"Neither Here Nor There\\"."},{"Title":"Neither Here Nor There","review":"Everything is good enough.The book is beautifully printed and artistically bound,and the packing is strong enough.Anyway,that's kind of the idea."},{"Title":"Neither Here Nor There","review":"Well written, funny in places, easy to pickup anytime/place and gives you an insite of places most people will never visit. Worth a read."},{"Title":"Neither Here Nor There","review":"The book was in great condition and arrived very quickly! Thank you very much for it. I look forward to shopping with you again!"},{"Title":"Neither Here Nor There","review":"Bryson is curious, clever and has a terrific way with turning a phrase. Spending time with him is always interesting and often fascinating."},{"Title":"Neither Here Nor There","review":"Reading Neither Here Nor There made me think that I won't die happy if I don't get to see Capri, and I determined that there were several other cities I don't ever wish to visit. I also learned that a certain brand of travelers' checks is terrible, and I won't be using them in this lifetime.It is interesting to read this book in it's Communist-era, pre-Euro context. Empty shops in Bulgaria and discussion of purchasing things with dinars and schillings was very interesting. Unfortunately, reading the book even as I did, spreading the chapters out over several days, I still got that \\"If it's Tuesday, this must be Belgium\\" feeling. I began to lose track of where Bill saw the beautiful sunset, or where his pocket was picked.I was also disappointed by Bryson's alarming views towards animals and cavalier comments about hating them and wanting them killed. Dogs hate him, and this fact has provided much humor in his writing over the years, but the tangents he went on regarding his loathing of companion animals were over the top and distinctly unfunny. So was his anti-Arabic rant during one of his many visits to queues for financial situations. I may be more sensitive to such things in light of recent world events, as comments about the guttural nature of German language or the expense of traveling in Switzerland didn't bother me, but this did.The funniest anecdotes were the ones Bryson shared about his previous travels through Europe with his friend Katz. Katz provided a hugely politically-incorrect thread of humor in the book, and at times I thought he would have made a more interesting traveling companion. Heresy, I know.All in all, I'm very glad I read the book, and I got many laughs out of it, but it was no Walk in the Woods."},{"Title":"Neither Here Nor There","review":"Unless you're really into &quot;humorous&quot; stories about travelling gone awry, don't waste your money on this book. The theme of the aloof American traveller getting into a mess abroad with chattering, irrational foreigners is outmoded and trivial. Bryson is obnoxiously critical of Europeans and their ways, making this book, in spite of its occasional tolerably funny passages, one of the most ridiculous and unpalatable books I've read in a long while. I get the impression that Bryson the American feels he is always right and the childish Europeans are always wrong and immature."},{"Title":"Neither Here Nor There","review":"i found this book to be such a downer. almost every new location he visits there's always something wrong. it might be the locals are mean, some parts of the cities are dreary and could be so much more beautiful, the trains run too slow, god forbid a local that can't help him because he doesn't speak english, or things are just too expensive. waaaah, waaaaah, waaaaaah. you know what? how about trying to find the positive things when you travel and write about those? use the negative things that happen as anecdotes but not the focus. i've been to many of those places he wrote about and have really great memories and i don't focus on the negative. so what, florence can be hot and crowded in the summer, but is that what i want to remember? no! i want to remember seeing the duomo for the first time or walking the boboli gardens. why do i want to read about someone bitching and complaining about how traveling can sometimes be work and things don't always go the way we want. that's part of traveling. he should feel lucky to even have the privilege to travel and probably be paid for it at the same time! the book is in the recycle bin."},{"Title":"Neither Here Nor There","review":"Although the book is loosely based on Bryson's old and new travels through Europe, you learn remarkably little about the continent. This is because Mr Bryson himself is too preoccupied with high cost of orange juice in hotels and memories of his teenage travels with a flatulence-happy friend to notice anything of interest.Shallow anti-German and anti-Austrian outbursts do not add value to the book, and neither do annoying complaints about the costs of food in Scandinavia. Firstly, Mr Bryson is hardly a man who finds it difficult to afford a pizza anywhere in the world, secondly, his leftist admiration of extravagant social provision in Denmark somehow does not translate into understanding where all the money comes from.This is a funny book, but you cannot help noticing that there was no need for Mr Bryson to travel to Europe: he could have produced something equally funny from his weekend trip to a supermarket or car dealer."},{"Title":"Neither Here Nor There","review":"Having read five of Bill Bryson's books (including the excellent, \\"A Walk in the Woods\\"), I was looking forward to this book. I traveled to Europe and Africa in 1971 for nearly six months when everyone was carrying the book \\"Europe on $5 a Day.\\" I followed up with a short trip back to Europe in 1985 and then again many times years later. I was very interested in reading this book, since I had been to all the places Bill was writing about. e.g., even Sofia and Istanbul. This book was a major disapointment. Not very informative, interesting or FUNNY! There were some interesting facts, but usually just whinning and comments about how lousy a time he was having and all the unpleasant and unattractive people he encountered. I am sure all this was designed to make the book more readable and humorous, but I found practically nothing funny in this book. I guess you bomb out on a book every once and a while. Bryson appeared to be a self-centered, pissed off, ugly American traveler--the very ones he hated and mocked in his book."},{"Title":"Neither Here Nor There","review":"I shouldn't like this book. I should hate this book. I should complain,deride and denounce this book because every time I read it, I wet my pants laughing. It should be illegal to make someone laugh so hard she wets her pants. It's embarrassing. This book is so addictive that I tend to pick it up wherever I see it. Since I am an avid reader, I pick it up in book stores and libraries. It's humiliating to be standing in a bookstore with your legs crossed and a warm stream of pee tickling down your thighs because you can't stop laughing. I should also be mad because Bill Bryson clearly stole all my experiences of travelling to Europe for the first time. I'm the one who couldn't understand the English language the way the English speak it, who thought they were angry when they said they were \\"pissed\\" and didn't know it meant \\"drunk.\\" I'm the one who spent the night trying to figure out what I was supposed to do with the window because the innkeeper told me, \\"Fold the pane.\\" Bryson stole all my material. The only reason I'm not mad is because he writes it all so beautifully, weaving the jokes into the story into the irony into the drama into the comedy, and does it so beautifully that this book disappears in hours when by rights it should take days to read because it is so full of experiences. I denounce Bill Bryson. Off with his head. Send him back to Europe, but please let him pack his pencil and his sense of humour before he goes. He is a national treasure."},{"Title":"Neither Here Nor There","review":"Bryson covers lots of cities and interactions with locals; his encounter with Austrians in a pub makes for chilling reading. The book is four stars rather than 5 because the light style encourages reading but the lack of maps, photos, and other exhibits prevents a 5-star award."},{"Title":"Neither Here Nor There","review":"I love travelogues, but I've never read any of Bryson's books, so I can't say whether it's one of his best or not. But on its own merits, I enjoyed the writing and his views of the different parts of Europe. He comes up with some wonderful metaphors, and the book held my interest throughout. At age 42, I no longer feel I have to read every word of a book--life's too short, so skip the parts you don't care about--but I did read every word of this one.BUT--on the last page, when he decides to go home, he reveals that his wife is pregnant again and he really thinks maybe he ought to get back. WHAT??!! What kind of lowdown leaves his pregnant wife and kids fending for themselves while he gallivants around Europe for a couple months? What kind of idiot woman stays married to such a schmuck? I lost all respect for Bryson then and there.But still, you can't deny the writing is good and enjoyable. So read it, just skip the last page. :)"},{"Title":"Neither Here Nor There","review":"There is no doubt that Bill Bryson can make me laugh. Out loud even! Bryson's whimsical description of his stop and go tour through Europe constantly entertains. I learnt about Europe, the idiosyncrasies of its places and people.Probably one of the highlights was Bryson's hilarious description of his desperation to reach the toilet of his hotel room while his terribly overfull bladder is bursting. Without giving my belly a chance to recover from laughing, this account was immediately followed by the equally hilarious description of Bryson's efforts to find food in the hotel to satisfy the urgent needs of his terribly empty stomach, an attempt which involved dead end fire-escapes, three drunken Japanese men in blue business suits, a stubborn elevator that keeps returning to the same floor, locked doors, and an over-zealous waiter who takes away the very peanuts that our starved hero so desperately needed.What I find most disappointing about this book, however, is that Bryson frequently sees the need to resort to a brand of humor below the waist and above the knees. Such gutter humour, sexual jokes and innuendos are hardly necessary given Bryson's incredible talent with words. Although there are chapters without this foul-mouthed and low-down humour, on the whole Bryson has painted the whole book with this gutter-style brush of sexual humour. In my view this negative cancels out all the positives of the book. If it wasn't for this, &quot;Neither Here Nor There&quot; would be a brilliant book. As it is, however, Bryson has successfully allowed his book to be re-classified amongst a great deal of &quot;trash&quot; in the humour section. Too bad.On the bright side, this book is one of Bryson's early works, and he seems to have matured with age. The weaknesses of this book are much less evident in his most recent work, &quot;In a Sunburned Country&quot;, which describes his trip to Australia. If you are going to buy only one Bill Bryson book, I would recommend purchasing this latter title instead."},{"Title":"Neither Here Nor There","review":"Bill Bryson walks you through quite a fiew European cities. He gives you accurate observations and - as far as I can tell - a good feeling for the places he visits. But he also prefers to sit in public places and read other people's books on those places, instead of talking to all the different folks of Europe and giving you impressions on what really adds spice to Euorpe. This is were the book completely misses out on Europe. Tourists will never get experience; and neither in Europe nor from Bill. He remains a tourist himself, and seldom turns into a traveler. I still give him 3 stars because of his entertaining humor. And because - from 30'000 feet - he rates the Austrians even lower than the Germans."},{"Title":"Neither Here Nor There","review":"Not much joy here as Bryson, an American Anglophile infected with Europhobia, whines and whinges his way across Europe. Bryson takes us to Stockholm where he complains about the quality of the Italian cuisine. We stop in major European cities where Bryson refreshes himself with a carbonated, caramelized caffeine drink or with typical American standby hambuger and fries as if Europe's kitchens could offer no better. We share the fights and slights of times past when Bryson flashes back to another Eurovoyage with an equally disagreeable companion. Curiously or perhaps understandably Bryson meets no one who doesn't bore him or anyone he doesn't crown &quot;the most boring...&quot;. Other critics' views are altogether too generous but read it if you must."},{"Title":"Neither Here Nor There","review":"So far this is my favorite of Bryson's travel books, though, in some ways it is also his most eccentric. This memoir represents a return visit to Europe, when a more affluent, middle aged journalist Bryson retraces his earlier trail through Europe as a carefree youth. Besides his characteristic sardonic observations, his descriptions include a number of nostaglic reminiscences and disappointment as his recollections are viewed through rose colored glasses.You have to have tolerance for Bryson's use of the various venues as a means of launching into sophomoric tangents reflecting on having lusted after beautiful young women, or puerile comments on digestion and bathroom habits that provide too much information.His descriptions are the usual mix of admiring and scathing; he clearly was enraptured with Southern Italy and less than impressed with Brussels and much of Belgium. His stereotypes of the various nationalities while often funny are outrageous and savage.This is a good airplane, pool side, stuck somewhere book. It keeps you interested and amused."},{"Title":"Neither Here Nor There","review":"I picked this book up kind of randomly. &quot;A Walk in The Woods&quot; always seemed kind of hippy-dippy to me - and while I am quite the liberal chick, I am not so enviro-hippy. When my dad, a conservative guy, told me he loved it, I thought, &quot;huh&quot;. Then I picked up Bill Bryson.The gimmick in &quot;Neither Here Nor There&quot; is a return to Europe. As a young man in the '70s, American Bryson spent 4 months backpacking with an unforgettable loudmouthed &quot;friend&quot; named Katz. Now, 20 years later, he returns, following virtually the same route. The result: kind of makes you want to pick up and meander through Europe the way Bryson does.Along the way (through Paris, the Netherlands, Germany, Austria, Italy, Yugoslavia, Bulgaria), he sprinkles his essays with historical notations (usually funny, sometimes somber, as with his tribute the amazing people of the Netherlands, the humanitarians of WWII who put life, and the safety of their Jewish population above all else), sometimes hysterically funny observations (about the people, cultures and TV channels in each country) and reflections - comparing Europe now to Europe in 1970. An interesting thing to note is that this book was written in 1990, before much of the conflict in Yugoslavia began on a grand scale. When I arrived at the chapter entitled &quot;Sarajevo&quot;, I worried for Bryson's safety and wondered about his choice of a war zone for vacation. Then I checked the copywrite date. Because of the time it was written - so contemporary, yet milleniums away for the people of Yugoslavia - this book offers a unique perspective on Yugoslavia BEFORE the war ... a world that sadly, doesn't exist, is nicely perserved with Bryson's trademark spot on observation, wit and reflection.Though this book is compulsively readable, there are some flaws. Bryson can be negative at times, complaining that &quot;Europe has changed&quot;, bemoaning globalization and the &quot;Disney-fying&quot; of the Continent. However, he does not reflect too much on how HE has changed and how his perceptions - that is, his level of comfort, his experiences etc... - have colored how he sees Europe. This kind of reflection would have been interesting ... we expect everything to stay the same, when nothing can because we never do.Overall, this is a great book to read - especially before (or perhaps even more so, after) a trip to Europe. Even better, bring it with you to the banks of the Danube and sip a coke or coffee at a Cafe. You'll be happy to have a friend with you."},{"Title":"Neither Here Nor There","review":"I bought this book with the hopes that it would be a story of Bryson's misadventures with the imimitable Katz. Unfortunately, it seems to be a Contintent long ethnocentric rant. The only redeeming thing is that Bryson includes himself and his adopted britain in on the abuse.If you travel with as many preconceptions and make snap judgements as Bryson does, you are in for some very dissappointing trips.Paul Theroux writes with much more humor and insight."},{"Title":"Neither Here Nor There","review":"I read this book over the summer and discovered that there was much I could relate to; having travelled on a slim budget through Europe only a few years before. The book got into European novelties that &quot;you'd have to see to believe&quot; and unless you've been there to experience that, sometimes it's tough to get the humor of the situations Mr. Bryson shares. However, the trip gets long, not only for the reader, but also the author himself seems to hurry through the last few chapters, providing less detail of the trip and therefore the humor also dries up. I did enjoy the reflections presented throughout the book contrasting the trip the author took 20 years ago and the changes he noted, not only in the countries he travelled in but in the traveller as well. Overall, I found it good for a few laughs, but not a trip I'll take again."},{"Title":"Neither Here Nor There","review":"This was the first book by Bill Bryson that I ever read, which started me on a long love-affair with the writer. I had the misfortune of reading this book mostly in public (during a trip), and I made a perfect fool of myself laughing out loud at times, sometimes literally with tears running down my cheeks. I'm sure people thought I was insane. So, do yourself a favor - buy this book immediately, but do read it in private. It is wonderful."},{"Title":"Neither Here Nor There","review":"I've now read all of Bill Bryson's past and current work, and Neither Here nor There, with a few exceptional stories wasn't one of his best works. This seemed to be a revisiting of places he had seen much earlier, and was pretty negative on most locations in Europe since much had changed, gone down hill, or been replaced by new buildings or vistas since he had been there the first time. He tried to \\"go home again\\", but it didn't work out well, at least for him. Still, he does describe some interesting places and provides tips on the pleasant ones. This is a \\"maybe\\" selection."},{"Title":"Neither Here Nor There","review":"Last fall, as a 21 year-old college student in his final year, I started pondering what to do with that ludicrous accumulation of wealth that all university students find upon graduation. Lies, actually: I scraped together the best I could and bought a ticket for London. A pair of \\"Let's Go\\" guides accompanied me for practical reasons, but Neither Here Nor There was my travel bible, my Psalms, as it were. I read it that Fall of '07 and it inspired me to take the trip in ways that no other source had. It revealed to me that even travel hardships can result in the most absurdly funny, cherished stories.His ascerbic wit goes gangbusters on the little quirks of the Continental, from country to hilarious country. I partially molded my trip to make sure I checked out some of his destinations--they were that well-described.Interestingly enough, I found him to be dead-on in some countries/cities, and WAY off the mark in others. One of his most memorable anecdotes comes out of backwoods Austria. I happened to find the same people to be the kindest, most hospitable of my whole 14-country trip. But the laughs I had over that chapter, and the inspiration to camp out under the Tyrolean night sky, paid dividends. So what if his descriptions aren't cookie-cutter and unfailing? No two travel experiences are the same, and God forbid they ever will be.Read this book. You'll shoot (insert beverage here) through your nose laughing and develop an ache to see Europe. Prost, Bill."},{"Title":"Neither Here Nor There","review":"I read this book whilst on a small trip to Australia, and I fondly read about the curiousities and peculiarities of the people I know so well in Europe. I laughed out loud, reading about the stern French (so they really can be!), the friendly Northern people etc etc. Sometimes people are ridiculed in a very funny way that even Europeans themselves can laugh about. Nobody writes as witty and funny about travel as Bill Bryson. If you have never read one of his books before, this one is very good to start with and it also teaches you a lot of nice dinner-party facts about my strange continent...."},{"Title":"Neither Here Nor There","review":"I'm glad I read this book in the privacy of my own home. If I had been reading this in public, I would have been mistaken for one of those crazy people you see sitting at coffee shops and laughing hysterically by themselves.This is the first book I have read by Bill Bryson, and I was completely impressed. As I was reading through this book, I had to keep myself from running back to the bookstore and buying his whole collection.In &quot;Neither Here Nor There&quot; Bryson is reliving a journey he had taken through Europe in his youth. If you've ever been to Europe, you will deeply appreciate the sarcastic humor that Bryson uses to describe the people he meets and the places he visits."},{"Title":"Neither Here Nor There","review":"I was born and raised in Europe, but I grew up in America. I have since been back to travel thru Europe and Bill Bryson is right on target when he makes hilarious, witty, harsh, and yet exact comments about the way Europeans are.All the criticism about Neither Here Nor There is coming from people without a sense of humor! Lighten up! If you are a traveler, you'll understand where he's coming from. He talks about the experiences that you think about, and will tell your friends and family after your return home, but his sense of humor and a cocky attitude make such a normal thing, like crossing the street in Paris, an event! This is a book that makes you laugh out-loud!This is a great book for anyone who traveled thru Europe, or would like to go there. If you have never been to Europe, this book will give an idea of what traveling thru Europe really is like!"},{"Title":"Neither Here Nor There","review":"A desperate effort of an American living in the UK to surpass his true heritage of 'american humour', the books has its moments but all in all is more fiction than anything else. Mr Bryson does not understand a thing about Europe or it's culture, no matter how many places he visits, how many miles he covers or how many years he chooses to live here, he remains and represents the average American mind, short of the ability to understand - and even worse, wanting to understand - anything that lies beneath the surface."},{"Title":"Neither Here Nor There","review":"Bryson has a lazy and sometimes obnoxious style of writing, and the countries he visits in this book all blur together because of it. His perceptive commentaries on the natives can generally be summed up as \\"The Swiss, they're so funny!\\", \\"The Austrians, they're so funny!\\", \\"The _______, they're so funny!\\" He also uses a lot of expletives, apparently thinking this will add humor to his writing. His attempts to tie his travels to an earlier journey as a student are thin at best, and may be nothing more than an attempt to add padding to this small and worthless volume."},{"Title":"Neither Here Nor There","review":"Whenever I need something to read before I fall asleep, I reach for one of Mr. Bryson's book. Since I travel a lot, people assume I love travel literature, and give me his ridiculous books as &quot;going away gifts.&quot; This particular book, &quot;Neither here nor there&quot; certainly doesn't buck the trend of under-educated, under-informed, boring slop. Although I don't doubt that Mr. Bryson has traveled in Europe, his use of standard cliches has the ring of someone afraid to leave his front door, in case he might have to eat something with which he is not familiar. He pretends to know the political and cultural history of every country he visits - therefore allowing him to make the rudest and ugliest jokes...but what can we expect from an American afterall?"},{"Title":"Neither Here Nor There","review":"Bill is a good writer, but genius should be reserved for writers like Thomas Sowell, Marc Steyn, Shelby Steele, Dan Pipes, Victor Davis Hanson, etc. No, I don't expect everyone, sadly, to have read works by these brilliant men, of course.But anyway, a guy like Bryson, being paid to travel around Eurabia and mock people, offering his insight, should be able to produce good copy. I'd like to see more people write about the decadence, hedonism and secularism that is fueling Eurabia's rapid demise though. I know it won't be any Euros, as they cater to Islam, ignore evil, and spew hatred at the Jews just like in 1939, so hopefully more Americans will.Off tangent? Nope. Poking fun at Eurabia is different than being brutally honest. Travel books about this barbaric country where six million Jews were exterminated in unappealing.But yeah, while he's not a genius, you can call him acerbic, or, like the \\"great\\" John Stewart,\\" \\"witty.\\""},{"Title":"Neither Here Nor There","review":"A page and a half from the end of this worthless narrative is the key to Mr. Bryson's travel philosophy: \\"...what an odd thing tourism is. You fly off to a strange land, eagerly abandoning all the comforts of home, and then expend vast quantities of time and money in a largely futile effort to recapture the comforts that you wouldn't have lost if you hadn't left home in the first place.\\" This is a perfect attitude for the armchair traveler; these are exactly the people that should not travel. Buy Mr. Bryson's books and stay home. I hope no one with this attitude would presume to make themselves an ambassador to any foreign land. The whole point of travel/tourism is to have new experiences and to realize that your miniscule world is not all there is. I unfortunately forced myself to finish Neither Here Nor There at the end of a trip to New Hampshire. Had I realized Mr. Bryson's residence was so close, I would have liked to have coffee, simply to see if such a narrow-minded attitude is more than a writing persona."},{"Title":"Neither Here Nor There","review":"Bill Bryson, in his mid 40's, recreates the trip he took to Europe when he was 20. Any baby boomer who traveled Europe on the cheap in the 70's will love it. Those of us who have returned to Europe since then will adore it. I laughed out loud throughout"},{"Title":"Neither Here Nor There","review":"It is clear to anyone reading this book that Bryson knows nothing about Europe, but therein lies its charm. The thing is filled with memorable one liners and hilarious set pieces; checking out of a Copenhagen hotel springs to mind, as does his gracious departure from a restaurant in Italy to make way for some small time mobsters. Those looking for 'Baedeker'-style detail will be disappointed, but Bryson's perspective on this odd continent is fresh and enjoyable."},{"Title":"Neither Here Nor There","review":"Bill Bryson is the funniest writer - I like Dave Barry too but sorry Dave, Bill is way smarter. The first time I read this book I had to read parts aloud to my husband, we kept shrieking with laughter at Bill's descriptions. We travelled Europe together and so many of Bill's experiences were ours. We pointed at random menu items in Germany and nearly wound up with tongue - the waiter helped by sticking his tongue out at us to demonstrate what body part we'd be receiving. Bryson's description of his and Katz's reactions to nearly receiving brains was EXACTLY ours - the swooning, the relief at a narrow escape... And we adore Katz! We met so many obnoxious travellers who liked to speak to non-English speaking locals about outrageous things and it was very funny when they were caught, as they often were. Museum lineups, Gypsy thieves, hotel nightmares, weird train carriage companions - Bryson covers it all with self-deprecating humour and lots of good research."},{"Title":"Neither Here Nor There","review":"Listening to this book being read by the author adds an additional dimension to the enjoyment. You can hear undertones in Mr. Bryson's voice where he clearly finds certain parts very funny or quite serious. I have read the book several times and always find it enjoyable. Listening to the book in the author's own words is an added treat."},{"Title":"Neither Here Nor There","review":"This was difficult to find. It is an autographed edition. It is now rather dated, having been written in the 90's and, true to form, Bill does a lot of walking. It had amusing moments, but I'm not sure I would recommend it. I have enjoyed his more recent books."},{"Title":"Neither Here Nor There","review":"While some parts were funny and he visits many out-of-the-way places, his constant complaining and haughtiness gets old. He complains often about the natives, especially the Germans, and he complains about tourists, especially American (but what is he exactly)? He doesn't speak any other language, except maybe a phrase anyone can learn in a guidebook. Also, not all of his humor is enjoyable, but I'll leave this to individual taste. All in all, I liked reading about foreign places but the book soon became stereotypical, repetitive, and annoying."},{"Title":"Neither Here Nor There","review":"Bryson is funny, and he has a knack for describing the most mundane of the situations with a very acid humor. In this book, however, too many joking gets a bit tiresome (may it was the begining of his carreer, and his style was not so sharp yet)"},{"Title":"Neither Here Nor There","review":"Bill Bryson's droll sense of humour and turn of phrase is hilarious. I've made the mistake of eating when reading his book and a sudden guffaw will invariably send the food the wrong way!Anyone who likes a good laugh should read Bill Bryson."},{"Title":"Neither Here Nor There","review":"Pretty good. A bit dated now but well worth reading. Some excellent descriptions, and some very astute observations. It would be interesting to see an update - maybe another trip over the same ground and plot the changes."},{"Title":"Neither Here Nor There","review":"I have read and enjoyed most of Bryson's books. Can't tell you how many times I've read A Short History. I own a couple of his books about words and language and have read one or two that I wish I had kept.Neither Here Nor There is his funniest. Much funnier than Dave Barry, who is nowhere near as funny as his reputation. Sorry, Dave.Bryson copyrighted Neither Here Nor There in 1991. That's 21 years ago. Therefore all the information is totally out of date.But it's delightfully written. I often laughed out loud -- hard.So read it."},{"Title":"Neither Here Nor There","review":"It's interesting to read through the reviews for this book: most of those praising the book either come from Europeans, or else mention &quot;Neither Here Nor There&quot; resonating with their memories of travelling in Europe. The negative reviews all chastise Bryson for being too superficial, or shallow, or racist, or for not 'interacting' properly with the people he meets. What's particularly strange is the number of reviews that praise Bryson's other books, then say this one is not up to his standard.Well, to those who fail to catch the humor here: book a flight to Europe, and see for yourselves. Europeans aren't somehow beyond the possibility of being unintentionally funny, and Bryson is not being an 'ugly American' for pointing out their foibles in very funny ways--witness, for example, his devastatingly funny transliteration of Dutch conversation, or his adventures getting travellers' checks replaced after they've been stolen by a Gypsy girl in Italy.Bryson is also honest. He tells you what he likes, and what he doesn't, and, far from being xenophobic or parochial, he's perfectly willing to change his mind when a place he visits either exceeds or falls short of his expectations. He lavishes praise on the most unlikely of destinations, and avoids the fawning tones of many travel writers who feel somehow obligated to adore every place they visit, especially the most famous ones. All real travellers are familiar with this phenomenon: the most intense joys of travel are most likely to be experienced in the least obvious places, and often at the most inopportune times.Finally, Bryson is simply funny, and this book is too. I hope he comes to Asia next."},{"Title":"Neither Here Nor There","review":"I believe there are more than enough reviews here to decifer whether or not you plan to read this charming, witty and candid book. However, as an Australian raised in both Europe and America, I must heed a warning to those of you who read the negative reviews by Europeans and Asians. DO NOT LISTEN TO THEM!! They obviously lack a sense of humour and the ability to laugh at themselves (unlike Bryson). Bryson can be provincial at times, but he is so charming indeed! One who has traveled for days in a foreign land can understand his exhaustion and frustration and will howl with laughter.Yes, Bryson at times can be brutally honest with his opinion of foreign countries and their inhabitants and culture, but they are HIS OPINIONS and they are frankly FUNNY and quite observant. I suppose those who take offense to his opinions neglected to understand that Bryson is a brazen self critic and will unabashedly admit to his lack of sophistication due to his stereotypical midwestern American upbringing. Please take no notice to the malevolence of the quazi-sensitive and humourless French and Germans who negatively reviewed this charming and engaging work.Give the man a break and give this book a READ...Unless you possess absolutely no sense of humour, you will find it quite enjoyable!"},{"Title":"Neither Here Nor There","review":"In his book \\"Neither here nor there\\" Bill Bryson writes about the experiences he made when he was travelling through nearly the whole of Europe, fluent in only one language (which is English).He starts in Hammerfest, Norway (as far north as you can get in the world by public means of transport, he says), goes to Paris, Brussels, Belgium, Aachen and Cologne in Germany, then on to Amsterdam, Hamburg in Germany again, Copenhagen in Denmark, then onto Sweden (Gothenburg and Stockholm), then down to Rome, then to southern Italy (Naples, Capri and Sorrento), up to the top (Milan, Como), through Switzerland, Liechtenstein, Austria, Yugoslavia, Sofia in Bulgaria, and finally Istanbul.As you can see, by reading this book you'll learn a lot about European countries with their different languages, customs, habits and ways of life. But this isn't one of those boring highbrow books, that you can't read without falling asleep - no! - once you start reading you can't stop. Bryson has a unique brand of humour that I personally like very much. He is able to crack jokes about any situation, no matter how hopelessly and unpleasing they might have been.Especially as an European citizen you'll have a lot of fun because you recognize all the stereotypes that you know either from telling or personal experience. And be prepared for some nasty jokes about your compatriots!All in all I can highly recommend this book to everyone who wants to get to know European countries in an amusing and interesting way."},{"Title":"Neither Here Nor There","review":"Bill Bryson really made it big in England after the release of 'Notes from a Small Island', which, however isn't his best book. His best would be either 'The Lost Continent' or this book 'Neither Here Nor There'. I very rarely laugh out loud at TV shows or books. Only 'Frasier' on TV and Bill Bryson in books have this capacity to make me laugh relentlessly. 'Neither here Nor There' is Bryson's story of the reenactment of his student-day travels through Europe some twenty years later. He tries to visit all the places that he visited with Katz (yup, he appears in 'Walk in the Woods' too) in the seventies, as well as Norway to see the northern lights. Bryson's descriptions of situations are hilarious, primarily because he is just a normal guy and you can imagine yourself in the same situation, especially if you have visited any of the countries he visits, but even if you haven't, it is still a delight to read. Another great thing about Bill Bryson is that he is not afraid to be politically incorrect, calling France's population 'Insufferably French' to give just one example. He is also happy to insult a place if he feels it deserves it, something which other travel writers can seem reluctant to do. He of course balances out these criticisms with his entusiasm for so many places and you also learn many interesting facts from his stories such as Liechtenstein is the world's largest producer of sausage skins and dentures. Hands up who knew that!!! I can't even begin to do this book justice in my review, all I can say is buy Bill Bryson's books and I promise you will not be dissppointed, they are all a joy to read. Bill seems a lovely guy and, in his words, not mine, 'If he wishes to acknowledge this unsolicited endorsement with a set of luggage or a skiing holiday in the Rockies, let the record show that I am ready to accept it'!!!"},{"Title":"Neither Here Nor There","review":"If you're looking for a travel book to use when you explore Europe, this one won't be the most useful book out there. But if you are looking for entertainment, want to learn a bit about Europe and are prepared to laugh uproariously, this is a great choice. Bryson skewers the traditions and habits of other countries, recounts many hilarious experiences during his travels and describes some of the best (and worst) destinations in Europe. He has a fine writing style, casual, breezy and unique. The section on waiting for The Northern Lights to appear - and waiting and waiting for days on end - was worth the price of the book alone."},{"Title":"Neither Here Nor There","review":"This book is an average book: enjoyable at times, slow and boring at others. While Bryson maintains his sarcastic style used in Walk in the Woods, Notes from a Small Island and the Lost Continent (all better choices as intros to Bill's brain), he fails to bring out what always saved his sarcastic rants: his fondness for the people or country.In the 3 books I listed, Bryson deliciously skewers the US and UK and their people, but there's always a loving undercurrent underneath (kind of like teasing the sibling which you love to death). In case you miss the point, he would end the book by saying how much he loved the respective countries.In this book, no such love is found. He just rants and raves about different European peoples and cities. Further lowering the enjoyability of this book are the few remarks that could be considered racist or xenophobic. As to these remarks, they don't get a lot of airplay and only sensitive people (or members of the groups) will object to them, but they're there nonetheless.All in all, I'd recommend this book only for those who have read the other Bryson travel books and need to read everything he has written. Otherwise, read the 3 books listed above and his essay compilation &quot;I'm a Stranger Here Myself.&quot;"},{"Title":"Neither Here Nor There","review":"While Bryson does offer some historical context for the places he travels (especially in relation to WW II), whether you like this book or not depends far more on your sense of humor. There's very little dialogue and almost no social interaction outside of Bryson dealing with travel logistics- getting bus tickets, checking into hotels, ordering dinner. Personally, though, his dry/goofball/neurotic sense of humor made me laugh out loud time after time, and I found myself more surprised during short passages where he was relatively serious than the relentless humor. Only if you're obsessed with political correctness, he may offend you, but he is democratic in his targets, and even pokes fun at himself (for example, describing his temper tantrum in Sweden after having to pay for a failed phone call).Some specific examples include him describing the cow as the perfect pet, a slapstick scene involving the meatballs rolling out of his sandwich (\\"like sailors abandoning a burning ship\\"), a woman on the train who \\"looked as if she hadn't smiled since 1937 and who spent the entire journey watching me as if she had seen my face on a wanted poster\\", and another train ride when he was \\"spreading out the map on my knees in its full crinkly glory, to the undisguised irritation of the old lady next to me, who hoomphed her bosom and made exasperated noises every time a corner of paper waggled in her direction.\\""},{"Title":"Neither Here Nor There","review":"Someone once said that you can fake intelligence, but you can't fake wit.Maybe that's why there are so many books...but so few funny ones.I for one think the world needs a lot more funny books.I sometimes get sick of reading analytical nonfiction, sick of reading serious descriptive prose, sick of the things I read always demanding something from me, whether its my earnest attention or my logic and reasoning.Sometimes, I just want to read something that will make me laugh.That's when I'm grateful for Bill Bryson.This guy is hilarious.Forget how cranky and irritable his writing makes him seem, forget his biases, forget that the subjects of his books sometimes seem like little more than loose structures built solely to be ornamented by jokes, forget that his book jackets always mention that he's one of Newsweek's celebrated \\"boomers,\\" forget all that.Instead, just read his work, and take careful note at the number of times you have trouble breathing due to how hard you're laughing, at the number of times someone asks you if you're okay because they're not quite sure if you--you with the book over there--are laughing or sobbing, at the number of times you almost wake up the sleeping person next to you with your uncontrollable guffawing.This book has little more going in the way of plot than the loose story of Bill Bryson traveling aimlessly around Europe, but it is funny. Hilarious.If you have any sense of humor at all, you will laugh at it, I can almost guarantee it."},{"Title":"Neither Here Nor There","review":"An account of the author's rambles across Europe. Bryson is always entertaining, and his writing alternates from downright hilarious to the point of absurdity to dealing with some very sobering statistics. This is a wonderful mix and he's a very gifted writer whose works sound like a really great story you once heard from a friend."},{"Title":"Neither Here Nor There","review":"Having just returned from Japan, Kuala Lumpur and Australia, I'm not yet ready to attack &quot;War and Peace.&quot; But after reading Bryson's &quot;In a Sunburned Country,&quot; which gave us a hilarious and tantalizing introduction to Australia, I'm finding &quot;Neither Here Nor There&quot; just as much fun and an easy read while suffering from post-Australian jet lag.I've visited most of the cities he describes, and he brings back lots of funny memories and also takes me back to places and points out things I really didn't pay enough attention to when I was there. As another customer reviewer said, if you don't laugh a lot when reading Bryson, you don't have a sense of humor, and I wouldn't want to be stuck on a desert island with you.Although I winced a few times at some of his crude language -- he doesn't use it in &quot;Sunburned&quot;; maybe he found his vocabulary during the 90's -- he didn't use any words I haven't used myself when the situation warranted it.Read it and laugh."},{"Title":"Neither Here Nor There","review":"I am a huge Bryson fan, I love his humor and his talent for noticing absurdity in everyday situations.This audiobook is on 5 CDs and plays for 6 hours, and features Bryson's sardonic voice telling us about his adventures over Europe. If you have liked his other books, you will like this one. He writes in a detailed enough way that you will want to slow down to savor this book, so hearing it read aloud is perfect.Unfortunately, this audiobook is abridged, and while that is not always a problem for me, since I get bored easily and prefer the story to move along, with Bryson, I always feel like I am missing a little extra something with his audiobooks. His books are good enough to want to savor every word.So, do buy this audio CD version, but perhaps read the book first so you get the entire scoop and all the description, and listen to the audiobook in the car or while doing something else. It is one you will likely want to keep and listen to every time you get antsy for travel."},{"Title":"Neither Here Nor There","review":"I love Bill Bryson. I've read almost all his books, and each time I finish another one, I get a little sad thinking there are now fewer left for me to get to. He is that good.&quot;Neither Here Nor There&quot; is classic Bryson. This guy could write about paint drying and still make the funniest, smartest observations ever. Although all the giddy excitement of traveling to new places shines through in this memoir, most of the time Bryson talks about his experiences on trains, railway stations, police stations, waiting rooms, or hotel rooms by himself. Here is were his true talent shines through and he illuminates the absolutely wacky in the mundane.I could have done without some of the misguided political commentaries he let slip in this book, but it is still a wonderful treat to see Europe through this mild-mannered madman's eyes. If you really want to laugh and laugh, go pick up this book--and all his other ones, too!"},{"Title":"Neither Here Nor There","review":"I picked this book up on a whim. I found myself near the Travel section and it just called my attention. I had been wanting to get a travel memoir for a while, so I decided to follow my instinct and buy it and read it immediately. I am very glad I did.Bryson's memoirs of his trip through Europe are incredibly funny and poignant. Interspersed throughout the narrative are stories from a 1972 trip he took with a &quot;friend&quot; named Stephen Katz which help to bring modern Europe into focus. Bryson, who at the time was living in England though he is American, has a bit of a &quot;best of both worlds&quot; kind of vision, which makes him able to see Europeans on their own terms, so to speak. The book covers a lot of ground, as Bryson travels from Scandinavia, through the usual staples of Western Europe, and ends up on the fringes of Europe, in Yugoslavia, Bulgaria and Istanbul. Some of the places he visits I have visited myself, and in those cases it was fun to see how we each experienced the city (I am happy to report we share our opinion of Naples, namely Ugh!) and/or country; in those cases where he goes to places I have never been (and there are quite a few those), the fun is in both his stories and just the sheer fun of travel. As I said, Bryson is funny in a candid way; he has no problem telling you about how many times he got drunk, or the various times he gets completely taken for a fool, always with wit and humor. Travel memoirs usually include these little details, factoids, that make the places come alive, and Bryson, though not a scholar and not a travel guidebook writer, injects quite a few of them in, always with an eye to bring the destination to life through history and context. In the end, however, the book is excellent because it is a very heartfelt and honest travel memoir that takes you along as a companion. Anyone who has ever traveled can relate to it, especially if you have visited Europe and can chuckle silently (or loudly, as I did too many times to count) when you remember all those little quirks that are quintessentially European. On a personal level, memoirs like this help me to bring into focus my own trip to Europe, going on three years ago, and remind me of the joy of travel, of the joy of seeing new lands, of the joy of coming home ready to do it all, all over again. And that is something that I appreciate immensely."},{"Title":"Neither Here Nor There","review":"If you want to read a captivating Bryson Title go for the Australian title, &quot;In a Sunburned Country&quot;. I read that one first and then bought this one and the Appalachian Trail title, &quot;A Walk in the Woods.&quot; I have to say I enjoyed the hiking book about his experiences hiking the Appalachian Trail only because he was so concerned about encountering bear. The other books haven't met the mark for me. READ &quot;In a Sunburned Country&quot; there is plenty of history and incredible accounts of what he sees and does in that book that are a lot of fun to read."},{"Title":"Neither Here Nor There","review":"I'm a travel enthusiast, or at least a dreaming-about-traveling enthusiast, so I picked up this book for a little summer \\"getaway\\" of my own. I read the whole book, but there were numerous times I put it down to absorb something shocking Bryson said or to read a particularly ridiculous passage to my boyfriend. Bryson is incredibly negative about every single place he goes to, the exceptions being Copenhagen, Amsterdam, and Italy (at least Rome and Sorrento). Bryson seems to direct most of his disappointment and, quite honestly, thinly veiled dislike of Germans and German-speaking countries, as well as most of northern Europe. It's not just that he bitches about train schedules, public workers, the sound of the German language, how terrible their food is (and all of this gets pretty annoying after awhile), it's that he seems to bring up the horror of WWII every chance he gets in the appropriate countries. He seemed to look at Germans as inferior, and was appalled that the old men he encountered could have been Nazis 50 years earlier. Good God! I didn't know I was settling in for a depressing and pretty judgmental portrait of central Europeans. This constant theme was tedious, as well as his blatant elitism. There was one lovely passage where Bryson speaks of the \\"typical\\" haughty manner of European service workers and writes that, in effect, these workers are inferior because they spend their lives waiting on other people, so clearly they aren't doing something important. Although Bryson is often sarcastic, this was not a sarcastic passage. It was appalling.Oh, and the constant complaining about tourists and how they're ruining Italy, the Alps, and most other countries he went to is ridiculous, as he was among them.The only positive thing I can say about this book is that there are some passages that are funny and had me giggling to myself. However, once I realized that the entire book was going to be about him bitching about every single place he went to, I just plowed through the rest of it as fast as I could to get it over with."},{"Title":"Neither Here Nor There","review":"I generally love the Bryson books-- A Walk in the Woods was great, I enjoyed \\"In a Sunburned Country\\", and I found A Short History to be both very entertaining and educational. I had to struggle to make it through \\"Neither Here nor There\\". The tone is generally whiny. The adventures are generally not adventures at all. The flashbacks to his backpacking are good on the whole but the \\"present day\\" stuff tends to be incredibly dry. There is lots and lots of \\"I arrived in town. Had a hard time finding a hotel room (or meal). I finally did [and complain about price about 33-50% of the time]. I walked up and down some streets and then left town.\\" The sidebar stories are more self-centered and less entertaining/educational. I thought I'd get a good travelogue with some interesting sidebars and anectdotes on each of the locations. I really didn't get much of that.If you enjoy Bryson's good books, I'd avoid this one. If you want to hear him complain about making a claim for lost travellers checks then this is the book for you."},{"Title":"Neither Here Nor There","review":"In this book, the American travel writer Bill Bryson decides to take a big trip around all the countries in Europe. He starts at Hammerfest (the northernmost town in Europe), goes through countries including Germany, Holland and Italy, ending at Istanbul (near Asia). He retraces the steps he took as a young student in the early seventies.I wasn\`t sure I would like this book because I\`m not normally a fan of travel writing, but after reading a bit I began to really enjoy it, because its very funny. Bryson makes lots of wry observations and little jokes about the places he visits (for example, did you know Liechtenstein is the worlds largest producer of false teeth and sausage skins?)He also boasts a near-encyclopedic knowledge of each country he is talking about, so this book is also good if you\`re interested in European geography or history, but I think the humor is its best feature.Although the book contains lots of funny jokes, the thing I don\`t like is that Bryson has a tendency to swear an awful lot and use bad language in his narrative. Swearing occasionally I can understand, but he does it so much that after a while it ceases to be amusing and Bryson sounds like a 12 year old saying &quot;I can use four letter words! Aren\`t I clever?&quot; Bryson has a tremendous talent with words, and there is no need for him to resort to this.Apart from that, I think this is a great book and would recommend it to anyone who likes Bill Brysons humor. If you\`re new to the travel writing genre in general, or Bill Bryson, this book is a great place to start - its guaranteed to make you smile."},{"Title":"Neither Here Nor There","review":"He manages to absolutely &#34;nail it&#34;, either positively or negatively - I share many of his feelings about the places he visits, and even if I do not, he is delightful to read"},{"Title":"Neither Here Nor There","review":"It is extremely funny and really describes life as it really is?

Neither provacative nor engaging.Awful.Not funny.Maybe I've travelled too much to appreciate this book, but it was awful, bordering on offensive. I would have thought that Bryson would be an enthusiastic and passionate traveler, but he wasn't. At least not in this book. In this book he was bitter, whiney and did nothing but complain.Let me sum up the book for you:EVERYTHING IS EXPENSIVEthe food is badPeople are different than him, therefore, awfulsomething poop relatedHe bashed the culture of every country visited in some way. When he was in Switzerland and bored he made up some riddles. Here's one: \\"What do you call a gathering of boring people in Switzerland?\\" ... \\"Zurich.\\"Every once in a while something seemingly positive would happen, and I would think ... maybe ... maybe he's going to have ONE good experience on this trip. But nope. Always a \\"but\\". Murphy's Law always right around Bill Bryson's corner.I'm shocked that this book was published. I've written better travel commentary on the back of an American Airlines cocktail napkin."},{"Title":"Neither Here Nor There","review":"I only read the Italy chapters.If writing like this is what is selling a lot of books then we can all become writers, there is obviously no talent needed! My main issue with his travel writing about Italy is the complaining, complaining, complaining, endless complaining. It was too hot, the line was too long, the English tourist women in the cafes were too ugly, and on and on and on. Sometimes he does manage to be funny (describing the emotions of travelers while buying tickets at the train station), but at other times, the incidents that happen to him seem to be made up (like the policewoman in Florence who was typing one key at a time waiting whole minutes between each key, I mean seriously? its a bit much and FAKE)I've been to Italy, and yes it can be frustrating sometimes, TrenItalia DOES make Amtrak look competent, but his whole description of travel in Italy is one misery after another. The only place where he has a good time, and describes beauty is in Capri. He doesn't even make an attempt to spend time in Naples, or eat there or sight-see there, even though that chapter is named \\"Naples, Sorrento and Capri\\". Just another typical American buffoon who can't deal with Naples because he is expecting Switzerland or something in the south of Italy.Also some of his observations are pretty misogynistic, describing some tourist women as \\"mannish\\" and \\"insufferable to look at\\", I mean has this man ever looked in the mirror?? Does he think he is some inspiration for a vision of beauty?? But besides all that, my main problem with this work is that it doesn't add anything to one's knowledge or experience of Italy, the book is styled in this format: I went to place A hated my hotel, then I went to place B too much walking, grumble grumble, then on to place C, more grumbling.......a very boring, even irritating and overdone concept.YOU WILL LEARN NOTHING about Europe from this glorified travel journal, books like this make me want to write, because apparently anyone can do it! and make lots of money! no talent or concept needed!"},{"Title":"Neither Here Nor There","review":"From reading the numerous glowing reviews, I guess it is just me. I was bored silly with Bryson's \\"Neither Here Nor There,\\" and after just 70 pages ended up skimming the rest to see if it got better. It didn't and I cut my losses and gave up. Normally I like books by humorists, but Mr. Bryson's humor seems labored and deliberate; basically he hits you over the head with his cliche'd descriptions. I found some of his experiences unbelievable and perhaps he asked for some of the treatment by his manner, attitude, who knows?I have read Dave Barry and howled, David Sedaris and doubled over trying not to embarrass myself in public by screaming with laughter. Mr. Bryson is not my type of humorist. I guess my impression of this book is that he took a trip back, with a chip on his shoulder and really didn't enjoy it at all. Why are we supposed to???"},{"Title":"Neither Here Nor There","review":"after reading &quot;A Walk In the Woods&quot;, I was extremely excited to get my paws on another Bryson book. I was dissapointed. &quot;Neither here nor there&quot; has about half the humor, one tenth of the adventure and even less of the overall appeal of &quot;A walk in the woods&quot;. It is a book that starts off on a promising note, with a description of his quest to see the northern lights in northern norway in the middle of winter; it had me thinking, 'great, here we go, typical Bryson, doing whacky things that come to him on a whim'. However, as the book progresses it digresses into a mundane journal of the rather ordinary wanderings of a solo traveler. Part of the problem is that he makes very little effort to interact with others. Because of this there is an awful lot of, &quot; I went from the train station, found a hotel, had some dinner, drank a coke, went to bed&quot; kind of &quot;action&quot; that even Brysons astounding propensity for making ordinary situations seem extraordinary cannot save it. One other major flaw it seems is that Brysons trip had no ultimate goal, no purpose. It seems to me that most satisfying travel literature begins with the author expressing a desperate need to find or achieve something, then chronicles the pursuit and struggle to meet those ends, cope with failure, and come to some kind of grand catharsis. My all time favorite, &quot;tales of a female nomad&quot; is the story of a womans need to find something fufilling in her life and in herself after essentially losing the &quot;family woman role&quot; that had come to define her. Her travels are not planned to a T, but she does travel cognisent of purpose/goal/need, and this makes that book very compelling indeed. I am not saying that travel literature must have all of those elements, but at least a little dose of purpose would have gone a long way towards making this book compelling. Do yourself a favor and put the 15 bucks you would spend buying this book in savings toward your own trip to Europe."},{"Title":"Neither Here Nor There","review":"From Bryson's descriptions of Swiss people as boring, to racist cracks about gypsies in Italy, I wonder why I am the only reviewer who felt annoyed. (Maybe he should read Isabel Fonseca's &quot;Bury me Standing&quot; and learn a little about the culture of gypsies. Sure they can be annoying, but you'd have to be a stupid schlep to get pick-pocketed as easily as he did) This is one uptight American that I wouldn't want to travel with. This is a great book for people who like to travel to foreign countries to rip on other peoples' cultures. A colossal bore."},{"Title":"Neither Here Nor There","review":"I did not find this book funny. I DID find it mean-spirited, intolerant, and whiny. And let me state for the record that I have backpacked through many of the countries Mr Bryson visited.I have only the following to say to him:- The idea of traveling is to be able to experience and encounter new cultures societies and accept them for what they are, not to criticise, criticise, and then criticise some more. So the Germans and Swiss have an inordinate number of rules, and the French cut queues. Nobody asked you to visit, and if you don't like it you can always go home.- Not everyone speaks English.- The Second World War ended 55 years ago (or 45 years at the time he wrote the book). It is not nice to keep harping on it, when those responsible for it have expressed their contrition and been punished. (If he has a problem with the Second War, go pick on the Japanese, who seem able only to whine about 2 nuclear bombs being dropped on them and have conveniently forgotten the countless atrocities they committed in Asia.)- Industrial development is an inevitable part of progress. It cannot always be done in a pretty manner, and even if it could, that might cost money which the country can ill-afford to spend. So too bad if you find that your sense of aesthetics offended; the decisions of governments are not made with only you in mind.- It's perverted to want a place to have more dangerous, reckless drivers just to fit your image of what that country should be like.- Things change in 18 years. Doubtless you were a lot more tolerant when you were 20. It's sad to devote a holiday to revisiting the places you went to long ago and, instead of reveling in the familiar amidst the different, spend it tut-tutting about how different it was 18 years ago. Quit dwelling in the past!- It would be nice if you could be happy about more tourist dollars enriching the local economy instead of whingeing about the inconvenience additional tourists pose to YOUR personal comfort.- You complain about hordes of American/Japanese/German tourists spoiling everything, and bemoan the prospect of more tourists on group tours clogging up Europe. That's not the problem, the problem is all the whingeing that emits from these tourists, and unfortunately, in terms of attitude, you are indistinguishable from them.- A holiday goes a lot easier if you PLAN and BOOK in advance. Then you won't have to spend so much time queueing for tickets only to be told they were sold out ages ago. Then you won't have to complain so much.- On the last page, you state a desire to forge on ahead and see Asia. PLEASE DON'T COME HERE. You can't even survive Europe without complaining about the crowds and the litter and the service and the people. What makes you think you can survive here? And we can do without the worst kind of tourist of all - a cross between the American whinger and the intolerant Englishwoman he complains infests Italy."},{"Title":"Neither Here Nor There","review":"Why not just read Mark Twain's Innocents Abroad instead? Bryson's account reads like a bad rip-off at many points, and while Twain's mockery of a typical American tourist in Europe is clearly coming from love of and respect for his fellow Americans, Bryson comes off as snobbish and superior, wishing to distance himself from all things American, quick to point out that he is an ex-pat. Also, Twain is funnier. Of course."},{"Title":"Neither Here Nor There","review":"Why did Mr. Bryson write this book? Was it to discourage people from traveling in Europe? He is disappointed at every stop he makes - perhaps had he planned a little better, that would not have been the case.

While his observations can sometimes be a bit mean-spirited, he also pokes fun at himself, and many of his observations are quite funny, if clearly exaggerated. Starting in the artic north of Norway, and continuing in a zigzag pattern across the continent, Bryson explores many of the most famous of Europe's cities, as well as some more obscure locals. While he notes the changes in Sofia that occurred after his visit, his descriptions of Yugoslavia are even more dated (starting with the fact that Yugoslavia doesn't exist anymore!). Fans of Bryson's humor won't be disappointed, but if you're looking for a guide to traveling in Europe, this probably won't be your best resource."},{"Title":"Neither Here Nor There","review":"Neither Here Nor There is probably more for the novice than the experienced traveller, but it is entertaining and has a usefully broad scope. Bill Bryson, an American resident in London, takes his readers from the Arctic Circle to Istanbul in something like a couple of months, mixing in parts of Scandinavia, the Benelux, France, Germany and Italy among others before passing through the Balkans.Inevitably a lot is about finding hotels and places to eat, misplaced reservations and the pitfalls of communicating with strangers. This is travel writing, after all. And inevitably there tends to be quite a few clich&eacute;s and national stereotyping. The commentary ranges from insightful (e.g. different perceptions of Amsterdam) to expected but fun (the police episode in Florence), to downright vulgar (\\"Quick restaurants - as in quick, pass the bucket!\\"). I found the first and last chapters, set in northern Norway, then Yugoslavia and Bulgaria, the most interesting. Bryson has more to say in out-of-the-way settings. And having travelled to the latter two at about the same time, I thought his observations both original and to the point. Nor does the book, written in the early 1990s, generally feel out-of-date.Bryson's style combines a wide descriptive vocabulary with a matter-of-fact, colloquial tone. It drips with irony and evinces plenty of sniggers. The same note is held too long, though, which may explain why one doesn't laugh as much as one would expect: the jokes and witticisms eventually lose an essential element of surprise.Perhaps not unusually for the genre, the book ends up saying as much about the observer as the observed. It provides a snapshot of how an educated and informed American views the European continent."},{"Title":"Neither Here Nor There","review":"This is my third Bryson book, and so far so good. The AT book was a bit better, and the Short History was a bit broader, but so far they all follow a simple but successful format. Bryson goes somewhere, observes and then writes about it. The writing is not usually laugh out loud funny, but it has enough funny moments and humorous observations that when these are combined with the interesting facts tossed out by Bryson that you end up feeling that you got your money's worth.Neither Here nor There starts with his second (major) trip to mainland Europe (he lived in semi-Europe, that is, England, for seventeen years) and he starts with an epic bus trip to view the northern lights in the Nome of Norway. At least I think it was Norway, it was some non-descript Scandinavian country. In any case he captures well the feeling of being on the edge of nowhere in a community so bland it makes your last Young Republican rally seem like the Watts riots. He alternates between being wryly bemused and clinically depressed, but weaves it all together when he finally does get to see the lights, in all their glory.The wry bemusement versus clinical depression seems to be a common theme of the book, if not his life, and it helps you kind of root for him as he goes gallivanting like a trust fund baby through all of Europe. Italy, Germany, Yugoslavia, Belgium, even Liechtenstein- he doesn't miss much. I think Spain and Greece got bypassed somehow, but pretty much everywhere else he hit. Even a brief hangout time at pre-war Bosnia, a bit surreal.I really don't find any great weakness in the book, other than there is no traveling partner of any kind to give dimension. Some of the better bits are his reminisces, if they can be called that, of his earlier trip with his friend Katz. Katz is a character, to say the least, with all the in-your-face-humanity of a Homer Simpson without the FCC to keep him in check. He should've tried to get old Katz out of by-gosh Iowa for one more trek of the Old Country. We do get to run into him again in the Appalachians in another Bryson book, but Europe would've benefited by him, too, in my opinion.I've only ever been to Austria (which he slams a bit) and Switzerland which he also slams a bit, but from my limited experience his observations seemed to be at least in the ballpark. Switzerland is very expensive (sehr teuer) and Austria is full of Austrians and both are full of beautiful mountains. And if you don't like German it doesn't matter- everybody speaks English, most likely as well as you do."},{"Title":"Neither Here Nor There","review":"This book is by no means meant to be a typical travel guide. This is more like a memoir of sorts. A memoir of a guy trying to relive an adventurous part of his youth, before he sells out to a middle aged mundane life. In stead of getting details about where to stay, where to eat, what to see... you get an impression. To me, this was vastly more interesting than a list of who-what-where.You hear snippets of Katz... well, read A Walk in the Woods to learn more about Bryson's friend, reminds me of Seinfeld's Kramer. To Bryson's credit, he doesn't try to polish his story, or try to make himself out as anything he is not. He just tells it like it is. If anything, Bryson encourages armchair tourists to get out and live a little."},{"Title":"Neither Here Nor There","review":"\`Neither here nor there' is Bill Bryson's travel accounts through Europe, mostly some large cities. Now Bryson really isn't a traveller, he's more of an observing tourist. Typically, Bryson arrives somewhere, checks into a hotel, has something to say about it, goes out for a hike, wondering about what he sees, comparing it with how it looked twenty years ago when shoestringing the place with his side kick Katz, goes into a restaurant and either mocks or glorifies it. As always, food and beverages are quite a big deal in Bryson's accounts. And as ever, when being bored of it, he just skips some parts. He seems quite easy in strolling the local Main Street and then happily scratching the city of his list as a done deal.Now that all sounds quite shallow if it wasn't for Bryson's observing eye and him taking a keen and clever interest in everything he sees, being accurate while at it. Plus he's hugely witty and funny, he really is. Even when he's p.o. about something, he's always amusing. Besides, more then his feet, his mind wanders in all directions at times, placing things into amusing perspectives. One really shouldn't judge this as a travel book, you just want to enjoy it for it's Bill Bryson who wrote it."},{"Title":"Neither Here Nor There","review":"Very funny travelog! Bryson retraces the steps of his summer trip in Europe in the late 1960s. Now he is older, and wiser, and offers a great deal of information about how Europe has changed, and how it has remained the same. Starting in Scandanavia, he travels around a great deal of the European continent. There were some countries he missed (I would have loved to hear what he said about Iberia, and Greece, and some more of the Eastern European states), but it was great fun to read. I found myself laughing out loud many times!Recommended for anyone who loves travel and humor."},{"Title":"Neither Here Nor There","review":"If you've ever traveled through Europe, with a backpack or briefcase, you will enjoy reading the different cities he's traveled too. He puts into words the feelings we've all had while exploring new cities, meeting new people and trying to figure our how to make the most of the short vacation time we have."},{"Title":"Neither Here Nor There","review":"Listen...stop trying to find comparisons with 'The Lost Continent'...this is a different kind of travel experience .Bryson, with a little help from Katz, tells it like it is.If you have ever travelled much in Europe you will identify will Brysons' comments.Ok, he does generalise a little but ..well... its true !Italians are like that ! Ditto Germans/Swiss/Scandanavians.More compact than his other books, I can read this in one sitting and I always take it along if I am going to visit somewhere mentioned in the book, and then look to see what Bryson has said about it .Non-Europeans may make heavy weather of some parts but persevere , its well worth it !"},{"Title":"Neither Here Nor There","review":"So, it doesn't cover intellectual subjects that some may find stimulating. This book is hopefully the bible for all other writers to appreciate what the majority of the public want.....humour. Yes it may touch a nerve at times but the only reason that it will be criticised is that it shouldn't be possible to get so much enjoyment from a book!!"},{"Title":"Neither Here Nor There","review":"Loved 'Walk in the Woods' so I bought all BB's work. I finished this one thinking BB is kind of a jerk. I am a long-time resident of Yer-up and his methods are cringe-inducing. To wit: BB never seems to reserve hotel rooms, planes or trains, yet feels the locals should see his crises as theirs. He never speaks any of the local language, yet is mystified at being misunderstood. And toward the end, BB declares that, alas, he must work his way home to the UK because his &quot;long-suffering wife is on her semi-annual pregnancy.&quot; Ooooh! I'm surprised she didn't change the locks as our buddy Bill pranced around Europe on a protracted midlife-crisis tour."},{"Title":"Neither Here Nor There","review":"Bill Bryson's \\"Neither Here Nor There\\" is another great travelogue from one of the funniest travel writers out there. The book chronicles Bryson's solo journey through Europe in 1990. He spends most of his time in Western Europe, but also ventures east for brief visits to Yugoslavia and Bulgaria. The chapters are compact. Like most backpackers, Bryson gets footloose after staying in one place for more than a few days, and quickly packs his pen for his next exciting destination.Many reviewers fault Bryson for being too negative about the people he meets and the places he goes. I don't hold that against him. He's a satirist, who's in his element when exaggerating the foibles of what he discovers. In fact, the funniest vignettes in the book involve his awkward and uncomfortable encounters with all of those smelly, noisy, oh-so-clueless locals. My only complaint is that I wish he had taken it a bit further. I think Bryson was sensitive to being criticized for being too critical. To address that, he throws in far too many \\"it was the most beautiful thing I had ever seen\\" and \\"it was the most delicious meal I had ever eaten\\" to keep the overall tone more or less balanced. Splashes of Rick Steves isn't what I wanted to read.Perhaps the problem is that Bryson traveled alone. Without his trusty foil, the pseudonymous Stephen Katz, the stories lack that zesty punch that make \\"A Walk in the Woods\\" so memorable. But this isn't a major blemish. When it comes to humorous travel writing, there are few who can keep pace with Bryson."},{"Title":"Neither Here Nor There","review":"Across Europe, from Brussels to Bulgaria, Bill Bryson takes us up alleyways, into coffee shops with indifferent waitstaff, into overpriced museums, across ancient bridges and onto crowded buses through death-defying mountain passes, into magnficent town squares and finally, repairing, into various hotel rooms which occasionally overlook gloriously sunsetted harbors. It's a fantastic and schizophrenic yet entirely believable mix of experiences (even as Bill's out-loud thinking sometimes intrudes into the narrative). We're right there with him, thanks to his down to the dustball description of every minute detail alerting every sense. One can almost smell the malodorous feet of the geezer next to him on the bus to Belgrade. Or hear the Swedish girl of his dreams as she breathes into his deleriously drunken ear: \\"I'm fool of lust\\".Mr. Bryson's amazing account of this journey falls back occasionally to a trip taken with a college buddy two decades earlier. At the start of the book this flashback is a little distracting and seems out of place, but as the diary progresses it makes sense; a brief understanding of his earlier trip comes in handy in spots as he looks back at how things have changed in the various countries he visits. The continuing communistic state of Bulgaria (in 1990) is particularly poignant and despite his gourmand-like tendencies, Mr. Bryson is not without honest compassion for the poor, currency-waving, bedraggled citizens queuing up to make meager purchases at nearly empty shops. Especially as he reposes in the only place of true civilized comfort in town: the Sheraton. It is also interesting to read the peaceful account of his stay in Sarajevo -- \\"the setting sun crowning a skyline of minarets and ... muezzins' tortured calls to prayer echoing over the rooftops\\" -- on the eve of the bloody few years which would follow in that region.Mr. Bryson is a master at descriptive writing and a master of English, if not language in general. Second only to this is his skillful and biting sarcasm, which allows for at least one LOL moment per page. Some may find it tiresome, some of the humor IS repulsive and it DID border on \\"enough already\\" for me too at times. But I have to say, this is one of the most entertaining AND informative books I've ever read. I highly recommend it, if you can put up with Bryson's non-stop sarcasm and propensity for nerdy self-obsession.Indexed; endpapers contain handy map of Europe with countries outlined. It is a curious oversight that Poland is unnamed."},{"Title":"Neither Here Nor There","review":"Bryson is a very funny writer, and this book will not disappoint. If you've ever travelled through Europe, or want to, this book is an unflinching look at many cities and countries, which will leave you laughing your tail off in many spots. Often cynical, insulting but accurate, this is a worthwhile companion to your average tour guide, and ranks up there with the best in travel books."},{"Title":"Neither Here Nor There","review":"Bill Bryson is an amazing story teller. If you've ever thought of visiting Europe, in this book, he tells you how it was (when he visited it many years earlier) and how it has changed and if you might like to go there. He has a great sense of humor and yet the book is filled with pathos as he relates to the people and the land. Read this book and then find his other travel books on hiking the Appalachian trail - \\"A Walk in the Woods\\", Austrailia \\" A Sunburned Country\\", or living in England and then returning to the U.S.A. and finding himself \\"I'm a Stranger Here Myself.\\" Reader warning - some strong language does occur."},{"Title":"Neither Here Nor There","review":"Bill Bryson is a masterful writer. He has the enviable talent of turning the most mundane occurrences into engaging and often hilarious anecdotes. I am envious of how far and how well he has traveled. While I may not always agree with his opinions, they are just that, opinions. What I really enjoy is how he shares them. In this book he covers an amazing array of countries and cultures. His insights aren't always spot on, but the are almost always amusing. I think his writing was a bit more crass and vulgar than in some of his other books, but it didn't detract much from my enjoyment of this book."},{"Title":"Neither Here Nor There","review":"Since being introduced to \\"In A Sunburned Country\\", I have been a big Bill Bryson fan. Although seen as a travel book, it truly isn't in the strictest sense. Bryson wanted to revisit many of the places that he had as a much younger man, and see it through more worldly eyes (and with a fatter wallet, perhaps). He describes his experiences, often going back and forth from the first trip to the second, in hilarious detail. I laughed out loud through almost every chapter.Yes, he is quick to point out what he doesn't like about various locations. However, even when he's completely charmed by a city, as he is in Rome, he still describes the insanity of the Roman's driving and parking habits in a refreshingly truthful and very funny way.Obviously, there are people who found his candor distasteful, but I thought this was one of his best books."},{"Title":"Neither Here Nor There","review":"Ok, let me make some things clear for some readers.a) This book does not (well, the version I read 12 years ago did not) present itself to be some sort of travel guide to Europe. If you want a recommendation for the best coffee shop in Rome or the nicest phone both in Hammerfest, buy a Lonely Planet Guide or something like that.b) Mr Bryson whilst raised in Des Moines, Iowa, lived in the UK for 20 years, latterly near Settle in North Yorkshire, where I oft saw him leaning over dry stone walls, swinging on gates, or drinking a quiet cup of coffee at the Old Naked man caf&eacute;.c) The above establishment, despite its name does not guarantee any sightings of old men, naked or otherwise. You have to go to the Golden Lion pub for that.d) C) (above) was mild sarcasm, a very British trait and which is you don't appreciate or don't \\"get\\" means that no matter which BB book you read, you are going to end up disappointed.e) This is very important. ALL OF BILL BRYSONS BOOKS TEND TO BE THE SAME SO IF YOU DON'T LIKE d) (above), YOU WILL BE VERY UPSET.f) Points b) to e) (above) are written in the style of Mr Bryson, so if you don't like this review, you are unlikely to like the book.So, if you are still with me, BB rambles around Europe in a hap-hazard way, making wry observations. The thing is this, and I suspect that many readers don't get it. Maybe its an English thing.It spoils the book if you actually try and recreate it by going to see the things that he describes! It is more fun to not go there, and imagine that that's how those places and people actually are, and that amusing and gently madcap adventures follow him around. You will find that should you follow in his footsteps, madcap adventures are unlikely to follow in yours.I think that BB explains his mindset best in his Down Under book, where he explains his best introduction to a new place is to have a cup of coffee and read the local paper. If that sentiment mirrors your own thoughts and attitudes, then I welcome you to the world of Bill Bryson, you will have a wonderful time.For some others, I can save them some heartache by (forgive me Bill) offering you this abridged version.\\"Neither Here nor There - By Bill Bryson (abridged by Pastor of Disaster) .Chapter 1 - I visited every country in Europe (East and West even though the Berlin wall is still up and travel to some eastern-European countries can be rather difficult). All of the hotels I stayed in were really brilliant offering huge rooms with wonderful views, the food was amazing in all of them, and every restaurant and caf&eacute;, I had no problems at all with public transport and found every local I met totally helpful, and eager to present the fascinating cultural and historical aspects of their city/country in all of their splendour and in such a way that I could find no humour in it, just a further respect for my European brothers and sisters.Chapters 2- 34 contains a detailed list of hotels I stayed in, the names and addresses of friendly locals and GPS co-ordinates of places I visited that have faithfully promised not to have changed in the intervening 16 years since I visited them in-case it offends your enjoyment of this book.I thank you."},{"Title":"Neither Here Nor There","review":"After reading \\"A short History of Nearly everything\\", and as a travel-lover, I decided to buy this book from Bill Bryson.I have to say that after reading it it left me a bittersweet sensation. On the one side it is quite funny, specially the first part of the book. However, on the other hand it is too much topic based and many times the author exagerates too much about things.On the whole, funny, but a bit out of date and at some points too biased from today's Europe."},{"Title":"Neither Here Nor There","review":"NEITHER HERE NOR THERE is one of Bryson's earlier travel books, conceived somewhere around 1991. It is a tour of Europe, excluding Spain, Portugal, and Greece. Bryson's method of operation is to steer clear of tours and find lodging and food as needed; his planning is in maps and cultural background reading. He travels by foot, train and bus. This formula produces more winning museum visits and views than desirable rides,lodging and food, but he is not a glass half empty kind of guy. He voices his opinion about bad food and attitudes but he is generous with praise when it is deserved.There is much to enjoy in this book: Bryson's style of humor, often bratty and tear-inducing in its hilarity, is full throttle. While it is not a muse or a sentimental journey, his travels coincide with the 1973 itinerary of his hitchhiking days with pal Steven Katz, the memorable sidekick from A WALK IN THE WOODS. Bryson sprinkles this book with memories and lessons learned from that first foray. The one thing NEITHER HERE NOR THERE lacks is the degree of information with which he packs his later books, particularly IN A SUNBURNED COUNTRY. As he sets off in Paris, he visits a musty old bookstore called Shakespeare &amp; Company and says nothing--c'mon, Bryson, think Hemingway, Fitzgerald, Stein, Joyce! He does get better as he gets into the trip, though, and refuses to let Austria and Kurt Waldheim off the hook for their roles in World War II.One last note: it is interesting to see Europe before the Euro and Sarajevo and Belgrade in that sliver of time between the fall of the Berlin Wall and the devastation of the 1990s. This book is at once very contemporary (American fast food chains everywhere) and yet historic."},{"Title":"Neither Here Nor There","review":"Unfortunately this book is not funny. It is not even entertaining. And it is not a travel book at all. It is a contribution to intolerance and prejudice.I wonder how can be one so superficial, narrow-minded and intolerant! Bill Bryson should think about the difference between a traveller and a tourist. Why do people travel? Probably because they want to experience new cultures and the best way to do it is doing it in an open-minded and sensitive way.But BB did not. He seemed to hunt for negative things only in the most prejudicing way. And he was on a hunt through Europe! Travelling is about SPENDING TIME instead of rushing from one place to another. Travelling is also about TALKING TO PEOPLE instead of reading books in restaurants and other places.I hope that Americans visiting Europe are not biased by this intolerant point of view and hopefully enjoy the diversity of Europe.I also hope that BB stays at home in the future instead of throwing 'Travel books' on the market (isn't there a recent one about Australia - well-timed to the Olympics?)"},{"Title":"Neither Here Nor There","review":"I have enjoyed several of Bryson's books in the past so finally got around to this tour of Europe; I'm sorry I did. This is like one man's mid-life crisis dream of re-living an adolescent fantasy journey, with little real thought about the people in the places he visits. Sources for drink--often LOTS of drink--and the occasional museum are the primary focus of his entire journey, and the xenophobic comments that pass for humor here get very old very quickly.Probably the saddest part of the entire book was being reminded that less than 20 years ago, he could visit Sarajevo and watch families playing quietly in a park. For anyone like me who is just now considering reading this, don't. There are far better, more current travel books and far better Bryson books out there, so do yourself a favor and skip this one."},{"Title":"Neither Here Nor There","review":"The book arrived slower than I expected, but the item was in good condition and I enjoyed the experience."},{"Title":"Neither Here Nor There","review":"I've read a number of Bryson's books and this is by far the weakest one in my opinion. It's not terrible, but Bryson seems to be traveling just for the sake of crossing cities off of his to-visit list. He has a great writing style, but he seems to have very few really intriguing experiences and spends so little time interacting with the locals that you wonder why he bothers leaving home. If you want a more entertaining and informative story about traveling in Western Europe, consider reading my book, \\"Searching for the Holy Grail: My Travels in Western Europe.\\""},{"Title":"Neither Here Nor There","review":"When purchasing audiobooks, I normally follow a simple but very effective rule: never, never, never buy an audiobook read by the author. Even if the author is a talented writer, he/she is invariably a terrible narrator. Always look for audiobooks performed by experienced readers, as in Bryson's own \\"Notes From a Small Island\\" and \\"A Walk in the Woods\\", read by Ron Mclarty.In Bryson's case I made a rare exception when I listened to \\"In a Sunburned Country\\" - the audio version had received reasonable reviews and his performance was indeed adequately entertaining. For this reason I assumed that \\"Neither Here Nor There\\" would be equally enjoyable. I was wrong. Bryson's deadpan monologue makes it sound as though he was bored out of his mind while reading this book. Passages that may have seemed amusing in the written version are herein delivered in a sleep-inducing monotone. The sardonically comedic talent he displayed in his reading of \\"In a Sunburned Country\\" is totally lacking. I would recommend this audiobook only as a cure for insomnia."},{"Title":"Neither Here Nor There","review":"After the author began bragging about his lack of foreign language knowledge, I recognized a familiar type of traveller - opinionated, not interested in learning other peoples culture, ready for derision. That exactly what this book is about: derision and labeling of peoples and cities. Too bad, a city cannot sue for libel! That's Bill Bryson's characteristic of a wonderful German city of Cologne bustling with life, very comfortable to live, with beautiful scenery, lots of public spaces, museums, a famous opera, etc.: \\"Cologne is a dismal place, with its Cathedral occupying a huge ugly square similar to an empty parking lot\\". (something like that - I listened to an audio version). Bill Bryson is so sensitive - he left Cologne in disgust after a night stay since he happened to find a pornographic shop at the train station! How ironic - considering that his book is a fine example of pornographic writing - sexual remarks in bad taste on each page. He described a bad travel companion who annoyed him by categorizing his farts - I can describe his book instead as a collection of verbal farts. Who is it written for? I can imagine someone who hates travelling (especially because of all those foreign languages), so he enjoys Bill Brysons book, and thinks: \\"How wonderful this guy saved me the trouble of seeng all those disgusting European places, with all those French and Germans who want me to obey their stupid rules!\\". But someone who is open minded and curious please don't trust this bunch of lies and distastful jokes. Go and see by yourself, or read Mark Twain if you want a funny travel book."},{"Title":"Neither Here Nor There","review":"I was totally dissappointed that the author of so many wonderful and compelling travelling stories could produce such a blatantly offensive novel. Neither Here Nor There is nothing more than a rambling, stereotypical take on Europe and its people. Absent is any of the charm, wit, and carefully constructed observations of people and places that are the hallmarks of his other books."},{"Title":"Neither Here Nor There","review":"\\"Neither here nor there\\"by Bill BrysonIn the book \\"Neither here nor there\\" the American writer Bill Bryson tells about his adventures during his trips to Europe. The hole book is divided into twenty two chapters and every chapter tells the reader about a different place. In the first two chapters he describes his trip to the northernmost European town Hammerfest and in his typical sarcastic way he tells about the exhausting bus ride and the people he get to know. After an apparently endless journey by bus he finally arrives at Hammerfest. At first he is really bored in the small town as nothing ever seems to happen there, but after he have spent some weeks in the dark Hammerfest, he starts to enjoy the easy way of living there. He gets to know the advantage of having time for things you usually can't do. Furthermore, he starts making friends with the Mayor and some other inhabitants. So at the end of his stay in Hammerfest he doesn't only has got to know most of the people there, but even has seen Northern Lights, which had been the reason for that trip. After the fascinating event of the spectacular Northern Lights, that impressed him deeply, he decides to return to Oslo, although for a moment he has doubts if he should leave Hammerfest so quicklyHe also remembers his first trip to Europe as a young man in the seventies, where he went by plane and got impressed by Europe and its people as it seemed to be so different from everything he had known before. He got to know the hospitality of a couple from Belgium and their Citroen 2CV as he hitch-hiked to find a room for the next few days. Although the wife didn't really trust him, the man was fascinated of him and wanted to spend more time with him, but Bryson himself thought that they had been very strange. So he was glad when he finally found a small hotel where he could stay. That summer he also tramped through Britain, Ireland, Scandinavia, Germany, Switzerland, Austria and Italy."},{"Title":"Neither Here Nor There","review":"Many of the negative reviews of this book point out that more often than not Bryson goes of on complaint tangents about a slew of things about his travels. I must agree with these critics. It seems obvious that if you don't like the bizzarity of red-light districts don't peruse them or if you don't want to spend an uncomfortable pair of days on a bus bound for the outer reaches of Norway don't board the bus. Simple as that! Yet Bryson does these things and finds fault with them. I believe that may have something to do with America and maybe only Americans can understand this. We are a country who, for many of us, love complaining more than not. We are not stoics. We are commenters and fault-finders. In this manner I can indentify with Bryson as I myself have been a traveller in Europe and frequently felt the same way. Another negative that stopped me from giving all the stars to this finely written book is Bryson's pervasive hate of industrialism or mass commercialism and mass tourism. I'm sorry to say it, but if we take a quick peek at the recent history of Europe we see that it may have never been the storybook/postcard destination that Bryson envisions. Maybe he had such a hard time finding his perfect Europe because its a figment of his imagination. Let's take a peek at this history- for the first half of the last Europe was rocked by the two most devestating wars ever- before that Europe experienced fifty years of instability as revolutions came and were violently supressed in nearly every country-before that were the massive invasions of Napoleon-before that was a country were you were luck to live to your twentieth birthday and not be killed by Europe's world-famous crowd diseases that spawned from Europe's history of pure squallor and lack of anything that we would today recognize as sanitization. Now Bryson complains about the culture sapping American-style commerialism and disneylandish style tourism. If that Europe's biggest problem all Europeans and travellers should thank thier lucky stars when comparing this with Europe's past history. The Europe Bryson wants is elusive in that Europe may never have been the perfect combination of unseemly commercialism and sanitation that it appears he wants. I gave the book four stars because it is one the few books that I read that made me laugh out loud. It is extremelly well written. Bryson's sense of humor even during the complaint sessions is amazing. I suggest anybody who has ever even thought of Europe to read this immediately."},{"Title":"Neither Here Nor There","review":"When a prejudiced guy goes abroad to nourish his prejudices, it begets a book full of clich&eacute;s. Sure, BB is subtle enough not to let us in on his preconceived judgements, but he definitely carries a bagful of them. The book even lost its (claimed) humor on me because, as an European, I've been familiar with all those commonplaces for ages. \\"Neither Here Nor There\\" is so shallow that it has almost nothing to do with what Europe is about. Indeed, BB should stick to his English teaching knack."},{"Title":"Neither Here Nor There","review":"Unlike \\"Small Island,\\" this book sticks to big cities that are familiar to travelers. Alternating the present trip with a years-ago trip with Katz makes this more interesting. He has his rants and he sometimes whines, but he is always funny and the narrative moves right along. This is not a travel guide but a series of essays."},{"Title":"Neither Here Nor There","review":"fantastic book...very funny, history facts intertwined throughout...well written. made me want to go back to europe!"},{"Title":"Neither Here Nor There","review":"I have traveled extensively and while I don't always agree with Bryson's analysis of an individual locale, I did enjoy this book. An easy read, I was able to complete it on a flight and the return trip. If you have visited Europe, this book will be more enjoyable to you, however, I question its value as a travel guide to the first time visitor. I have not read any of Bryson's other travelogues, but I have put several on my Christmas list!"},{"Title":"Neither Here Nor There","review":"Bryon's humor had me bending over laughing, while trying to drive in Boston traffic. Any book that will make Boston traffic easier is a miracle. I loved being brought to every corner of Europe in this tape. I will get this book in paperbook to re-read the humor and be brought back to Europe again. I can only hope to meet Bryson's at the upcoming Maui Writer's Conference and have him laughing through the pages of my book."},{"Title":"Neither Here Nor There","review":"In this book, Bill Bryson retraces the path of his trip which he took with a friend in the 1970s. He runs into awkward moments, memorable moments, and, best of all, hilarious moments. Bryson has a way of describing funny incidents so that one laughs hard. For instance, he describes that after one party one night back on the 1970s trip, his friend got back, stumbled in, and &quot;urinated in the wastebasket [thinking it was the sink]&quot; Bryson could have used simpler words, but this line, if spoken, would probably be in a completely serious tone, either actually serious or faking it. Either way, this 'serious tone' line describing a hilarious instance makes it even more funny. Another thing that makes this book especially funny is the way Bryson talks to the audience. One example of this is when he is talking about one country sending out men to fight in the war. He says, &quot;they sent out eighty men, and, -you're going to like this- they came back with eighty-one, because they made a friend&quot; These qualities plus Bryson's funny descriptive style create an outstanding, hilarious travel book which I like a lot!"},{"Title":"Neither Here Nor There","review":"This was my second book by Bryson and the first audio-book of his I have listened to. There were times when I had to slow down from my usual pace of 75-80 mph to about 50 because I was laughing so hard I couldn't see. For anyone who has visited Europe, the book rings true. Mr. Bryson's political views only broke in once, toward the end with a tangent on the nobility of the idea of communism or something, but other than that I enjoyed this book-on-tape immensely."},{"Title":"Neither Here Nor There","review":"Travel Writing is very difficult to do well. There's a balance to be struck between simply telling the reader about the places you're passing through (which might as well be a guidebook), and entertaining him (which risks not talking about the travel, and talking about something else). Bill Bryson strikes that balance perfectly. He captures the spirit of the places he visits accurately, whilst at the same time managing to be genuinely funny. His love of Italy and contempt for the Austrians are heartfelt, and come over so strongly because of his tone of voice. That really is the most remarkable aspect. He uses a friendly, lively, approachable tone that feels just like a conversation with an old friend, whilst still keeping his descriptive prose stylish enough to be evocative of the places he sees. Great stuff."},{"Title":"Neither Here Nor There","review":"I loved this book. This story of his travels in Europe, left me wishing he had continued into Asia, just to kept the story going. When I lent the book and &quot;the Lost Continent&quot; to a work mate, he read it so fast, I had to lend him Notes from a Small Island&quot; just to keep him going for the weekend. Bryson keeps this story moving all the time and it doesn't labour in places as some of his other books do. Quite funny, but more enjoyable as a theatre of the mind, created but his wonderful descriptions of the places he visits."},{"Title":"Neither Here Nor There","review":"An extremely humorous and observant account of a mans travels throughout Europe. The reader cannot help but relate to many of the situations that Bill Bryson finds himself in. He is at the same time, informative, enthusiastic, witty, sarcastic, intolerant and weary! Another classic from the man from Des-Moines (where?)."},{"Title":"Neither Here Nor There","review":"In 1990 Bill Bryson set out to \\"do Europe\\". He says that his motivation was to relive his experiences from tours in Europe in 1972 and 1973 when he was a young student wandering around Europe with a backpack.In reality it seems as if the primary reason for Bill Bryson to do this trip was so that he could then write a funny book about the trip.\\"Neither Here Nor There\\" is, in fact, a very funny book, at least in the beginning. Bill Bryson can describe situations in a very humorous way, and he's willing to make fun of himself, as well as everything around him.Unfortunately, after a while the humor wears thin. Then it wears very thin. Then you begin to dissect the humor, and realize that you've been had.Bill Bryson's method of traveling is to emulate the kind of tourism we all like to ridicule. He typically arrives by train in a new city in the evening. He has no hotel reservation so he has to spend time finding a hotel that is not really what he wanted. He sees \\"the sights\\" that one is supposed to see in that city. He makes no effort to get in touch with the local people, to learn about their lives, or to understand their country and society. He spends typically 2-3 days in each city and then goes to work on figuring out how to get to the next city or country on his list, which often leads to further complications.This is obviously not the way to travel if you're writing a travel book. Nobody in their right mind would want to read about this kind of traveling.But Bill Bryson is not writing a travel book, he's writing a funny book, and he has a sure-fire recipe:1. Do things in problematic ways, and then make fun of all the trials and tribulations that result.2. Mix in lots of flashbacks to the trips of your youth, with much juvenile humor related to the drives that young men are so driven by.3. Feign incomprehension about everything foreign and satirize everything that is unfamiliar.4. Make funny remarks intended to reinforce national prejudices.This last type of humor can be especially tiring. Here are a few examples to illustrate what I mean:\\"Let's face it, the French Army couldn't beat a girls' hockey team.\\" (pg 32)\\"The (German) women still don't shave their armpits. ... They all look so beautiful and stylish, and then they lift up their arms and there's a Brillo pad hanging there.\\" (pg 91)\\"In Norway, three people and a bottle of beer is a party; in Sweden the national sport is suicide.\\" (pg 97)\\"But the most preposterous law of all, a law so pointless as to scamper along the outer reaches of the surreal, is the Swedish one that requires motorists to drive with their headlights on during the daytime.\\" (pg 110)\\"I love the way the Italians park. You turn any street corner in Rome and it looks as if you've just missed a parking competition for blind people.\\" (pg 123)In conclusion, if you're someone who \\"did Europe\\" in your youth and you want to relive fond memories in a humorous way, then you may well like this book. Most other readers will probably start out laughing, then smiling, then wondering why the jokes seem to have lost their appeal, and finally ending up wishing they'd picked a real travel book or a real humorous book.Rennie PetersenPS. Just for the record, here is a list of the places covered: Norway (Hammerfest, Oslo), France (Paris), Belgium (Brussels, Bruges, Spa, Durbuy), Germany (Aachen, Cologne, Hamburg), Holland (Amsterdam), Denmark (Copenhagen), Sweden (Gothenburg, Stockholm), Italy (Rome, Naples, Sorrento, Capri, Florence, Milan, Como), Switzerland (Brig, Geneva, Bern), Liechtenstein, Austria (Innsbruck, Salzburg, Vienna), Yugoslavia (Split, Sarajevo, Belgrade), Bulgaria (Sofia), Turkey (Istanbul)."},{"Title":"Neither Here Nor There","review":"This has to be one of the funniest travel guides ever written. I loved it - what else can I say? At last, the truth about Europe, and because I'm European, I'm allowed to comment (even though Scotland wasn't covered)."},{"Title":"Neither Here Nor There","review":"I bought Bryson's book while idling in Heathrow, waiting for my plane to Nice. I started reading it soon after boarding. Trouble began when I started laughing out loud. The plane was maybe 1/3 full in business class (where I sat), and I tried to keep my guffaws down, but could not. I had to stop reading when I started getting strange looks from fellow passengers and the flight attendants. So, I have a warning for anyone buying this book: don't read it in public. Read it in quiet places where noone can see or hear you! Being Belgian myself, and having lived in Luxemburg and France, and been to many of the places he mentions, I can tell that he hits the mark on more than one occasion!"},{"Title":"Neither Here Nor There","review":"My wife has been sorry about introducing me to Bill Bryson ever since the day she gave me &quot;The Lost Continent&quot;. Since I am from Europe (Holland) and have travelled most part of Europe I can only fully agree with the writers descriptions of the countries he travelled (especially Belgium). Do not read this book in public places! People tend to react in various ways to a grown man laughing out loud all by himself."},{"Title":"Neither Here Nor There","review":"I read Neither Here Nor There a week after returning from my inter-rail trip around Europe, at the same age as Bryson was and with a friend...who is nothing like Katz. This book just captured so many of my experiences as a European traveller, and as a European. He is spot on about so many things, particularly France, Austria and Germany. Indeed the similarities were almost uncanny when he talks about the hotel he stayed in on his honeymoon which he was distraught to find is now a Holiday Inn. We walked past this hotel in question every day from our hotel around the corner!! A fantastically funny read- the right length - or the stereotypes could become grating - if they weren't so correct most of the time."},{"Title":"Neither Here Nor There","review":"I have never laughed so loud from a book in my life. His Swiss riddles still make me giggle. The only reason I am giving the book a 9 and not a 10 is that he hated Florence, and anyone that hates Florence deserves to be punished!"},{"Title":"Neither Here Nor There","review":"As a relatively seasoned traveller, who over the years has visited many of the places which Bill Bryson visited, the book struck a chord with me. It's not so much the descriptions of the locations he visits but of the people he meets that captivates me. The descriptions of national characteristics as well as the personal idiosynchrasies he observes left me in stitches with much laughing out loud. This book as a travel book is now getting a bit dated but as a piece of writing it remains outstanding. It's perhaps not as good as Notes from a Small Island but that might be because, being a Brit, I am even more familiar with the locations and his observations were pointed at my compatriots - always good for a laugh."},{"Title":"Neither Here Nor There","review":"This book is unbelievable. The back cover carries a blurb from a British newspaper that promises you &quot;belly aching&quot; laughs. From the beginning, this proves to be true.Bill describes his first trip to Europe as a 17 year old. He tells us how he imagined his flight across the Atlantic to be a dream come true - he would be sat next to an 18 year old blonde nymphomaniac, who, halfway through the flight, would politely ask if she could please sit on his face. Instead, he got a spotty religious freak.The book is a gem to read. Bill relays his most personal thoughts about Europe - both current time, and as it was when he was a teenager. He manages to keep the book humorous and light hearted without sacrificing any honesty or emotion.If you start to read this book, you'll not put it down until you finish. Just don't let anyone else borrow it..."},{"Title":"Neither Here Nor There","review":"Bill Bryson is a traveller's travel writer. Not content tofollow well-worn tourist trails, he blazes his way acrossnations by the seat of his pants. This is no dry,philosophical tome on travel and its affect on the psyche,or an author attempting to 'find himself' while on a daringjourney. No, this is the story of Bill Bryson stumbling hisway across Europe, encountering all manner of misery, joy,and hilarity along the way. Written in an uproariously funny,conversational tone, 'The Lost Continent' will make your sidesache with laughter as you read (and re-read) it."},{"Title":"Neither Here Nor There","review":"Unfortunately this book is not funny. It is not even entertaining. And it is not a travel book at all. It is a contribution to intolerance and prejudice.I wonder how can be one so superficial, narrow-minded and intolerant! Bill Bryson should think about the difference between a traveller and a tourist. Why do people travel? Probably because they want to experience new cultures and the best way to do it is doing it in an open-minded and sensitive way.But BB did not. He seemed to hunt for negative things only in the most prejudicing way. And he was on a hunt through Europe! Travelling is about SPENDING TIME instead of rushing from one place to another. Travelling is also about TALKING TO PEOPLE instead of reading books in restaurants and other places.I hope that Americans visiting Europe are not biased by this intolerant point of view and hopefully enjoy the diversity of Europe.I also hope that BB stays at home in the future instead of throwing 'Travel books' on the market (isn't there a recent one about Australia - well-timed to the Olympics?)"},{"Title":"Neither Here Nor There","review":"Sure he's kind of funny, but this book was more frustrating than rewarding for me. Bryson here seems to be extraordinarily ethnocentric and much of the humor is from looking down on other cultures. He offers observations but no real insight and is more like a spoiled kid on a trip than a travel writer. I did learn one good thing about the bizarre Capuchin Monk tomb in Rome, other than that the book was a waste. I abandoned it in a foreign hotel room- not even worth carrying home to the used bookstore."},{"Title":"Neither Here Nor There","review":"This was my first Bill Bryson book and I can still remember riding the subway to work and errupting into fits of frenzied laughter as dour-faced clerks and bankers peered disapprovingly at me over their morning broadsheets. If you happen to be one of those people, I apologize. I couldn't help myself.With Neither Here Nor There, you are not going to get a comprehensive travel guide to Europe filled with effusive descriptions or ponderous sentences like, 'Politically, as well as socially, Sweden is currently at a crossroads....' Rather, what you will get is an irreverant account of comedian-philosopher Bill Bryson country hopping about the world's most-cultured continent with no real purpose, point, or plan. And yet it works. From encounters with non-English-speaking Swedes to a flashback of a run-in with some beer-swilling, redneck Austrians, this diminuative volume makes for some great escapism. And between the jokes, there's some fine writing, a foreshadowing, of sorts, of things to come. Bryson's description of his experience in Norway, for example, is deftly-penned. Please note that this book isn't meant to be taken seriously. Its title should tell you that.Troy Parfitt, author of Why China Will Never Rule the World"},{"Title":"Neither Here Nor There","review":"Bryson might be the funniest travel writer around. He is also very informative. This is one of his early books, he has not yet really found his style.Mr. Bryson travels through continental Europe. His journey has two purposes: he wants to write about Europe, and he wants to relieve a journey he made in his youth with, the by now infamous, Katz. His inner journey is a middle-aged man trying to remember his youth, even if you sometimes wonder if he has really grown out of it! His outer journey lets him experience the feel of all the places he visits. That is by far the best aspect of the book! Here he is no-holds barred funny! He can pinpoint the national bad habits of every country he visits. Since he also lets us know about his own bad habits it is not insulting. There is a love and a respect hidden among all his writings. He loves travelling, and he loves all places he visits. He seems to have a nack for capturing the soul of the places he visits. His books can almost be used as travel guides."},{"Title":"Neither Here Nor There","review":"I first heard of Bill Bryson when someone mentioned him to me in a conversation. So, off I went to the bookstore, looked around, and thought, &quot;The Europe one sounds good.&quot; I have been to some of the places Bryson visits (Amsterdam, Paris, Belgium, Germany - but not the part he went to, and Istanbul) so; I wondered how we would compare notes.A comment about the other reviews here; Bryson is accused of xenophobia (Fear or contempt of that which is foreign, especially of strangers or foreign peoples) and other such politically incorrect attitudes. However, I think such designations are a bit of an over reaction. I do agree with one reviewer that there seems to be some gratuitous swearing and this could have been scaled back.I found it interesting when Bryson visits places that are probably not on non-European's Travel hit list; Norway, Sweden, Denmark and Yugoslavia. However, it is interesting to see what he thinks about these places. In this book, one gets a sense of what it is like to go traveling; one must constantly find places to stay and places to eat. The downside to this is that Bryson calls nearly every place he stays at very expensive; one wonders if he is comparing it to the USA... At one point, he recounts a familiar (to me anyway) traveler&#65533;s dilemma; one travels to experience a different culture, yet one still wants pieces of home for comfort (whether it me English-language television, recognizable food, air conditioning etc) and to acquire these comforts is often prohibitively expensive.Some of my favorite parts were in Yugoslavia (he went there before all the wars, bombing etc wrecked the country), Italy and Scandinavia. A common problem that I have experienced in certain parts of Europe is communication. I have undying admiration for the Dutch; everybody in the Netherlands speaks 3 or 4 languages. I am fluent in English and to lesser degrees in French and German. Yet, I think it better to try to communicate in the local language than always blunder around in English. Sometimes strange things happen; once I was in a small town in Turkey, and in not a few shops, I met people who knew German.I also agree that Bryson is fun to read and reading this reminds me of meeting people on the road and swapping stories. I have just started reading his book about Australia (title: &#65533;In a sunburned country&#65533;) and I think it is much better researched (there is a bibliography), the writing seems better but perhaps it is somewhat less funny (in the course sense of the word)."},{"Title":"Neither Here Nor There","review":"Bryson is a good deal funnier and more mature than, say, Jeff Greenwald, but he falls into the trap of not meeting enough locals and padding his book with initially-amusing-but-eventually-repetitious accounts of surly service workers and mediocre hotels. He helpfully weaves tips on traveler's checks and museums into some of his anecdotes."},{"Title":"Neither Here Nor There","review":"I shared this book with my father one rainy afternoon and we could not stop laughing. Every few paragraphs he'd erupt into giggles again and share Byson's latest gem.Ok. Some reviewers have complained about rough language, crude descriptions and talk of, well, farts. Relax! Start thinking like a thirteen year old boy and enjoy the book. Xenophobic? Nah, he's poking fun at what we all know is true and yet don't really want to admit. Keep in mind that Byson makes fun of himself, too. Few writer's have been able to make crossing a steet so enjoyable. (See the section on Paris)."},{"Title":"Neither Here Nor There","review":"As a fan of the other Bill Bryson books, I was disappointed by this one. It really appeared to me that Bryson took this trip because he wanted to relive the wonder of his first youthful European trak without really realizing how much he had changed. He still offers funny anecdotes but he clearly did not connect with many Europeans and his sarcasm was not tempered with much genuine enjoyment of his experience. I would have been just as happy for him to have spent his summer in England with his family and simply used his extraordinary ability to tell stories about his daily life!"},{"Title":"Neither Here Nor There","review":"I read this book shortly after my study abroad trip to Rome. I found Bryson to be very humorous and laughed out loud numerous times. I enjoyed the book while i read it in about 3 days flat.My only issues when getting further along was when he obviously began to be homesick. He would pick on each location and pick apart what problems they had and complain about it. After a while he just became cranky and made you almost want to quit reading the book. He rushed through his trip near the end and it was sloppy.Although a good amount of what he said still applies today, but this book is out of date to read about current Europe. He took this trip back in 1990. It's been 17 years and I would not use this book to accurately give a feel for each city visited.I still more or less enjoyed the book and would read just to refresh myself on my own memories of Europe and to have a good chuckle."},{"Title":"Neither Here Nor There","review":"This is one of my favorite humor/travel books. There are several sections that make me laugh out loud for pages, something not that many books can do. Over the space of a year, I've re-read it twice, and it remains as good and bright as ever. I've gone on to buy all Mr. Bryson's books, and have enjoed them all, but for me this is one of his very best."},{"Title":"Neither Here Nor There","review":"I couldn't stop laughing while reading this book after a day-long meeting, back in my hotel room in England. I have travelled to Europe at least once a year, sometimes for business, most for holidays, for the past 10 years. The author's experiences, and impressions, of Europe match mine exactly. This book is a wonderful memoir for anyone who has travelled to Europe on a self-guided tour; it will remind them of what they've seen and done there. It is definitely not a travel &quot;guide&quot; book for people who intend to use the book for planning their trips."},{"Title":"Neither Here Nor There","review":"It can't truly be said about many authors, but Bill Bryson is laugh-out-loud funny. Especially if you like your humor with a little edge to it. &quot;Neither Here Nor There,&quot; was one of his travelogs that preceeded his massively sucessful &quot;A Walk in the Woods&quot; (and is now a dozen years old). Yet it is not remotley dated.The book is basically Bryson doing what he does best, bumming around a particular countryside (this time all over continental Euroope) and commenting upon everything he sees, hears, smells, tastes and touches. He does not particularly seek out resort spots, nor would the typical tourist want to imitate his arduous treks (many of which involve endless walking). But that's what makes his work so charming. He travels the way most of us live, and his sense of humor is unsurpassed.Overall, another winning travel book from one of the most offbeat popular writers working today."},{"Title":"Neither Here Nor There","review":"I always enjoy reading Bill Bryson's books, but this was a little disappointing. I have the same mixed feelings about the book as he does the places he's describing. He moves around too quickly, and although he seems to have a good &quot;feel&quot; for the cities etc. he visits, they are inevitably a bit superficial. Indeed, some of his observations are flawed. For example, he must be joking when he says that, &quot;the Italians technological contribution to humankind stopped with the pizza oven&quot;. A typical Anglo-Saxon stereotype, and, as it happens wildly inaccurate: the Italians are fine engineers, and....what about Marconi, for example?I also found his (Anglo-Saxon) &quot;can't (won't) speak the language&quot; attitude rather irritating. With a little more effort, perhaps he might have done better."},{"Title":"Neither Here Nor There","review":"Very few book provide laugh out loud humor. In fact, I didn't realize this book did until people on the plane started asking me what had me crying in the aisle!So, if you've been to Europe and haven't read TRAVELS, your trip isn't complete!If you haven't been to Europe, don't read this on pain of becoming most unbecomingly jealous of those who have!Live Europe through the perspicacious and witty eyes of fellow traveler Bill Bryson, the very personable Master of the Travelogue renaissance.A joy to read, it's as much a series of shorts on various locations throughout Europe as a complete novel, connnected by the trials and tribulations of one B. Bryson and companion.TRAVELS also provides a great view back 20 years in European travel - back when Europe seemed a bit more like a 3rd world country, if all is to be believed. Don't let this scare you, things have changed quite a lot (if not the toilets, of course).Cheers,BilFish"},{"Title":"Neither Here Nor There","review":"During my recent trip to Europe, I decided to read this book since I enjoyed his other book Walk in the Woods. It was well worth it. The book was extremely funny, even to the point where I would laugh out loud during the middle of train trips.There were parts of the book that were probably exaggerated for effect but nonetheless the entire book was entertaining and well worth the read."},{"Title":"Neither Here Nor There","review":"I bought this book in Heathrow while waiting for my plane to Boston. Some indefinite time later I was surprised to find myself landing. This book is brilliant! While not intended for a serious traveler this is great for anybody who's been to Europe, especially for those who have traveled lightly, never staying in any one place more than several days. My experience is in many ways similar to that of Mr. Bryson, and while I'm not as sarcastic as he is, I can attest that in most cases he is right on target. This is a great study of why most stereotypes are so persistent - that's because for the large part they are true! What really surprised me, however, was Mr. Bryson's style - he effortlessly combines humorous dialog and some obviously contrived stories with great, almost poetic (Northern Lights, for instance) descriptions of places he's seen. Not many writers posses his skill. For those who did not like this book - lighten up, folks - this is not your average &quot;two thumbs up&quot; trip to Disney Land. Thanks a lot for this great and very funny book."},{"Title":"Neither Here Nor There","review":"Excerpt from the book: \\"In the evening I went looking for a restaurant (-in Cologne). This is often a problem in Germany. For one thing, there's a good chance that there will be three guys in lederhosen playing polka music, so you have to look carefully through the windows and question the proprietor closely to make sure that Willi and the Bavarian Boys won't bound onto a little stage at half past eight, because there is nothing worse than being just about to tuck into your dinner, a good book propped in front of you, only to find yourself surrounded by ruddy-faced Germans waving beer steins and singing the ''Horst Wessel Lied'' for all they're worth. It should have been written in the armistice treaty that the Germans would be required to lay down their accordions along with their arms.\\"This book is full of clich&eacute;s (French are arrogant and rude, Italians loud, Germans efficient and humorless etc.). That's fine with me, I sometimes have the same clich&eacute;s in mind when travelling (as long as they are not taken to seriously). And as a German I have learned to live with the equasion: Germany = Bavaria (you will not find lederhosen nor polka music (which originates from Czech Republik) in Cologne or beer steins in a town that \\"invented\\" the tiny and infamous 0,2 liter beer glasses. Believe me it takes some time and effort to get drunk in Cologne ;-)) You will find things like that all over in the book due to the fact that he stayed only for a few days in a particular city (at best) or even left a city after a few hours because he dind't like the surrounding of the railway station. The rest is an exhausting description of hotels (including the search for, the way to and the way back from one), restaurants and trains. Still it's quite funny here and there, BUT (although Mr. Bryson seems to be a quite sophisticated guy) to claim that germans gather in restaurants to sing the \\"Horst Wessel Lied\\" (a Nazi propaganda song honoring a SA-Sturmf&uuml;hrer, who was shot by a communist in 1930) is just plain insulting. I really doubt that Mr. Bryson even knows what the song is about, let alone ever heard it in public (for it's banned by law in Germany). Someone who writes in all honesty about s**t like that is either mindless of the consequences, malicious or plain stupid."},{"Title":"Neither Here Nor There","review":"In Neither here nor there, Bryson soaks up Europe and sprinkles it with his wit, observations and humour to go. You have to admire his ability. He goes to Rome and Paris and Berlin, but doesn't stop there because this is Europe we are talking about. He finds himself in Bulgaria and Hammerfest, looks at Istanbul and trots along Oslo. What is the result?An undoubtedly entertaining book. The first few chapters are as fresh and engaging, the words flow through your conscience magically. One country's culture is analysed and evaluated in the most brilliantly delightful way. There are jokes. None of them are subtle and are all of the same mode, Bryson-esque, and for 75% of the time,they please. He makes a particularly good day of his a good chapter. You laugh. He loves the sunshine, museums and parks.Then sets in. Bryson appears to enjoy making fun of people. He makes fun of himself and pleases the reader at his expense, but openly insulting a poor waiter? And there are the occassional comments that you have to read several times in order to come close to not saying, &quot;Hey, this is racist.&quot; And he uses the term, 'What a wonderful country', several times. He spends too little time here and rushes off to the next, only to waste pages and pages there. Why does he always tell us about his experiences with dining? It begins to flag. And his travels become slightly tiresome. He has to go to parks and museums. You begin not to care about whether or not he goes to Sorrento and Capri because you know he'll throw around the same jokes and make roughly the same comments as he did with Rome. It's only during the last quarter of the book, which is a bit too late, that you feel this is a good book. Because you realise the contrasts between the beginning and the end. These are pedantic quibbles, but they are warranted and should be considered.Bryson is honest with us. He shares his opinions, recalls his travels with Katz twenty years earlier, relieves us with extremely amusing anecdotes. He tells us whether he likes this place or that, or whether he loathes whatever. It is great but, because he stops inventing after a while, it becomes a slight chore. And the question that I ask is if Europe can be condensed into bite-sized diluted pieces of writing to form a 300-page book. No?If you aren't particularly critical and enjoy a read where for the most part, you can leave your brain behind, Neither here nor there is a smashing read. But, and here it is, but his later books, especially Note from a Small Island and A Walk in the Woods are much more enjoyable, detailed but at the same time readable. This isn't to say Neither here not there isn't good or delectable or lovable, but it simply isn't as good. His later books seem like results of learning from mistakes in this book and, it comes down to this, they are much more worth your cash. Invest in these books if you want Bill Bryson. If you've read all of his except for this, you'll probably be disappointed."},{"Title":"Neither Here Nor There","review":"First, let me say I'm a Bill Bryson fan.His &quot;A Walk In The Woods&quot; and &quot;In a Sunburnt Country&quot; were brilliant, witty, informative and thoroughly entertaining. They were, in short, everything this book is not.&quot;Neither Here Nor There&quot; is a travellogue with the emphasis on log. What we get is a listing of the author's various motels, transportation and meals in different European cities. This book is heavy on the actual travel and accomodations and very light on the places he's visiting. In other books, Bryson would tell the story of the place, livening up his observations with fascinating tidbits of history and curiousities that made most of the places interesting in themselves. In this book, the places seem just an excuse for him to ride the train or bus, change hotels, and drink beer and eat.There are a few -- disappointingly few -- laugh out loud moments in the book. On the whole, the witicisms and wry observations are replaced by overly long descriptive sentences.This book was written before some of his more recent successes. The earlier Bryson doesn't compare well with the current model. I'd skip it (and &quot;Notes From a Small Island&quot; which suffers from some of the same deficiencies) and go to his other books if one is looking for the enjoyable Bryson reads."},{"Title":"Neither Here Nor There","review":"In the early 1970s, when he was twenty, Bryson left Iowa for a summer of wandering around Europe. He enjoyed it so much, he did it again the next summer. Then he actually moved to England and took up residence in his career as a journalist, though he somehow didn't manage to see much more of the Continent. Twenty years after his first wanderjahr, he had a hankering to do it yet again, hitting as many of the original sights as possible, just to compare notes with his earlier self. The result is a sometimes witty, sometimes annoying tale of a middle-aged monolingual man's impressions of what happened to the Europe he first fell in love with, but which was discovered by American capitalism in the interim. Starting in Hammerfest, the northernmost town in Europe (he wanted to view the northern lights), he makes his way in fits and starts through Scandinavia in the early Spring (which he doesn't much like), Paris (which he loves though he doesn't much care for the people who actually live there), the Low Countries (Amsterdam isn't what it was), back to Copenhagen and Stockholm (mostly expensively disappointing), and finally to Rome by plane because he missed the sun. He loves the Eternal City, Capri, and Italy generally, with the exception of Milan (which apparently isn't Italian enough). He loves the scenery in Switzerland but doesn't care much for the Swiss. He doesn't particularly approve of Zurich or Geneva, either. And he makes it clear several times that German is a funny-sounding language and that German menus are dangerous to order from because you never know what weird dish you might get. He seems to like Yugoslavia, mostly because of its primitiveness and because it isn't crammed with tourists -- and he really dotes on Sofia, which is just strange. On the other hand, he doesn't like Istanbul at all.Bryson is the sort of traveler who actually enjoys wandering by himself through a strange town, not understanding a word anyone says, not knowing the local mores. Apparently, he likes being a stranger -- The Other. I prefer knowing what I'm doing, understanding what's happening, appreciating what I'm looking at. I hate discovering, six months after returning home, that there was someplace I would have made every effort to visit, had I only known it was there. Anyway. Though he can be amusing, Bryson comes across as a bit of an Ugly American. Or Ugly Adopted Yorkshireman, or whatever. He tends to make wisecracks based on ignorance, such as making fun of the fact that Norway (in 1991) required motorists to drive with their headlights on, even in the sunniest weather. He considers this not only pointless but \\"surreal\\" -- although the practice now, fifteen years later, is widely recommended in the U.S. and (yes) required by law in some areas. So much for European backwardness."},{"Title":"Neither Here Nor There","review":"About as unfunny a book as I've read recently. Bryson's attempt to force a funny expression into every other sentence makes the experience of reading this akin to spending a few hours with a hack comedian who's trying out his new material on you. I found the humor forced, smug, and really pretty mean spirited...unless you like petty jabs at the expense of the overweight and acne-scarred, and tired sterotypes about Germans, Swiss, etc., leave this title on the shelf."},{"Title":"Neither Here Nor There","review":"I was lucky enough to be able to interview Bill Bryson when this book came out, and the interview was for a literary magazine. I think people forget just how skillful good comic writing is. Humorous writers make it look so easy, but writing that can make you laugh out loud - and this does, on almost every page - has to be well-observed and sharply written. I also used to teach travel writing classes, and as well as using extracts from some of the more literary travel writers, like Bruce Chatwin and Paul Theroux, I also used extracts from this book, to encourage students to be more observational as they traveled the world. And in person Bill Bryson was charm itself, giving me several hours of his time, even though the interview was only for a tiny magazine."},{"Title":"Neither Here Nor There","review":"I jumped on the Bryson bandwagon after reading \\"A Walk in the Woods\\" a few years back. I loved his self-deprecating humor, his factoids and quirky side-notes, as well as his anecdotal style. I continued on that bandwagon with \\"I'm a Stranger Here Myself,\\" which was laugh-out-loud funny. Since then I've read most of his books, and although my enjoyment of them has varied, I've never been disappointed.Until reading \\"Neither Here nor There.\\" Perhaps my expectations were too high, having traveled in over half the places Bryson details in his travelogue. But \\"details\\" and \\"travelogue\\" are both too kind in their description of this book. From his first whiny, self-centered moments in Norway, Bryson makes it clear that his story will be more about him than about the peoples or places he visits. His chapter on Oslo is a sham, barely even mentioning the city. He spends a good deal of time complaining about lack of beauty in Brussels instead of telling us what the city has to offer instead--though I agree, it's not a pretty city, in general. He makes all the usual comments about Amsterdam's seedy side, but provides little insight into the mindset or history. Frankly, he seems grumpy throughout the book, as though held at gunpoint to meet a contract with his publisher. He's the humorous uncle who shows up at Thanksgiving dinner drunk, and then makes the entire meal uncomfortable with his self-congratulatory humor and lack of manners. He talks about the complete waste that he believes dogs are--and says he would personally shoot poodles. He even has the nerve to compare Belgian spa treatments to Josef Mengele's horrors in WWII concentration camps. Not exactly the most suitable comparison when a few pages later Bryson points out the number of Belgians killed by SS stormtroopers in one particular confrontation.I will continue to read Bryson's work, based on his track record, and on the fact that he can be funny when he's not drunk on his own clever sentences and feigned knowledge of his location. This book, though, is a forgettable almost unforgivable waste of his talents, Europe's richness and intrigue, and my time."},{"Title":"Neither Here Nor There","review":"I loved Bryson's book about Britain but this and his book about America just fall flat. The US book confirmed that following American interstates is dull as dirt, but hey, I already knew that. The Europe book skates around the Continent combining a lack of depth and humor in a deadly fashion. It's not bad; it's just that I suspect that Bill Bryson is really funny for one book and then he wears thin. Perhaps, however, the Britain book is great because he knows the foibles of his subject well, but sashaying around Europe gives him just enough time to do a few snap judgements."},{"Title":"Neither Here Nor There","review":"PROS:- Bryson's writing style is fluid and funny.- Good coverage of Western Europe: 19 out of 22 chapters are on it.CONS:- The subtitle of the book is, \\"Travels in Europe\\", but it should have been called \\"Travels in Western Europe\\" since that's where 90% of the book takes place.- Bryson has minimal interaction with Europeans, only interacting with the locals briefly, even though he traveled alone. He seems to travel with his guidebook in hand, looking at buildings, but not really spending much time getting to know the people. Part of that probably is that he doesn't speak a foreign language well.- Not terribly informative.CONCLUSION: Don't expect to learn that much about Europe, but do expect to laugh out loud. If those are your expectations, then you will love this book. I gave it 4 stars because it was so funny, so entertaining, that it overcame the flaws I listed."},{"Title":"Neither Here Nor There","review":"I definitely liked this sarcastic but warm book about solitary travels thru Europe, interlaced with fragments of a journey taken years earlier with a certain weirdo named Katz.The glimpses into European culture are just great- how movie tickets are sold here, how food is served with attitude there. Also, there is great comedy in the scenes of being an odd duck in places like Lichtenstein and MIlan, but also rewarding beauty in Capri and Paris.I wish two things: that there had been more about Katz, who is one of the most misanthropic figures I have come across in a while and that generally makes for good comedy; also, that the last three chapters hadn't felt quite so tired. I suspect that that is just a realistic impression of how the author did feel towards the end of his journey but it was anti-climactic."},{"Title":"Neither Here Nor There","review":"This book was a riot! I found myself laughing out loud and desperate to read aloud passages to anyone nearby. I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Neither Here Nor There","review":"Although I find Bill Bryson very amusing and he certainly can &quot;turn a phrase&quot; I found the content of this book unnecessarily explicit and really too much. I was listening to it on tape which may have emphasized the inappropriate language and his somewhat juvenile bent toward naming body parts and sex paraphenalia as well as bodily excretions. It was, however, interesting enough that I did listen to the whole tape but Bill, cut the gratitously offensive language."},{"Title":"Neither Here Nor There","review":"He's Bill Bryson: it's going to be hilarious. I think the people who are taking offense to the book have forgotten that the voice he writes with is genuine and very much his own. Sure, the cities he visits and their inhabitants are portrayed as caricatures, but I'm just grateful he does not hesitate to make fun of himself either. If you're looking for a more comprehensive, lyrical version of Lonely Planet, look elsewhere."},{"Title":"Neither Here Nor There","review":"Although Bryson starts this journey through Europe rather slowly, the book soon picks up the pace once he enters more countries and provides us great descriptions of people and places in that quirky way he has. It is really funny and a great book to take along and read on the trains in Europe."},{"Title":"Neither Here Nor There","review":"This is the second book by Bill Bryson that I have read, but since the first wasShakespeare: The World as Stage, this was the first time I got to experience Bryson's humor and travel writing. I was hardly disappointed. In \\"Travels in Europe\\" Bryson writes about the cross-continent trek that he took alone in 1990 and he weaves memories of a trip that he made in the 1970s with a friend across Europe. Bryson travels from Hammerfest in northern Norway to Paris, Belgium, and the Netherlands, to Germany, Denmark, and Sweden, to Italy, Switzerland, Lichtenstein, and Austria, to Yugoslavia, Bulgaria, and finally Istanbul. Bryson can be both hilarious and serious at times (for example his sobering discussion of Switzerland), although he is mostly hilarious. There is at least one sentence on each page that will make you grin, and there is about one sentence in every ten pages that will make you laugh out loud.A sampler: while at a restaurant in the German city of Aachen, Bryson attempts to order a beer,My waitress spoke no English, and I had the most extraordinary difficulty getting myself understood. I asked for a beer and she looked at me askance. \\"Wass? Tier?\\"\\"Nein, beer,\\" I said, and her puzzlement grew.\\"Fear? Steer? Queer? King Leer?\\"\\"Nein, nein, beer.\\" I pointed at the menu.\\"Ah, beer,\\" she said, with a private \\"tut,\\" as if I had been intentionally misleading her.Although it is clear that Bryson took some artistic license in creating this dialogue, this comical passage highlights the difficulty that Bryson encounters throughout his travels in only knowing one language. And at times I wished that Bryson was multilingual, as Bryson would have been able to probe the various countries and cultures that he experienced. Rather, it seems that Bryson is stuck with the normal tourist sites and relegated to eating alone in expensive restaurants; but Bryson is a great writer so his wit and prose make up for this inconvenience.Once he gets to Yugoslavia Bryson notices that he has become homesick, and I must admit that I too was getting a little worn out of his increasingly monotonous travels, and I was glad when he wrapped things up in Istanbul. But all-in-all this was a fun book to read."},{"Title":"Neither Here Nor There","review":"You must know by now that I never write a bad review about this guy. In this book, we take a whirlwind tour of Europe. You can read the cover blurbs about how funny and perceptive he is, and how skillful he is with the language, and how eminently readable he is. I agree with every word. But I'd like to mention that this isn't some snooty tour guide or gushing forth bubblehead. He's an average guy who won't hesitate to tell you what sucks, or leave a place that he doesn't like, or bend over backwards to say nice things. He'll bash anybody, himself included. He's refreshingly honest.Plus, if you had it in your head that Europe was just one homogenous place, or if perhaps you've heard a whole bunch of national or cities names and characteristics and can't keep them all straight, this book will fix that right up. In addition, if you're overseas but in a country nowhere near Europe, perhaps some place in Asia, you can still enjoy some very familiar situations. In case you haven't guessed, I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Neither Here Nor There","review":"Before embarking on a longish trip, Jill and I like to read about the places we are going to visit. Not just guidebooks--although I must admit we buy those by the pound--but travelogues, histories, and novels set in those areas. Sometimes this is easy. Italy and the Galapagos are well represented in literature. Other places are not so visited by those whose inclinations are to put pen to paper or hands to keyboard, including Ecuador and Costa Rica. At the present, I am unsure of where Austria and Switzerland will fall, but the thought has crossed my mind that a well-placed proposal might nab me a book contract.As histories go, Austria is completely overshadowed by its larger German-speaking neighbor. This is unfortunate. While it is understandable that historians be interested in Germany, Austria has plenty to answer for in the last century as well. The same goes for the Swiss, who sorely need some bright lights shone in their shady vaults and executive suites, as the recent findings about Jewish bank accounts proves.The problem in travelogues lies in the fact that no travel writer seems to go to either of these countries by themselves. Nestled in the heart of Europe, they are waystops between places--like from Germany to Italy or France to Russia--and while travelers may make it a point to stop in, say Salzburg or Zurich, for the night, the urge to stay never comes over them. According to Bill Bryson, the lack of this urge may not be wholly the blame of the visitor.Austria and Switzerland each get a chapter (out of the total 22) in Bryson's Neither Here Nor There. Similar to his first travelogue, The Lost Continent, this one has Bryson still trying to recapture earlier days, but in Europe. Although American by birth, Bryson is thoroughly British in his writing and wit. His journeys resemble those of Redmond 0'Hanlon, except more cosmopolitan acid without a companion. It is not that things go wrong necessarily, but that when they do so he describes it so hilariously.Something that Bryson does not describe is how he can afford his trip-- both in time and money. He mentions wife and children seldomly, although he has both. He does not mention regular employment, but I get the feeling that he is not independently wealthy either. It is neither here nor there, but I am intensely curious (if only to see if it is possible to emulate).I am not sure that I learned that much about my upcoming vacation here, but Europe through Bryson's eyes is almost as much fun as going yourself."},{"Title":"Neither Here Nor There","review":"When Bill Bryson was in his twenties he went on a trip to Europe. It was for him a liberating experiance despite spending his time with a friend called Katz.This book is about another trip that he goes on through Europe after he has worked in England for some years as a journalist. He starts of in Norway and travels through Europe to Istanbul.Bryson is partially a travel writer, partially a story teller. His books are largely a starting point to have a talk. That can be about his childhood, his German teacher or his belief in the arrogance of French people. This book is actually a laugh out loud type of book. I first read it some years ago, but on re-reading it recently the jokes were just as funny and one actually breaks into laughter reading it.The book is short and can be read quickly but it is worth every penny you pay for it."},{"Title":"Neither Here Nor There","review":"Bryson is very descriptive about his travel to Europe. He shares his opinions and thoughts (good and bad) with the reader about every place he explores. Also, he shares his view as an American observing completely different cultures. Bryson reminds that each place is different and unique and to simply enjoy your journey. Bryson shares with the reader his hilarious experiences in these strange yet unique places. Overall, this is a very funny book which goes into detail about different cities, towns and people in Europe."},{"Title":"Neither Here Nor There","review":"This is by far the funniest book I've read in a long time and everyone I've lent my copy too has loved it. It is even funnier if you've already read A Walk in The Wood because Bryson retells many delightfully funny misadverntures with Katz from his first trip around Europe. I would warn you, do not read this in the company of others as you will not be able to keep from laughing out loud - and I don't mean snickering, I mean full out guffaws. BUY THIS BOOK!"},{"Title":"Neither Here Nor There","review":"For anyone that has backpacked through Europe or is on their list of things to do, &quot;Neither Here Nor There&quot; is a must read! It is factual and funny. He has each country down to a tee. He is wonderfully sarcastic. His relationship with fellow backpacker, Steven Katz, is continued in his following novel, &quot;A Walk in the Woods.&quot; This book is a must read for any one that loves Europe!"},{"Title":"Neither Here Nor There","review":"I can't remember the last time I laughed out loud so many times while reading a book. It's fabulous!!! Don't be mislead though, this is not really a book for those BEFORE they go travel in Europe. Rather it is a wonderful book for those that have already been there and want to relive the experience. The perfect gift for a friend that recently returned from backpacking thru Europe!"},{"Title":"Neither Here Nor There","review":"Bill Bryson is one of the best writers in the world. He makes every experience a humorous one. I recently traveled Europe and found it to be a tremendous help. Bryson and I had almost all the same experiences and I was able to take everything in with a light heart. I love this book and believe that everyone should read it."},{"Title":"Neither Here Nor There","review":"After reading all the other readers'reviews, I realize it all has been said about this book. I will just add a few personal points. I have experienced this book from the perspective of a &quot;double foreigner&quot;: I was born in Chile, South America but have been a resident of the US for the past 19 years and now I find myself living in Europe for a 1 yrs. stint. Let me tell you, when you are in that position, you can really use laughter to help difuse the many frustrating situations that come up. This book certainly did that! It is so right on target.I'm in Belgium now and have travelled to some of the countries Mr. Bryson talks about and it seems we have shared similar experiences. Also, after reading his book, I decided to visit Brugge and he was SO right! It was the most beautiful and perfect place I have EVER seen so far in Europe. Amsterdam WAS full of washed out hippies, derelict looking people and garbage everywhere. Waiters in Europe ARE rude and on it goes. He really nails it!! I too found myself laughing out loud and waking my husband at 4:00AM. to share chapters with him. This book will lift the spirit and leave you knowing you're not alone when feeling like a foreigner in a foreign land.. but it doesn't have to be a bad thing, it could be a hilarious thing!"},{"Title":"Neither Here Nor There","review":"One of the funniest travel books I know. Bryson sets off solo, intent on recapturing the spirit of a long-ago college-era trek around Europe, covering the breadth of the &quot;continent&quot; in 21 brief chapters. His dry and droll observations on architecture, national character and local custom are so good I took to underlining them. Even if you aren't a travel book reader, try this, it is so damn funny, anyone should enjoy it."},{"Title":"Neither Here Nor There","review":"Bryson's sense of humor is delightful but I wish he'd gone back to Europe more recently...especially Eastern Europe. I'm Bulgarian so the several pages about Bulgaria were a pleasant surprise, although it was pretty obvious that Bryson didn't really try to understand much of the culture...oh well, the rest is still worth reading."},{"Title":"Neither Here Nor There","review":"Bill Bryson does make fun of the cultures he encounters in this book. Yep, on just about every page. But guess what? He also makes fun of his own native culture, America (for an entire book of Bryson poking fun at the oddities of American culture, see \\"I'm A Stranger Here Myself\\") and of the UK, the country that he adopted as his own for 20 years. No, Bill Bryson is not a xenophobe: he makes fun of everyone equally, and he does it in a way which makes it obvious that he is in loving awe of the differences that can occur amongst members of the same species depending on where/how/by whom they were raised.This book has two personalities to it- the involved tourist and the observational tourist. Bryson spends some time recalling the previous trek he took across Europe in the 1970's with his friend (of \\"A Walk in the Woods\\" notoriety) when he was much more involved in what was going on around him. He communicated with the people and the culture of the places he visited. During his return visit, 20 years later as a lone middle-aged tourist, he was less involved and chose to merely peer through the glass at the places he visited; this part of the story involves a lot of \\"I went from here to here, I couldn't find a hotel, the last bus had left, no one spoke English,\\" etc etc. While this aspect of the book might not be as fun to read as Bryson's misadventures from other books, it is endearing because it is real. This is not a book that gushingly romanticizes travel, rather it is one witty, sarcastic man's take on the people and cultures that he encountered, both in the 1990's as a middle aged American expat, and in the 1970's as a curious 20-something backpacker. My favorite Bryson book."},{"Title":"Neither Here Nor There","review":"I just returned from a Eurail trip, through Europe of all places, last week. I had never heard of Bill Bryson before I left, but I met this girl laughing out loud in a London Youth Hostel. She was reading Brysons book about travelling through the States and highly recommended it to me. Unfortunately I was on my way out of London that day and never got to a bookstore, but the name stuck in my mind. Four countries later (having looked in Spanish and Portugese bookstores) I was desperately in need of something more to read than my Let's Go and Thomas Cook (which I was near having completely memorized). Lucky for me I was in Gibraltar where I found a nice little english bookstore. Fortunately they didn't have &quot;Travels...&quot;, but had this other book &quot;Neither Here, Nor There.&quot; Since it was about Europe it only made sense to buy this book and have a go at it. Having just previously been or been close to all of the places he highlights, I absolutely busted a gut every time I read a chapter or two. I was throughly enjoying this book and looking forward to fininshing it in tandem with finishing my own trip, when something ironic occured in Italy. I had just been reading the chapter (laughing of course!) where Bryson gets pickpocketed in the Italian quarter of Switzerland; that night I was on a train to Rome when my backpack was nicked from underneath me. Despite losing really really important stuff, I also lost &quot;Neither Here, Nor There.&quot; I couldn't help but think of Brysons similar situation which I had just read, thinking of this made my situation all the more funny, despite not being able to finish my trip. The main point here, although this is not your regular review format, is that Bryson is an extremely witty writer and right on in his assesment/observations of Europe and its people. Newsweek would say &quot;Brillianly Funny!&quot; I just say if you've been to Europe, or know anything about it, read this book. It doesn't matter if you've been to all the places or not, you'll still be crying by the end each chapter! One word of caution; if you take this book along and read it on your trip, he may rub off on you as you write in your own journal. You'll begin to see places through a slighlty distorted, although humorous, lens. I even started to write a bit like him. In any case enjoy, and happy travels! Oh yes, I would probably give this book a five star rating, but I still haven't read the last few chapters; so all I can say were that 4/5 of this book were excellent!"},{"Title":"Neither Here Nor There","review":"I loved this book. I have read it several times over the years especially on planes and I laugh so hard each time. The comments about it being racist and Mean spirited are unfounded . Its funny and hilarious. I am European living in the United States and I have travelled around Europe and found similar situations. Enjoy the book for what it is . I plan on reading it again real soon."},{"Title":"Neither Here Nor There","review":"I began to read NEITHER HERE NOR THERE, as a prelude to reading Bryson's latest WALK IN THE WOODS. After all, we had not been properly introduced.Where has he been, all my life? Bill Bryson took me on a whirlwind tour of Europe, &amp; I never wanted to come home or quit laughing. The man has a knack, of seeing the humour in just about everything. If I had been to the places he described, I laughed harder - &amp; if I had not, well I want to go there &amp; laugh again.He does have a serious &amp; thoughtful side to him as well - his descriptions of the Northern Lights were graphic, &amp; he has shown himself to be a real 'people person' - he captures in words every tic &amp; quirk meticulously.It has been such a long time since a book had me roaring out loud. Bryson's descriptions of some of the 'seamier' shops in Hamburg brought tears to my eyes, along with his very apt descriptions of the streets of Amsterdam: I could see it, I could hear it, &amp; yes, I could almost smell it!The best part, is seeing how many European readers have reviewed his books so favourably - thank goodness they can laugh at themselves. Now I must read more - to find out why an equal amount of Americans cannot laugh at themselves, in his book about America? Is Bryson less funny - or - ?I cannot wait to read everything this man has written. I firmly believe laughter is the best medicine, &amp; I think I want to have some stock on hand, just in case I laugh myself sick."},{"Title":"Neither Here Nor There","review":"Bill Bryson has a talent for turning his travel adventures into a humorous celebration of the obscure, the bizarre and the frustrating. He has a keen and often sarcastic eye for what will entertain the seasoned armchair traveler, and books like \`Down Under' and \`Notes from a Small Island' are filled with hilarious anecdotes and interesting insights into the areas he is exploring. Unfortunately \`Neither Here nor There' is not as engaging or amusing as many of Bryson's other efforts, and seems like a rather hotch-potch attempt to fill a book with as many destinations as possible.With around 25 destinations visited in \`Neither Here nor There', Bryson does not have the time or room to exercise his trademark ability to unearth unusual facts and figures. He seems to rush around Europe and not greatly enjoy his travels, although a large beer and a big meal often appears to soothe his frazzled spirits. One thing that surprised me was that Bryson proudly refuses to learn even the most basic foreign phrases, which seems a little rude and ignorant. I started to suspect that this is partly because he relies upon language-barrier humor a little too much. He also does not meet with locals a great deal in this book, denying us the Bryson knack for meeting people who are either a little odd, or filled with fascinating information.Although I did still enjoy parts of \`Neither Here nor There' immensely, I found myself occasionally wanting to skip a chapter or two, which saddened me as I am a great admirer of many of Bryson's other books. I ended the book feeling I didn't know a great deal more about the cities he visited, and that the book was more an attempt to gather enough material for publication rather than a great travel story that needed to be shared."},{"Title":"Neither Here Nor There","review":"This book was a good read. I felt as if I shared in Bryson's romp around Europe retracing his teenage interrail trip of the early 70's. I alsofelt that he had many incisive comments and insights. I laughed out loud on the subway at the many scenes that were so hilariously described.Bryson has succeeded in taking the bar-room story into book form where he is the teller. Unfortunately, the book does suffer from its on superficiality. By the turn of the last few pages, were Bryson says: &quot;I sat trapped.. listening to my idly prattling mind and wished that I could just get up and walk out on myself&quot;? One realizes that throughout the book, Bryson has never genuinely interacted with the people on his trip. He sees the characters he meets as pawns for his cultural comments and one-liners. He travels with the air of superiority that is a legacy of the Baedecker days where &quot;foreigners&quot; (i.e. the locals) are reduced to servents and characters in a play. The country and culture becomes a stage, all performed for the sojourner's benefit where the entrance fee is reserved seat on a train purchased by AmEx. I enjoyed the book, but Bryson's open embrace for this form of whirlwind-travel leaves it a bit empty in the end."},{"Title":"Neither Here Nor There","review":"I was quite curious to see what Bryson would make of Milan, the city where I live. I'd already read quite a few of his other books so I was looking forward to an interesting, intelligent read. Instead, I was amazed: the man was unable to find a coffee shop in the centre of town.This makes me have my doubts about Bryson as a travel writer. If he couldn't find a coffee shop in a town that has at least two on every block, who knows how many other things he is wrong about? Can I trust his observations on other countries?On the positive side, the book is amusing, the anecdotes about his youth are funny and his observations are interesting even if after a while they become somewhat trite and predictable. They usually run along the lines of &quot;Why would anyone in their right mind tear down this &lt;insert word here&gt; to put up a modern &lt;insert word here&gt;&quot;). This is a book that's certainly worth reading, even if it's not worth taking seriously."},{"Title":"Neither Here Nor There","review":"This was a pleasant breeze of a book on European travel which I read in less than 2 days, actually while travelling back from London. I found some of Mr. Brysons observations on European societies to be insightful and on the money. I especially enjoyed his take on Italian drivers and the Scandanavian penchant for public drunkenness, however his classification of Germans as &quot;fat and arrogant&quot; is probably untrue. Surely Americans are fatter and the French more arrogant, but lets not split hairs.The greatest weakness of Bryson's writing seems to be his overuse of hyperbole in trying to get a laugh. Sometimes he connects, and I did laugh out loud many times in my reading, but most of the time it seems he is trying too hard to be funny.Bryson, being a travel writer, does not seem particularly adventurous or much of a risk taker. He generally sticks to well travelled, touristy places in very safe European cities. He seems to confine himself to museums, churches, city centers and the hotel bar and nothing else. Worst of all, he does not really interact much with the locals which he is making such broad observations about. Aside from ordering food and drink and checking in and out of hotels, Bryson overall seems a timid introvert writing smart alecky comments about people he is not truly trying to understand."},{"Title":"Neither Here Nor There","review":"I bought this book for an aquaintance, a young guy with a good sense of humor and dreams of backpacking across europe, and couldn't resist reading it before passing it on. It really is hysterical, moving at a less tedious pace than some of his other travelogues. Bryson's ability to ridicule others (and himself!) and have it come off as endearing not an insult is remarkable, and the humor isn't forced, suprisingly poignant observations blend right in. The gift was quite a hit!"},{"Title":"Neither Here Nor There","review":"In this book, Bill Bryson embarks on the grown-up version of backpacking across Europe. Having wandered Europe twenty years previously with a friend named Katz, he revisited some places and observes how they have changed.Bryson has the idea of starting at Hammerfest, in far northern Norway, and then working his way south to Rome. Because he wants to see the northern lights, his journeys begin in winter, when the Arctic is still dark and, of course, cold. The northern lights don't appear to him for a couple of weeks, so the book begins at a leisurely pace, with Bryson hanging out in a dark, cold city where there really isn't much for a tourist to do.Moving south from Hammerfest gives Bryson many cold, rainy days in Copenhagen and Stockholm before he can't take it any more and goes to Italy. From there he hops from one city to another, ending in Sofia, Bulgaria. His slower pace in the first part of the book gave him many opportunities to talk about the people in each place; in Italy, his observations tend to focus on the physical plant instead. When he gets to Yugoslavia and Bulgaria, however, his observations tun personal again.Oddly enough, Bryson's most pithy observations are about the people but he doesn't spend much time meeting them. He comes across as a loner who is happiest wandering the streets of an unfamiliar city, visiting the museums, and then having a large number of beers at the end of the day. That strategy means that he risks making unfamiliar generalizations about the people around him, so it's remarkable that his observations don't necessarily jibe with the stereotypes. However, he doesn't pass up a stereotype if he can make a good joke.Bryson is at his best when on the road less-traveled, from Hammerfest to Sofia, and he doesn't have much to say about the Romes of the world. He's a gifted writer, and it's a pleasure to accompany him."},{"Title":"Neither Here Nor There","review":"Bill Bryson is a gifted writer, able to weave laugh-out-loud humor with poignant rhapsodizing while tossing off tirades against changes that have conspired together to ruin America or the world in general. \\"Neither Here Nor There: Travels in Europe\\" manages to include all three as Bryson retraces steps he took as a college student in the 1970s and backpacks across Europe twenty years later in an effort to relive those days and to see what has changed, or sometimes, what hasn't. It is a riotous mix of laughter and good times but more often than not a candid look at the problems facing Europe (in the early 1990s) and the problems of the tourism industry.Byrson begins his travels in Hammerfest, the northernmost point in Norway during the frozen winter months, so that he can observe the Northern Lights. From there, Bryson moves in a zigzag south and north, ranging from Paris to Belgium to Germany to Sweden to Italy to Eastern Europe to end in Istanbul. At each place Bryson comments upon the beauty (or lack of) in the local landscape and architecture, spends his time wandering town centers and interesting museums, in search of good food, good beer, and good times. Overall he is successful, his twenty years from the first journey to this one making him a wiser man who has learned a thing or two about the world and isn't easily swept away by sights he saw the first time around. Mixed in with Bryson's current observations are reminiscences about his first trip with his friend Stephen Katz and memories of his life growing up in Iowa. Bryson offers many laugh-out-loud moments, like his wonderings about sex dolls in Hamburg to his belief that cows are the perfect pets. But he also offers up some sad but true observations about how we live: \\"We used to build civilizations. Now we build shopping malls\\" (page 105). We build without beauty and with no need to last.\\"Neither Here Nor There\\" is a delightful journey with a witty and observant tour guide. At times, Bryson's wanderings seem redundant - at each new place there is a hotel room to be acquired, museums to visit, digressions to make - but being that he takes readers to places they may never have been before, it is a welcome diversion. Just as with \\"The Lost Continent,\\" Bryson's book about traveling small town America with the hope of finding the perfect small town, Bryson tries to find that idealized European village that existed in his childhood imagination from movies he watched. He finds it in the most unlikely of towns in the least visited country, a village seemingly untouched by Western influence. But that was over twenty years ago. It's time Bryson took the trip again."},{"Title":"Neither Here Nor There","review":"I read this on a recent trip to Europe and could relate to many of the places Bryson describes. It is absolutely hilarious in places and laugh out loud stuff."},{"Title":"Neither Here Nor There","review":"Amusing, witty, informative, reflective; it's just a typical Bill Bryson book. The guy writes such great stories you can't help but enjoy them!"},{"Title":"Neither Here Nor There","review":"Bill Bryson's humor is, as always, top-flight. One reviewer mentioned a series of jokes that he found \\"tiring\\" ... personally I found the caricatures very funny. Of course Bryson's comments are generalizations, many of them over-generalizations for humor's sake, many of them are grossly inaccurate I am sure. But the reality is that we *all* generalize, and while I understand the European point of view, I would ask the critics of this book who cry xenophobia to think about all of the over-generalizations Europeans have of America and Americans. But hey, we're all entitled to our own opinion, and humor perhaps more than anything is something that is lost in translation. I don't think the European audience is the one Bryson is targeting anyway, and I'm sure there exist many books in Europe that lampoon America to a degree that most Americans would similarly take offense at. C'est la vie.While the humor itself rates 5 stars, the \\"travel\\" part is 3~4 stars at best. I do agree with the critics that note Bryson's somewhat formulaic style becomes a little weary after a while, and aside from the funny stories and interludes, Bryson's travels are actually on the dull side. In many ways, it felt like a sequel that was a watered down version of the original--I wondered if Bryson wouldn't have been better off writing about just his *original* youthful travels around Europe with Katz instead of this version we had--Europe: Part Deux. Bryson himself seemed to lose interest in his own travels around Italy, and often it felt like he was more interested to leave the last town than to enter the next one. By Istanbul, Bryson was clearly just going through the motions. Bryson's general lack of attachment to these places keeps the reader at arm's length as well.In the end, I think the reader's opinion of this book will depend on how the humor is received. If you don't find it funny, this book will be a miserable read. For me, and I believe most people, the humor is hilarious enough and the flashbacks are interesting enough to carry the reader's interest from beginning to end. Still, I agree with those who say it does not match the level of Bryson's other works. The style remains but this book is missing a bit of the soul that makes Bryson's works such interesting and entertaining reads."},{"Title":"Neither Here Nor There","review":"We're planning a trip to Europe and this book gives a lot of information you don't get from a travel guide, and it's all done with a lot of humour.

IstanbulIndex============================================It's only fair that I should start this rambling in the same way as I started the book: from the last but one chapter.For me, purely personally, by far the most interesting part of the book was chapter 21, because it is dedicated to the town in which I was born and raised. The chapter's a real riot to read, at few points the laughter becomes almost dangerously intense. As far as I can say, for I was about ten years old at the time, Mr Bryson has captured the atmosphere of the devastating crisis from the early 1990s very convincingly. His description of the town in the early 1970s, during the height of the Communist rule, is stupendously funny but, from all I've heard from my parents, very accurate and even perceptive as well:\\"I remembered Sofia being a city of broad boulevards so empty of traffic that people walked down the middle of them, stepping aside only to make room for the occasional Zill limousine carrying party functionaries to some dark, Orwellian ministry. I have never been in a more timeless city. It could have been any time in the last forty of fifty years. There were simply no clues to suggest what decade it was; the shape of the few cars in the road, the clothes people wore, the looks of the shops and buildings were all curiously uniformed in fashion.\\"\\"Sofia had an enormous department store called TSUM, [...] spread over five floors and containing not a single product that it looked as if it had been produced more recently than 1938.\\"Though I am pleased with Mr Bryson's claim that Sofia without any doubt has the most beautiful women in Europe, I have to say that I have never been able to notice that myself.Of course many things in Sofia have changed out of recognition since the early 1990s. For better or for worse is a debatable question, but I guess Mr Bryson would not even recognise the city today. That's why the final paragraph of his Chapter 21 is unusually perceptive:\\"My guess is that communism in Bulgaria won't last. It can't last. No people will retain a government that can't feed them or let them provide toys for their children. I'm certain that if I come back to Sofia in five years it will be full of Pizza Huts and Laura Ashleys, and the streets will be clogged with BMWs, and all the people will be much happier. I can't blame them a bit, but I'm glad I saw it before it changed.\\"I don't know whether my admiration for Mr Bryson's \\"Sofia chapter\\" is not due more to sentimental reasons than to any literary value or author's perspicacity, but one thing is sure: Sofia is a dead dull city in which there is hardly anything worth seeing. It's a vastly different matter to visit some of the greatest European capitals like Paris, Rome and Vienna. And here the real value of Mr Bryson's book surfaces all too obviously.After reading A Short History of Nearly Everything, I have learnt not to expect much from Bill Bryson. And he delivers the same, if not worse, pulp non-fiction here: sometimes dull but often hilarious, with very occasional flash of insight but with a good many comments so pedestrian that one wonders how he had the audacity to publish them. Of course he is wonderfully readable and he often makes me laugh my head off - which are considerable virtues by far not every writer is endowed with - but what else is there to justify the existence of that book? Very little as it turned out.The story is simple and effective enough, and it pretends to be all true. In 1972, the very young, enthusiastic and charming Bill Bryson wandered through Europe. Some two decades later the middle-aged, whining and exasperating Bill Bryson repeated the stunt and, inexplicably, decided to write a book about it. From time to time some travel companion of his appears too, and he is one of those enchanting personalities who feel compelled to use the word [Amazon censorship!] every second sentence. Bryson himself almost never stops complaining: about people, about hotels, about buses, about restaurants, about bars, about... you get the picture, don't you? His arrogance is of cosmic proportions and so is his vanity; he is cocksure about everything and seldom - if ever - does it occur to him that there might be other point of view but his own. Bill Bryson is the chap who knows, everything about anything everywhere in Europe, most often in a compulsively derisive tone. Rarely does he allow himself to show some appreciation, let alone affection, for the cities he visited or the people he met. But his pages are packed with trivia, most of it badly dated, and sweeping generalisations which are obviously based on a very limited experience and can be called ''perceptive'' only by abusing the word. Instead, Mr Bryson's devastating sarcasm pervades pretty much every paragraph. It is generally very amusing, if caustic, but it sometimes is crude, overdone, heavy going and just short of obscene as well.So why on earth did Bill Bryson write that book at all? It is no travel guide, to be sure, for there is not enough specific information, but since such books age quickly, this is all for the better. Nor is Mr Bryson concerned with more than a very perfunctory glance at the European history, philosophy or art. To do him justice, I would suppose that he wrote that book with no other aim but to provide a solid dose of fun - otherwise the volume would hardly worth the paper it's printed on.There is a lot of fun here all right. But there's a lot of arrogance, inanity, ignorance and even bigotry, too.Let's start with the fun, shall we? It is not an especially intelligent amusement and a great deal of it might well be fictional, but it makes one laugh, or at least such episodes certainly make me laugh:\\"...a waitress named Shirley who was the most unpleasant person I have ever met. Whatever you ordered, she would look as if you just asked to borrow her car to take her daughter to Tijuana for filthy weekend.\\"\\"In the evening I went looking for a restaurant. This is often a problem in Germany. For one thing, there's a good chance that there will be three guys in lederhosen playing polka music, so you have to look carefully through the windows and question the proprietor closely to make sure that Willi and the Bavarian Boys won't bound onto a little stage at half past eight, because there is nothing worse than being just about to tuck into your dinner, a good book propped in front of you, only to find yourself surrounded by ruddy-faced Germans waving beer steins and singing the ''Horst Wessel Lied'' for all they're worth. It should have been written in the armistice treaty that the Germans would be required to lay down their accordions along with their arms.\\"\\"The best thing that could be said about travelling abroad with Katz was that it spared the rest of America from having to spend the summer with him.\\"\\"...I spied a coin under the seat in front of me, and with protracted difficulty leaned forward and snagged it. When I sat up, I saw my seatmate was at last looking at me with that ominous glow.''Have you found Jesus?'' he suddenly asked.''Uh, no, it's a quarter,'' I answered and quickly settled down and pretended for the next six hours to be asleep, ignoring his whispered entreaties to let Christ build a bunkhouse in my heart.\\"That said, and quoted, a great deal of the book is actually too dull to be funny. Mr Bryson's endless curiosity about the commonplace and the mundane is to my mind devastatingly wearisome. I do not wish to put on any airs and sound like some lousy intellectual snob, for I am neither intellectual nor a snob, but I am often astonished at the impossible crap that Mr Bryson thought worthy of writing, not to mention publishing. Last but not least, Mr Bryson is also prone to awkward and rather self-indulgent digressions: in the middle of Belgium he thinks it necessary to reflect why cows are the perfect pets as far as he is concerned, and while walking through the streets of Cologne he feels compelled to lecture us about the invasion of Japanese electronics into the Western world. Thank you, Bill, your enthusiasm to inflict your opinions of cows and electronics is much appreciated, but I'd rather do without either.Now let's have a look at the saddest part of all. We may start with Vienna. Sometimes Mr Bryson does tend to be appallingly crass, and the case of Vienna's Kunsthistorisches Museum is a perfect example. After giving his stupefyingly superficial description - \\"fabulous - vast, grand, full of great paintings\\" - Mr Bryson explores in detail the \\"commendable\\" system with information cards for visitors in every hall, complains that the museum is much too big and finally gives some of the greatest junk I have ever read about anything:\\"...I was suffering from museum fatigue. In these circumstances, especially when I have paid a fortune to get in and feel that there are still a couple of hours standing between me and my money's worth, I find myself involuntarily supplying captions to the pictures: ''Salome, on being presented the head of John the Baptist on a salver saying: \\"No, I ordered a double cheeseburger,\\" or an exasperated Saint Sebastian whining, \\"I'm warning you guys, the next person who shoots an arrow is going to be reported.\\"Well, Bill, this is the perfect thing to say when, after twelve hard hours of strenuous tourism, you're sitting in a cozy bar sipping your fourth cocktail late in the evening. But it is definitely not something that deserves to be printed.When he is in Paris, Mr Bryson is so desperate that the Louvre is crowded that he tells us amazing stories about how terrible the traffic in the French capital is and then goes on into considerable, and intolerable, detail how his travel companion had twice become a victim of bird [Amazon censorship!]. And do you know what was the only picture in the Louvre that Bill Bryson remembered from his last visit and very much wanted to see again? One that showed two ladies, one of whom had casually put a finger into the other's \\"fundament\\"!Give me a break, Bill, will you!Now, I am all for flippancy on every page and tongue-in-cheek narrative all the time, but inanity and vulgarity I cannot possibly tolerate, especially from a man who spends several days in each of Europe's grandest capitals and is supposed to be fairly intelligent. Nobody expects Mr Bryson to be a witty kind of Baedecker, much less a walking history of art, but some sensitivity to and seriousness about matters other than sleeping, eating, drinking and [Amazon censorship!] would be much appreciated. Moreover, in addition to being a sex maniac and a philistine, Bill Bryson is an awful prig as well:\\"I don't think I can altogether forgive the Germans their past, not as long as I can wonder if that friendly old waiter who brings me my coffee might once have spent his youth bayoneting babies or herding Jews into gas ovens. Some things are so monstrous as to be unpardonable. But I don't see how anyone could go to Germany now and believe for a moment that that could ever happen again. The Germans are becoming the new Americans - rich, ambitious, hardworking, health-conscious, sure of their place in the world.\\"The last two sentences are typical for most of Mr Bryson's positive comments: ambiguous and condescending, reeked of insincerity, added as if only to preserve some sense of decorum. One wonders if Mr Bryson could ever forgive the Spaniards the Inquisition, Rome the Crusades, the French people the French Revolution or his fellow Americans the Indian wars.Not only is Mr Bryson a prig, but he is also a prude, as shown on the main train station in Cologne:\\"And then I saw something that gave me an instant urge to get out of there. It was a non stop porno movie house, and quite gross one at that, to judge from the candid glossy pictures on display by the ticket booth. The movie house was in the station, one of the services permitted to travelers by the thoughtful management of Deutsche Bundesbahn, the national railway company. I don't know precisely why, but I found this hugely repellent. I have no special objection to pornography, but in a train station? There was just something so seedy about the idea of a businessman stopping off at the end of the day to watch twenty minutes of bonking before catching the 5:40 to his home and family in Bensberg, and there was something seedier still in the thought of a national railway endorsing it.\\"This from a man who fantasises about stewardess and couchettes during a long bus travel, falls in love (read \\"lust\\") with innocent receptionists, is convinced that some dogs want to have sex with him and walks through the Red Lights district of Amsterdam giving us detailed descriptions of sex shop windows and covers of pornographic magazines. Had Mr Bryson had a little common sense more, he might have reflected that the \\"repellent\\" practice of Deutsche Bahn actually shows a very keen understanding of human nature. Needless to say, it never even occurs to Mr Bryson that the \\"seedy\\" story with the businessman might well be a product of his own sick imagination. I have to say that I am sorry for having missed that porn cinema last time when I was passing through Cologne. It might have been removed since those loose times when Mr Bryson wandered through Europe.It is true that sometimes Mr Bryson manages to convey a very genuine imitation of enthusiasm, which is almost touching actually, but that happens all too rarely in the maelstrom of inspired nonsense. One such exception from the usual crappy stuff is the awe Mr Bryson obviously felt as he entered St Peter in Rome:\\"St. Peter doesn't look all that fabulous from the outside, at least not from the piazza on its foot, but step inside and it is so sensational that your mouth falls open. St. Peter is a marvel, so vast and beautiful and cool and filled with treasures and airy heights and pale beams of heavenly light that you don't know where to place your gaze. It is the only building I have ever entered where I have actually felt like sinking to my knees, clasping my hands heavenward, and crying: ''Take me home, Lord.'' No structure on earth would ever look the same to me again.\\"I wish there had been more passages like this one. But there aren't. What is more, they are used as lame excuses for Mr Bryson's indolence, or lack of interest perhaps, or I don't know what. Certainly his dismissal of the Sistine Chapel and the museums of Vatican is downright mind-boggling:\\"...then went to the Sistine Chapel and the museums, and they were naturally impressive, but I confess that all the other visual experiences were largely wasted on me after the spacious grandeur of St. Peter's.\\"\\"Impressive\\"? Is that all your brain can produce, Bill? Obviously. All that Mr Bryson has to say about the famous \\"Pieta\\" of Michelangelo, surely one of the greatest masterpieces in the history of European art, is that he ''had a look'' at it and it was behind a barrier and a glass screen which kept visitors too far away. I rest my case.In short, highly enjoyable but perfectly forgettable read. One laughs a great deal while reading it, but after the last page there is a feeling of curious intellectual blankness. I cannot honestly give one star to a book which is so readable and makes me laugh so much, especially one that has obviously been designed for nothing more. But I cannot honestly give it more than two stars either, for great part of it is occupied by the egotism, vulgarity and stupidity of the author. The man has the inestimable gift of great readability, moronic stuff and all. He is not entirely devoid of brains or a sense of humour either. Sadly, the former is all too seldom used, and the latter is severely marred by his triviality and his vulgarity. All that reduces his book to a guilty pleasure, fleeting and useless. I surmise one is unwise to expect more from Bill Bryson."},{"Title":"Neither Here Nor There","review":"Travelogues of Europe have been around since the Roman Empire, so if you want your book to attract even the smallest iota of attention, you've got to be either a fantastic writer, or have a startlingly original tale to tell. Bill Bryson knows how to write, and more importantly, how to write a travel journal utterly different from any you've read before.Mr Bryson's secret is his discovery that, as any journalist will tell you, people aren't all that interested in travel or foreign parts; people are interested in people. And in Neither Here Nor There, the person Mr Bryson gives us is himself, a former newspaper journalist and editor with a taste for neoclassical architecture and draft beer, and a sense of humor that is caustic, expletive-laden, scatological, even prurient at times, but never less than screamingly, hyperventilatingly funny.It certainly isn't the most complete guide to Europe out there. By his own admission, Mr Bryson's itinerary is impulsive and random rather than methodical. He bypasses Europe's second-largest and most bull-trampled nation, Spain, as well as virtually all of Central and Eastern Europe, though in fairness these countries still lay behind an Iron Curtain that was only just beginning to lift. His 1990 journey starts off in Hammerfest, Norway, to see the northern lights, then skips down to France, and meanders to Turkey via Germany, Sweden, Italy, Yugoslavia and Bulgaria, among others.This route breaks little new ground, though Mr Bryson assuredly deserves kudos for visiting the top of Norway in the depths of winter. He travels mostly by rail, but sets himself no gimmicky limitations, and isn't above jetting off somewhere if the weather proves unappealing. Others may try hiking the continent or roaming it on a unicycle, but Mr Bryson gets around fueled by beer and irritation.Nor is the book especially informative regarding the things to see and do. Mr Bryson visits the requisite churches and museums, but rarely in elaborate detail, talks to the locals no more than necessary, and seems far more content to simply amble about the neighborhoods and parks and take in the atmosphere. The funniest parts of the book are Mr Bryson's frequent reminiscences of his childhood in Iowa, and of his two previous trips to Europe in 1972 and 1973. Otherwise, the energy of the book comes from Mr Bryson's catalog of complaints, discomforts and misadventures.This is precisely what makes Neither Here Nor There such a great travel book. Mr Bryson completely strips away the romance of travel, and save Angelina Jolie, none of us look our best naked--especially not if we're still wearing our socks. In his almost masochistically honest account, you feel that Mr Bryson strikes closer to the actual experience of travel rather than the ideal; the frustrations and fatigue, the queues and queue-jumpers, rude waiters and cabbies, small hotel rooms and large restaurant bills. Readers looking for more genteel fare should try Paul Theroux or maybe the adaptations of Michael Palin's BBC voyages (I love the man, but his idea of interview technique is to say \\"Fantastic, great\\" to everything).To be fair, Mr Bryson speaks almost rapturously of some places he visits, such as Copenhagen, Capri and Hamburg. But Mr Bryson the writer is at his best when Mr Bryson the traveler is at his worst. In lesser hands this would come across as mere whingeing, but it's never less than achingly funny to watch Mr Bryson wallow in his own misery.By now the book is dated, of course, but in a way, this only adds to the enjoyment. Neither Here Nor There forms a neat snapshot of Europe at the end of both the millennium and the cold war. Mr Bryson talks of prices in francs and marks and lire, where now there is only the euro. It is sobering to read of Mr Bryson's stay in Sarajevo, knowing that two years later the city, along with the rest of Yugoslavia, would plunge into a horrific civil war that gave us the term \\"ethnic cleansing\\". His time in Sofia, Bulgaria, gives a hint as to why the Communist system collapsed.His decision to end his \\"European\\" voyage in Istanbul raises an issue that is contentious once again. In 2006, Turkey's talks to join the European Union were once again frozen. Where does Europe begin, where does it end? What sets it apart as a distinct region? It's instructive to note how easily Mr Bryson moves about the continent despite knowing, at best, just one language. Neither Here Nor There suggests what binds Europeans together is their ability to embrace travelers to their nations and tenderly, gently, lift the traveler's cheques out of their jacket pockets."},{"Title":"Neither Here Nor There","review":"When Bryson was young, he toured Europe. A generation later, he went back for another look, and this is what he saw.Enough has been written about this book that my goal here is to help the prospective reader sort it out. Yes, it's true, Bryson's got a sharp tongue and an Americocentric streak two feet wide. He does come off as petulant when what he wants doesn't just sort of appear before him. A lot of his dissatisfactions can surely be attributed to his own spasmodic trip management and monolingualism. At the same time, he ranges from funny to hilarious. He spots a lot of interesting things about other countries. There were a lot of places he really liked, and he said so. And it must be admitted that he made it to some out-of-the-way places: Hammerfest, Capri, Locarno, Sofia. I have to respect the effort that required.So who'll like the book? It depends on your approach. If Bryson dogged your country/city/favourite landmark, and you're inclined to get annoyed at such things--or if American tourists are your (understandable) pet peeve, probably you won't much care for him. If you enjoy funny travel writing from someone not afraid to show his complete ignorance and make a merry fool of himself in public, Bryson is for you. While Bryson pokes a lot of fun at grumpy ticket counter people and waiters, he is his own single largest target. I'll raise a beer stein to that."},{"Title":"Neither Here Nor There","review":"Bill Bryson is a genius. This book is absolutely hilarious.

Bill Bryson is undoubtedly a very witty writer and somewhat open to adventures (although it would be nice if he could tackle at least one foreign language in all of these years of \\"Weltenbummeln\\"). Unfortunately, he often comes across as the very sort of narrow-minded American tourist that he himself criticizes with gusto. He goes for the usual cheap shots of calling all Parisians snotty, as well as bringing up Nazi war crimes when confronting Germans. The worst part for me was when he was fed up with the French (who deigned not to speak his native tongue) and wanted to \\"remind them that we liberated them\\". (When will this whinging war cry ever end?! When are the other Allies EVER going to get any credit?) This is precisely the sort of smug behaviour that makes Americans universally detested abroad. Sure, he often changes his mind and mellows out after a few beers and a good meal, but those comments sting, and I'm not even European (I just live here).I suspect that this book would have had a less isolated and more entertaining tone if Mr. Bryson had taken the beloved Katz along for the ride. Now that would make a great book!"},{"Title":"Neither Here Nor There","review":"About 100 pages into this book, I was on my way to ordering all of Bryson's books. A few pages later, my pace of reading started to slow down. And then suddenly I couldn't get any further, however hard I tried...Maybe it was partly because his journey started in my home country of Norway, but I found myself laughing out loud constantly during the first part of the book. I also enjoyed the start of his European travels, but as he left Rome, I just didn't care anymore. The jokes seemed to dry up, and perhaps he lost interest himself? Anyway, I've tried to pick the book back up several times, but I'm just not into it any longer.

It depressed me to picture him traveling through Europe, being that negative. Skip this book, and read an intelligent and interesting travel book, like something by David Hatcher Childress."},{"Title":"Neither Here Nor There","review":"Bryson's best book is &quot;Notes From a Small Island,&quot; about traveling in Great Britain. It's one of the funniest books I've read. The British are funny, and Bryson knows them well after living in Britain for 20+ years.His book about Australia, &quot;In a Sunburned Country,&quot; is also entertaining. He studied Australian history, met many interesting locals, etc. After reading it, I feel like an expert on Australia and its people.His book about Europe, &quot;Neither Here Nor There,&quot; isn't so good. The problem is that he speaks no languages other than English. He didn't talk to anyone on this trip. Wwithout any characters (other than Bryson) the book isn't engaging. The book has only one joke, which he repeats: &quot;The waiter/hotel clerk/taxi driver didn't speak English so I tried to make him understand that I needed...&quot; Some of these moments are quite funny, but they don't constitute a book. Bryson didn't study the places he visits. Unlike the Australian book, you learn almost nothing about the countries he visited.Bryson's book about America, &quot;I'm a Stranger Here Myself,&quot; failed to make me laugh. It reads like a series of Erma Bombeck columns. Bryson comments about various aspects of his life in a small town in New England. Not other people's lives, which might have been interesting, but only about his domestic life.I got only a few chapters into his book about the Appalachian Trail, &quot;A Walk in the Woods.&quot; I wasn't amused that two people with no backpacking experience would attempt a six-month hike. After several chapters of Bryson repeating one joke -- &quot;I know nothing about any of this!&quot; -- I stopped reading.This suggests that the old advice &quot;write about what you know&quot; is worth following. It also made me realize that traveling is only enjoyable if you do two things: meet interesting people, preferably by speaking their language; and studying the area you're visiting.Review by Thomas David Kehoe, author of &quot;Hearts and Minds: How Our Brains Are Hardwired for Relationships&quot;"},{"Title":"Neither Here Nor There","review":"This audio book of Bill Bryson's is not bad, but the abridgement really hurt it.

I remember taking up collections in the theatre during WWII for the \\"Greek Children\\". We all participated but now I learn the politics of the transporting Greek Children. Some were luck and get to the Red Cross but others forever separated in Communist countries. This story is simply about a mothers love. Well told by a participant. The movie is very good, too."},{"Title":"Eleni","review":"fascinating piece of investigative reporting by the son of eleni who was killed by the communist guerilla insurgents during the civil war. more than a war story, a story that illuminates all wars and especially civil insurgencies. also a gripping read from start to finish."},{"Title":"Eleni","review":"I started this book thinking that probably it would be a bit over dramatic and sentimental since it was written by the son. Nothing could be further from the truth. It is dramatic, but in a way that places you right in that village, fighting alongside the village people, outraged and helpless. It is sentimental. Gage paints vivid characters you feel as if you've met. An amazing and heart-rending story. A well-written and interesting history. A piece of Communist injustice. Definitely worth reading."},{"Title":"Eleni","review":"This true story reveals humanity's deepest capacity for evil, and also its strongest drive to nurture, protect, and do good. It is a demonstration of the depths to which one can be pushed when survival is the basic need.A most important, riveting read. It should be required reading for any political science classroom or discussion on the nature of the human. I strongly recommend this for any book club. You won't be able to put it down."},{"Title":"Eleni","review":"I loved this book. I checked it out from the library a few years ago after seeing the movie, but didn't really dig in and read it. Several years later and with a son of my own, I read the book. In fact I stayed up almost all night to keep reading it. I can't think of a book I have loved more. Gage does a great job keeping the reader straight on the myriad of characters in the book and above all, does a wonderful job describing his family's experiences. I truly wept while reading this book. Just buy it!!"},{"Title":"Eleni","review":"This book is a true masterpiece ! The love of Eleni's son, and her devotion to her family , make this a book you will never forget. Nikola's love for his Mother and this tribute to her memory is told as only her son could tell it. I read this book by accident. I would have never bought a book about the Greek civil war. But this book is so much more. It somehow reminded me of, &quot;For Whom the Bell Tolls&quot; but you feel this book in your gut, and you know this is REAL. BRAVO Nikola !!"},{"Title":"Eleni","review":"I was given a copy of Eleni many years ago - perhaps ten. The strength of love felt by a mother for her children was a power death could not diminish nor end. Poverty, civil war, hardship and community rivalry are key themes but none so haunting as Eleni's love for her children. I urge you to read this book. I never forgot it although I subsequently mislaid it. Some seven years later I had a little girl and I called her Eleni. A year ago I was in a book store in Florida and to my delight came across it again which I immediately bought to give to my Eleni when she is older."},{"Title":"Eleni","review":"\\"Minutely observed\\", from a New York Times book review, is an understatement.This book could have been written on half the amount of paper. I found the made up conversations and daily life scenarios between all the characters excruciating (i.e. boring). After a while I got to the point where I flipped through pages. Fewer words, more elegently written, would have brought the characters to life far more engagingly and believably. Which is a shame since I think the core story and this woman's life are worthy of telling.It really lost me towards the end when one of his sisters, after learning of the mothers' death, took a bite of baklava (sp) at a wake and \\"felt for the first time a lifting of her sorrow.\\"\\" I mean, come on! Talk about a bad, made up detail.Unfortunately Nicholas, the writer and young son in this story, was not there to really observe any of this history so he was forced to create a life (Eleni's, his mother) and the supporting characters from some sketchy memories of survivors and some documents. He also switched from first person to third person, adding a stiltedness to the storytelling. Between chapters, he added historical \\"mini-chapters\\" of what was going on with the war during the time of this story. The final chapter read like a bad B-movie thriller, complete with a gun toting son looking to shoot his mothers killer but in the end didn't do it... yawn. We already knew that would happen -- the author isn't in jail. The ending actually makes Nicholas Gage look a little deranged and obssessed, as at the time of the final confrontation, he is in his 40's, married with young children, etc. No doubt this is not what his mother would have wanted -- a man obsessed and losing years of his life haunted by her murder. I hope that in writing this book Mr. Gage found some surcease.In summary, while we can all understand to varying degrees loss, anger, the need for revenge, etc. this story was just too \\"made up\\" and un-engaging to keep me reading it. The story itself is moving, the heroic death of his mother, her obvious love for her children, but the author takes creative license one too many times to make this novel a great one."},{"Title":"Eleni","review":"An important read especially for those who do not know a great deal about Greece's modern history. However it does, somewhat understandably given the author's involvement, have a rather anti-left bias. Therefore, I strongly recommend that readers who enjoy this novel also read at least one of the many novels that demonstrate the atrocities that were committed TOWARDS those on the left (eg. Achilles' fianc&eacute;e by Alki Zei ASIN: 9600404801), in order to gain a more balanced picture of historical events in Greece."},{"Title":"Eleni","review":"As a descendant of Greek partisans in the Civil War it is important for me to tell you that the story tries to diminish their cause, Greece ended up in the hands of foreigners and fascists because of their defeat.The story of the book is powerful, but it is wrong to think that it is decisive enough to say which side was right or wrong."},{"Title":"Eleni","review":"I'm generally not into reading, but I decided that I would give this one a shot, expecting it to be as good as Face/Off. Boy was I mistaken. Cage should stick to acting. Do you remember in Snake Eyes when he punched that guy in the face? Do you remember in Boy in Blue when he punched that guy in the face? I enjoyed those moments more than I enjoyed reading Cage's book, or reading anything for that matter."},{"Title":"Eleni","review":"Human diminishment is the theme of this masterwork, which shows how people can sacrifice their rational powers and nobler instincts on the altar of a reductionist ideology, then descend into the (home) economics of envy and the politics of resentment, and end up killing off even the mildest opposition. Concretely, it is about how Communist guerrillas in Epirus took over the village of Lia, reduced the once sturdy villagers to treacherous, starving, vermin-infested semi-savages, used them for slave labor, and finally murdered many of them. The story centers on Eleni Gatzoyiannis, who attempts to escape with her children, more for their sakes than her own. The Communists manage to get other villagers to snitch on her and they end up torturing and murdering her in a ravine along with a few other villagers. Nicholas Gage reports here on what he found out about exactly what happened in that doomed village and what happened to Eleni. Gage is, in fact, Eleni's only son and he managed to escape to America just before the Greek national armies managed to rid the northern mountains of the Communists. A successful journalist in the US, he has written a marvelous account of some unsettling and depressing events. Toward the end of the book he has the chance to take revenge on the person most responsible for his mother's fate, but decides it would be a more fitting tribute to her if he did without his revenge. Some parts of the narrative are (necessarily) reconstructed, but in general the work is faithful to the facts of history. Extremely powerful, it will stay with the reader long after the reading is finished."},{"Title":"Eleni","review":"I'm from Greece. Before 4 years i read this book, and till then I can't forget it. I visit the place where Eleni lived and died, I talked with people who met Eleni, or their childrens. Reading this book, I had in my mind my own village, where same stories were happened. I could wright more and more for this lovevly book, but my english aren't good and i don't want to anoy you. Read this book and learn what happened at the heroic Greece. I'm glad to be here. Nicholas."},{"Title":"Eleni","review":"Nicholas Gage (Nicola Gatzoyiannis)wrote a book that was both terrifying and touching. It was terrifying because it exposed the brutality of Communism and touching because it told of a woman's undying love for her children, especially the boy who would one day pay tribute to her. The descriptions of torture Eleni and fellow villagers endured at the hands of the ELAS/DAG were some of the most horrifying things I've ever read. The scene where Eleni tells her son, Nicola, to be brave and gives him a gift of a cross is one of the most touching scenes of family love I've ever read about. This story is a must-read for everyone. It is both instructive about the moral degradation caused by Communism and about the courage of a family. Also read Nicholas Gage's followup, &quot;A Place for Us: Eleni's Children in America,&quot; which chronicles events leading up to Gage's life today. Excellent writer!"},{"Title":"Eleni","review":"I'm half Greek but only recently heard of \\"Eleni\\" and the author Nicholas Gage (\\"Gatzoyiannis\\" in Greek). I'm not sure how I missed them growing up, though I think my parents may have read this story when I was little.\\"Eleni\\" is the moving story of Gage's mother Eleni (the Greek form of \\"Helen\\") and their family in war-torn northern Greece near the Albanian border. It recounts the effects of the Greek civil war (when Greek communists were fighting Greek nationalists for control of the country, post- WWII) on their village, Lia, and on their entire family.I cried a lot during the book. Not necessarily because it was sad, but because it was so moving and beautiful. Eleni the person can be summarized in one word: love. She took the necessary steps to help her children escape from communist-controlled Northern Greece, and for her effors the communists (fighting \\"for the people,\\" mind you) murdered her, along with 4 other villagers that they felt were not \\"for the communist cause.\\" Eleni's faith, devotion to her family, and continued struggles throughout her life are very inspiring for me. I am an Orthodox Christian, and I regularly pray to her now for intercessions to help me. I firmly believe that she is among the saints as a \\"New Holy Martyr of Greece,\\" just like the Russians have new martyrs that died as a result of communist persecution in their country.Her 5 children (4 girls and one boy), Olga, Kanta, Glykeria, Fotini, and Nikola (who is now Nicholas Gage) are devoted to their mother. It is worth noting that if it weren't for Eleni, the 5 would probably have been shipped to an Eastern bloc country to be raised by communists, which was done in Northern Greece during that time. Children were taken from their mothers and sent to communist propaganda camps in the Eastern bloc. Kanta and Glykeria served time as \\"andartinas,\\" young Greek girls taken from their families and forced to fight for the Greek communists.Gage's book is warm, loving, tender, and heartfelt. His style of writing truly makes you feel that you are there in Lia, witnessing what is going on to the characters, which is both good but horrible. Some of the events truly make you realize how evil men can be toward each other.I highly recommend \\"Eleni.\\" I just ordered and am looking forward to reading the sequel, \\"A Place For Us,\\" which recounts the story of Eleni's 5 children and their family after immigrating to America in the late 1940's."},{"Title":"Eleni","review":"I read the book some 5 years ago and found myself closing the book to the horrifying scenes of torture. This is the true story of an era of shame in the history of Greece that so many Greeks tried to hush and distort the truths about the so called &quot;civil war&quot;. It is an honest encounter of the horrors of that war. But most of all it is the story and glory of a mother whom words cannot describe her grace, her love for her children and her courage. Nocholas Gatzogiannis bears a legacy of a mother that very few people can understand. Should Eleni's spirit sees him from above, she can only feel proud of her son. For he not took revenge but instead wrote the TRUTH."},{"Title":"Eleni","review":"A disturbing, angering and emotion-filled recollection of events which touched the lives of many thousands of Greeks, living today. The life of Eleni Gatzoyiannis is a beacon, demonstrating a Christ-like love for her children and fellow man, despite the awesome terror she faced. Clear in the pages of this book is the tragically unjust suffering of the common man at the hands of political mad-men, drunk with their sense of self-importance and the fulfilment of their objectives - for which everyone except themselves ultimately suffers. Eleni is an important book for everyone to read, but especially Greeks, because it vividly portrays the depths to which Greece sank, in a time most can still remember. Despite this, many exiled Greek communists are received like heroes, and the horrors committed by Greek upon fellow Greek, rationalised as a political struggle. This clearly shows our ability to forget and our vulnerability to sink again to such depths in the future."},{"Title":"Eleni","review":"I'm half Greek and have lived in Greece most of my life. The period of the Greek Civil War is rarely talked about and when it is, it is always under a cloud of secrecy and obscurity. Participants on either side mostly keep a low profile, deny their involvement or distort what happened as is correctly revealed by the author. Whether you are interested in the historical side or just looking for a good read 'Eleni' is a superb book about the struggle of a woman, a village and a country which wounds have not entirely healed despite the passing of more than 50 years."},{"Title":"Eleni","review":"This book is a tribute to a mother by her only son, celebrating a woman who sacrificed herself to save her children. Whether you know anything or not about the Grecian Civil War, Nicholas Gage's book will inform you, albeit not without partiality; the story is as much about his need for revenge as it is about Eleni Gatzoyiannis, a woman of incredible courage. The reader will wish for more information on some of the events surrounding this story, or for a little objectivity in the case of Eleni's accusers, her fellow villagers; but Gage contains over a decade of story in a book just over 300 pages without crowding it in. As far as the objectivity goes, Gage doesn't pretend it, so the reader shouldn't expect it. There is little sentiment (a Godsend in this sort of biography), but a great deal of emotion meshed into the narrative, and it flows without interruption. This is Gage's grave-offering to Eleni, and it is peerless."},{"Title":"Eleni","review":"I could not put this book down nor get the incredible true story of Eleni out of my mind. This book stands as a memorial to the strength and courage of a mother's love for her children. It also stands as a perfect illustration of the unspeakable injustice and horrors that men inflict on innocents in the name of a cause. Through her son's painstaking and painful research, Eleni will live in the reader's hearts forever. A brilliant and enlightening book. I cannot recommend it highly enough"},{"Title":"Eleni","review":"This is an amazing book. It is full of Greek history during WWII and the aftermath thereof.

The strength of the Greek women &amp; children during such a terrible time touched me &amp; I pray for the souls of those who died."},{"Title":"Eleni","review":"I'm Greek-American and read that book in about 2 days, with little sleep. The movie was horrible. Gage is an excellent writer, always has been. The schism between the children and father was common for that generation, since the fathers came to the US to begin busnesses and build a life here so they could have their families with them. My paternal pappou came, but in the early 1900's, and was very successful. He and his brothers all got out before WW II and more Turkish slaughters.Gage is very open about the feelings for his father since, as in many Greek families, the \\"mana and yia yia\\", were everything. The father was an anonymous figure far away. It was the women who were the strong ones at that time... they had to protect hearth, home, and teach the Greek way of life. Their roles were all-encompassing and the execution of Gage's mother, which couldn't even be truly adknowledged properly, out of fear, shaped his entire life."},{"Title":"Eleni","review":"I have owned this book for over 10 years. Every time I read it I thought of my maternal grandmother (that was her generation) and all the other brave Greek mothers before her and cried like a baby. I passed it onto my second husband who is not of Greek descent. He loved it and really liked the name Eleni. That was about 5 years ago (we've been together over 6).Our second daughter was just baptised Eleni in the Greek Orthodox church. It was the only name we could agree upon. My aunt & uncle came from Greece and told me a story of when my uncle was a little boy. He was injured by an unexploded bomb and was taken to a hospital in Athens. His grandmother went to visit him. She had been born and raised in Athens, although now living about an hour outside of the city, so she knew the short-cuts to the hospital. On her way to see her beloved grandson she was shot dead, mistaken for a man in disguise. This was at the beginning of the civil war. I had not heard this story before, and had no idea who my paternal grandmother was. Apparently, her name was Eleni. I wonder if this is why I was steered to this book and so moved by it? Ain't life funny?"},{"Title":"Eleni","review":"A very touching and human account that stays with you long after you've read the book. Comparing it to previous books by Nicholas Gage it's clear that he put everything he had into this. The description of the gripping events that occur throughout the story somehow moves the reader to evaluate his own feelings and motives."},{"Title":"Eleni","review":"I cannot remember reading a story with greater emotional impact. The actions of the guerillas and reactions of the people of Lia - given my age and upbringing here in Canada - are not something I am easily able to comprehend. Nicholas Gage must have to deal with feelings of rage which at times must seem overwhelming. I recommend this book highly. As is always the case, it is much better than the movie, although, Kate Nelligan did a good job."},{"Title":"Eleni","review":"This book was incredible...a great story told magnificently by Nicholas Gage...his compelling writing style made this story have such a greater impact...I've read the book in its entirety 3 times and it just gets better...some of the details of the war we could've done without, but other than that, this book comes highly recommended by me"},{"Title":"Eleni","review":"This was one of the few books I read from cover to cover my senior year of college.

It starts out wonderfully, drawing us into their rugged life in the mountains as well as the politics of the time. Then it bogs down with so much minutiae that you feel like you are trying to swim in a mud pond and can no longer imagine the other shore. Yet, my cousin recommended this book to me as her favorite biography of recent years, so one could say there is an individual experience of this book and it just didn't click for me personally. I will say that the topic is compelling and important, and the subject, Eleni, is inspiring."},{"Title":"Eleni","review":"This book gives a good account on many fronts. Primarily it is a biographical tribute to the authors mother who saved her children's lives at the price of loosing her own. She was certainly a serious, emotionally strong woman, and the tribute is fitting. The book also gives a decent account of the Greek anti-Communist struggle following WWII. Each chapter starts with a couple of pages describing the history of events that pieced together form a chronology of the Greek civil war. The book also provides a very accurate picture of the life and the people of small Balkan towns in the middle part if this century. Lia is a Greek town but the characters would be little changed if they were Serbian or Bulgarian. What the author describes is a hard life and it makes for hard people. They are peasants. Hard working, very hard working. Genuine and likeable people, but also ignorant, superstitious, cunning, and sometimes cruel.Lastly the book gives a taste of true 'real world' Communists and Communism. It's not pretty, and so very far from the flawed ideal espoused by pseudo-intellectuals around the world. It takes a special mix of political fanaticism, ignorance, and cruelty to be able to torture and execute children and women. In this century only Fascists and Communists have found and used this formula. The book describes the Communists quite well."},{"Title":"Eleni","review":"Author Nicholas Gage tells the story of the Greek civil war and how it personally affected him and his family. Most notably this book describes how politics, fear, greed, and desperation combined to culminate in the brutal torture and execution of his mother, Eleni, for the crime of merely saving her children from starvation or forced separation.My brother highly recommended this book to me. I was a little put off by its length and the obscurity of its subject (I had never even heard about the Greek civil war), but as the story unfolded I found myself completely engrossed in it. The first 100 or so pages were just a little difficult absorb because of the necessary build-up of the scenario and the characters. I also struggled throughout the book to get a grasp of the numerous greek names of people and places. However, these were minor inconveniences to pay for the huge reward of learning about this incredible and disturbing experience.Nicholas Gage very eloquently describes the cruelty and injustice that war tends to inflict on so many innocent victims. Everyone could benefit from learning about this story that he has so vividly portrayed in Eleni."},{"Title":"Eleni","review":"This is a very good book written by the son of a woman murdered while trying to escape to freedom with her children from a corrupt government.

I didn't realize there was a book until the Wall Street Journal recently wrote about a sequel by this author's daughter (also Eleni).The book is incredibly gripping and powerful. I am pretty middle-of-the-road politically, and used to be somewhat left-leaning in college. However, I found myself feeling that communism is the ultimate evil - I actually had to remind myself how evil totalitarianism on the right can be as well. ANY political system where people can't emigrate freely is EVIL!The stories of family love, village life, and self-sacrifice are stirring to read. I was quite affected by this book.I was, howeer, terribly disappointed by the author's decision regarding the main antagonist (whom he locates years later)."},{"Title":"Eleni","review":"This book described horrors, brutality, suffering, moral degradation, man's inhumanity to man, etc. which is why I say it was a terrible book. And what always makes such descriptions more difficult for me is the fact that it was real, true. It was \\"heart wrenching\\" and \\"hard to get through\\" (quoting from other reviewers), and it was painful reading. Yet I agree that it was an \\"important\\" book and it made me think. It was about war and if I think I have learned anything about war, it is the fact that if you don't shoot the guy in front of you, you will get shot by the guy in back of you - if you're not with us, you are against us. This book (for me) wasn't about the Communists versus the Nationalists as much as it was about getting swept up in overpowering conflicting and confusing forces of nature, and struggling frantically with the question of how to save yourself, your belief in yourself, and those you love. For me, the question of right and wrong lost all meaning here. I asked myself what I would have done in the various situations described; I concluded that I don't know. This an important book and a well written book. But don't read it if you want to read a feel-good book."},{"Title":"Eleni","review":"Eleni is a gripping story of man's inhumanity to humans; in this case the Greek Communist's inhumane treatment of its own men, women and children during the Greek Civil War in the late 1940s. Although this book is a biography, Nicholas Gage's narrative prose reads like a powerful novel. Every aspect of the hard-working villagers' life is depicted, right down to the peasants' ignorance, their superstitions, and their cunning and cruel treatment to each other for survival in the hands of the communists. Above all, this story is about Gage's mother Eleni who sacrificed herself to save her children. If you can read beyond the killings, the cruelty, the starvation and torture, you will find it difficult to put down this 470 page masterpiece. For the weak-hearted, simply skip those parts, it's worth reading."},{"Title":"Eleni","review":"Ironically, the reader enjoys the story because of the compelling way Nicholas Gage describes his pain and tragedy. I've rarely read a book that I just couldn't put down, this is one of them. I too am a Greek American, my own mother's name is Eleni and my younger brother's name is Niko, so I could just imagine the close bond Nicholas Gage (the baby of the family) and his mother had. I think this book does an amazing job of describing just how cruel people can be to each other in a Civil War."},{"Title":"Eleni","review":"A revealing and sometimes harrowing exposure of what the Greeks did to each other in the name of &quot;freedom&quot; in the late 1940s. An honest peasant woman with her five children, husband in ameica, is persecuted for simply wanting to protect her family, and is finally shot by the people who were supposed to be providing a better Greece for her and all Greeks to live in. The story is unfolded by her son who goes back to Greece in adulthood to find the 'judge' who ordered her execution. I'm not sure you could call this a 'good' read, it is too sad in parts, but with moments of humour and much love, but definitely rivetting and something everyone should read."},{"Title":"Eleni","review":"This has got to be one of the best written books I have ever read.

I guarantee that any reader will relate to Eleni's emotions and sacrafices when it comes to her children."},{"Title":"Eleni","review":"It is sometimes said that each of us has one great book to write, but that few of us will have the talent, time and inclination to write it. And if so, then this is Nicholas Gage's great book, and time, talent and inclination were clearly not lacking.But there is a recurring problem with books of this kind. While passion is the engine of greatness, it is also the author of blindness. As love is blind, so is anger, and there is plenty of both here.Nicholas Gage portrays his mother in heroic saintly terms that seem just too good to be true. While there are heroes and saints (and Eleni may well have been both) the inclination to simplify heroes and saints into their types takes away from them as much as it gives. In this case I cannot help feeling that the Eleni of the book is as much the expression of the hope and love and despair of a motherless son than a description of the real person.And when Nicholas Gage writes in the first person dramatic mode, rather than the expository mode, there are moments where the story rings unconvincing. For example, the scene in which he finds himself in front of the sleeping judge who sentenced his mother to death, with a revolver in his hand, and struggling with the moral dilemma; to kill or not. I am sure Nicholas Gage imagined this kind of encounter on many occasions. I believe it a safe bet that he was never actually in that situation. It must have been clear to him from the outset that the revelation of the facts in this book would be revenge enough, and for the intellectually inclined and gentle character he portrays himself to be, that must have been enough. It is just an intuition of mine, an indication not so much of fact as of Gage's failure to convince me on this detail.Even so, it is a powerful, compelling and monumental work, written with great passion. Strongly recommended."},{"Title":"Eleni","review":"As a Greek American having made many trips to Greece over the last 25 years, I found this book to be poignant and heart-wrenching. It's been years since I read a book this engrossing and rich. The complexity with which Gage treats the Greek villagers, the civil conflict and the interference by international powers is impressive. The book perfectly elucidates how political philosophy can serve the desires of unjust men at the expense of the people."},{"Title":"Eleni","review":"The Greek Civil War 1944-1949 is one of the most interesting of thecommunist/ left/ socialist/ insurrections in the 20th century.The Communists were so routed that in the waning days of that War,that they took to stealing children to indoctrinate back in Russia.This is a great story about that horrible time in Greece.It is the story of a mothers love of her family and her neighbors."},{"Title":"Eleni","review":"One of the most engrossing factual books I've read.

Deciding to read it again now, my positive attitude has not been diminished, although I can now see some flaws that I did not pay attention to the first time.As a son's personal journey, obsessed by the death of his mother, and his burning need to exact revenge on those who have denied her her most basic rights as a human being, Eleni works brilliantly.It is written is such a way that will totally engage you, admiring the courage and strenght of character of this brave woman who has shown unwavering sense of duty,and unconditional love and dedication for her children, that resulted in the ultimate sacrifice.There are two tones in Eleni.The first and last chapters are very personal,and deal with Gage's emotional state, his still unexpressed grief for his mother, and his investigative work,trying to put names on the blurred faces of her executioners.Yet in most of the other chapters, Gage takes the tone of an objective narrator (or as objective as he can be), describing in literary prose the story of Eleni,Greece during the war,the traditional village life in the mountains,the struggles of the peasants trying to make ends meet,their deep faith laced with centuries old superstitions and tradition, and subsequently the events that lead to his mother's death after the communist take over of the Mourgana mountains.What is so striking about Eleni, is how Gage's sorrow, and anger is so believable and raw after all these years, yet how majestic is the power of forgiveness he was able to find within him!I loved the fact that at the end, Gage was able to exorcise the demons that had haunted him since he was nine, and when finally he faces the judge that sent his mother to her death, he finds Justice and his peace of mind through forgiveness and not revenge.Yet, the flaws that I found in Eleni and which I mentioned above were mainly because of the prejudiced overtones of the book:On one hand it is understandable coming from a grieving son, less so coming from an investigative reporter.Naturally the communists take the full brunt of his prejudice, and although atrocities were committed during the war in the name of many ideologies, from fascism to communism, you can feel that his anger, because of his mother's fate is solely directed towards the red guerrillas.Moreover, the historic animosities between Greeks and Turks do resurface again in his book,and the minority Turks of Greece are portrayed as aliens,conniving, ungrateful,and allying with the axis powers against their 'Christian' countrymen...(however we all know that collaborators were of every ethnic group and faith).Having said all that, Eleni is still a wonderful read,(if you can weed out these prejudices),if only to admire courage, unconditional love, sacrifice, a son's dedication to his mother's memory and his journey of redemption during which he found a wonderful power few of us possess: forgiveness!"},{"Title":"Eleni","review":"\\"Eleni\\" is an hymn to the author's mother. It describes the strength of his mother's love for her children that helped the family survive through a variety of hardships - the father's absence in USA, civil war, poverty, hostility by other villagers. The book describes a compelling story of the family, their struggles and the escape of 9 year old Nicholas Gage to the U.S.A. As an adult, Gage returns years later to get revenge from the people who tortured and murdered his mother but at the end he decides to honor her by following her teachings instead of revenge. The book provides a look in the life of small villages in the Balkans and the beginning of cold war. It is a great novel and the author is a masterful story-teller.Unfortunately, despite Mr. Cage's credential as an investigative reporter, the book falls short on historical accuracy and serves as a [...] tool for the pro-western faction of the civil war against the \\"evil\\" communism. It is a romanticized version of the actual events as witnessed by a young boy who wants to \\"protect\\" the memory of his mother since he was not there to defend her life and as re-told by the villagers who want to absolve themselves of any crime.Great portrayal of a mother's love for her children just do not buy it for its historical value!"},{"Title":"Eleni","review":"In this engaging and harrowing work , Nicholas Gage documents the life and death of his mother , Eleni Gatzoyiannis , who was tortured and murdered by Communist thugs who had taken over her village of Lia in Northern Epirus , Greece , during the Greek Civil War.Her 'crime' : trying to prevent her children from being abducted by the Communists.It is also how as always Communists turn everything they touch into hell on earth , everywhere in the world where they rear their evil heads. And of the brave Nationalists who fight to save their homeland from malignant Communist murderers, a struggle which has taken place in so many countries.Here a proud and charming village is destroyed and it's wonderful and engaging inhabitants reduced to terror and starvation.It is the story of Eleni and her five children : Olga , Kanta , Glykeria , Fotini and Nikola. Their personalities are really brought to life.We get to know the real life characters in a nonfiction work which flows like a great classic novel.So much that is moving in this work , for example how before Eleni is executed , her last words are a cry of love and the cause for which she has been murdered : \\"My Children\\".Or when Eleni appears in the dreams of the oldest daughter Olga to tell her that she was not stoned as Olga thought , but shot , later re-appearing to tell her that the other daughter Glykeria is alive and will find them soon, exactly as happens.Eleni really is a testament to life , death and renewal. A masterpiece!"},{"Title":"Eleni","review":"There are few books on the Greek Civil war that erupted after 1945 between Communists and the rest of Greece. During the war some 158,000 or more people died, many at the hands of the Communists. Yet most books on the subject in English are still sympathetic to the Communists (seeRed Acropolis, Black Terror: The Greek Civil War And The Origins Of The Soviet-american Rivalry,1943-1949) and refuse to condemn the red terror and the mass killings. This book goes a slight way towards setting the record strait if only because it shows the story of one peasant woman in a small village known as Lia in the mountans of northern Greece. But the story of how the vilagers were used as slave labourers by the COmmunists, starved and finally tortured and murdered is a story of what befel all northern Greeks during the Communist insurgency. Westerners present this insurgency as 'romantic' as only westerners can present genocide as 'romantic'. But this sad and disgusting train of thought is finally shattered by this excellent and daring book that tells the story not only of Lia but of the peasants who lived there and Eleni and of course her son who survived and who has lived to return to Greece to tell the story.Seth J. Frantzman"},{"Title":"Eleni","review":"I found the book to be a wonderful read, very historical and insightful yet intensely emotional."},{"Title":"Eleni","review":"I read this book for my book group and it was very hard to get through. It is very well-written and interesting, if you can get past the Greek names, killing, starvation, torture and general horror. Not wanting to be defeated by a book, I read on, trying to mentally cover my eyes and rush through the worst of the beatings and torture. Somewhere along the way I became mesmerized by Nicola's story of his Mother's life and how she managed to defy the communists. It is a very heart-wrenching story, from the clouds of war in the beginning to the final horrible outcome for her. But it is also uplifting in the sense that her spirit prevailed right to the end and lives on in her son, who upholds her example in his most trying hour. Anyone who can read this book and not thank God he was born in the United States, and is living in a time of peace must be crazy!"},{"Title":"Eleni","review":"Eleni is an ode not only to the author's mother, but also to the thousands of martyrs of communist atrocities in Greece after WWII. It is a very accurate depiction of the situation and a precise historical account of what happened in Greece (Hellas) during that time. It is a very sad story, but unfortunately history and facts cannot be revised to please those uncomfortable with this accurate account. An eye opener and a shocking reality to sheltered Americans might be the mention in this book of the forceful stealing of young children from their parents and forwarding them to Eastern European countries to be raised as young communists, never seeing their parents again."},{"Title":"Eleni","review":"Eleni is a very powerful book and it struck close to home to for me because my great-grandfather was on the Fascist side during the Greek Civil War, although he was an Bulgarian naval captain during World War II. His housekeeper named Elizabeth was the person I remembered, when I began to read Eleni although she didn't suffer the same hardships or even death as Eleni. I firmly admire Mr. Gage's writing style and I believe this book to be one of the most interesting and riveting books on Greece that I have ever read. This is a story at that still goes straight from the page to my heart and I couldn't sympathise more with Mr. Gage in his search for revenge.I would like to thank him for all the good he has done by writing out such a superb and heart-warming book. I Love Eleni!"},{"Title":"Eleni","review":"I read this book much faster than I should have, but I couldn't wait to get to the next page. This is a dramatic story, told in a balanced and unemotional way such that you wouldn't guess the author to be related at all to Eleni. The ability to write in such an accurate and neutral manner about such a powerful topic is truely a sign of the utmost professionalism. In spite of that you are moved by this epic story because of it's ability to make human a person who does super-human things. The disturbing part of the book is the fact that we must realize that there is abuse, corrutption, inslavement and torture going on today just as it has for all time. When will it ever end? This is a must read for everyone. Period."},{"Title":"Eleni","review":"I have been meaning to read this book for years, knowing it would be a difficult story for me to absorb - one that would not be forgotten. I am a Greek American, whose Yiayia and Papou emigrated to the U.S. around 1920. Although I may have relatives in Greece that were affected by the violence of WWII and the Greek Civil War, I do not have personal knowledge of any. Read this book, and you will suffer with the Gatzoyiannis family. It gave me an insight into some of the customs practiced by my grandparents, my US-born father (to a lesser extent), and our Greek Orthodox church community. This story of Greek against Greek (Communists versus Nationalists), which continued to rage after WWII was over, is horryfying to those of us proud of our heritage. Nick Gage (born Nikoloas Gatzoyiannis) painstakingly reconstructed the history and events leading up to his escape from the Communist-occupied town of Lia, along with his sisters, as well as the execution of his mother (who instigated their escape to safety). It is a wrenching story of love, unfathomable hardship, and betrayal."},{"Title":"Eleni","review":"60 years ago today, 41-year-old Eleni Gatzoyiannis and five other villagers of Lia, Greece met a tragic end at the hands of a Communist firing squad--she, in particular for the \\"crime\\" of sending their children to live with their father, who had been in America for over a decade.Eleni and her five children had endured years of Italian and German occupation during World War II, and the subsequent attempted Communist takeover during the Civil War.Her youngest child and only son, Nikola recounts these tragic years, and his hunt for and ultimate confrontation with the judge who sentenced his mother to death decades later, is the climax of the story. But there is one aspect of the story that has always struck me: The influence of Eleni's mother, Megali over these events.When Eleni married, and her husband, Christos went to America, Eleni was forced to stay behind behind because her mother threatened to commit suicide the day her daughter left the village, and cultural dictates were that Eleni honor the wishes of her immediate family. Her husband, who, in fact, also told her to stay, would return from America periodically, and most of their five children would be be the products of conjugal visits, which was not unusual for the time and place.But little Nikola would never see his parents in the same room; born in 1939,he and his mother and sisters were cut off from their father by World War II, and the Civil War, and it would be nine years before he would travel to America to meet his father for the first time.Eleni's mother could evoke empathy as a product of her time and culture, and as someone would would have needed her daughter to do chores, as many peasant families may have.But her grandson, Nikola, might have a less tragic tale to relate had she and her son-in-law been more forward thinking and had allowed her daughter her own chance to live.When \\"Reader's Digest\\" featured excerpts of this book, they called it a \\"Tragic Tale of a Mother's Love\\". But even before the Communists forces ultimately hindered Eleni's plans to escape to America with her children,Eleni's mother and husband more or less sealed her fate by forcing her to stay in Greece years before.And while respectful of that culture for what it was to a degree, her mother's threat especially strikes me as one of self-centeredness.25 years after her story first became known to the world, Eleni Gatzoyiannis is remembered for the courageous way she played the brutal hand she had been dealt, and her tragedy becomes her children's triumph. But one is struck at how much could have been different if a young bride had been allowed to go to America before all the chaos came to her village."},{"Title":"Eleni","review":"This book is written well, but it is a hard read. I didn't think it really grabbed me until about 244 pages in. It is worth it in the end, but you have to want to finish it (or in my case, be required to) in order to enjoy."},{"Title":"Eleni","review":"In the late 1940s, civil war tears Greece apart. The Communist forces take control of the mountains bordering Albania, and Eleni - the \\"Amerikana,\\" wife of Christos who long ago emigrated to the United States and became a citizen there - finds herself forced to become more than the peasant woman she has always been. She has remained in Greece out of duty to her aging parents, while her husband has visited often enough to father a family of five children. Now she knows she should have insisted on going with Christos after their wedding, or at least have insisted on following him with the children later on. For under the Communists, she fears for her children's survival. She fears so much that for the first time in her life, she stops obeying her husband's orders to stay put (for Christos understands nothing about the conditions under which his family is living) and stops relying on her father's advice. She makes her own arrangements to cross the lines and escape into territory held by the Greek government; and when a work detail's seizure of her third daughter makes it impossible for the whole family to go, Eleni remains behind and sends her other children to safety. She orders them to go to their father in America, no matter what happens to her or to their absent sister. And no matter what the rest of their extended family, including the men to whom Eleni had always listened before, says they should do.Eleni dies in Communist hands after her children, all but Glykeria, escape. Her youngest child and only son, Nikola, grows up in the United States and becomes journalist Nicholas Gage. Decades later, obsessed by his mother's murder and aware of how it feels to love one's children - for by now he has a family of his own, as well as a successful career - Gage returns to Greece and begins investigating. He feels compelled to know every possible detail of his mother's life, especially during its final days, and he desperately wants to track down her killers and make them pay. Since those Greek Communists who went into exile after the war can now return without fear, thanks to a 30-year statute of limitations even on murder, he locates them one by one. One by one, he learns not only what they did; but why. Katis, the judge who condemned Eleni to death - and who before that, ordered her vicious torture - becomes the focus of his fury. What will Nicholas Gage do when he faces Katis at last? For the man is not only still alive, but free and enjoying life with his family in his homeland. While Eleni is dead, and her children far away.This is a wrenching story, the meticulously researched and detailed work of a fine journalist. It is also the very personal, sad, and at times terrifying account of a woman's life, and of the son whose birth and rearing she saw as fulfillment of her primary role in the world. The most interesting thing about this book, though, is in my opinion how ordinary the people who acted like monsters - who murdered and tortured, and informed on each other - turn out to be. \\"What would you have done?\\" some of them ask Eleni's son, when he finds them and calls them to account.

East Berlin and East Germany become part of the Federal Republic. East Germans face a new society as they seek to integrate into the Federal Republic and Western Europe. This shock produced by the fall had many unsettling results. Schneider tells these stories in a series of essays addressed to German readers.There are some interesting situations described here. The East German policeman pursuing a Vietnamese into West Berlin so as to deport him. Poor Polish merchants peddling goods in a walled off West Berlin portion of the city. Questions whether the greater Germany will pose a threat to Europe. The costs of bring East Germany up to West German standards. There are many fine points to discuss here.This is an OK read for those interested in the division of Germany. I wish I could have read this book when I visited the remains of the Berlin Wall in April, 1990. Germany and Berlin are now united, but the Germans will be working through the problems of the separation for many years to come."},{"Title":"The German Comedy: Scenes of Life After the Wall","review":"I started reading this book several months ago and now have slowly wandered my way to the end. It is a book best read an essay at a time. Otherwise it seems to jump around too much. A movie in the Seattle International Film Festival, &quot;No Place to Go (Die Unberuehrbare)&quot; reawakened my interest in the book. In the movie, a leftist writer struggles to discover how to survive after the Berlin Wall has fallen and all her hopes for a socialist Germany have been dashed. She has become an anachronism moving across the landscape with nowhere to go. This book is much lighter in tone, a series of good-humored irony-laden essays about life in Germany in 1989 and 1990 in the absence of the legendary Wall. Schneider points out various paradoxes such as West Berliners becoming less enthusiastic about the Wall coming down as the probability of its demise approaches. Also, the book is full of interesting historical footnotes, such as that most of the Wall has disappeared as people have hacked off bigger and littler pieces of it as personal momentos and much-in-demand tourist items. For someone as little aware of recent German history as me, this book was very informative and leaves me wanting to read more about recent German history to find out what has happened since 1991."},{"Title":"A discourse of matters pertaining to religion","review":"Recognizing the precariousness of arguements from authority and supernatural proofs in light of both science and historical critical understandings of the Bible, Parker wishes to re-establish religion on a surer ground, one consistent with the expansion of knowledge and modernity. He does this by looking at various world religions, history of religions and there development, but continually refers to the religious sentiment to be found in every place. The creeds, scripture, Jesus miracles, etc. are all additions and pale in comparison to the basic truths accessible to all. His use of historical criticism to relook at all the dogmas of Christianity with the intent of revising faith not attacking it, is probably a first among American writers. His theory of religions is remarkably similar to the arguement made by John Hick.

I have personally been seeking the definition of Qifrom a martial arts standpoint, taken years to formulate myown definition and understanding--and this book has done atremendous job of condensing an infinitely complex conceptand given it a conceptual framework.Well and clearly written, this book explores the origins of theterm 'Qi' in Chinese history, and explores this conceptthroughout a number of aspects of Chinese history and culture.Yu Huan Zhang, the author, concisely explains the central roleof the concept of Qi in Chinese philosophy, religion, medicine,art, martial arts, qigong, literature, science, and others.After reading this work, one realizes that one's understandingof qi can never be complete, and will always be dictated bythe context. Appropriately, this book both expanded myawareness of the concept of qi, enhanced my understanding,yet failed to provide a coherent, simplistic answer.Before reading this book, I had come to the conclusion thatthere really was no such thing as qi. I was right, and Iwas wrong. But I feel significantly closer to trueunderstanding.Highly recommended! My only criticism is that for such a shortbook, too much time was spent on extended quotes. Yes, theyadded to the text as examples, but I would also like to haveseen more in-depth exploration of major concepts. If space wasa limitation, then I would have preferred more brief quotes, andmore narrative exploration.This is a must read for anyone seeking to understand the conceptof Qi, that has yet to find the answer, or is not sure of theanswer. Or anyone who is interested in better understandingthe root of Chinese culture and thought."},{"Title":"A Brief History of Qi","review":"First of all, I must say that this book unquestioningly accomplishes what it set out to do, which is detail the historical evolution of qi. If you are unsure of the qi's nature and would like a little context as to its historical development, a bit on its philosophy and its applications, this book delivers. However, you will not find much depth here as it is an historical overview. It is effortless to discover starting points for further study in qi through the references used. I wholeheartedly recommend this book for anyone trying to understand qi.Now, there are several elements of this book that I did not care for. In fact, I found them downright irritating. First of all, quotations are seldom (if ever) documented. The text is named and a passage follows, but translator and page number are absent. You know where the information comes from only in a vague sense so there's no way to locate the original information. I would like to know which translation of the Dao Dejing is referenced as the Chapter 43 citation on page 155 is a terrible one. There is a bibliography on page 184, but no Dao Dejing is listed. Next, there are a lot of superfluous pictures and characters sprinkled about that don't seem to benefit the reader one bit. If you could read Chinese, perhaps you could double check the translation, but for the average audience to whom this book caters, this is lost. Next, the authors make very general assumptions that are not clarified. For example, one section explains that Leibniz and Bohr may have been influenced by the Dao Dejing (or was it the I Jing?), but no mention or evidence of how are listed. Also, they boast that qi dates back 10,000 years, but no citation is given to account for this. Lastly, the authors become dismissive at times towards western methods, especially concerning medicine. The tone seemed out of place and unnecessary.I guess what I would like to see is a second edition of this book that is chalked full of beefy endnotes that fill in the vague spaces and lead the reader directly to the pages from which the citations are lifted. If this were done, this book would become tremendously powerful and reach an even larger audience. I would like to see this book used as an undergraduate textbook someday, but as it stands, I could not see it used as such due to its academically sloppy presentation.As mentioned, this book really is wonderful at what it set out to accomplish. Regardless, all I can see when I look at it is how great it could be."},{"Title":"A Brief History of Qi","review":"The book sets out to investigate historical references in the understanding of Qi. Obviously this is a major science and this book has the foundation of a 5-star rating, but falls short in that there is a lot of material the author did not investigate. In particular, I would have liked to see deeper research into the various practices primarily in China, India, and Japan that focus on the cultivation of Qi, along with a comparison of the different techniques used to achieve this end. In such an absence, the book assumes an academic journey into the historical record and falls short of offering any practical value.This is an essential book for any practitioner of eastern medicine, yoga, or the martial arts. All of these people can gain a solid foundation of the background of this science, and here I believe the book really delivers. Where the book fails is in the definition of Qi, which should have been one of the first entries to set up the root of understanding the future concept. Another major failure is the lack of any explanation or discussion of the many uses of Qi within the body, and what they are called and how they are differentiated according to the Chinese (ie Yuan Qi, Wei Qi, Gu Qi, Zong Qi, Zhong Qi, Zhen Qi, Lung Qi, Heart Qi, Liver Qi, etc etc.).Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) defines Qi as one of the 4 vital substances: Qi; blood; Essence; and body fluids. The 2 main properties of Qi are: 1) Qi is an energy which manifests simultaneously on the physical and spiritual level; 2) Qi is in a constant state of flux and in varying states of aggregation (when Qi condenses, energy transforms and accumulates into physical shape. Accordingly, there are many different types of human Qi (ie lung Qi, food Qi, defensive Qi, etc), however they are all still Qi manifesting in different forms.For example, Nutritive Qi exists in the \\"interior\\" (of the body) and its function is to nourish. It is denser than say Wei Qi (Defensive Qi) which is on the exterior and protects the body from pathogenic invasion. Its impossible to discuss Qi without going into the relationship with the other 3 vital substances, and this was not covered anywhere in this book. Essence for example has a major influence on Qi, and this is an essential discussion that is completely absent.There are two types of Essence (plus Kidney Essence): pre-heaven & post-heaven. Pre-heaven Essence is given by parents at conception and has 7 irreplaceable levels that we burn throughout life. Post-heaven Essence is nourished by Qi, which is produced from the air we breathe, the water we drink, and the food we eat (in order of importance, which is why true yoga is so powerful: increased respiration). Our lifestyle produces the quality of Qi which in turn affects the rate of Pre-heaven Essence depletion. If our Qi production is poor via our lifestyle, our body cannot perform optimally, and eventually if bad habits are not addressed they manifest as injury & illness.The reason I listed Qi components in order of importance is because the author failed to do so and it is essential for an athlete focusing on Qi to know this. The human body can arguably go months without food, a few weeks without water, but only a few minutes without breath.In the index, there isn't even an entry for breathing. It is mentioned in passing here and there, but nowhere did the author include a detailed analysis of the fundamental importance of the breath nor how to practice it for maximum affect. He also fails to detail the relationship of water and food for the optimal production of Qi. This is very disappointing. So is the brevity of the chapter on TCM.The book is not titled \\"The History of Qi in China\\", so to discuss Qi and ignore India and the art of yoga, is to completely miss an awareness of Qi that is arguably more developed and better in tact than anything China has to offer. The closest thing offered is in his telling of Da Mo (Bodhidharma in Hindu):\\"....he compiled a series of exercises designed to bend the limbs and stretch the sinews...these bending and stretching exercises serve as a basis of a variety of martial arts and techniques developed in Buddhist temples throughout China....which include a series of breathing techniques aimed at harnessing and developing a mysterious internal power.\\"Da Mo came from India to China, and likely brought Yoga with him. This was the foundation of internal Chinese martial arts. Unfortunately, it was never an improvement over the original Yoga. It is a major oversight that the author did not get into this. The only yogic reference is on p15, \\"The ancient Hindus wrote of prana, the invisible 'breath of life' that they cultivated through yoga.\\" After that he goes off about Greeks and the Kabbalah.In any event those are my personal grievances and the book still has a ton to offer. Chapters include:1) The Literary Traditions of Qi: Etymologies; Definitions; Ancient Texts; Modern Writers; Concepts in Other Cultures2) The Qi of the Philosophers: Ancient Cosmology & Ontology; Natural Phenomena & Basis of Social Structures; Qi & Dao; Qi of Kong Zi, Meng Zi & the Confucian School; Qi in Western Philosophy;3) Qi in the Arts: yi Qi He Cheng; Dance of Qi; Qi in the Education & Training of Artists; Charm of Qi; Understanding Qi -Perception & Appreciation of Art4) Qi in Medicine: Concept of Qi; Differentiation in A&P; Qi in Diagnostics & Therapeutics; Nourishing & Treating Qi for Healthy & Longevity; Theoretical Tools to Identify & use Qi in TCM5) Qi Gong: Ancient Roots & Practices; Aims of Practitioners; Search for Internal Elixir; Real & the Fake6) Qi in Martial Arts: Qi Power; Gung Fu; External & Internal; Masters & Secrets; Tai Chi7) Qi in Daily Life: Qi in Modern Chinese Language; Familiar Experiences & Expressions; Qi & the Chinese World View; Future of QiThe TCM section dealing with Longevity is almost entirely devoted to a discussion of herbs, and not to the hard work a person needs to do to maintain a personal practice that cultivates Qi. The \\"Qi Gong\\" section can be debated almost endlessly. My main gripe is the author's failure to recognize that \\"Qi Gung\\" was one of many \\"Gungs\\", or skills. Just as \\"Hei Gung\\" referred to \\"Light Skills\\", or being light on your feet, Qi Gung implied mastering the practical application of Qi, be it for healing or fighting (yin/yang). Internal martial artists will have a field day with various opinions on the Martial Art chapter.Regardless of my criticism, the book is still excellent for what it is, and disappointing for what it could have been. There is a great collection of b/w photos of all different nature that add to the study. A table of the Heavenly Stems (seasons) and Earthly Branches (Circadian Clock) is included in the back. Unfortunately he did not include the corresponding Zang/Fu organs. There is also a chart of the seasonal divisions, and a not-so \\"Concise Chronology of Chinese History. There is a 1-page bibliography, and the body of the text offers many primary sources for additional study."},{"Title":"A Brief History of Qi","review":"A Brief History of Qi is a remarkable book that finally gave me a clear concept of what qi is. Having always thought that qi was synonymous with energy I was amazed to see that it is not just limited to a function of the body but that it permeates everything. It is a lot closer to the Force but in a real way. Each chapter of the book describes qi in relation do different aspects of Chinese culture through an examination of the meanings behind the Chinese characters. Qi is indeed a fundamental concept to the Chinese understanding of the universe and the authors exemplify this as it pertains to medicine, philosophy, martial arts, art, literature and even the day to day application of it. Not only is the book extremely insightful it is an easy read with a lot of historic images. It is a must read for anyone who has been even remotely curious as to what this whole qi thing is all about."},{"Title":"Essential ColdFusion 5 for Web Professionals (2nd Edition)","review":"I really liked this book and it was a really easy read. was very straightforward and used some pretty neat applications."},{"Title":"Strawberry Sunday: A John Marshall Tanner Novel","review":"As a long time fan of Greenleaf and Marsh Tanner, I thoroughly enjoyed Strawberry Sunday. I love books that inform and challenge me as well as entertain, and can always count on this author to accomplish that.A rumor has been circulating that Greenleaf planned to retire the Tanner series, and with the last book seemed to have done so, in a most excruciating way. With this book, Marsh has been returned to me and I can imagine him, one of the rare really good people, continuing to do what he does best."},{"Title":"Strawberry Sunday: A John Marshall Tanner Novel","review":"Strawberry Sunday, by Stephen Greenleaf, was nominated for an Edgar Award, 2000 -- and reading it, it's not difficult to see why. This is a mystery novel with a social conscience and a wry sense of wit. It begins with the hero, P.I. John Marshall Tanner in a hospital recovering from a gut shot and mourning the death of his close (cop) friend Charley Sleet, but most of the action takes place in the California Salinas agricultural community. Tanner has resolved to find out who murdered Rita Lombardi, a fellow hospital patient who wants to better the life of farm workers.There are lots of red herrings, wonderful characters, and witty and often hilarious dialogues with them (and with himself). Tanner often reaches wrong conclusions and gets plenty of egg on his face, but in the end he prevails; he's a tough guy with loads of grace. Strawberry Sunday is a punchy, funny, touching novel. Read it."},{"Title":"Strawberry Sunday: A John Marshall Tanner Novel","review":"Did you every wonder where your fresh strawberries come from? Or the pears, peaches, grapes, pineapples on your table?Stephen Greenleaf explores the agricultural caste system through the voice of his private investigator first person narrator, John Marshall Tanner.Tanner is a great narrator: an intelligent, world weary private eye. Tanner goes off to the strawberry fields of the Salinas area to investigate a murder, then two, and actually three. But this isn't a story of violent murder; it is a story of agricultural communities, of dating in the l990's, of small town politics, of family rivalries. Tanner's weapon is simple: he asks questions. The answers eventually fill in the pieces of a mystery.This is a great read."},{"Title":"Strawberry Sunday: A John Marshall Tanner Novel","review":"San Francisco private investigator John Marshal Tanner has been hospitalized while he recovers from gunshot wounds. John's best friend Detective Lieutenant Charley Sleet shot John, who was forced to kill his buddy. Charley, dying from cancer, killed two dirty cops, and wanted John to end his life.John still suffers nightmares from the incident. If it were not for fellow patient Rita Maria Lombardi's support, his mental recovery would have been a lot slower. Rita was recovering from surgery that corrected two deformed feet and an ugly birthmark on her face. She plans to return home to marry her boyfriend and help the strawberry pickers being terrorized by the Gebrides family, who own the town of Hacienas.Rita invites John to visit her, but when he calls to set a date, he learns she was murdered. John decides to repay Rita for helping him regain his equilibrium by visiting her hometown and uncovering the identity of her killer. The obsessed John does not care whose skeleton is rattled nor whom he must hurt as long as he feels that he has paid back his debt in full.Strawberries have everything and nothing to do with this well-done who-done-it. Stephen Greenleaf cleverly uses the fruit as a symbol of the wide chasm between owners and workers in a feudal system that has seen limited changes even with the noble efforts of Chavez. Within the framework of this socio-political tale, STRAWBERRY SUNDAY is a first class novel filled with betrayal, greed, and murder that adds much depth to this on-going series. It also serves to remind readers that the plight of the migrant farm worker remains similar to what it was three decades ago.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Strawberry Sunday: A John Marshall Tanner Novel","review":"This excellent Greenleaf novel opens with Tanner recovering from a gunshot wound in a hospital.

I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Border country: A novel","review":"Few novels are as beautiful and compelling as those simple stories that are steeped in the essence of a place and time, and yet powerfully reflect our universal experience. Border Country fits easily among much more recognized time-and-place classics like Tarjei Vesaas' Ice Palace and Yukio Mishima's Spring Snow.Analyzing a place and time and the people who lived there is never a proxy for being there with them. The power of Border Country is that the style and tone--pared down, local, and direct--is really of the time and place and so has the authentic power to transport you into the lives of Harry, Ellen, Matthew, and the others connected to the border country.If you're a deep thinker, you can dig many themes out of this novel--trying to return home, honoring labor, being part of a community with all its vagaries, finding a sense of place, and integrating who you've become with the place from which you came. If you're an academic, you can even dig much deeper in William's works, as he himself did, in the backwards evolution of our increasingly commercialized--and disassociated--culture.Or if you simply want to read and appreciate a beautiful story about real lives, Williams welcomes you to do that too."},{"Title":"Lost in Time and Space With Lefty Feep: Eight Funny and Fanciful Fables of the Forties, Plus One Brand-New Parable of Modern Times","review":"This collection of pulp tales brilliantly shows just how different the meaning of a writer's work can differ between a fan and the writer. Editor John Stanley, host of the once popular San Francisco based late night horror movie television show Creature Features, put together many of Robert Bloch's 'famous' Lefty Feep stories. Each yarn involved a very contemporary (for the 1940's that is) con man named Lefty Feep who delighted in telling some long suffering schmuck in a coffee shop the wild tales about his failed get rich quick schemes. Written for the fantasy pulps of yore, each tale has a magical trapping of sorts (i.e. flying carpets, genie in a bottle, etc) that inevitably trip up our tireless, and quite clueless, fall guy of a hero. Not surprisingly Bloch barely remembered writing some of the stories (most were written at the request of the publisher and not out of any desire by Bloch to explore the character further) and this workmanlike attitude casts a humorous light on Stanley's obvious, and quite fanatical, love for the character in the interview segments with Bloch that bookend each story. The small press edition, from Stanley's own, and now defunct, Creatures at Large Press, was intended to be the first volume in a series, but none ever followed. Bloch, in his unauthorized autobiography, blamed the stories with his trademarked bemused self-deprecation. Highly recommended for both the silly stories and the probably unintended fan/writer insight."},{"Title":"Lost in Time and Space With Lefty Feep: Eight Funny and Fanciful Fables of the Forties, Plus One Brand-New Parable of Modern Times","review":"Between 1942 and 1946, Robert Bloch wrote 22 comical fantasy adventures of Lefty Feep, a cross between a Damon Runyan gambler and Baron Munchausan. The formula for each story was essentially the same. Lefty corners the reluctant narrator at a cheap restaurant and tells him of his latest adventures with the pied piper, a magic carpet, an invisible coat, or a golden touch machine. In each case, his plans to get rich go askew. All of these stories appeared in _Fantastic Adventures_. At one point, Bloch was writing them at the rate of one a month. He says that editor Ray Palmer steadily bought the stories but gave him no special praise; that would have encouraged him to ask for higher rates.In _The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction_ (1995), John Clute states that all of these stories were collected in _Lost in Time and Space with Lefty Feep_ (1987). Would that it were so. But the collection consists of only nine stories-- the first eight Lefty Feep yarns, plus a new one written especially for the collection. Future collections were planned and advertised, but I can find no evidence that they were ever published.The new story, \\"A Snitch in Time,\\" has Lefty travel to our own time. It's a bit too world-weary and gloomy. It doesn't go with the breezy optimism of the earlier pieces. \\"Time Wounds All Heels,\\" the first Lefty Feep story, is relatively rough. And \\"Jerk the Giant Killer\\" is flawed because Lefty is telling about the adventures of somebody else. Bloch rates it as his least favorite of his early stories in the series, and properly so.On the other hand, \\"The Weird Doom of Floyd Scrilch,\\" \\"The Little Man Who Wasn't There,\\" \\"Son of a Witch,\\" and \\"The Golden Opportunity of Lefty Feep\\" have a certain manic fun about them. They are loaded with slapstick action, ghastly puns, comical dialogue and other assaults upon the English language.Make no mistake. I am glad that this collection was assembled. I would like to see more Lefty Feep stories in print. Perhaps the one in which Lefty gets henpecked (but not by a housewife), or the one where he has misadventures in an old folks home for gangsters, or the one where he encounters the dragon and the sleepy-time princess. And yet, you know, the stories-- even the better ones-- are not really top of the line. The jokes sometimes misfire. The dialogue is frequently corny. And you can usually predict their endings early into the story. And I am not either stuffy and humorless!"},{"Title":"Lost in Time and Space With Lefty Feep: Eight Funny and Fanciful Fables of the Forties, Plus One Brand-New Parable of Modern Times","review":"When I was a kid I used to collect old pulp magazines. One of my favorites was a magazine called \\"Fantastic Adventures\\". The stories were an odd combination of science fiction and fantasy. Most of the stories were set in the present day. You would see stories of people who found bottles with genii in them or dropping into odd dimensions, or whatever. Most of it was pretty light fantasy stuff.My favorite of these stories were about a character named \\"Lefty Feep\\". Lefty was a race track tout who would tell all sorts of outrageous stories. Imagine Damon Runyon stories as written by a compulsive punster.Lately I have been going back and rereading the stories. They do contain a few bits that are not considered PC. (These were written during World War II, so there are various anti-Japanese and German slanders.) They are still fun to read. Robert Bloch had a wicked sense of humor and it shows in these stories.This was the first volume of a planned three volume set. The second and third volumes were never printed. (As well as the story that started it all \\"In the land of the sky-blue ointments\\" which has never been published and \\"The Return of Lefty Feep\\" which was printed in an obscure fanzine.) It is too bad. There are far too many stories of that era that are forgotten because it is next to impossible to find them in print."},{"Title":"Date... Or Soul Mate?

Although he said that he is a big believer in marriage, he said that he knows lots of single psychologically healthy people who are happy in being single. He points out that you can take control of your dating life, so that you don't ever need to let a doomed relationship go beyond several dates. When a relationship goes on for so long, so much bonding occurs that breaking up becomes extremely painful.

But there are things that are immeasurable; things intangible that can't be measured and put on a chart and analyzed. I can't put a finger on it myself. My point is....it only goes so far. It does not apply to everybody; nor does it work all the time. You can have a successful, happy marriage based on just a few compatibilities, and everything else works because the couple are very much in love; enough that they work things out! Believe me, working things out covers a multitude of incompatibilities, and so does love. But it's real love that I'm talking about. This book is very helpful.

How To Know If Someone Is Worth Pursuing In Two Dates Or Less","review":"Date. . . or Soul Mate? How to Know if Someone is Worth Pursuing in Two Dates or Less, by Neil Clark Warren, Ph.D., is an extremely practical dating guide from the founder of eHarmony.com. The book is like a handbook on the psychology of compatibility and time management. And it provides tools and tips for making the dating process as effective and time-efficient as possible.As a dating and relationship coach working with singles looking for a life partner relationship, I had heard a lot about eHarmony.com and its particular protocol. Clients tell me that rather than sort through various online dating profiles themselves, eHarmony.com has you first take a personality test. From the results of that test, members are then introduced to other members that, according to Dr. Warren's formula, they would be most compatible with.In my live lectures and virtual teleclasses, I frequently have stated my agreement with Chapter 2 of the book entitled \\"Know Yourself.\\" I have heard singles claim they already know everything about dating and relationships, but complain about still being single. I use this chapter, and the ones that follow, \\"Your Must-Have and Can't-Stand Lists,\\" to direct singles to identify what they're looking for in a partner. Dr. Warren generously provides readers with the fifty most popular must-haves, and the fifty most popular can't-stands, to help articulate what frequently has become an amorphous blob of an ideal mate, that they will only recognize by chemistry.Once you have these lists, Dr. Warren suggests that you \\"burn them into your brain,\\" as they will now serve as your \\"shopping list\\" for finding your soul mate. He describes how to be \\"other conscious\\" rather than \\"self-conscious\\" while dating, and suggests areas to question your dates about to help you determine if your must-haves and can't stands will be met. He addresses the importance of emotional health and its powerful effect on compatibility. These chapters provide great directions on how to navigate the frequently confusing dating waters.I found the section on \\"Seven Significant Similarities\\" in chapter 8's \\"Differences You Must Not Overlook\\" especially important. In his 30 years of practicing as a psychologist and working with singles and couples, Dr. Warren has identified certain key similarities that strongly contribute to marital success. They are: 1) spiritual harmony; 2) desire for verbal intimacy and ability to be intimate; 3) level of energy; 4) level of ambition; 5) expectations about gender roles; 6) interests, and 7) personal habits.I found the last one, personal habits, to be the most eye opening. Dr. Warren contends that the degree to which one person attends to neatness and orderliness in his/her life, should not differ too much from those of whom he is dating. I don't think I would have given this life habit much credence before I read the book. Rather, I would have suggested that it wouldn't be until a couple were living together that they would create a household system that works for both of them. But Dr. Warren makes a strong case that you should observe how your dating partner attends to neatness and orderliness BEFORE you live together or marry, and determine ahead of time if you could actually live with him/her.The only weak part of the book is towards the end, when Dr. Warren tries to quantify the principles of negotiating a \\"great deal\\" in a relationship. I think that he made a great effort in attempting to take the intangibles about dating and partnering and make them practical up until this section. In my opinion, determining if you got an \\"good deal\\" still remains intangible.Of course, Dr. Warren uses Date or Soul Mate? to make a case for signing up with eHarmony.com. I suggest that you use the principles of his book to help you keep focused as you travel the road in your search for your life partner."},{"Title":"Date... Or Soul Mate? How To Know If Someone Is Worth Pursuing In Two Dates Or Less","review":"The most useful part of this book is the list of 10 must haves and the 10 can't stands. This allows one to screen potential mates quickly. Warren points out that the chief reason for divorce is the common practice of settling for someone that has one or more of the &quot;can't stand&quot; items. This is usually rationalized as &quot;I may never find anyone else&quot;, etc. The limit of 10 is a practical compromise between, say, 5 and 100 items. It accounts for the most crucial areas of compatibility and incompatibility to be accounted for, yet without being so selective that one would never be able to find a mate."},{"Title":"Date...

It assists you through self-discovery and how to articulate the type the person you want to spend the rest of your life with. I think every single person should read this book before making any long-term commitments! Also, if you are already in a relationship and have doubts - it can also help you identify the source of your frustrations and how to end the dating relationship before heading to marriage.As for e-harmony - many people that say they had a bad experience is due to putting up false & unrealistic expectations for the service. Like any on-line service- you need to check & research everyone you attempt to pursing communication. E-harmony doesn't do security, investigative or credit checks so don't expect that everyone you meet will be honesty & clean. (If you read Dr. Warren message - he explains this very thorougly)Another thing to keep in mind, is that the service doesn't promise that you will meet your dream partner and happily get married. It is just a tool to help you meet additional people ideally closer to your personality that you wouldn't normally meet on a regular basis. You still have to do the work in identifying whether this person is truly the best match for you.Be smart, wise and don't put yourself in compromising or dangerous situations.This book will definitely help you put dating in the RIGHT PERSPECTIVE!"},{"Title":"Date...

How To Know If Someone Is Worth Pursuing In Two Dates Or Less","review":"In general I found this book to be a very usefull tool in the begining of a search for that one true love. I do believe that the book is too short for a true effective purpose or it should be written with two more books; one containing exercises to get you thinking about what you really want, and the other book to do just the opposite, make you think about what you really don't want.I would recommend this book to anyone who has problems narrowing issues down that you want in a mate and/or issues that you don't want. It does have the ability to get a person thinking, but it does not go far enough.There are a couple of flaws with the book. The first flaw I find is that the author who has several years experience in psychology is not able to go beyond a couple of pages before he tells you this, and it is repeated. The other flaw is do to its brevity and not enough detail or any real exercises to get a person thinking about the true qualities of their mate."},{"Title":"Date... Or Soul Mate? How To Know If Someone Is Worth Pursuing In Two Dates Or Less","review":"This is an outstanding book if you are interested in dating consciously. Very good tools for finding out your own values and what is important to you in choosing a lifetime partner. Not only will you be able to consciously date and find someone truly suitable for you but also is an exceptional guide for looking deeper into yourself. I found it to be excellent in looking deeper at what I want in my life and in a mate. I totally recommend it to anyone wanting higher quality dating."},{"Title":"Date... Or Soul Mate? How To Know If Someone Is Worth Pursuing In Two Dates Or Less","review":"This book is well written and contains a lot of vital 'how to match' criteria within it. It does a good job of helping you to learn what makes you inwardly tick, so that you can be looking for the marriage partner that keeps time with you. This is good. But, (isn't there always one of these \\"but\\"s somewhere), this book has a major shortfall, due to its narrow focus on looking for your marriage partner and running away from all the rest. Mr. Clark understands what makes a marriage work, but appears to have little understanding what soul mates are. Everybody needs to find their soul mates in life (note the plural). The soul mates that we are meant to find will come in the form of the opposite gender and the same gender. These are people who we need to claim as friends for life - and stay close with. Then, depending on your intimate preferences, we need to select a potential marriage partner from this group of close soul mate friends that we now have. I believe Mr. Clark needlessly teaches his readers to overly narrow the search criteria when out on their first couple of dates with someone new. So when reading this book, remember that what we need to be looking for are our soul mates in life when we go on a date, and the rest who are not - do as the author suggests and run away fast (but, very politely). Now, that we have close friends for life, start narrowing down through interaction who, out of all your soul mates, makes for the most compatible match for marriage. I recommend the book regularly to others (with this caution). As for the eharmony web site mentioned in the book, I must give you strong caution - especially males. You could be into very serious disappointment if you pay for membership too soon. EHarmony's customer support is just rotten (they refuse to answer member's emails regardless how polite and persistent you are). Also, they are very good at matching you with people who are clearly on your Can't Stand list in personality characteristics. Apparently the web site version of the book does not follow the criteria of the book itself. You have been forewarned by someone who has experienced this first hand! I still recommend the book, though, with the caution above in mind."},{"Title":"Date... Or Soul Mate? How To Know If Someone Is Worth Pursuing In Two Dates Or Less","review":"This book is not awful, just not very good. It brings up important points but it's written in such a breezy, over simplified style, that it reads more like a \\"summer beach book\\". (The author also repeatedly states throughout the book how intelligent he is, how everyone says so, etc, etc. That's a \\"red flag\\" warning right there, if you ask me). It sounds oh, so logical but unfortunately human beings are a bit more complex than what the author conveys. In short, finding your soul mate is quite more difficult than finding a refridgerator. A concept the author is refusing to grasp.As for eharmony, I'd dare say that it is a business i.e. they want your money. Whether they really match people up correctly is anyone's guess. The underlying assumption of the website is that people are honest, and are self-aware. It claims to weed out emotionally troubled people but it doesn't take much intelligence to fudge the answers so you come out smelling like a rose. Proceed with caution. With this book and the website.The word scam comes to mind."},{"Title":"Date... Or Soul Mate?

How To Know If Someone Is Worth Pursuing In Two Dates Or Less","review":"This is a great book. The E-harmony service is BAD. It is not based on the concepts in this book and there is very little assistance from customer service when requested. Below is a comment I submitted to EH when closing my 1 year subscription. I hope this helps others avoid spending money on a bogus service.I found very unacceptable matches through EH. The first fellow I went out with lied about his age and wanted a 3-some. The 2nd fellow wanted me to have sex with him after a glass of wine on our 1st meeting. The 3rd fellow became so angry during a 1 week period I started to fear for my personal safety. He was VERY verbally abusive. I did not meet any matches after 07/05 because of my unsavory experience with EH. I do not believe your 29 points matching points are real. The last fellows capability for anger and mood management was non-existent and yet we were matched. Good thing I am not a hot head and fought back... who knows what would have happened to me. I fear for the first woman who is raped or worse trusting EH methods. When I complained to EH customer service I was told these are \\"life style choices\\". That is a way to not be responsible to your customer if you ask me. I'm SURE you will not respond to my feedback because that is your way of avoiding responsibility. By closing my EH account and not giving your company any more of my money and telling EVERYONE I know about my EH experience is how I am being responsible to me and those I care about. It's really no wonder that on www.amazon.com the EH books are not talked about so much in the customer reviews but how bad the EH service is... It really is true... this is a BAD service.

How To Know If Someone Is Worth Pursuing In Two Dates Or Less","review":"I found Dr. Clark's writings insulting and amusing. He also degrades the dating/courtship process. I am a Christian and have read many books on finding a date/mate in life. None of the other books blatantly degraded or insulted the reader's intelligence (via his choice of words and phrases) as Dr. Clark has. It's unadulterated bashing!The infamous 20 questions are ridiculous....one should write their own questions and use their own judegment and criteria when evaluating their date. The whole process takses time if you really want to give a person a chance (get to know them). Some people are able to decide if a person is right in 1-2 dates, whereas others might not be able to or not want to.Monitoring your date for behavior and communciation is abusrd and defeating. His whole perspective (point of view) on this subject is abusrd and insulting. I did not receive insight on identyfying a mate/date with this book. I would recommend Be Your Own Dating Service, Nina Atwood, M.Ed., L.P.C.

The recommendations are largely superficial at best, with few or no original points or slants. The author fails to mention the import of &quot;soulmate&quot; connection. Although his intentions may be good, he seems to have &quot;dispatched the job&quot; of writing this book in favor of displaying his ego and advertising his eHarmony website, which male customers should avoid like the plague. In both book and website, the author demonstrates that his &quot;foolproof system&quot; actually features more holes than a piece of Swiss cheese. It is better that unattached males and females seek other avenues for insights into successful relationships."},{"Title":"Date... Or Soul Mate? How To Know If Someone Is Worth Pursuing In Two Dates Or Less","review":"Well Smithers, if you want success in relationships or dating, take Neil Clark Warren with a grain of salt. A friend who tried e-harmony and this book gave it to me to read. Her experience alone was enough to call me to question this guys validity, and the assertions he makes on his e-harmony commercials are ludicrous and without merit.Point 1 - He pushes getting your free personality profile which is normally a $40 value. How did he arrive at this value? How many people have ever had to actually pay for this personality profile? E-harmony wouldn't exist if this profile wasn't free. Once you take the profile, they start matching you with people regardless of whether you joined or not. This is their hook. If you didn't pay, you start seeing people matched with you to interest you into joining.(They e-mail these to you) If you do join, you are also matched with people off of their personality profile, who may not even be members. Hence, since they haven't joined, you can't communicate with them and vice versa, but you see it as activity and being matched with someone so you assume that it's working, or at least that e-harmony is matching you to people.Point 2 - Neil Clark Warren discusses that you are matched on his &quot;29 dimensions&quot; of compatibility. And that these 29 dimensions are necessary for relationship success. Garbage! As a member, you will never learn what exactly these 29 dimensions are, or how the person they matched you with fits these. To me he's a con artist for suggesting that people who DON'T possess the 29 dimensions aren't in for a happy or successful relationship. I'd like to suggest that in order to qualify his remarks, we give every married couple who claims to have a happy, fulfilling relationship his personality test, and see how many of these people wouldn't match up on his 29 dimensions. Divorce lawyers could have a field day. Why would you like this divorce, is it irreconcilable differences? Mental anguish? Adultery? No, no, I was perfectly happy until I found out I don't match my partners 29 dimensions for relationship success. Divorce me, I've got to find one of these e-harmony partners! I'm left to wonder how the human race has survived without Neil Clark Warren and his 29 dimensions to relationship success."},{"Title":"Date... Or Soul Mate?

How To Know If Someone Is Worth Pursuing In Two Dates Or Less","review":"Was working on a church project with a friend struggling with the dating scene and this book came up. I think I've read a couple hundred on this mid-life dating thing in the last ten years. This title made it into the top 20 at least.A friend started me out on this path here. A few bumpy years later I found this book that fine tuned a simple rule a redhead gave me one afternoon: \\"On a good day you are not going to get more than 80% of what you want in a woman. You'd better make sure the 20% that you're not getting isn't something very important to you.\\" That's the sum of this book. But he makes you write it all down. Who you are; what you want. Gives you a top 50 in must have/can't stand fashion.Truth be told I hated the author's eHarmony web site. Used it for six weeks out of five years of dating at age 54. But I found a life partner there, a spouse of 5 years now. This book was very helpful. A friend pointed me toward this work. Not a great book but a good book, focused on a very simple and basic rule that is not worth breaking.Give this book or a review of this book to a friend who is not having much success in dating of late.

But even so to help anyone to make the best choice possible no matter what!"},{"Title":"Date... Or Soul Mate? How To Know If Someone Is Worth Pursuing In Two Dates Or Less","review":"A long-term, serious relationship has been on my mind as of late. Not so much because I'm yearning for one, though I would like that in God's good time but due to: My realizing I do need a helper, I think long term and so thinking way ahead of now I know this is something I should be thinking about, praying about, preparing for now, I'm in a class at church called \\"the call of husbands\\" where we talk about love and marriage every week. Incidentally, the pastor of my church has also been preaching a very good series on marriage.Part of what I'm doing to be more prepared for marriage and find the right person and be the right person is reading a few books on the matter. I've read a handful of books on the matter before and I must say, these I've recently read are much better. They are not from the typical conservative Christian camps that try to prescribe the right way to do something (or else!). The three I've read are written by Christians who focus more on the knowing than the doing.Okay, so quickly here: \\"date or soul mate?\\" by Neil Clark Warren, PhD. (Warren is also the founder of E-Harmony). This is a short and simple book and worth the time. Not sure if it's worth the full price, but if you can rent it or get it cheap, I say go for it. Like the other author I've read, there's significant emphasis here on knowing yourself well. Then the emphasis is on knowing what you want/need. The clincher is this though: don't compromise. Warren has the reader put together a list of ten can't stands and must haves. He strong encourages you to hold to every one of those when dating - hopefully you have very carefully thought through those lists to begin with.Warren ends the book by speaking on the importance of emotional health (to which I give a big amen), as well as differences that must not be overlooked and how to make an accurate and early decision. He doesn't want people wasting their time in a relationship and says that after 1-2 dates one ought to know whether someone is worth pursuing further. He places a strong emphasis on marrying right, since so many marriages have and will go sour. So now is the time to figure out what we truly want and need. It's also a good time to figure out what we have to offer (as singles). Am I the kind of person who has ten (for instance) qualities someone may be looking for in someone? Do I have undesirable habits, or patterns, etc. If no, those need to be worked on.This was a good book and I recommend to other singles."},{"Title":"Date... Or Soul Mate?

I have a library at home (BIG reader!) so it's not a small thing when I say this book is on my top five must-read list for anyone. I went on to sign up for eHarmony (author is also the founder of eHarmony & the whole concept of eHarmony was built on the principles of this book!) & again the book really helped me to identify & narrow down the traits I wanted or couldn't have in a partner. It was like a journey into yourself; who you are & what makes you happy or unhappy. It does not guarantee a partner at the end, but it does help you know yourself more so that you are more savvy in your search for the right person. It solidifies that image of who you're looking for in your mind, rather than painting him or her in a romantic haze of perfection.I met my future husband on eHarmony a week after signing up & about 10 days after I went through the homework set out in the book. I can honestly say that would never have happened if I had not gone through the process of self-discovery through this book! I moved to Singapore 3 months later to be with him, got engaged 7 months after that, & we got married 11 months later. We have been blissfully married for about two years now, & in that time I have purchased probably 6 copies of the same book to give to my friends & family members who are still single.

Or, what if you're blinded by outside appearances yet don't really know what suits you best for a long term relationship?So, while I don't know if Warren's book is a panacea, he sets up some new and refreshing ideas on how to match personalities.I took the test at eharmony, which was free, and it gave me some insights into my personality, as well as personalities which are best suited for me in dating.How much is that worth to me? Well, enough to put in some time to buy the book and read it.

Or Soul Mate? How To Know If Someone Is Worth Pursuing In Two Dates Or Less","review":"At first I thought the title of the book was too good to be true. After years of dating you become sceptical.The book tells you how to make a list of 10 things you absolutely must have in a soul mate and 10 things you you can't stand in a person. When you go on a date, you use that list to evaluate if the person complies with your list. If he/she even has just one of your can't stands, it is a deal breaker. This list makes it possible to sift through all the fish in the sea and helps you to recognise your perfect soul mate.Dr Warren also has a website [...] where you fill in a questionnaire and it evaluates what type of person you are over 29 dimensions. It then searches for your match - on paper at least. This was very valuable to me.I recommend that readers also buy \\"Falling in Love for All the Right Reasons\\" also by Dr Warren. This explains each of the 29 dimensions of compatibility.I found my soul mate on an Internet dating site. I used my list to \\"interview\\" soul mate candidates through a series of casual questions. When a person didn't measure up, I politely ended the online conversation.On my first date with my husband, I mentally checked off all my \\"must haves\\" and saw that he did not have one of my \\"can't stands\\" and when the chemistry was there as well, I knew I had my soul mate.

How To Know If Someone Is Worth Pursuing In Two Dates Or Less","review":"This book, which contains good material, could be easily condensed from the current 200 pages down to 75 pages. Just read the section heading titles and the first sentence in the listed items and only read in further detail on concepts that are new to you.The dating site is not as good as it is described. There are a variety of problems some which you have workarounds for and some which cannot be overcome. The workaround problems are that the site will not function with some web browsers. The abbreviated personality test is not 100% accurate. The test does not test for honesty, realistic expectations, or mental health. These last three problem areas are very prevalent on the site, possibly more so than on other sites. The problem that you cannot work around is that they will only show you the matches they think are close to you. If you are young and live in a large metropolitan area this is no problem. If you are not you will not get any or very few matches. It would be better if they relaxed the match criteria and rated the match and let the two people decide if they wanted to risk it. Another problem is that the time of the last visit of the matches is not indicated. You will get your hopes up over matches that have expired memberships or are people who have not joined yet. .A further amusing thing about the site is that the book lists eating addictions as one reasons for marriages ending in divorce and advise against marrying anyone who has it. The site does not require people to list their weight.After being on five dating sites for one year each, the sad truth is that dismal as eharmony is, it is much better than any of the others. Only 98% of the people there are strange as opposed to 99.9% on the other popular sites. This means that you need to get 50 matches to find one you like and there is only a 2% chance that they will like you. In other words you will need to get 2500 matches to have a 50% probability of mutual interest with someone in a good state of mental health and having realistic expectations. There is one sort of dishonesty on the site. They will show you people who are new and do not tell you that they have not paid for membership. So do not pay to join the site unless you see someone you really like or you are contacted by someone you like.Also keep in mind that a recent survey of people with internet access and with recent happy marriages showed that only 3% of them met through any dating site. I think that you will find almost 100% of the peoplel on all dating sites, including this one, are at the bottom of the desirability scale. The data is out. The annual marrage rate for this site is 0.5%. This means you have to subscribe for 100+ years to have a 50% chance of getting married. They hide the statistics on the divorce rate for the site."},{"Title":"Date... Or Soul Mate?

If you're reading this review, you're curious about the book enough to be wondering what people thought about it. Look no further - it's exactly what you need and more. This book is a tool, it's not a novel, it is absolutely one of the best guides I've come across in regards to hitting pretty much every aspect of how to sift through people you meet and avoid wasting your time.If you're still considering the book, just go to the used section... I literally got this book from a reliable book seller on Amazon for ONE CENT! And it was in incredible condition, I couldn't believe it. All I had to pay was $4 shipping.Pros:There are lists. Lists are amazing because you can go through them with your potential partner or just simply read along by yourself and read and understand different categories of things to know what YOU want and need in a relationship. (Dealbreakers, necessities, compatible traits, etc.)There is a section on learning to understand yourself - which is a must - before introducing someone else in your life.There are sections for so many different steps of processes.Cons:The only cons that I can think of, and I had to think really hard, is that sometimes the author talks about people who are not healthy for relationships but gives no proper solutions for those people. Overall, it's REALLY a small, small concern only because I'd like to help people that I know who are emotionally unhealthy.Overall:Buy this book, you won't regret it. The only people who would are the ones who are not serious about relationships and just out to have fun or mess around. And if you're here, online, looking for a book on finding your soul mate, and reading my review... chances are, that's not you. So you will be satisfied :)"},{"Title":"Date... Or Soul Mate? How To Know If Someone Is Worth Pursuing In Two Dates Or Less","review":"I asked Wendy \\"Would you like to talk about marrying me?\\" and she said \\"Yes, when?\\", so we were tentatively engaged when we sat down together with this book, head to head in a good talking restaurant (a Subway, FWIW) and glanced through a couple chapters together: the top 50 must-halves at one session, and the top 50 can't-stands at another. We may not have read the whole paragraph about each item, just enough to say: Here's something some people care a lot about; do we agree about this item? or would it probably cause trouble between us? do we need to make a plan to deal with this? We agreed so smoothly our engagement strengthened, and we've now been married 2+ years, both for the first time--and I'm almost fifty! We were too busy that summer (not in bed, though we now have a new baby) to finish the book; it has other chapters we could've done the same with. I've since given out a few copies (and I suspect one copy may possibly have led one couple to adjust their friendship in a reality-facing way, i.e. break up nicely because their aims were too different). I had read the whole book before noticing Wendy; she hadn't.This use is different from what the book was written for, but I do recommend this use to couples seriously interested in each other: several evenings of useful discussion, making sure you've considered things Dr Warren, with his experience, knows couples need to consider.200 pages; for this use, you needn't read every one. It's written for you to read, make your own lists, and check out a date by the standards you've clarified for yourself. If you do that, you might still want to use it as I suggest--it'll strengthen an easily workable relationship, bring up things a middling relationship needs to deal with, and point out serious problems ahead in some relationships: better to get out unburned, and look elsewhere, than to crash, thinks Dr Warren, and I tend to agree. This book, and E-harmony, may not work for some people, and there may well be better stuff out there, but if a dozen bucks or so for this saves you a lawyer, you've come out ahead."},{"Title":"Date...

I am currently divorced and searching for a partner. Had I read this when I was younger I would not have married the man I married. Reading this now I can see how different we were from the beginning. As we got older our differences became more apparent and made raising our children a challenge.

How To Know If Someone Is Worth Pursuing In Two Dates Or Less","review":"Finding the one is a process of learning the difference between males and females, and the roles they perform in dual gendered relationships, and in some homosexual relationships. Conditioned to choose between one of two options which may come naturally to males - of either 1) search and destroy for dominance that the military and other organizations sometimes find so useful, or 2) possess and control, also for dominance - females seeking soul mates and/or loves of their lives are required to seek instinctively the male upon whom she may influence sufficiently to share the life of a male to the extent that she may modify the intensity of either choice. Often, that modification is merely a guide, or anchor, of how, when and where to focus those natural tendencies in her male to achieve the desired result, assuming she has respect of the male upon whom she relies. Without such influence, she has neither credence nor function except as ornament, social or economic freeloader, or servant. This time-tested tradition is not well documented, nor examined for its efficacy but may properly characterize the stress of living with males who are automatically thrust into the competitive arena. It rarely works in reverse however for some reason since women are not known to require this kind of support, nor have they traditionally found it in abundance among men to use at their disposal. Characteristically, the simplicity of this model may be applied to women to define the unique strengths males bring to the lives of women beyond the biological capacity of fertilizing them to produce children. Since the world continues to be mostly male oriented, however, we have yet to reach the question in order to answer it adequately. It may lie within the realm of security, however, to aid women in the blossoming of their confidence as they mature, and forming the parameters of any boundaries which may exist.

Later, I found the book, YOU KNOW ME, AL, and totally enjoyed it, as well. It remains one of my favorites of all times. With my Kindle account, I have recently found more of Lardner's works. GULLIBLE'S TRAVELS did not disappoint. If you can remember and liked those old situation comedies of the 1950's, such as I Love Lucy, The Life of Riley, My Little Margie, and so on, you will probably enjoy this book as I did. I gave it four stars instead of five stars, because YOU KNOW ME, AL is still my favorite, and I noticed that it is also available in the Kindle book store."},{"Title":"In pictures Death Valley: The Continuing Story","review":"The book contains some really good pictures. It is a good primer of what you can expect to see in Death Valley. It also gives you idea about where to wait for good pictures. The book would have been more useful if there were info about the picture details like what amount of hike/exposures were required."},{"Title":"Tale Of Benjamin Bunny, The","review":"Like many other books, I grew up with this one. This is a book that you can read over and over again and it will never get old. The characters are also good. Within the story, there is a little adventure. It also has a little bit of a conflict.

I routinely use various search engines, and this book pointed me to numerous sites full of useful information that I would never have found by merely using the results of those searches.The format of the book is straightforward with many snapshots of computer screens to give you an idea of what the site is actually like. Also, there are many generalized tips such as rules for mailing lists and how to maximize the performance of audio and video files that I found helpful.The Internet is a daunting world, and a good jungle guide is invaluable.

It does not help you find samples or items. Instead, it's written to help an internet newbie find information about gardening. It's loaded with URLs of websites to help you in your gardening adventures, but it does not offer free STUFF, like the title implies. It only offers free information.

I enjoyed seeing how close the program was to the book."},{"Title":"CHAMPAGNE FOR ONE - a Nero Wolfe Mystery","review":"If you are already a Nero Wolfe fan and are considering Champagne for One, I promise you won't be disappointed; it's one of the best. If you have never read a Wolfe book, this is a good one to start on. All the Nero Wolfe books are extremely funny and intriguing. In Champagne for One, the fat genius dectective Nero Wolfe has to solve the case of a girl who's death looked like suicide, but wasn't."},{"Title":"CHAMPAGNE FOR ONE - a Nero Wolfe Mystery","review":"One March morning in 1952 Archie Goodwin got a phone call from an acquaintance, Austin Byne, who wanted Archie to fill in for him at a dinner party that evening. Archie had an unpleasant experience with the hostess a few years earlier, he knew that the excuse Austin had given him was false and he was aware that the dinner party, an annual event where the guests of honor are unwed mothers, was unusual and more than a bit awkward. Despite all the reasons not to go Archie's curiosity got the better of him and he agreed to go. Before the evening was over though he came to regret his decision though. One of the unwed mothers committed suicide by putting cyanide in her post dinner champagne. At least that was the official explanation, Archie was convinced that the young woman had been murdered, and based on Archie's conviction Wolfe found himself involved in the mess. It was a decision that he must have had second thoughts about though when multiple women came through the brownstone on several occasions before the culprit was found.As always with Stout's stories the plot is clever, full of twists and turns that will keep the reader guessing as Archie ferrets out the clues. The dialog between Archie and Wolfe is witty and the scenes of Wolfe coping with a roomful of females is hilarious. Those who are new to the series would do well to start here and those who are fans will enjoy this one with its delightful peeks into life in the brownstone."},{"Title":"CHAMPAGNE FOR ONE - a Nero Wolfe Mystery","review":"Champagne for One begins with Archie Goodwin getting roped in to attending a somewhat unusual dinner. A small group of \\"unfortunate\\" young women (unmarried but had children) are paired with men of society in an attempt to broaden their horizons. It's sort of an odd premise but it does provide a great setup for Archie to practice his flirting skills. As you might guess, this being a Nero Wolfe novel, one of the young ladies swallows poisoned champagne and dies at the party. Most of the people there believe it's suicide, but Archie was watching her and knows she didn't poison the glass. From there, we are treated to a mystery with all the usual twists and turns until you're practically certain that no murderer will ever be revealed. And then, of course, Wolfe reveals the killer.Champagne for One is a good read. It isn't quite up there with the very best Wolfe novels but it is far from the worst. The characters are probably better than average, the humor typical of the series is present and accounted for, and the mystery is more than interesting enough to hold the reader's attention. I probably wouldn't give this to a first time Wolfe reader if I wanted to be sure they'd get hooked on the series, but I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it to a fan looking for their next fix of the corpulent detective."},{"Title":"CHAMPAGNE FOR ONE - a Nero Wolfe Mystery","review":"A straightforward mystery to solve...how does a young woman commit suicide in front of a watchful Archie Goodwin. She didn't as Archie contends and Wolfe proves; she was murdered. The whole gang investigates in this one and it will keep you guessing as there are a variety of reasons for young Faith Usher's demise. The ending is a little weak as it relies on police investigation to tie the murderer up but a good addition to the series."},{"Title":"CHAMPAGNE FOR ONE - a Nero Wolfe Mystery","review":"I almost gave it three stars because it was one of the episodes of the Nero Wolfe series that I had seen and so reading it was less interesting - I already knew who did it.

Here, even though the plot premise is a bit strained, I really don't care. We get something better: in a quartet of dialogues -- through Archie's eyes, and through Fritz's & Wolfe's -- we see Archie at his Archie-est.A few brief tastes of these four:First dialogue, with a new male character. He calls out-of-the-blue to invite Archie to a very elite, possibly strained dinner party. After toying with him, Archie says to himself,\\"If I hadn't had my full share of ego I might also have been curious as to why he had picked on me, since we were not chums, but of course that was no problem. If your ego is in good shape you will pretend you're surprised if a National Chairman calls to tell you his party wants to nominate you for President of the United States, but you're not really surprised.\\"...the fact was that that idea [of the dinner party] appealed to me. It would be a new experience and should increase my knowledge of human nature. It might also be a bit ticklish, and even dismal, but it would be interesting to see how they handled it. Not to mention how I would handle it myself.\\"Second dialogue, with another new character - an older very rich female snob, who neither likes nor trusts Archie. Starting with Archie:\\"Okay. I accept the invitation as a favor to your nephew. Thank you.\\"\\"Very well.\\" A pause. \\"Of course it is not usual, on inviting a dinner guest, to caution him about his conduct, but for this occasion some care is required.

Relax. I am fully briefed. Tact, discretion, refinement, black tie, seven o'clock.\\"\\"Then I'll expect you.

In the brownstone's kitchen, again, starting with Archie:\\"...and I would appreciate some suggestions on how I act this evening.\\"He snorted. \\"Act with women? You? Ha! With your thousand triumphs! Advice from me?

Therefore your attendance there will be an imposture, and you know it. I begin to doubt if you will ever let a woman plant her foot on your neck, but if you do she will have qualities that would make it impossible for her to share the fate of those forlorn creatures. You will be perpetrating a fraud.\\"I was shaking my head. \\"No, sir. You've got it wrong. I let you finish just to hear it.... And don't be so sure I don't meet my doom.

There are nice Wolfe-Archie tiffs, and a couple of fun Wolfe-women tiffs, as well as a few touching scenes, too. Great mature Stout, with many characters well-drawn.I close with the Archie quitting scene, one of several in the Stout canon. After a frustrating dry period, Wolfe had just given Saul an errand.

I was delighted to have found it on Amazon! It didn't disappoint - Wolfe, Archie, Fritz and Inspector Cramer were all there, in rare form, as usual. I read and reread my Nero Wolfe mysteries all the time. Rex Stout was a literary genius, using big words that I sometimes I have to look up, plot lines to keep anyone interested, and a large dose of humor. I would recomend this book, as well as any Nero Wolfe mystery by the incomperable Rex Stout."},{"Title":"CHAMPAGNE FOR ONE - a Nero Wolfe Mystery","review":"I am a fan of the Rex Stout's Nero Wolfe mysteries and think that Michael Prichard's readings capture all that is best in them. His individualistic voices for the Stout characters are right on target. His Nero Wolfe conveys Wolfe's unflappable superiority, his remarkable presence (and bulk), and his high IQ. But my favorite has to be Prichard's tongue-in-cheek, smooth-talking, sophisticated tough man, Archie Goodwin, the narrator of each tale. Prichard's reading of \\"Champagne for One\\" amply shows off his acting talents, as much as the intriguing plot and many characters demonstrate Stout's writing abilities."},{"Title":"CHAMPAGNE FOR ONE - a Nero Wolfe Mystery","review":"another in a series of simple, well devised Nero Wolfe mysteries. if you like the series this is a \\"gotta have\\"."},{"Title":"CHAMPAGNE FOR ONE - a Nero Wolfe Mystery","review":"I read all of the other reviews and was prompted to buy this book, because there was a consensus that this was one of his best books or the start of a solid string of Wolfe novels. The only problem with the other reviews I have is that none of them, really take into account the first time Wolfe reader. I found the dialogue and interaction between Nero Wolfe and Archie Goodwin very intriguing. It shares some similarities of the genius detective and his trusty sidekick. The difference being here that Archie is more the eyes and ears and the man about town that Wolfe is not. If you read Christie or Conan Doyle, then you may tire of the dolt of a sidekick who can never figure out in the slightest what the hero detective is up to. While Wolfe is the genius here, the story revolves around the fact that Archie is present to the supposed suicide of a young single mother that he feels is actually a murder. It is Wolfe's trust in Archie that commits him to the case at hand. Throughout the way the police and other parties try to convince Wolfe to give it up, but his intelligence and the resourcefulness of Archie and company find the truth. Truly an entertaining story and intriguing characters. It is clear from Stout fanatics that it is worth the read, and take it from a first time reader as well."},{"Title":"CHAMPAGNE FOR ONE - a Nero Wolfe Mystery","review":"This is Wolfe in his pomp. After a patchy time, with a few sub-standard stories during the early/mid 50s, I think that in this book, Stout established the key ingredients which he continued throughout his excellent later period. After Champagne for One, he never wrote a weak full-length Wolfe. Good plot- there's even a passable sub-plot!"},{"Title":"CHAMPAGNE FOR ONE - a Nero Wolfe Mystery","review":"One of the best of Nero Wolfe. I also recommend Some Buried Caesar, one of more light-hearted books. I read Rex Stout nearly 20 years ago and have just started re-reading them. I am enjoying them more the second time around that i did the first. the plots and characters are ageless! I can still laugh at the unique interplay betwee Archie Goodwin and Nero Wolfe, still envy the freedom of Nero's lifestyle, and still admire the plots. One of the great things about Rex Stout, is that (unlike some mystery writers that I could name), he doesn't hold out clues or keep secrets that the hero discloses at the end. He gives you the clues (sometimes tossed out in the middle of a paragraph). And sometimes, just sometimes, the reader get the thrill of solving the mystery!"},{"Title":"CHAMPAGNE FOR ONE - a Nero Wolfe Mystery","review":"This book is fast paced and gets to the point quickly and with style.

Mixing in with the horrors of death are the poignant story of a girl in trouble trusting philanthropists to take care of her, and the careless class of the wealthy who are indifferent to everything save their own public images. Engrossing and suspenseful, Champagne for One is a quick read that will leave you wanting to devour more of Rex Stout's wonderful Nero Wolfe mysteries."},{"Title":"CHAMPAGNE FOR ONE - a Nero Wolfe Mystery","review":"This is anything but hardboiled crime - more like light musical crime. An odd genre that has a murder as the central plot device, but we're all meant to be well aware that, like in cartoons, nobody really gets hurt: the victim will get up, dust themselves off, and be ready to be done in or doing-in in the next novel. The TV drama based around this series suits it perfectly, with the same cast taking turns in different roles throughout. Still it's an enormously popular style, so safe in the knowledge that we're deep in convention we can have a nice time playing in a situation that in reality would be awful.While Stout never goes over the top (which is why I stopped at a B - I smirked occasionally but never laughed out loud), the characters and manor of dialogue are not too distant from a Wodehouse novel. Stout's narrator is dryly humorous rather than ingenuously hilarious. He has his moments:\\"It is always a temptation to monkey with locks, and one of the best ways to test ears is to enter someone's castle uninvited and, while you are looking here and there for something interesting, listen for footsteps on the stairs or the sound of an elevator. If you don't hear them in time your hearing is defective, and you should try some other line of work when you're out and around again.\\"Nice timing - it's the sort of thing I'd expect to hear from John Clarke. The confident females we encounter sparkle in conversation, and most of the company is pleasant enough to be with. Stout makes the trip quite agreeable.He puts himself under a bit of pressure with the frequent references to Wolfe's \`genius' (I always prefer a writer to convince me of a character's outstanding attributes by their actions and dialogue rather than expecting me to just take their word for it that they're intelligent/funny/cunning or whatever), but part of the reason for this is he enjoys playing with the hierarchy and professional protocol of various detectives who enjoy sorting out their place in the pecking order, and need a grand master to aspire to.This is not fantastic or powerful or stunning - but it was never meant to be. Stout was a prolific professional writer turning out another workmanlike product in his justifiably successful franchise - this is hardly his attempt at a masterwork, but it is a solid, enjoyable light crime novel."},{"Title":"CHAMPAGNE FOR ONE - a Nero Wolfe Mystery","review":"No good deed shall go unpunished. Archie fills in for a friend as an escort at a dinner for unwed mothers and one of the mothers ends up dead. Archie is the only one who thinks it was murder not suicide. Will the police never learn? Nero Wolf steps in to straighten it all out."},{"Title":"CHAMPAGNE FOR ONE - a Nero Wolfe Mystery","review":"In this Nero Wolfe mystery, written near the end of the 1950s, Stout returns to his best writing (as exemplified by some of his earlier Wolfe novels, such as Some Buried Caesar and Too Many Cooks). In this book Archie must attend a party for six unwed mothers, one of whom, Faith Usher, carries around a vial of cyanide just in case she feels like committing suicide. During the evening, Faith dies: poisoned by cyanide in her champagne. Was it suicide? No, says Archie, who had been keeping his eye on Faith and her drink and her behavior the entire evening. Archie claims that nobody had any chance to put anything into Faith's champagne, and therefore she was murdered.The pressure for Archie to change his statement is intense. Pressure not just from those at the party, who don't want a scandal, but also from the police and the Police Commissioner. Archie won't back down, and Nero stands behind what Archie says. And then Edwin Laidlaw hires Wolfe to keep something from being revealed: that he was the father of Faith's child. So Nero promises to solve the murder case before the information about Laidlaw and Faith is revealed.A well-plotted story, with lots of Archie-Nero dialogue."},{"Title":"Around And About Buttercup Farm","review":"My mother had this book when she was little, and my children wanted a copy since my mom is no longer living.

Adams has been a newspaper writer, an FBI agent, a vice-president of commercial banks, and the head of a conservation agency. Adams said the settlement of the West was important in developing the American character. Western history needs to be better taught (p.17). If Americans were in the wrong by conquering the Sioux so too the Sioux by conquering other tribes earlier (p.18). The occupation of the plains was inevitable, but human nature prevented a better solution. [Most people get their history from Hollywood drama and other fictions with a hidden agenda.] Horses and firearms changed the way of life for the Sioux in the 18th century (Chapter 1). The settlement of the plains was made possible by the mechanical reaper of Cyrus McCormick and John Deere's plow (pp.28-29).The Kansas-Nebraska Act began the settlement of the West as it was necessary for a trans-continental railroad. The economics of the Sioux tribes is explained on pages 63-64. Chapter 3 explains how the Civil War was followed by the Sioux uprising in Minnesota. The indiscriminate attacks on Indians caused them to band together (p.100). Chivington's attack at Sand Creek created a common bond among the Plains Indians (p.105). The Sioux made the Cheyenne their allies by threatening to attack them. The warfare had high costs compared to a peaceful settlement (p.155). But many Indians refused to give up their traditional way of life. Chapter 9 tells of life as a Sioux Indian. They lived in the present, always with danger (p.211).Chapter 13 tells of the Sioux's greatest victory in June 1876. General Sheridan had underestimated the numbers of Sioux and Cheyenne warriors, and Crazy Horse led them in massed attacks, a new tactic. Crook was repulsed, Custer and his men were slaughtered. The large concentration of Indians was very unusual, they did not have the supplies (p.314). The Indians set fire to the grass to deprive their foe of fodder. The Indians fought for their traditional way of life, based on buffalo hunting. Scarcity affected their outlook. Nelson Miles used the telegraph and telephone to impress the Indians with the power of the Americans (p.347). Sitting Bull and his followers surrendered in 1881 (Chapter 16). They would become farmers (p.352). A new treaty was signed in 1889. Sitting Bull was killed while resisting arrest by the Indian police (p.363).There is a selection of photographs on pages 365-382. The steamer \\"Far West\\" was about 30 feet in the beam and about 110 feet in length (p.367). The 'Notes' explain each chapter (pp.385-422). The 'Bibliography' lists the most important sources (pp.423-431)."},{"Title":"The Deep","review":"This combines Winton's knowledge about kids with his love of the ocean.

It does so, while giving one a little flavor of what India was like in the early days of the British East India Company. The reader will befriend Jason Savage, and the women he loves. There's enough \\"action\\" for most tastes; but the author does more: he takes us inside the mind of Jason and we see the drama of a young man building his own character, with the twists and turns involved.The only reason I give it a 4-star, rather than a 5, is that the author is unable to articulate an ultimate goal for his adventurous hero.

Quantum non-locality is not rare and does not disappear. The Universe operates according to the principles of complementarity at all scales - Kafatos and Nadeau established the particulars of this verity with extraordinary adroitness in their watershed book &quot;The Conscious Universe.&quot; The concept of non-locality as an implicate attribute of the material world is borne out by three pieces of impeccably documented science which are only now becoming generally known. Nicolas Gisin and his colleagues at CERN proved that Bell's predictions regarding non-locality were precisely correct. The positron-electron pairs they separated with a Potassium Niobate crystal and shunted through 15 kilometers of fiber optic cable, automatically re-oriented spin and polarity instantaneously to maintain net-spin values of zero when one of the particle-pair was accelerated through an electromagnetic field, to seven decimal points, in repeated trials. The effective rate at which the information transfer occurred between the particles is calculated to be at least 10 to the nine times faster than the speed of light. Second, Vladimir Poponin has demonstrated in his work with the DNA Phantom Effect that every molecule of DNA exerts a non-local field effect on the material locale surrounding it, which persists for up to 30 days after the DNA molecule source has been removed. The importance of Poponin's work is that it proves unequivocally that among living organisms, non-locality operates simultaneously with chemo-synaptic neuronal processes at all scales and in all living things. Finally, Donald Eigler's work at IBM's Almaden Lab's proves that non-local holographic field effects operate in all things as an intrinsic attribute of matter at atomic and sub-atomic scales, regardless of whether the materials are organic or not. In &quot;The Non-Local Universe,&quot; Kafatos has simply opened the lid to this Pandora's box by providing an epistemological model which is carefully thought out, clearly articulated and reasonably constructed. His model is absolutely right on the mark and deserves to be read by anyone who is willing to look at this aggregation of unimpeachable evidence with clear scientific detachment."},{"Title":"The Non-Local Universe: The New Physics and Matters of the Mind","review":"Even though I found Nadeau and Kafatos' The Non-Local Universe&quot; a challenge to absorb, I couldn't put it down. In this book, the authors do much more than just rehash some much pondered over points about the implications of the Gisin and Aspect experiments that verified Bell's Theorem. For those of you who haven't checked out what's happening in modern physics in the last 50 years or so, &quot;The mathematical statement derived by Bell in his theorem is known as Bell's inequality, and it is predicated on two major assumptions in local realistic theories-locality and realism.&quot; (p. 69) Aspect and then Gisin figured out a way to measure paired subatomic particles which refuted the locality assumption. Although Nadeau and Kafatos never make this exact point, one way to understand the refutation of localism is that in their wave structure, subatomic particles are extended infinitely throughout space and time (highly improbable, but nevertheless finitely probable). Hence in this sense, every particle/wave overlaps every other particle/wave and therefore, &quot;We are all connected.&quot;Nadeau and Kafatos are at great (sometimes, too great) pains to show how slowly and laboriously many physicists have given up the assumption that mathematical models of external reality can have a one-to-one correspondence with that reality. They even imagine Einstein still living and contemplating the Aspect experiments, agreeing that he was wrong and Bohr was right. They spend a comparable amount of effort in painting a non-picture of our non-local universe, as their book title might imply. The reason I say &quot;non-picture&quot; is the fact that a central point of theirs is that we can not adequately visualize a more than three-dimensional universe. While the &quot;non-picture&quot; that they paint is at times fuzzy and not well worked out, a mere blueprint for further investigations, they propose that it is free of metaphysical assumptions (including the one-to-one correspondence theory).In other chapters in their expansive book of modest size (240 pp.), they trace literature that rejects the narrow Darwinian interpretation of evolution and replaces it with an ecological view of the earth's biota as a self-regulating organinism (Ch. 6), trace the evolution of humans as symbol-using creatures and the emergence of self-consciousness, not as isolated in a separate mental realm, but rather as &quot;[deriving] its existence from embedded relations to [the larger whole of biological life]. (Ch. 7,.p. 144) and offer a critique of classical economic theories, showing how building an economic theory using the emerging ecological paradigm can account for and ameliorate overproduction based on a solely competitive model. (Ch. 10)One of the threads of insight woven through each of these chapters is what Nadeau and Kafatos call the &quot;logic of complementarity.&quot; They are building on Bohr's conception of the complementarity of wave and particle. One of the implications of Quantum Theory is that a complete view of subatomic structure must rely on its being viewed as both wave-like and particle-like. When subatomic structure is not being observed it is wave-like, when it is being observed, it is particle-like. We also see in Einstein's general theory of relativity the complementary nature of time and space. They suggest &quot;that the logic of complementarity could be the logic of nature and that the use of this logic as a heuristic could serve to better explain the character of other profound oppositions in the natural process.&quot; (p. 103)In various places in their book, they also trace the history of Western philosophical and scientific thought leading up to, through, and beyond Bohr's Copenhagen Interpretation of Quantum Theory, and they trace the development of the Postmodernist movement as a reaction to the Classical Realist metaphysics implicit in much of earlier math and physics. In doing so, they are really trying to solve a communication problem for academics in C. P. Snow's two camps: &quot;Another of our large ambitions here is to demonstrate that our new understanding of the relationship between parts and wholes in physical reality can serve as the basis for a renewed dialog between the two cultures of humanist-social scientists and scientists-engineers.&quot; (p. 13)In tracing the Postmodernist literature from roots in Nietsche and Husserl to more contemporary writers like Lacan and Foucault, they identify three major assumptions of Postmodernist metatheory and assert that &quot;the resulting view of human consciousness is an extension of Cartesian dualism and not in accord with our current scientific world view.&quot; (p. 165) Nadeau and Kafatos in no way intend to denigrate the work of the postmodernists, which they say &quot;has, in general, made us a more humane society and served as a source of liberation for large numbers of individuals.&quot; (p. 164) Their point is rather that &quot;since the postmodern view of the relationship between mind and world is one of the primary sources of our contemporary dispair and angst, the prospect that it could be displaced by an alternate and much more positive view is certainly worth considering.&quot;Toward the end of the book, they sketch Capra's &quot;ecological world view,&quot; which is distinguishable in terms of five related shifts of emphasis, and &quot;which is entirely consistent with the understanding of physical reality revealed in modern physics.&quot; (p. 213) Here is a sketch of the core of this idea: 1) properties of parts must be understood as dynamics of the whole, 2) every structure manifests a fundamentally dynamic web of relationships, 3) human observers and their processes of knowledge must be embedded in knowledge descriptions, 4) phenomena exist as mutually consistent relationships; knowledge is an interconnected network of relationships founded on self-consistency and agreement with fact, and 5) the whole constituting webs of relationships cannot be represented by our necessarily approximate descriptions.I can tell you this much about &quot;The Non-Local Universe.&quot; Even though I had a passing acquaintance with the writings of visionary physicists, before I read this book, I felt like a body trapped in a time sequence. Now I have a different view of myself, connected to other beings and to the Universe, past, present and future...."},{"Title":"The Non-Local Universe: The New Physics and Matters of the Mind","review":"If Albert Einstein had lived long enough to witness the results of Alain Aspect's experiments at the University of Paris-South in 1982 he would have had to concede that quantum theory is a self-consistent theory and physical reality is non-local. The Aspect experiment, and the 1997 Nicolus Gisin twin-photon experiments, validated John Stewart Bell's non-locality theorem to a substantial distance. These experiments confirmed that the physical universe is holistic and indeterminate, a fact that many physicists call the most profound discovery in all of science.This is the premise of a thoroughly enlightening book by Nadeau and Kafatos, who by virtue of clear and concise writing, entice the reader into taking a journey into the new world of non-locality. The authors state that in order to embrace their premises one must be committed to metaphysical and epistemological realism. Metaphysical realism assumes that physical reality is real or has an actual existence independent of observation, and epistemological realism assumes that progress in science requires strict adherence to scientific methodology. This seems to be a bit of an inconsistency since one of the main premises of their book is that metaphysical realism is invalid.Einstein, who was himself a contributor to quantum theory, and whose theory of relativity demonstrated that space, time, and motion are relative concepts, was none-the-less not ready to give up on the idea of deterministic principles and objective reality. His debates with Bohr concerning whether quantum theory was a complete theory was never settled during their lifetimes. In his most famous thought experiment, called EPR, devised with the help of two colleagues, he made his most brilliant effort to once and for all put the matter to rest by saving classical causal reality. The purpose of EPR was to show that both the position and momentum of a particle could be deduced in violation of the indeterminacy principle making quantum theory incomplete.John Stewart Bell sounded the death knoll to any hope that Einstein could be correct in his effort to save objective reality. Bell's theorem is predicated on two major assumptions: Locality (signals or energy transfers between regions separated in space and time cannot occur faster than the speed of light) and realism (physical reality exists independently of the observer). As Nadeau and Kafatos put it, both of these assumptions may be invalid. While Bell's theorem in no way violated Relativity's ban on information traveling faster than light speed, it did clearly demonstrate that there is an indeterminate and instantaneous connection between systems. Since the connections are indeterminate and subject to the laws of probability, there is no way to transfer information in a meaningful way under these random circumstances; therefore, Relativity itself remains intact. Bell's theorem clearly proved that realism could not exist at the deepest levels or reality. Quite simply, if nonlocality is a fact of nature, indeterminacy is also an indisputable fact of nature.The demise of realism also puts to rest the paradox of the well-known Schrodinger Cat Experiment. Since there is no one-to-one correspondence between physical theory and reality, and, since only measurement or observation determines reality as Bohr clearly maintained, we cannot assume that systems, either the particle or the cat, have any reality in the absence of measurement. Therefore, nothing can be said about \\"the cat in a state of limbo.\\" Since no measurement has been made, there exists no reality to this unobserved situation.Despite the fact that realism has been shown to be invalid, Cartesian dualism, the reigning scientific paradigm since the seventeenth century, remains steadfast among many scientists today. Dualism has found form in the post-modern rationalist ontology of positivism. Adherents of this philosophy believe that certain truth about physical reality resides only in the mathematical description, and contend that a one-to-one correspondence exists between every element of physical theory and every aspect of the reality it describes.Neither dualism nor positivism can be considered valid in light of the new reality of nonlocality for a variety of reasons: First, as we noted earlier, the positivist contention of an objective reality is inconsistent with principles of indeterminacy. Physical laws and theories have no independent existence and are human creations useful only in coordinating observations with experience. By definition, an objective reality suggests a consciousness separate and distinct from the rest of reality. This arbitrary distinction is invalid in a holistic universe. If nonlocality is a property of the entire universe, then we must also conclude that an undivided wholeness exists at the most primary level of physical reality.Second, science can claim knowledge of physical reality only when the predictions of a physical theory are validated by experiment. In a non-local universe the indivisible whole cannot be measured or observed, and nothing can be said about the character of this reality. Quantum systems it seems behave in such a holistic state. The wave and particle are the total reality of the situation--they are complimentary. The system is determinate when left alone, but upon observation it behaves indeterminately according to the laws of probability. Only one aspect of the whole can be observed at any one moment in time. Interestingly, as science has progressed in this century, more and more complementarities have been found. In special relativity, mass and energy as well as space and time were found to be complimentary; in mathematics real and imaginary numbers are complimentary; in biology, Bohr himself realized that organic and inorganic matter are constructs that need to be applied in a complementary way to describe the phenomenon of life. Life appears to be holistic, as any attempt to isolate its parts for scientific study tends toward a reductionist approach which only makes for inconguencies in the study of the whole. The whole is not built from the parts; rather, the whole bifurcates into the parts. This new understanding of the relationship between part and whole in biology mirrors nonlocality in physics.The authors conclude by making the philosophical argument that since consciousness is an emergent process of the brain, and the brain, in turn, is an emergent process of the undivided whole, it is not unreasonable to believe that the universe is conscious."},{"Title":"The Non-Local Universe: The New Physics and Matters of the Mind","review":"This book is far superior to such popularizations as &quot;The Tao of Physics.&quot; It is clearly written, is not tendentious, and modest in its proposals. What is really refreshing is their sticking so closely to a really realistic epistemology.

For one who IS a metaphysician it is refreshing to see they do NOT make moves in that direction but stay within the limits of their own discipline."},{"Title":"The Non-Local Universe: The New Physics and Matters of the Mind","review":"I am not a scientist. I have never read clearer explanations than in this book about the Michelson-Morley experiements, or the Double-Slit experiment, or Bohr's atom, or finally, the concept of non-locality. If you are a fan of Michio Kaku, or John Gribbin, or Brian Greene, et. al., and if you are patient and work hard, you will love this book. But the authors, unlike Gribbin and Greene, do unfortunatly use the proverbial turgid prose. They never use a one-syllable word when a four syllable word will do. They would be an English teacher's nightmare. I could easily see them describing a &quot;cow&quot; as a &quot;lactating bovine mammal.&quot; In the end, though, their ability to teach is so strong, their exposition (if not their prose) is so clear, I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"The Non-Local Universe: The New Physics and Matters of the Mind","review":"Enticing and most suggestive work connecting the recent 1997 empirical confirmation of nonlocality suggested by Bell's theorem, and the realm of both biology and postmodernism. The author's begin by suggesting the classical problem of Cartesian dualism is to be resolved by this new view of mind in relation to physics. While there is certainly a gateway to a new perspective on this tragic division, it is not clear how the broader confusions of ethics and values can enter either the classical or postclassical views of physical systems, yet the basic insight seems fruitful indeed on the way to a new synthesis. The book weighs in with Bohr's Copenhagen perspective resolving the long debate with Einstein. The book then proceeds to a provocative consideration of the limitations of current Darwinian theory, still enmeshed in the classical paradigm, concluding with a hope this new unification will help to heal the two cultures divide. I am always left to wonder quizzically at renewed hopes of finally bridging the Cartesian divide, for the problem is in part one of false terminology, and the lack of self-perception, more than self-division. The great Indian 'metaphysics' of Samkhya never had this problem because instead of two entities, it had three, all material. The division of mind and matter is a confusion of terms, and thus not open to solution by physics, a most debatable point itself, to be sure. None of this really negates the very fruitful connection now shown between mind and physical reality demonstrated in the new physics. Excellent book, one way or the other. May be read Kant also.

Thank goodness for the Undivided Universe and thinkers like David Bohm, B.J. Hiley as well Jack Sarfatti exploiting the potentials of nonlocality. These new frontier thinkers have scouted a universe that will allow Nadeau and Kafatos to expand on the very fine work recorded in this book. The matters of spirit are in this book and the authors bravely respect the connectivity of this massless domain to the manifestations of participative science, religion and mind. In this book you cannot miss the concept, time came before creation and the emergence unfolding in this whole undivided process was guided by a wonderful observer. The good news is this book is very informative, accurate and expandable. When the insights of Bohm are fully unfolded in the next addition we will have discovered the potential of the wheel once more.

One of the best written and most enthralling books on physics, history, and the philosophy of science. A must read."},{"Title":"The Non-Local Universe: The New Physics and Matters of the Mind","review":"Einstein said that \\"the most incomprehensible thing about the universe is that it is comprehensible\\". In \\"The Non-Local Universe\\", Robert Nadeau and Menos Kafatos reverse this dicta. They basically argue that it's quite comprehensible that the universe is ultimately incomprehensible.Once upon a time, as their tale goes, Newtonian and Cartesian thinkers imagined a world acting within a set of unchanging parameters extending infinitely across time and space, being perceived through a consciousness existing in an absolutely different realm. Einstein eventually tossed aside the universal measuring sticks, but still allowed local reference points from which phenomenon was objectively \\"relative\\". So long as you accepted that your reality was bounded by the speed of light, you still had something to hold on to. But then came those pesky, unpredictable quantum behaviors dragged up from the micro world, and even local relativity started losing its grip. Just as that was happening, ironically, the neuroscientists started proving that much of our seemingly absolute conscious awareness is grounded in this increasingly wiggly realm of particles and forces.The final nails in the epistemological coffin, according to Nadeau and Kafatos, were recently driven by a series of experiments confirming the non-local nature of quantum relationships (i.e., through infinitely fast reactions). Even though we in the macro-world cannot exploit these relationships to convey information faster than the Einsteinian light-speed limit, they do imply that every particle of matter and energy in the universe (including dark matter and energy) interact instantaneously in the fashion of a universal web. As such, there are no real yardsticks or reference points. There's nothing unchanging from which to measure and describe anything else. Everything observed is unique, with little relevance to what might have been observed just a micro-second before or what will be seen a micro-second later.Well, that's quite a bold conclusion. Few other scientists or philosophers seem ready to go this far regarding the epistemic and ontological implications of quantum non-locality. But this book is plainly not New Age quackery (although it could ultimately be described as a more grounded form of\\"What the Bleep Do We Know?\\"). Being intellectually honest, Nadeau and Kafatos warn you when they cross the border from accepted scientific paradigms to metaphysical speculation. They admit that their attempt to apply the lessons of quantum non-locality to biology, economics, ecology and mental dynamics is \\"heuristic\\" in nature. They fully respect the ways and presumptions of science, but want to elevate the reader above the trees in search of the forest. In attempting to doing so, they point out that some of the stuff coming from the quantum physics labs might ultimately contradict and eventually undermine those presumptions. Yikes, then what?This is big thinking, and I give the authors much credit for going out on a limb. Unfortunately, the huge sweep of this book ultimately dilutes it; it is too small, too weakly organized, and too blandly written to effectively convey all of this to the interested lay person. The basic explanations of quantum physics and non-locality are not the clearest I've seen (Nick Herbert's\\"Quantum Reality\\"does a better job). The authors do somewhat better in discussing evolution and DNA. But in attempting to tie-in chaos theory and emergence concepts, as well as post-Cartesian philosophical and neuro-psychological thinking regarding the realm of mental life, they eventually bog down. (Their brief attempt to reconcile post-modern deconstructionism a 'la Derrida is truly a quest for the bridge too far). If you are like me, i.e. not a polymath with an IQ of over 200, it gets difficult after a while to keep connecting the dots.But you still want to! The authors raise a lot of questions that may never have otherwise occurred to you. As such, this book might be seen as a cross between Fritjof Capra's\\"Tao of Physics\\"and E. O. Wilson's\\"Consilience\\"(both mentioned by Nadeau and Kafatos). To their credit, the authors resist both Wilson's scientific triumphalism and Capra's claimed victory of the mystical East. But especially with regard to \\"matters of the mind\\", they leave you at an epistemological wall. Their lovely questions may never be fully answered. Through the Copenhagen Interpretation, Heisenberg uncertainty and non-locality (the Holy Trinity of an age of indeterminacy), science may have finally caught a glimpse of its limits. This could be compared to what happened to mathematics a century earlier when it lost its struggle to ground itself in universal logic, as Russell, Godel and others floundered in the swamps of self-referential paradox. (This book offers a surprisingly good explanation of Russell's \\"set of sets\\" problem, even though it leaves you short regarding the \\"quantum of action\\" and other foundational quantum concepts).Sure, we can smile and say that all reality, including our own consciousness, has something akin to a wave-particle nature, and get on with our lives. Nadeau and Kafatos end the book on a note of social idealism, claiming that such enlightenment will teach us all to be more tolerant and far-sighted and kind with eachother. If you can't go any further with science, there's still plenty to do back in the world of human society. Admittedly, that's a noble and worthwhile thought. (As theologian Martin Buber says, the world is not comprehensible but it is embraceable.) And yet, one still wonders if there is some way out; e.g. will the umpteen dimensions of superstring theory or some other new concept open a trap door leading to another level of natural understanding? The hunger to bite the apple of ultimate physical knowledge will not be so easily sated."},{"Title":"The Non-Local Universe: The New Physics and Matters of the Mind","review":"Unfortunately this book propagates the same misinformation as many other bad science books such as &quot;The Tao of Physics.&quot; These books make a big deal about the nonlocality of quantum physics and about quantum entanglement and the experiments that have proved quantum entanglement. All of this is true. Unfortunately they mislead through omission. Nonlocality and quantum entanglement are very delicate and very rare events. A physicist doing an experiment has to work very hard to keep a quantum entangled system separate from the rest of the universe. Once the system interacts with the rest of the universe, the quantum entanglement vanishes. This is a well-known fact that all first year physics grad students learn. (I should know, I'm a physics professor.) So the whole conceit of the book is wrong. While quantum nonlocality does occur, it is actually very rare and disappears quickly--this is experimentally verified as well--and so the notion of a totally connected universe is a lie and a cheat."},{"Title":"The Non-Local Universe: The New Physics and Matters of the Mind","review":"This book describes the new physics of quantum entanglement and how human consciousness can emerge along with the natural world from the indefinite existence of quantum particles.

Those who claim otherwise haven't researched the realm of quantum physics or are frightened or put off by it's almost &quot;mystical&quot; like quality.

I agree with those reviewers who say that the authors never use one word when three could be used instead.That having been said, the underlying issues are fascinating, and some of the discussion so well-informed and thought-provoking (eg about the inadequacies of simple darwinism)...that it is worth the struggle. However I suggest that the book would have been far stronger if it had begun with the &quot;facts&quot; ie the experimental results explained extremely clearly...and moved onto a discussion of aspects of the implications of the &quot;facts&quot;."},{"Title":"The Non-Local Universe: The New Physics and Matters of the Mind","review":"If I lived in the USA I would definitely buy used at $2.25 if only to see how one can write about New Physics if one does not understand or even know 'old' physics; Nadeau otherwhere leaves out 1870-1907 which is comparable to the gap the French left in their defensive Machinot Line, called Belguim, through which the Mazi argument propagated itself in exactly the way that neo-classic economic thought flows through the gap identified by Nadeau by omission but not observed. It would have perhaps been fine if Nadeau had included the 'New Physics product description, given above, as preface for his later 'Environment Endgame' which every time I access I become ever more wondrous as to how such poor understanding of science can continue to propagate the naive idea that economic science is completely separate to physical scence; I want to be on his side but he does not allow that from his arguments. A good starting point for economists might be to address the physics question \\"Does wealth exist?\\" In classic physics if something exists it must be conserved. The philosopher is then faced with the choice: if wealth exists we cannot destroy it or that real wealth does not exist. In logic there is not a 'third way'. I would be most interested as to how this reality check aligns with New Physics, even if it agrees with ancient ancient. One could for example follow the neo-classic philosophy that wealth does not exist and we exist in what Soddy (1911) called a 'virtual economy'? We know in terms of virtuality that 'things'(2011) are not what they used (2008) used to be' - so how does New Physics explain this? If wealth however does exist it must therefore follow the laws of physics to which, as Soddy observed, credit was the only exception in what some perceive as the real economy.There is what I term the 'Bill Bryson Internet-lite' methodology of historical science writing [the same style indeed as Lester B Brown applies to enviromental studies]and the scholarly intricate logic-precise methodology of, say, Georgescue-Roegen or Murray Rothbard on economic thought and legions of other proper philosophers. The Internet is not a substitute for understanding, undertsanding being a state beyond even peer-reviewed knowledge. On casual exposure I put Nadeau in the 'Bill & Les' school, if less sensational he is also less directional objectivity as in what is sometimes referred to as an 'armchair philosopher' a term I carefully use to avoid discrimination against anti-temperance groupings. When I wish to observe 'things' from 'within the box' I am sure as sure can be that $2.25 will learn me something good about quantum theory which of itself would not make me a cup of coffee in the real economy, that is while I await non-locality boosting {monetary deflation?] of my bank resources.

I quickly moved on to the other more accessible chapters. Chapters 2-4 describe what happens to the brain when it's injured and the types and degrees of brain injury. Chapter 5 introduces the diagnostic and predictive tools used by medical personnel. When Jessica's doctors told me she would be changed forever by her brain injury, I turned to Chapters 6-8, which describe, in lay language, the most common physical, cognitive, and behavioral symptoms suffered by survivors. Chapter 9, \\"How to Pick the Right Rehabilitation Hospital\\" lists the fifteen components every rehabilitation program should include.

Hilarious and outrageous (a famous scenerecounts the taping of a game show called &quot;What's My Disease?&quot;),the book is an example of Southern's keenly moralsatirical sense as well as of his crafted, elegant writing.Influenced in style by Southern's mentor Henry Green, &quot;Flashand Filigree&quot; adheres to Green's theory of fiction: &quot;If youcan make the reader laugh, he is apt to get careless andkeep on reading.&quot; Indeed."},{"Title":"Flash and filigree (A Berkley medallion book)","review":"I wonder if I read the same book as the first reviewer here? Couldn't have.The book I read alternated between being boring and self-consciously \\"avante-garde.\\" In defense of Mr. Southern, this is very much a first novel. Lots of characters, lots of plot and. . .it all goes nowhere. The characters, all of them, are selfish, self-serving neurotic a-holes. It was impossible to feel anything for them. Only the Latino gardener character was anything resembling human.If you're new to Southern's writing, skip this effort and go right to THE MAGIC CHRISTIAN---so much a superior book, it's hard to believe it was written by the same guy.

Fans of David's Cronenburg's _Crash_ will certainly consume this book in a single sitting... simply to follow the exploits of Dr. Eichner (who would have been a nice addition to the movie; I guess Cronenburg didn't do his homework). Southern handles this whirlwind, insanely paced novel with totalitarian precision and makes every word (regardless of how trivial the word may seem) count. Southern was doing the gig that Tarrantino is now doing in the 50s. Southern also is not fearful of the controversial and he boldly depicts the daterape of Babs by Ralph. The scene is trash, but, by God, Southern writes trash perfectly. Besides, scenes such as this put the bread on the tables of MacKinnon, and Andrea Dworkin (this scene would have fit nicely into Dworkin's theoretical manifesto _Intercourse_). The characters are unforgetable (in fact, they have inspired a few characters in some of the stories that I have written).

This one has an involved plot about the bloody 1956 murder of a society girl. Lis Benedict has just been released from prison after serving 36 years for the crime and her daughter, Judy, has convinced Jack Stuart to take the case before the Historical Tribunal. Some anonymous threats suggest that somebody doesn't want the case re-opened.The story kept me turning pages to find out what would happen next, so it was a good read. There are, however, a few downsides to this one. Ms. Muller spends a lot of space trying to give it a dark, mystical mood. What with all the foggy settings, mysterious shapes, foghorns in the night, and dark forebodings of PI McCone, the rather unsurprising ending is something of a letdown. Also, Ms. Muller is a traditional San Francisco liberal, which is her privilege, but she increasingly wears hers personal attitudes on her sleeve. The story would have benefitted from having forty or fifty pages of murky scenery and Ms. Mullers' soapbox preaching edited out. As it is, the story rambles here and there.That said, it was still good enough to keep my curiosity up all the way through. Good enough for four stars in my estimation."},{"Title":"Pennies on a Dead Womans Eyes","review":"This was a weird one for McCone, but the mystery was fully developed and as usual the author didn't give much away until the very end.It is not necessary to have read the other books in the series to understand this one, but the others are pretty good too."},{"Title":"Pennies on a Dead Womans Eyes","review":"In 1956 Lis Benedict, a wealthy socialite, was convicted of murdering her husband's young mistress, Cordy McKittridge. Thirty-six years later, she is released from prison and goes to live with her daughter Judy, who testified against her at the trial. The daughter feels that her mother may not have been the murderer after all, so she requests a re-trial in the Historical Tribunal, a group which tries to redress old wrongs. Private Investigator Sharon McCone is asked to help with the case for the defendant, which is being prepared by the All Souls' Legal Cooperative, where Sharon works. Fearing that the trail is too cold to follow, Sharon interviews anyone who had any connection to the deceased or the supposed murderer. Tales of love and politics rise to the surface and Sharon begins to piece together a theory as to the real murderer's identity. This book is very suspenseful and had me guessing the murderer's identity up to the end. As usual, there is a complex plot and Muller does a masterful job of tying up all of the loose ends."},{"Title":"Pennies on a Dead Womans Eyes","review":"After getting into Marcia Muller a few months ago I picked up Pennies, thinking it would be equally enjoyable. I was wrong, barely getting through half the book and then putting it away.

So descriptive that you feel as if you were there. Astonishing in afterthought to realize that Dr. Donelson didn't have one actual line of dialogue - no &quot;he said&quot; &quot;she said,&quot; yet it reads as if conversations took place. This is the type of book that will please any reader who likes well developed characters and swiftly moving plot."},{"Title":"The Persistence of Visions: Reflections on Living from the Classroom and Elsewhere","review":"We are all philosophers, consciously or not. And we all have visions, which we either nurture or let wither. Dr. Kellogg has written here a deeply honest and authentic account of his own search for deeper meaning than the practical, for a broader canvas than the personal. I read this fascinating, broadly informative, wide-ranging work with recognition of a fellow seeker. The gratitude he has integrated into his own habits of reflection was also mirrored in my finding of another visionary who values living for understanding as much as for effect.I share Dr. Nelson's chosen passion for science and technology studies, and his belief in the critical importance of understanding the meaning of accelerating technologies, of gaining physical wisdom. At the same time, he talks intimately of the need for understanding and making peace with one's interior states, of gaining what my favorite transhumanist mystic Tielhard de Chardin (The Phenomenon of Man, 1955) would call &quot;psychical wisdom,&quot; both of oneself and ones interaction with the wider world.I don't know if Dr. Nelson has read Tielhard, but I know he would recognize himself in that classic, as I have recognized myself in this wonderful work. Thanks for living your life as you have, for persisting in the chain of inquiry, and for nurturing our collective vision."},{"Title":"The Persistence of Visions: Reflections on Living from the Classroom and Elsewhere","review":"I live in Ireland and I picked this book up on a recent visit to Boston, Mass. This book is very wide-ranging yet successful in connecting its components. I liked the following points: 1 The necessity for Gratitude not only in the character formation of children but also in uplifting the adult intellect beyond the mundane. The comments on Henry Adams and the Cathedral of Chartres evolving from the intellects formed in the Middle Ages are inspiring. Books relevant to gratitude in children include James Stenson's Lifeline ISBN 0-933932-97-9; 2 The book has an interesting aside on Pierre Duhem whose roles as a first rate theoretical physicist and as a researcher of the origin (in the Middle Ages) of modern science are only now being recognised. This book is an introduction to The Limits of a Limitless Science by Stanley L Jaki ISBN 188292646-3 or www.isi.org; 3 This book highlights that we need to cultivate the virtues within each one of us in order to have order, reason and possible happiness in our lives. The 4 cardinal virtues got a positive mention out of the mouth of Marcus Aurelius's son in the film The Gladiator. This book shows that we are to seek Wisdom outside of ourselves. Like truth, it is out there to be found."},{"Title":"The Persistence of Visions: Reflections on Living from the Classroom and Elsewhere","review":"This book elevates teaching in American schools and colleges to a sacred art, by example as much as by the richness of its requirement that the reader sit up, respect himself or herself, and pay attention--because this MATTERS. To be Dr. Kellogg's student must be a rare and precious pleasure. No light reading, but in angelically clear prose, this is a personal and deeply contemplative suite of essays spawned by a lifetime of engaged teaching in science classrooms. &quot;The Confessions of St. Augustine&quot; and &quot;Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynmann!&quot; need a third to form a braid, and this book is it. Professor Kellogg, a scientist and philosopher as well as an outstanding and decorated teacher whose teaching range spans nearly every conceivable educational venue, is searingly honest and relentlessly probing. Like St. Augustine, this career teacher is a practical visionary, at times monastically lonely and at others ecstatically devoted, both nourished by aspiration and pressed by solitude into the most difficult questions. Also like St. Augustine, Kellogg finds eternal stuff in the present moment: even when he recalls another thinker, he develops and applies that other mind as part of his own universal quest, personally felt and embodied in his own experience. What could he mean when he says, &quot;That's so far off, it's not even wrong?&quot; His reader, encountering that quoted phrase, sees through to its origin, and on to its applications tomorrow, thanks to Professor Kellogg's consistently elegant prose and intricate, heartfelt argument. Not since the works of John Dewey has it been so clear that the teaching of any discipline elevates each human who will engage that enterprise honestly. This book, an endorsement of education in and for a democracy of vital souls, belongs on a shelf among the most elegant, heartfelt, and persuasive defenses of the union of intellect, spirit, and educational institutions, leaning up respectfully against _The Confessions_, and giving us all hope for the future as we take up and read."},{"Title":"The Persistence of Visions: Reflections on Living from the Classroom and Elsewhere","review":"I watched Buzz Kellogg write this book-that is, I knew him and regularly talked with him during its writing. It began as a commentary on his experiences and observations from his tenure as a classroom professor. It quickly grew far beyond those walls. The book is an intriguing process of stretching the readers powers of observation far beyond (and beneath) the levels and spaces we daily record. I am not a teacher and it this general aspect of Kellogg's book I found fascinating. This book challenges the basic assumptions and underpinnings of our laxidasical phlsophical approach to life. What really counts? Why? Where dose it come form? How does it accumulate and evaporate? What creates purpose and meaning? How? Why? How is it that humans relate and understand?Kellogg gently leads the reader through the transcendant and almost scared which surrounds and infuses our daily existence.What do I like most about the book? Yes, it is being stretched to consider facets, spectrums, and hues I usually don't take time to notice. Yes, it is gaining a clearer perspective on questions like &quot;What's the point?&quot; But it is also the way Kellogg writes. It is vivid, personal, conversational, and flows with the energy and effervescence that characterizes Buzz's oral conversation. The writing is alive. He was excited and energized to write it and that joy shows in every page."},{"Title":"The Persistence of Visions: Reflections on Living from the Classroom and Elsewhere","review":"There is a moment in our family history that we refer to with a laugh whenever we seek some grounding in today's go-go, hyperspeed, so-materialistic world. A casual acquaintance, a woman steeped in show business, dismissed one of my wife's preoccupations with the silly line, &quot;The real world is not just sitting around reading books, Sheila!&quot; In his elegant and thought-provoking new work, &quot;The Persistence of Visions,&quot; Nelson &quot;Buzz&quot; Kellogg helps us to overcome some of the anti-intellectual pressures of popular culture and to see clearly how age-old human searches for spirituality through storytelling can guide us toward a future we can mold -- at least in part -- for ourselves. As a professor at Sonoma State University in California, Kellogg writes that he has often &quot;heard of formal education referred to as the artificial antecedent to real life, or the real world.&quot; In fact, as Kellogg makes clear with examples he culls from conversations with students in his classrooms, there is no more valuable a role for us than taking advantage of the opportunities we can enjoy to try to figure out who we are and what we're doing here. In an era when so many people, particularly during this economic boom in America, seem to find reality sipping a four dollar cup of coffee while studying stock quotes, &quot;The Persistence of Visions&quot; offers a guide back to the reality we can seek through some self examination. And for me, there is an immediate practical application to the musings and lessons in Professor Kellogg's imaginative writings: his thoughts and interpretations, the quotes he brings to the pages from past philosophers, and his arguments for envisioning an exciting, productive future, all provide valuable cocktail party ammunition against the next mundane post-literate suggestion that the real world is not just sitting around and reading books. In fact, &quot;The Persistence of Visions&quot; ought to be on the must-read list of those seeking some help combating the assault of superficiality we face daily from the mind-numbing entertainment factories of the pop world. It is a reminder that one of the true values we can reap from today's wealth is the time to study."},{"Title":"The Removal of the Cherokee Nation: Manifest Destiny or National Dishonor?","review":"Everyone should read this about the early Native American History and their desperate fight to save their land and the country they knew and lived in.

This book has a great appeal to children because it is about animals and celebrates their many different traits. It also teaches the moral that everyone is unique and special in his or her own way, and that one should be proud of who they are. It is a story of a dachshund, Noodle, who gets one wish from a dog fairy. Noodle decides he wants to be a new size and shape, since being a dachshund he has short legs and a long body. The story is Noodle's quest to find out the best size and shape, and along the way he meets many zoo animals who all have different opinions. In the end Noodle realizes exactly what size and shape is best for him. This story was my mother's favorite book as a child, and my brother and I grew up reading this story with our pet dachshund.

For example, the book offers strategies for visual, auditory, and kinesthetic learners and the importance of using lesson plans that reach each type of student. Other ideas include memory strategies. Often children may be asked to simply memorize information (e.g. the 50 states), but may have difficulty simply memorizing or may forget the information after a short time. The book offers some excellent ideas (based on memory research) to help a child to put information into long-term memory from working memory. Other topics include Gardner's nine factor theory of intelligence. Once again, it describes Gardner's theory (which is an excellent one by the way), and offers suggestions in the classroom to reach kids with various strengths (e.g. musical intelligence) which are not consistently measured in traditional school curriculums on a consistent basis. The book begins with basic brain anatomy and discussion of left and right brained learners. The reader will probably find some new ideas to apply to lesson plans and in using these ideas may be able to reach more nontraditional learners."},{"Title":"Brain-Based Strategies to Reach Every Learner: Surveys, Questionnaires, and Checklists That Help You Identify Students' Strengths-Plus Engaging Brain-Based Lessons and Activities (Teaching Strategies)","review":"Diane Connell's \\"Brain-Based Strategies To Reach Every Learner\\" is a great resource for teachers AND parents!As a primary school teacher for 20 years, and now currently working as a consultant in schools with parents,students and teachers on how to switch students on to learn in a way that makes sense to them, I can highly recommend this book.

I have dutifully worked my way through most of Schine's other books, but she has never hit Niece-like heights again for me, until now. I'm a sucker for the Jewish mother/daughter schtick. I consider myself a gourmand of the genre, consuming great quantities and often disappointed. In She is Me, Schine draws the issues of three generations with a superb comic hand. The grandmother's dialogue is a bit trite, but I suppose it's a rare Jewish grandmother that has anything original left to say. Ninety years of compulsive talking can wear you out.I particularly liked the the way she handled the middle-aged onset of lesbianism. Those of us feminists who have watched female friend after friend joyfully embrace homosexuality for the past thirty years can't help but feel left behind. Heterosexuality starts feeling like an internal parasite you've picked up and can't shake. When I read the book, I knew only that the author's long term marriage had recently ended, but did not know the circumstances. But Geta and Daisy's suprising romance was so authentically written, that I figured it must have happened to Schine. And apparently it has. She has exploited this crisis with dignity (I don't know if her ex-husband agrees, but I hear he's gone even further with American Sucker). The male characters are thinly-drawn, but like the trite grandmother, art imitates life."},{"Title":"She Is Me","review":"Broadway, film and television actress Patricia Kalember gives a sensitive, thoroughly engrossing reading to this affecting story of three women.

Things were okay for the California based landscape artist as her spouse is a nice person, her work enjoyable, and she is at some distance from the other generationals. That changes after her father dies and Lotte demands more of her time especially since the Jewish matriarch learns she has a nasty facial skin cancer. Elizabeth, with her preschool aged son and boyfriend, has relocated from NYC to work on a screenplay of Madame Bovary.Greta loves her extended family, but would prefer less demand as she can only supply so much. However, the biggest issue to confront Greta is her deepest feelings especially after being diagnosed with colon cancer. She wonders about what she has done with her life and why she suddenly finds herself extremely attracted to film director Daisy Piperino since she has been a heterosexual from the moment she discovered boys.SHE IS ME is an insightful look at three and a fraction (Greta's grandson is only three years old) generations of Americans. Each of the key characters especially the trio of women is fully developed so the audience can easily distinguish what motivates each one. The support cast enables an even deeper look inside the prime threesome though the tale lacks any major relational conflict as everyone tries to be considerate of each other.

That changes after her father dies and Lotte demands more of her time especially since the Jewish matriarch learns she has a nasty facial skin cancer. Elizabeth, with her preschool aged son and boyfriend, has relocated from NYC to work on a screenplay of Madame Bovary.Greta loves her extended family, but would prefer less demand as she can only supply so much. However, the biggest issue to confront Greta is her deepest feelings especially after being diagnosed with colon cancer. She wonders about what she has done with her life and why she suddenly finds herself extremely attracted to film director Daisy Piperino since she has been a heterosexual from the moment she discovered boys.SHE IS ME is an insightful look at three and a fraction (Greta's grandson is only three years old) generations of Americans. Each of the key characters especially the trio of women is fully developed so the audience can easily distinguish what motivates each one. The support cast enables an even deeper look inside the prime threesome though the tale lacks any major relational conflict as everyone tries to be considerate of each other.

It's a charming saga of prehistoric peoples somewhere in California. Our heroine gets afoul of her husband for adultery, and decides to run off instead of facing the death penalty allotted to her. Her angry husband and his brothers follow her for weeks with murderous intent. During her escape we read of her many exploits trying to throw them off her trail, the birth of her baby alone in a cave, and how she manages to cross a raging river with the newborn. Always heading west, finally she's taken in by a coastal tribe. Meanwhile the coastal tribe has their own problems. The mammoth migration has declined in recent years and they are forced to look elsewhere for a home. The angry husband eventually shows up and a deadly confrontation results. I found the story readable. The battered wife, angry husband confrontation is a bit overdone. Do we really believe that he would spend a year and risk death to find and kill a adulterous woman who ran off and kept going? I didn't believe it. The disaster that befalls the coastal tribe is a little overboard too, but I guess it's almost believable. With those exceptions it's a good entertaining read for the hot tub on an afternoon."},{"Title":"People Of The Sea - A Novel Of Prehistoric America","review":"Pregnant and fleeing from her abusive husband, Kestrel is in grave danger.

Now put this story back a few thousand years into just post-glacial America and a whole new dimension opens up.My only problem with the Gears is that they always start with a scientific stance (the evidence of archeological digs and research) yet introduce fantasy elements such as real contact with spirits, witchcraft, possession etc that contradict the physical.

The Spirals crying out for WolfDreamer to save them and now knowing what became of Green Ash's(People of the River) son Born of Water was gutwrenching. You can relate to the panic the people must have been feeling watching their world change before their eyes, having mammoths drown themselves and forgetting what some animals looked like must have been unsettling to them. It also dosen't help that their best Dreamer has lost his way to the One and has fallen for a hunted woman.

The introduction is clear; the explanation of meter is advanced but insightful; the discussion of the Greek origins of the comedy of errors is useful; and the commentary is tailored to the mid- to upper-level Latin student. I used this text for an advanced Latin course and found it quite good. The single drawback is the play itself - its crafting, structure, and sense of humor can appear clumsy and foreign to the tastes of modern students."},{"Title":"Plautus: Menaechmi (Cambridge Greek and Latin Classics)","review":"Having just completed teaching this text in a course, I'd say there is one main difficulty. This looks like an old typescript done in courier font that's been put into book form. It would benefit from a reset of the font and a more readable design. Other than that, maybe an update with more recent articles on the play would be in order. I'll use it again, but hope Bolchazy Carducci will do a remake. Otherwise a very usable book."},{"Title":"Plautus: Menaechmi (Cambridge Greek and Latin Classics)","review":"This is a review of A.S. Gratwick's commentary on Plautus's Menaechmi for the Cambridge green and yellow series. This play is about a set of twin brothers who are separated as very young children and then reunited as adults after a long day during which each twin is constantly mistaken for the other, with highly farcical results. \\"Menaechmi\\" is one of the major sources and inspirations for Shakespeare's \\"The Comedy of Errors\\", and besides the play's extended, classic treatment of mistaken identities, it contains much of interest in terms of social history (e.g. discussions of Roman court procedure, the patron-client relationship, the symptoms and treatment of madness, and life in a thriving port city). I especially found the fraught interactions between both brothers Menaechmi and the married brother's unnamed wife, his father-in-law, and his mistress to be a very engaging and thought-provoking (if stylized and farcical) study of dysfunctional family dynamics.This edition contains a 63 page introduction, 1162 lines of Latin text, a little over 110 pages of commentary, a very thorough bibliography up through 1990, an index, and four brief appendices containing, respectively, an overview of the textual criticism on the play, a metrical conspectus, a discussion of Plautine prosody, and a statistical analysis of Plautus's senarius. Taken as a whole, this book is definitely pitched to a more advanced, professional audience, but I would estimate that a reader with at least 3-4 years of Latin experience would be able to read \\"Menaechmi\\" using the commentary with fairly minimal frustration. The commentator does an excellent job anticipating the reader's questions and translation difficulties, and virtually all of the tricky or colloquial Latin phrasing is rendered into very literal translation-ese. Besides making comments on textual problems and meter (see below), the commentator will also clarify obscure historical and cultural allusions, discuss lexical and etymological questions with reference to the OLD and other Latin authors, and make observations about the staging and literary qualities of the play. The introduction provides a very judicious overview of Plautus's career and his place (and the place of Menaechmi) in the development of ancient comedy, and there are occasional references and direct comparisons to other Plautine plays in the commentary proper as well.The most prominent and the most noteworthy feature of this edition, however, is the emphasis that is placed on metrical analysis and textual criticism. The discussion of meter takes up a great deal of space in the introduction, commentary, and the appendices, and it is the most complex, detailed, and polemical treatment of meter that I have come across in any putatively non-specialist commentary on a Roman Comedy. The Latin text itself is also printed with all short vowels, the onset of longa, and brevis in longo marked, as well as with line breaks and spacing that reflect the metrical properties of the text. I can lay claim to some proficiency in scanning the various Plautine meters, but, even so, a fair amount of Gratwick's discussion of meter went over my head. Gratwick's treatment of meter is thus something one can profitably peruse after completely mastering the basics, not before.I found Gratwick's philological engagement with the manuscript tradition of the play and with the textual criticism on it much more accessible than his treatment of meter (though of course the two treatments overlap to some degree given the importance of meter in establishing the text). Gratwick provides a detailed apparatus criticus and a critical text that reflects quite a number of his own emendations, conjectures, and editorial choices. Unusually for the green and yellow series and most commentaries geared towards non-specialist readers, the editor has chosen to leave a relatively high number of \\"daggers\\" and empty positions in the text rather than print a smoother text using overly speculative conjectures. Again, I am not enough of an expert to evaluate the validity of any of Gratwick's textual choices (which he discusses in detail in the commentary proper), but this approach does at least have the effect of allowing a non-expert reader to access, understand, and appreciate the enduring uncertainties and controversies that remain when it comes to establishing the text of \\"Menaechmi\\". This book is therefore one of those very rare non-specialist commentaries that can serve as a useful introduction to textual criticism, and for this reason, as well as for its excellent quality in other respects, it is an especially important and useful resource for anyone with a serious interest in Plautus."},{"Title":"Plautus: Menaechmi (Cambridge Greek and Latin Classics)","review":"A well-presented, scholarly edition, with copious notes, but the binding on my copy was old and brittle, and fell apart almost instantly. I managed to glue it back together, but with some difficulty, and with the break still being somewhat conspicuous. If you don't want to take that risk, don't get it, because I may not be alone, but if you should get lucky and get a sturdy one, it is marvellous, and the notes are thorough. It is not for the fainthearted, but then that could be said for Latin as a whole, so if you think you are ready for unadapted texts with more trouble spent on scholarship that pedagogy, go for it. There is no vocab section, so you will rely on a dictionary, or less, if you are really clever. If you want more of a beginners' edition, go for Lawall and Quinn instead."},{"Title":"Hanson-Roberts Tarot Deck","review":"The Hanson-Roberts Tarot is a lighthearted redrawing of the Rider-Waite Tarot by Mary Hanson-Roberts.The penciled artwork in this deck is slightly cartoonish, and the scenes are rendered much closer than the Rider-Waite tarot. The result is a tarot deck that even as being smaller in size, it is still easy to read, to study and to appreciate. Some of the symbolism had been traded off for the close up shots, which may be a turn off for some tarot collectors, but still makes it easier for beginners to use.Each card in this deck is labeled in five languages within a small white scrolls at the bottom. The English label is most prominent than the others, most of the time presented in the middle of the scroll. The Major Arcanas are numbered, starting at 0 for The Fool and roman numerals for the remainder Major Arcanas.This deck is recommended for those tarot collectors who like pocket-sized tarot decks.

I was just discovering the Tarot, and I was attracted to the artwork. I immediately fell in love with it. The images are beautifully crafted, the colors are soothing, and it follows the Rider-Waite tradition which makes it easy to study (since most books out there on the subject of the Tarot follow the Rider-Waite tradition.) I know there are \\"flashier\\" decks out there, and I have purchased some of those; but I've never felt the same connection to those decks as I do to this one, and sadly they just lay dormant in my closet.

The colors are appealing and the cards are not over sized so they are easy to handle and easy to shuffle. There is a little booklet that comes with the deck that is quite helpful to the beginner. The deck is based on the Rider-Wait deck so is easy to learn with but much more appealing. Looking at these cards, one can tell that Mary Hanson-Roberts put a great deal of effort into her artwork for these cards and it shows. I now own over a dozen decks and I have not yet found card whose artwork is as beautiful as this one deck. I recommend it for beginners, those more experienced with the Tarot, and for children--whose minds need lots of color and whose hands need smaller cards. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Hanson-Roberts Tarot Deck","review":"This was my first tarot deck, and will always be my favorite. As a novice, I found the images to be very descriptive and easy to interpret. However, as I progressed and became more adept at reading the tarot, I saw more meanings in the cards. They seemed to advance with me.Before buying any deck, I highly recommend checking out the images to see if it 'speaks' to you. But please don't gloss over this deck because it's believed to be a \\"beginner's\\" deck. The Hanson-Roberts Tarot Deck is a wonderful deck, for novice and professional alike."},{"Title":"Hanson-Roberts Tarot Deck","review":"Created by Mary Hanson-Roberts, this deck is a softer, less Golden Dawn version of the Rider/Waite/Smith deck. Drawn with a much larger palette and in significantly greater detail, the Hanson-Roberts deck is true to the symbolism found in the RWS, and is the best example of art for the sake of Tarot, as opposed to Tarot to show off the art. The colored sketches look of the RWS deck is a straight to the point, no frills approach. However, here Mary Hanson-Roberts has significantly raised the artistic aspect in such detail that facial expressions enhance the symbolism, making card interpretation even easier.An example of this would be the Seven of Rods, known as the Seven of Wands in the RWS, these cards depict defending the higher ground and the courage of convictions. This is not easily accomplished and requires tenacity and effort. In the RWS the face on the Seven of Wands is serious and certainly one of conviction.By contrast the Hanson-Roberts Seven of Rods subject is wincing against the onslaught as this is a mighty task and one must go deeper inside oneself than to the level of ones convictions if one is to hold the higher ground.Among the few differences, again by comparison to the Rider/Waite/Smith deck, is found on the Six of Swords. In both Hanson-Roberts and the RWS the subject is steering the boat from rough waters into smoother waters towards landfall. The boat being steered in the RWS has passengers, what appears to be a woman and a child, but the Hanson-Roberts card does not. It is unlikely that this was an oversight, but rather a conscience choice of perceived interpretation. On the one hand, moving ones loved ones to safety is certainly moving out of a stressful situation, but on the other hand the sight of one's homeland and escaping the fear that one might not get the opportunity to see loved ones again brings the interpretation into a more personal focus. Either way the symbolic meaning is evident and nothing is lost.The Devil card is the only image that could be considered frightening to younger users. Aside from that card, there is no visible nudity or other imagery that might be considered inappropriate for less mature readers. It is also available in a mini-deck version, just the right size for purses or backpacks for when space is at a premium. The deck shuffles easily, and the cards have a very nice feel to them. We use this deck frequently, and is certainly one that we would recommend for beginners, purists or collectors."},{"Title":"Hanson-Roberts Tarot Deck","review":"I have a number of different tarot decks (I collect them for the artwork) but this is the one that I use.

Being an unshamedly faithful Rider-Waite clone, any complaint about its lack of originality is moot. Anyway, once you behold its plethora of delicately colored pictures, you will not bemoan the cash you paid for this little beauty. Hanson-Robert's artwork may be sweet and simple, but it is surprisingly resilient too, in that her tarot images stand up well to repeated use --- so complementary and responsive to your intuition they are.I have never understood the accusations of \\"childish\\" or \\"cutesy\\" levelled at this deck by some professional reviewers. Hanson-Roberts certainly never minimized any of the darker imageries from the Waite-prototype. Her deck is definitely not for meant for use by young kids. It is a very competent Waite-clone; whose art-style just happens to mimic that found in children's fairy-tale books.This deck is a pleasure to use or look at, even if you aren't a die-hard follower of Waite-ian tarot symbology. One for the collection."},{"Title":"Hanson-Roberts Tarot Deck","review":"I recommend this deck to beginners and experts alike, whether you're getting your first or adding to a collection.

If you want a \\"standard\\" deck but you aren't thrilled with old style Rider-Waite decks, this is definitely for you."},{"Title":"Hanson-Roberts Tarot Deck","review":"Though many may be inclined to not take this deck seriously due to its soft hues: the traditional symbolism of the tarot is fully honored from the images presented to the backs of the cards. Even the intentions of the use of colors is properly honored- colors chosen to attract and hold the eye.The only 'failing' is the book- which can be a bit difficult for new readers though it would hardly be an issue for an experienced reader. The meanings can seem overly vague and varied to a new reader with no indication of how to link them...but this is a common fault to many a deck rather than unique to this one.In short: a very good buy as a standalone or part of a collection.

For instance the &quot;Ace of Cups&quot; shows a large gold cup overflowing with water. This to me symbolizes an abundance of love in a relationship.

These cards are absolutely wonderful as a first deck. The images are soft and nice to look at - and most of them have enough detail in the illustrations that a reader can slowly build upon the basics by studying the cards and finding more complex implications.I love these cards simply because they're pretty and they're very clear in terms of sybols and meanings - I often fall back to this deck to elucidate readings with other decks or when I need a more clear-cut answer to a question."},{"Title":"Hanson-Roberts Tarot Deck","review":"I own this deck for many years already; is very pretty and the images on it will speak to you easily even if you are a beginner. The more you study it the more this cards will make sense to you and the more you will see on it. I found it beautiful, easy to read and the images are just charming. I own several decks and this is the one I use every day. One of my daughters is already learning to read tarot and this too is her favorite because of the easy images to understand. Also the smaller size comes in very handy."},{"Title":"Hanson-Roberts Tarot Deck","review":"This is the best Tarot deck I have found and it was also the first one I ever owned. My parents brought me up reading Thoth and I thought that was the only deck to use until I found this little gem.The Hanson-Roberts deck doesn't have all the frills and extra symbols of most decks, and some would say that is a weakness. To me, it's actually the deck's strength. It doesn't bog it down with details that confuse the novice reader and the expert will probably own another deck that has the symbols anyway.This deck has wonderful energy to it. It's like a caring grandmother that wants to steer you on the proper path. She may ignore the bad, or understate it, but she always knows what's best."},{"Title":"Hanson-Roberts Tarot Deck","review":"This was my first tarot deck, and will always be my favorite. As a novice, I found the images to be very descriptive and easy to interpret. However, as I progressed and became more adept at reading the tarot, I saw more meanings in the cards. They seemed to advance with me.Before buying any deck, I highly recommend checking out the images to see if it 'speaks' to you. But please don't gloss over this deck because it's believed to be a \\"beginner's\\" deck. The Hanson-Roberts Tarot Deck is a wonderful deck, for novice and professional alike."},{"Title":"Hanson-Roberts Tarot Deck","review":"I originally got the Hanson-Roberts deck on a whim sixteen years ago. My momma and I had gone to a bookstore, and while she knew what she wanted, I didn't, so I just walked around browsing. I ran across a stand that had different tarot card decks in it. Curious, so I looked them over. Some of them were hideous, some made no artistic sense, and then there were these. This deck was amazing! The colors and pictures were almost of a fairy tale quality. Still, attracted to the cards, I knew nothing of Tarot except it was something psychics do supposedly. Just what I knew from TV or movies.Next to the stand of cards were shelves with tarot books on them. A lot talked about the tarot, but what I found most interesting were the ones that taught you how to read the cards. I was drawn to a book because of the fact that it used the Hanson-Roberts deck as illustrations in it. (Tarot Unveiled: The Method To it's Magic - awesome book to use in my opinion, especially for starting to read) So I picked up the book and cards and sixteen years later it is the only deck I use.I got rid of the deck some years ago, and decided that I wanted a deck again but was fretful that I wouldn't be able to find it after all this time. Amazon having it was wonderful, and at a great price too! They are the same mystical quality I remember. Beautiful. Worth every penny and more! So hence the title of this review: Still Awesome After 16 Years! If you are new to tarot, or advanced looking for something more magical, along the lines of fairy tales and less doom and gloom. Check this deck out. It truly has stood the test of time!"},{"Title":"Hanson-Roberts Tarot Deck","review":"I Really Like This Deck. First, Having Small Hands, I Love Petite Decks, A Step Down From The Largeness of Other Decks, For Example: The Rider-Waite Tarot Deck. The Pictures Are Beautiful As The Colors. The Only Downside I Have With This And Any Other Tarot Deck, Would Be That Eventually With Using Your Cards, They Are Just Like Shoes, THEY ACQUIRE A PRINT And Eventually Become Warped. I Would Definitely Recommend This Deck!"},{"Title":"Hanson-Roberts Tarot Deck","review":"I was introduced to the Hanson-Roberts Tarot Deck by a friend of mine during my High School years, and ever since I saw it and used it, I have loved it...and can't seem to stop using it in my readings. The first deck I ever owned was the Rider-Waite, and don't get me wrong this is a replica of the Rider-Waite; however, this deck is positive and happy, while in my opinion the Rider-Waite imagery is dark and the people in the pictures appear to be cold and the colors can convey a dark message. When I use Hanson-Roberts deck, it invokes peace and the individuals I have done readings on love the imagery of the cards. I love this deck #1 because it is simple with its imagery and symbolism, #2 the cards have a fairy and angelic like ambience to them, #3 they are small to keep in a pouch and shuffle in your hands and the questioners hands, and #4 its numbering is written out with the use of four different languages: Spanish, French, Italian, and German. So, not only are you giving a reading to others, but getting foreign language lessons at the same time. Also, when I first used this deck I have never used a book, my intuition/psychic abilities opened as soon as I began to use them. I recommend this deck to anyone who is interested in opening their sixth-sense, learning esotericism, beginners who are curious about the Tarot (without feeling frightened from the imagery!), and conducting positive readings for self and others. Enjoy!!! you can't go wrong with this deck."},{"Title":"Hanson-Roberts Tarot Deck","review":"I love this deck. Actually I own 3 Hanson-Roberts decks. 2 original size, and a small pocket size. Although Hanson-Roberts comes in a smaller size than most tarot decks, it does make it easier to shuffle. And the smallest size is just as dynamic. The readings are right on target. I also own the two books, the Companion book and Tarot Unveiled. Both were helpful in the beginning of my studies. Quoted from Tarot Unveiled \\"The cards in this deck have a certain magical and enchanted quality that many people find appealing. Its images are also faithful to traditional tarot symbolism. \\" I love the coloring of this deck, not as stoic as other decks, and not so frightening. A great deck for anyone new to tarot. My only negative about this card deck, it could have been a little larger, but then, it wouldn't be Hanson-Roberts. Would it?"},{"Title":"Hanson-Roberts Tarot Deck","review":"I've been a card reader for 25 years. The Hanson-Roberts deck has served me best of all. There is a clear understanding of the symbolism and the numerology of the Tarot in the make of these cards. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Hanson-Roberts Tarot Deck","review":"I have this deck, and it is by far my favourite. The artwork is gorgeous in splendid coloured pencils, the images are almost from out of a story book, making this deck a good one for young people who are interested in Tarot. The titles are in 5 languages, giving it a universal literary value and last but not least; by far the characters themselvse are some of the most enchanting and emotional I've seen on Tarot decks. Right up there with Rider-Waite, an appealing must have deck! :)"},{"Title":"Hanson-Roberts Tarot Deck","review":"I absolutely loved this deck. It is very easy to learn, especially when you get the book that comes in the set. The pictures are very eye catching. I would suggest this deck to anyone"},{"Title":"Hanson-Roberts Tarot Deck","review":"I really loved this deck when I first got it, but as I learned more about the tarot, it got a little to fluffy for my taste. It is a good deck for begginers as some of the others get pretty grim in their artwork. I could also see it as a good deck for pros with skiddish customers."},{"Title":"Hanson-Roberts Tarot Deck","review":"This is probably one of my favorite Rider-Waite-Smith type decks. However, it's a little bit too cute at times, with the round-faced, red-cheeked people smiling in so many of the cards. I use it quite a bit for readings for people who aren't familiar with tarot, because it's approachable and friendly-looking, but it has a tendency to sugarcoat the serious stuff. It's great for teaching someone to read tarot, because it's so unassuming, but to read for myself, I almost never use it."},{"Title":"Hanson-Roberts Tarot Deck","review":"The artwork is very pretty, and the pictures are certainly recognizable as being derived from the Rider-Waite deck. However, as some other reviewers have mentioned, some of the symbolism of Rider-Waite is missing. This may be an advantage for beginners, who might not appreciate being deluged by the intricacies of the earlier deck. Also, the deck is almost playing-card size, which makes it easy to shuffle. Personally, I prefer the pocket version of the Universal Tarot because it retains all of the symbolism of Rider-Waite in addition to having Hanson-Roberts' magnificent color revisions. In short, Hanson-Roberts is a good deck for beginners, but if one is interested in Waite's careful attention to Tarot symbolism, the Universal Tarot may be the way to go."},{"Title":"Hanson-Roberts Tarot Deck","review":"Out of the 16 decks of tarot cards that I have, this one is the most loved. When my original deck got destroyed due to my sister. I went out and immediately got it again. The illustration are soft, and the deck pictures are on the lighter side. Great symbolism and care was put into every image. This is a great deck for beginners, however more advanced users will enjoy it as well. I have used this deck for over 15 years and still I am drawn to it. Great size and shape for easy handling, card stock is a great weight too. Very sturdy for heavy usage.Great deck for study and pathworking. Has a very gentle energy. Even after all these years if I had to replace it again I would."},{"Title":"Hanson-Roberts Tarot Deck","review":"Anyone familiar with the classic Rider-Waite Tarot will feel right at home with this beautiful interpretation. This is my wife's favorite deck. My favorite happens to be the Universal Rider-Waite, colored by Mary Hanson-Roberts.Hanson-Roberts' use of color, and near-storybook-style illustration, is quite masterful.Overall, an attractive and charming adaptation of Waite's Tarot symbology."},{"Title":"Hanson-Roberts Tarot Deck","review":"i absolutely loved this deck, i found it through a site that a friend of mine pointed out, there were litterally hundreds of different decks reviewed and this one got raved about! of course i had seen it all before but when i looked at the photo she had included of about six of the cards from this deck i absolutely fell in love! and it just got better when i bought it. this deck is a must for anyone who prefers the traditional style of tarot deck, the illustrations truly do help to show off the meaning of the cards to their fullest extent, and it is easy to work with as well. the cards are easy to shuffle and the back design is completely reversible, and i love the way that the illustrator uses the traditional two extra cards as well, i had the \\"title card\\" blown up and made into a poster for my wall, the artwork is exquisite while staying well within the original tarot design"},{"Title":"Hanson-Roberts Tarot Deck","review":"I am very pleased with this deck. This is my first deck and I have been very happy with it."},{"Title":"Hanson-Roberts Tarot Deck","review":"Loved it. thought it was going to be bigger, but it turned out smaller than i thought. all in all it was a good product. loved the pictures too."},{"Title":"Hanson-Roberts Tarot Deck","review":"First of all this truly is a wonderful and attractive deck. I first received it from a friend in elementary school and horribly abused it after realizing I hadn't the attention span to memorize 78 cards... and in the end had a 54 card deck (I had thrown out the ones that I didn't like) and eventually lost them all completely. Now just a couple weeks ago my friend pulled out his new deck he just got, it was the Hanson-Roberts deck. The second I saw the \\"to all believers\\" card I was swept back to 4th grade. I bought it online that minute.This deck means a lot to me and I highly recommend it to beginners and people who don't want their eyes to explode looking at the originalRider Waite Tarot. This will keep your eyes quite content and un-exploded. Truly beautiful."},{"Title":"Hanson-Roberts Tarot Deck","review":"This is another great deck that speaks to me when doing readings. The artwork is more &#34;fantasy&#34; and the characters are &#34;closer&#34; to you, but this tarot deck is great. It is smaller than most traditional decks so it is easier to shuffle."},{"Title":"Hanson-Roberts Tarot Deck","review":"I have ventured away from my first deck and so I had to re-purchase this deck. I think it's one of the best, especially to learn on. I love the illustrations and think it's a perfect deck. She also has a whimsical deck out based on fairy tales and I love that one too but I am kind of partial to having the amount of cups or whatever it is IN the picture...the whimsical cups or pentacles are all on the sides. Perfect deck though and will always cherish it!"},{"Title":"Hanson-Roberts Tarot Deck","review":"this was my first tarot deck, i think it is beautiful. the best thing about this deck for me is that its a bit smaller than regular tarot decks i ve seen. i have small hands and so the larger ones are akward for me. these ones seem to be about the same size as regular cards, but the pictures are still beautifully detailed. it comes with a little book that tells you the interpretatins and layouts. this will be the second time i bought them."},{"Title":"Hanson-Roberts Tarot Deck","review":"This deck is the first I have owned. I am a frequent user of them and they have lasted for over 7 years. The booklet helps a lot with the Major and Minor Arcana. I would suggest this one to anyone, be it experienced or beginning."},{"Title":"Hanson-Roberts Tarot Deck","review":"This is the first deck I ever bought, and I'm still using it a few years later. The main reason I bought it was that I was looking for a deck with traditional imagery, but I was uncomfortable with the Universal Waite and similar decks because they seemed very dark and unfriendly to me (I'm not into wicca, so maybe there's something there that I'm not seeing). I don't think that this deck is necessarily just a beginner's deck, but for me it was a great one to start with. The images are friendly, and at the same time filled with meaning. It's easy to learn what each card means by looking at them. Overall, I really like this deck and I'll be using it for a long time to come."},{"Title":"Hanson-Roberts Tarot Deck","review":"My friends and I jokingly dubbed the Hanson-Roberts &quot;Happy Fun Deck&quot;. Indeed, the soft pastels and grinning cherubic faces on most cards are off-putting to folks who feel divining with tarot should be a very serious endeavour (my deck was a gift from a wonderful woman who was eager to be rid of it). I thought I would hate reading with it, but I was wrong. Instead of outgrowing it, I grew into it... and many years later, it's still my favorite by far.Don't assume that the friendly, approachable Hanson-Roberts cards are lacking in depth. Look closer. This Ten of Swords features a limp figure, facedown in a large pool of his or her own blood, with ten large swords sticking out of his or her back and dark storm clouds boiling above. It's a grim, gruesome card which doesn't merely suggest &quot;utter ruin&quot;... it's in your face about it. Happy Fun Utter Ruin? I don't think so. The images of the Three of Swords, Four of Pentacles, Five of Wands, Nine of Swords, Hierophant and Devil all convey the darkness and/or complexity of those cards in a way that should spark any reader's imagination and intuition. And when I turned over The Sun as a friend's &quot;final outcome&quot; card recently, I felt like it lit up the whole room. That's what The Sun card should do.Granted, this deck is pretty much a straight re-illustration of the Rider-Waite-Smith deck's symbolism, so if you're looking for bold originality or strict traditionalism, this might not be the deck for you. Also granted, deck selection is a terribly personal thing, and the Hanson-Roberts and Rider-Waite-Smith-based decks won't be for everyone. However, I would never have imagined that I'd love a deck like this. Be prepared to let the Hanson-Roberts surprise you, because it might."},{"Title":"Hanson-Roberts Tarot Deck","review":"The HANSON-ROBERTS tarot deck is by far my favorite of all the traditional tarot decks, because it has a \\"lightness of being,\\" fairy-like or angelic quality to it, while at the same time maintaining the integrity of the original Tarot symbols. People (especially children and psychic/sensitives) will likely find themselves instantly attracted to this deck because of the feeling of purity its illustrations are imbued with.Colorful and cartoonlike, each card's illustration still manages to convey even the most somber of moods, such as the lifeless solemnity of the knight's effigy resting atop a marble tomb on the Four of Swords. Other cards, such as Temperence and The Star shine with such radiance that one feels uplifted just to gaze upon their beauty.This is a Tarot deck to cherish forever as both a work of art and a divination tool to share with others -- especially those with sensitive natures."},{"Title":"Hanson-Roberts Tarot Deck","review":"While searching out a tarot deck that incorporated the traditional images of the Ryder-Waite-Smith themed decks, I was pleased to come across the Hansom-Roberts Tarot deck at my local store. While the actual card size---about the dimension of a normal playing card---is conducive to easy handling, what intrigued me the most about this deck was dual functionality of its depictions. At first, the illustrations may seem soft as if seen through rose-colored glasses or a diffusion lens, but upon greater scrutiny, the discerning viewer will note that each of the images draws with the strength of a magnet, enabling the reader to grasp the card's intent both alone and more importantly within the context of a spread as if it were an old friend whispering secrets.The minor arcana color palette---rusts, reds, pinks, oranges and browns for Rods and Pentacles, grey, silver, white and blue for Swords, and yellow, gold, green and blue for Cups----again allows the reader to achieve instantaneous recognition, while the major arcana positively sings with symbolism. The Strength card represents one of my favorites---an individual who controls through caressing and compassion rather than brute force. Even the more \\"sinister\\" cards like \\"the Tower\\", the Devil, the three of Swords, and the nine of Swords convey powerful yet palpable images that aid the reader to gain multi-dimensional insight into the overall message being relayed.If you are searching for a deck that depicts the historical Italian or Marseilles tarot - this deck will certainly not satisfy. Likewise with decks that carry a specific theme like the Goddess Tarot or Bohemian Cat Deck. However, if you, like myself like the Ryder-Waite-Smith depictions, and are interested in something with a whimsical gypsy charm, the Hanson-Roberts deck may appeal to you as much as it appeals to me. Recommended for those who like an artistically designed playing card sized deck with Ryder Waite Smith symbolism."},{"Title":"Hanson-Roberts Tarot Deck","review":"I must say this is the easiest deck to read and handle! The cards shuffle well and the backs are skillfully done. I really like the artist styling here as far as the fairy tale quality of the deck is concerned. Most other reviewers summed up my feelings. This is the only set of cards I literally wore out reading! I am now on my 2nd deck!I purchased this deck when it was first published in the 1980s. It was truly a breath of fresh air from the heaviness of the standard Rider-Waite of the time. Many clients would only have me read for them with the Hanson-Roberts deck. It works for most people because it is so fun to look at! The 7 of cups has always been my favorite card.If one is beginning, this is the deck I recommend the most! It is inexpensive and comes with a great reference book. I would also say get a copy of the Universal Waite to cross reference. It is beautifully colored by Mary Hanson-Roberts as well. Then after this set is mastered, the sky is the limit when it comes to advanced styles of decks!"},{"Title":"Hanson-Roberts Tarot Deck","review":"The Hanson-Roberts Tarot deck is a lovely deck which draws on the traditional imagery of the Rider-Waite deck, yet still has its own unique look and feel. The images are done in pastels, and are drawn beautifully with attention to detail from the expressions on the faces of the people in the cards, to the small details in the backgrounds which only assist in conveying the meaning and message of each card. If you read cards in an image-based method, rather than straight from a book or memory, this is an excellent deck. The cards themselves are smaller than what you would often find in a Tarot deck, and I find the smaller size (of about the size of a playing card) to be easy to handle.My first Tarot deck was a Hanson-Roberts more than ten years ago, and when I lost that deck after two years, I went through several different kinds, thinking I should try one of the more \`unique' decks out there. However, when I obtained another Hanson-Roberts deck, I found it felt just right.The Five of cups, for instance, conveys the sadness and loss associated in the spilling of the three cups in the forefront, yet the two remaining full cups are in a prominent place just behind the saddened figure in the card. The clear meaning of the regret of loss, and the message that there is still yet something to cherish is clear. A deeper look shows peaceful skies and a beautiful castle in the background...further evidence that the situation is not as dire as it may seem to the questioner.The Eight of Pentacles displays a workman, an expression of satisfaction on his face as he polishes a pentacle, evidence of his labours lay on the worktable before him. His clothing is that of a middle-class person, well fitting and in good shape, evidence of his hard work bringing his prosperity.The traditional imagery makes this an ideal deck for a beginner tarot reader, and the beautiful images and comfortable size may make this deck a favourite even after many years of experience with reading the Tarot."},{"Title":"Hanson-Roberts Tarot Deck","review":"(10 for artwork, 5 for originality!) This deck is stunning, fantastic, and aesthetically nearly perfect. The artwork reached right up and grabbed me by the throat. The only problem I saw with it is that it's really a general rehash of the Rider-Waite deck. If you know a younger person who is interested in the tarot, and has never read it before, by all means, send this one their way. If you've been reading the tarot for awhile, and have a R-W deck, skip it. There's enough originality in the art to make it pretty, but not enough new symbolism to make it worth your money."},{"Title":"Hanson-Roberts Tarot Deck","review":"I have been a student of Tarot for 20 years, with on and off degrees of absorption in it, and I have come across this deck numerous times. But each time I barely glanced at it, dismissing it as sugary and cute. That's all I heard from reviews and the like. Word of warning, decide for yourself!Just months ago I took the plunge and bought this luminous deck. And opening it up and slowly going through the cards was such an amazing discovery. Why this deck isn't all sugar-coated and \\"cute\\". Each card is artistically redone in a passionate and evocative manner. And stays true to the meaning and RWS. This is a deck that is deceptive. It may be talked about as if it shallow and full of cherub children, which is isn't, but in reality it is a deck with a lot of power to be heard in a loud and clear voice. It reads like a dream. The pictures are incredibly intuitive. The art is breathtaking, the shading is just gorgeous. You can spend many hours looking at all the little details.The size are just perfect as well! Nothing worse IMO that a huge bulky, hard to shuffle deck. It interferes with my ability to connect and bond with a deck. The Hanson-Roberts is just perfect. Also there is an even smaller version available (which I have).If you're looking for a more visually stunning and intuitive Tarot deck that is completely RWS based....look no further than this faerie enchanted mystical creation, you won't be disappointed!"},{"Title":"Hanson-Roberts Tarot Deck","review":"This is a very beautiful deck, but I would recommend it more for the younger crowd, and maybe even for children. I bought this deck, and noticed how child like and the feel of the tarot had a Fairy Tale feel to it. The deck was very beautiful, but for a 32-year-old father, it just did not feel write, so I let my pre-teen 11-year-old twin daughters look at them and see what they thought. They absolutely loved them. If you are trying to teach your child how to read the tarot, then this surely is the deck. There is no Nudity what so ever; every one is fully clothed. The only disturbing cards are nine of swords and ten of swords, which are clones of the Rider Waite. The Nine of Swords depicts a woman crying in bed, while the ten of swords shows the traditional man lying on the ground with the ten swords within his back. Besides those two cards, the rest of the cards are easy enough for children to grasp. Even the Major Arcana card number15 which is the Devil card, reminds me of one of those monsters fought on Children's cartoons like Dragon Ball Z, or Batman.The Art is soft; the cards are small enough and comfortable for smaller hands, about the size of playing cards. Everyone in the deck, with the exception of a selected few, is very young looking. One of my 11-year-old daughters really loves this deck.I have read various reviews on this deck, mixture between positive and negative. Though these cards are not meant for children, buy looking at its Fairy Tale feel of it, one could tell that children would be drawn to it, and it would be a good choice for parents looking for a starter deck for their children."},{"Title":"Hanson-Roberts Tarot Deck","review":"The Hanson-Roberts was the very first Tarot deck I ever purchased and I learned to read with it. Now after years of collecting and using dozens of different decks, the Hanson-Roberts is the one Tarot deck I keep returning to. It is also the deck I use the most for my personal readings. The artwork is friendly but deep in symbolism. The coloring is wonderfully rendered and pleasing to the eyes. The images facilitate accurate, detailed readings, inspiring intuitive flashes of insight. Even so many years after its initial publication, the Hanson-Roberts remains fresh and very appealing. This deck is excellent both for beginners and for anyone looking for a beautiful addition to their collection."},{"Title":"Hanson-Roberts Tarot Deck","review":"This is my deck, a great deck for artists, beginners, or anyone!The illustrations have a positive, feminine quality, although I think the darker cards are just as striking as in the Rider Waite deck or darker decks.This is a great deck for beginners, because it will draw positive energy to you, bring out honest emotions,and the symbols are classic, making it easy to understand & remember."},{"Title":"Woman In Mind (December Bee),a Play By Alan Ayckbourn","review":"Woman in Mind is very remarkable for its representation and misrepresentation of reality. In the play, Susan, a totally disoriented woman, finds herself entagled in a viscious web of existence devoured by reality and virtuality. The real world she perceives is composed of her husband, Gerald, a boring clergyman, her boring and inefficient sister in Law, Muriel, and her irresponsive, introvert son, Rick, along side with Dr Bill Windsor who is a substitute doctor for the towns original medic. The virtual world on the other hand is composed of similar presence: Andy, a much more colorful and lively husband than the real one, Tony, an easy going, flamboyant brother, and Lucy , a charming and sweet daughter, along side with Bill Windsor, the family's substitute doctor. Thus Woman in Mind is presented on stage as well as on page n two frames or settngs juxtaposed sde by side and sometimes superimposed on each other: the real and the virtual. In both of the frames there is the conventional, traditional family pattern. However, the only difference between the two patterns is that the real is much less colorful than the virtual. The first sordid family represents Susan's real world. A dull world inhabited by dull people. In order to escape this grisly world she creates a colorful family in her mind and begins to communicate and live with them. Her virtual husband, brother and daughter, unlike her real ones, care a lot about her, eager to please her and very sensitive to her needs emotionally and physically. So far so good. But then suddenly her virtual world, like her real one, begins to collapse. The loving simulacra she creates begin to ignore her commands, violate her privacy and take control over her real life. When she tries to resist them by trying to switch them off, she fails and her system crashes. This crash is manifested in the last scene when she no longer is able to distinguish between the real and the virtual,and all the world appears to her as a mutated virtuality.The most dangerous question the play poses is why Susan's virtual world collapses. A very simplistic answer is because reality comes first, and any rejection of reality is bound to backfire and lead to such conclusion. A very main stream understanding of a middle class British morality text. But is this all? No. Somewhere in the play itself Andy warns ,or may be significantly, points out to Susan that &quot;nothing is what it is&quot; Indeed, the significations of the events may not look as what they appear to be.In the text, Susan in order to escape her reality of family life and marriage entrapment, resorts to fantasy. In reality, as we are made to understand, she is mainly depressed because basically her sexual and emotional needs are not well met by her clergy husband and introvert son. So to compensate, she resolts to substitution. She creates a virtual verile, slightly younger than her husband and a doting daughter. This fantasy works for a short time and crashes badly.Her virtual reality fails because, in my opinion, she fails to exit out side the conventional matrix of every day existence. All she does to evade her conventional real life setting is to replace it with other conventional imaginary setting. The big catch that none of the play's critics and reviewers sees, lurks in this particular happening. Namely, the collapse of the unreal because it is structured exactly like the real.Reality is a fabrication of the mind, and if the mind fabricates another reality based on a previous reality that already is a fabrication, then the second fabrication, twice removed from the mind that fabricates, is usually less durable and less credible than the original. This is Platonic in essence. And when the mind starts living to the faint and indurable reality any thing may happen to it.I am not trying here to say that if the woman has devised a different, non-mainstream pattern of fantasy, such as lesbian, fetishest, she would have been much better off. We will never know. The text has been created, and what is done is done; not even the god-author can undo it.What remains to say is that Suzan's unreal wold's collapse is the author'sdeath sentence on conventional middle class family structure. The author passes this sentence twice in the course of the text. First, Suzan's real, worldy family is a flop. The term &quot;family&quot; is used because the English language lacks the expression to describe the lack of it. Second, Suzan's unreal family, inspite of its initial cheerful and optimistic appearance, turns to be a worse choice than the real, as it sucks and drains Susan's life force."},{"Title":"Woman In Mind (December Bee),a Play By Alan Ayckbourn","review":"I was in a production of this in community theatre, and it was a lot of fun. The concepts and language are certainly palatable for a mainstream audience, while the plot and characters provide plenty of meat for eager actors.The subtitle of the show -- \\"December Bee\\" -- refers to how the lead character speaks once she starts to go mad. She speaks English words, but for their sound similarity to what she's trying to say. \\"December Bee\\" should be \\"Remember Me\\". See if you can guess what the title of the review says.I've seen some other of A.A.'s play since, and this feels like his typical quality: interesting people and situations, with some kind of overlap to keep the audience on its toes."},{"Title":"Woman In Mind (December Bee),a Play By Alan Ayckbourn","review":"This review will not be helpful to anyone but me. I took a memorable girl to see this play. We did not really pay attention to the play. A long time later, I saw this book and decided to see if it was really good. After reading it, I realized that the special part of the evening was the girl and not the play."},{"Title":"Woman In Mind (December Bee),a Play By Alan Ayckbourn","review":"...Its about a woman named Susan whom while garden steps on a rake causing the end to him her in the head and knock her out. And from this point on we see her getting more and more dilusional and not even being able to distinguishing fantasy from reality or sometimes intermingling them. Susan no longer loves her husband, he's always to busy writing, they even sleep in seperate beds now. Their son hasn't talked to them(Or more so her)in years since he's been at some philisophical/religious institution. And also living in their house is her husband Gerald's sister \\"Muriel\\" whom Susan despises, Muriel is a terribly airheaded cook who believes her husband will come back from the dead for her.So now we see through Susans eyes and meet her dilusionally perfect family: Her husband: Andy, Her brother: Tony, and her Daughter: Lucy. Each is truely kind and loving, but have harsh sides to them.These dilusions were thus created as a need for love and emotions for Susan. She was feeling unsatisfied and she needed more then she had. Which at first she found in her fantasy family.Another character who comes in at the beginning is Bill; the Doctor.This shows the degeneration of modern families and to the extremes one may take to escape it and find the emotions that have once been forever lost in work. And the love and tenderness that has desinigrated and the fantasies created in longing for these things.This is a *GREAT* read, I definetely RECOMEND IT!!!*Enjoy*!God Bless ~Amy"},{"Title":"Jitterbug Perfume","review":"tom robbins writes like i feel. his work is pure joy, that of life and the world around us. be prepared to laugh and never take life for granted again."},{"Title":"Jitterbug Perfume","review":"Perfume and immortality may SEEM unrelated subjects, but after reading this masterpiece it is impossible to refer to one and not the other...

All hail the great individual Alobar and his gallavanting wife Kudra. And no doubt the great Pan and Bunny LeFever. Basically, this book is for anyone at all who likes having things set before them a different way--it poses some really interesting questions.(I.e.--CAN one refer to curtains as 'drapes'?

It takes you through generations of history and places as if it were a history book but wait. Then you add a brilliant story and loveable/hateable people.

Hehas helped me deal with &quot;reality&quot; and keep my &quot;sanity&quot;. He hasmore insightful sightings, and ingenious prophecies than anyof the other writers I've read. You must read ALL his books,like I have, countless times, in order to get all his messages! There is no other other writers, besides Gilda Radner, that can make you cry at the begining of a paragraph,then laugh off your seat at the end. He is also an expert on health, especially with the hot baths and cold rinse, it is amedical standard, I'm an EMT and working on a paramedic, then doctor's degree. I feel sorry for anyone that hasn't shared hisjoyous scribes, and I suggest you run to your nearest libraryto enrich your imagination!! As I said before, he's an expertin this book, with his message of heating and cooling your blood. It's cured me, along with the belly laughs that no otherother writer can give me, and believe me, I've read ALL of them.

Orgasmic is not the right word, but its the first that comes to mind."},{"Title":"Jitterbug Perfume","review":"Received the book very quickly and well since it happens to be the best book I've ever read..I'm happy!"},{"Title":"Jitterbug Perfume","review":"The author bio in the back of Jitterbug Perfume for author Tom Robbins reads:\\"TOM ROBBINGS, maverick author of eight juicy, daring, and sagacious novels, is one of those rare writers who approach rock-star status, attracting SRO crowds at his personal appearances in Europe and Australia as well as in the United States...\\"This tells you from the beginning that the author is one of those truly intriguing individuals who is bold, unique, and completely and totally full of it. For some reason, I forced myself through this book--probably because it was a gift from a friend, and one of those novels that seems to be popular and loved for no particular or tangible reason, so I felt I had to attempt to understand it.That said, the book itself is rambly, annoying, and contains such egregious passages as \\"her nose [was] a busted hymen through which sperm of a thousand colors swam a hootchy-kootchy stroke into her cerebral lagoon.\\" And the entire book was rife with this stuff, very often to the point that it interfered with understanding the literal meaning of what was going on. I forced myself through this because of some interesting passages regarding immortality, religion, death, and things of this sort, but ultimately, I didn't find anything original or revealing said about these subjects either--just contemplative.Ultimately, I can tell that this writer has great potential which he has--quite intentionally, it seems--squashed in favor of exploring the writing style he has developed for himself, which you can tell he is hopelessly in love with. But if you, the reader, do not fall in love with it by the first two pages, I suggest you put this book down and save yourself the time."},{"Title":"Jitterbug Perfume","review":"I seriously cannot believe how many people gave this book good reviews. There were so many glaring problems that I feel like I have to say something to warn potential readers.The story was far from gripping, and at times made hardly any sense at all. The characters were a hodgepodge of cartoonish stereotypes that were impossible to relate to. Most characters were poorly developed, and almost all of the female characters were motivated by greed.There is a litany of juvenile sexual metaphors that are thrown about in a Palahniukish grab for attention, as if this wannabe rockstar writer was hoping that someone would use one of his puns as their facebook status. \\"She was so wet that children could have sailed toy boats in her underpants\\". Yuk yuk yuk, very clever.The themes of the story were immortality and scent. Alright I'll bite. Wait, smelling leads to a higher form of consciousness and makes us gentler, better people? Wait, learning to smell was one of the most important stages of our evolution because it made us less aggressive and more contemplative? Wait, you're going to ramble about this for 5 or 6 pages at a time? Robbins's claims were anecdotally justified if at all. I felt like he was a used car salesman trying to convince me that a Plymouth Voyager would help me pick up women. It could happen, but it's a stretch.I don't know if anyone else caught this, but he used the word \\"portentiously\\". That isn't even a word. What he meant to say was \\"portentously\\".The worst part of the whole ordeal was the terrible ending. All of the conflict was swept under the rug and ignored so that all of the loose ends could be tied up. Everything just kind of worked out for no reason. On top of that, he throws in a remark about how money makes it easier to deal with heartache. There wasn't a tone of sarcasm or cynicism. If you're thinking about marrying Robbins, get a prenuptial agreement.There are several things that I would love to tell Robbins about his writing style. Just because your characters are ridiculous, it doesn't make them complex or memorable. Characters should be relatable and show the reader something about themselves. If you want a humorous tone, don't use smutty, lowbrow jokes to achieve it. Write about something that makes even a little bit of sense or is at least make a justifiable argument. Don't just quickly wrap everything up at the end of a novel. Give us some reason to finish the last 50 pages. One last thing, there's no i in portentously."},{"Title":"Jitterbug Perfume","review":"Based on reader reviews, I selected this book for our book club. Out of 12 readers, only 1 other person - a philosophy major - was able to get through it, and we both hated it. By the 3rd chapter I was already tired of Robbins' overuse of metaphor, simile, and allegory. The story is disjointed, with so many extraneous passages, you lose interest in trying to see how each idea complements, or is even closely aligned with, the main thesis. The whole picture did not come into focus until the last four pages of the book; the long journey of the \\"epic\\" might have been worth it if he had bothered to explain all those extraneous thoughts, chapters and secondary characters (e.g. the crazy dancing guy?) This was almost a stream-of-consciousness read, with the reader grappling for a common thread to link random passages with something, anything, else is the story. His sexual obsession was creepy, disgusting, and adolescent. He managed to introduce bizarre sexual encounters in the most unlikely circumstances....the bee sting - give me a break! Robbins took a kernel of a good idea for a book and completely ruined it with a pompous, grand-standing writing style further ruined with a juvenile sexual obsession. I can't IMAGINE how this book has an average rating of 4.5 stars - reader beware!"},{"Title":"Jitterbug Perfume","review":"The first 2/3 of this book are enlightening, funny, life-affirming, unique, surprising and beautiful. The last 1/3 is dull, unbelievable and verbose. In the beginning, he spends a lot of time hinting at something that's grand in your imagination, but is cheapened in the end, when he feels the need to spell everything out for you. It's still good, though."},{"Title":"Jitterbug Perfume","review":"This book fills a genre one might call \\"hippie lit.\\" As such, it's filled with nostalgia for the 60s (which he arbitrarily compares to ancient Egypt, Persia, the Greece golden age, and the Renaissance), free love, a trip to India, some drug use, and a one-man-jam-band demigod. There is also a pervasive, didactic tone which tells the reader to live in a semi-hedonistic, semi-\\"spiritual\\" mode, among many other things. This is all done in a style that combines corny humor and smug, ineffective wit. As the author bio suggests, this book is a self-conscious attempt to be \\"sagacious\\" by an author who seems to self-consciously think of himself as a \\"maverick\\" or \\"rock-star\\" writer.There is no subtly here - by the end of the book he's practically spelled out his horrendously confused themes to the reader. In fact, if \\"show not tell\\" is the #1 rule of being a writer, then Mr. Robbins isn't much of a writer at all. The philosophical underpinning of this book is poorly conceived and awkwardly expressed, a sort of \\"religion's greatest hits\\" in which the world's philosophies are oversimplified and mixed with a new-age pseudo science to an irritating effect.If this weren't bad enough - and believe me, it is - his characters are largely one-dimensional stereotypes, including an irishman who talks like the Luckycharms leprechaun and a child who speaks like Mary-Kate Olson in her Full House days. And they have oh-so-cute names (Wiggs Dannyboy, Bingo Pajama). Also, when he talks about sex, which is quite often, he seems, at least to me, as sleazy and a bit sexist as well.Unfortunately, the qualities of his writing listed above, from the pretentious and didactic tone, to the cute and corny humor, to the pseudo-wisdom, are exactly what so many adore about Robbins' writing. I guess I'm just not a fan of beets."},{"Title":"Jitterbug Perfume","review":"...Unless you are an adolescent boy or a pervy old man. I honestly tried to like this book, but I couldn't get past 100 or so pages, and I skimmed over a few of them. I didn't like any of the present day characters, and if the king wasn't so obsessed with semen and describing his balls after sex, I might have liked him a little better. At least he had a personality!I like random, silly things, but this was too much for me. It bordered on mad and seems to have been written in a drug-induced state.Someone else made a comment that TR shouldn't write women and I agree. I couldn't relate to any of them. They were just as gross as the men, and had no desires other than to sleep with everyone. An old man's fantasy. Or a pedophile's, as many of the girls are underage. Ewwww.I hate that I will think of this book every time I think of beets. Unless you like crass sexual references that distract from any actual storyline (not that there is much of one), don't waste your time or your money."},{"Title":"Jitterbug Perfume","review":"I was not as impressed with this book as I have been with his earlier works. Examining his bibliography on a time-line, with the exception of \\"Skinny Legs And All\\" (and I'd bet money he'd written it or at least had a good outline somewhat before its published date), everything from Jitterbug Perfume to the most recent excrescence seems to be the masturbatory fantasy of an increasingly bizarre and pitiable personality attempting to hold on to some vestige of youth in the typical way of dirty old men chasing after sweet young girls, only he does it on the page rather than (or perhaps in addition to) real life.This novel, this very one, is the mark of when Tom Robbins jumped the shark. (I typeoed 'humped' and almost left it that way, as it seems rather fitting.) I'm disappointed. Robbins' earlier works are like opening your mind with a rusty can opener. His later ones are just embarassing to read. Preachy, not very interesting, and just plain silly."},{"Title":"Jitterbug Perfume","review":"Reading is this is like sludging through a swimming pool full of good chocolate. It is all very good, but there is too much of it, and it has no plot. IT is just a bunch of poetic meanderings that would be good as short stories but not all squashed together as a huge book. It also jumps around from paris to Seattle, to New Orleans and anciend what i think is rome or greece or england or ireland. IT jumps so much that it leaves you the reader in the dust. But obviously some people liked it or else it would not get an average customer rating of five stars. So i suggest you read it and decide for yourself."},{"Title":"Jitterbug Perfume","review":"Man was I ever excited to read this book. After reading so many positive reviews on Tom Robbins and I chose JP to be my first. It's been awhile since I've been unable to finish a book (I read 15-20 books a year), and I am unhappy to say that JP has met that mark. A plot that jumps around like a jitterbug with connection besides this obscure beet...i just didn't get it and couldn't take anymore of it. I tried to muschle through a few chapters hoping for some glimmer of light that would be able to carry me to the end...nope, nothing. For any of you that may be venturing into your first Tom Robbins adventure, I do not recommend this one.. I'm a little skittish to try him again. :-("},{"Title":"Jitterbug Perfume","review":"I had to buy this book, after my sister let me read her copy w/o letting me keep it."},{"Title":"Jitterbug Perfume","review":"I've loved every Tom Robbins book I've read to date, with this one probably being my favorite. He is easily one of the most original writers of all time. There is no mistaking the many bizarre twists and turns of his plots for the writing of anyone else, and his inventiveness is matched by his skill at wordplay. There are many talented writers on the literary scene but Robbin's signature style makes him stand apart from the rest in the best of ways."},{"Title":"Jitterbug Perfume","review":"I love this book.It was given to me by a girl i met when i was living in california.

If you like smelling things you will like this."},{"Title":"Jitterbug Perfume","review":"Jitterbug Perfume is epic, in that it spans thousands of years of mortal life, and about an hour and a half of the after life. This is my favorite Tom Robbins book. Those familiar with his writing style know that he can get a bit...wordy. His forays into the cosmic realms can be a little long winded, but this book seems to incorporate his philosophy into a readable and well told story. That it takes place over such a span of time and various locations, and the characters include a deity, a king, a voodoo chemist and a waitress all wrapped up in a cohesive and entrancing story is no small feat. If you read only one Tom Robbins book in your life this should be the one. Other works of his seem a little more experimental as far as writing style and big picture world view, but Jitterbug Perfume (IMHO) is his masterpiece."},{"Title":"Jitterbug Perfume","review":"If you read this once, you'll want to read it a dozen times. Like all of Robbins early novels (Still Life with Woodpecker, Even Cowgirls Get the Blues, Another Roadside Attraction) Jitterbug Perfume is fun to read. It's lively, light, great characters. Some of his later stuff (Fierce Invalids from Hot Climates, Half Asleep in Frog Pajamas) fails to recapture the early magic. Or maybe I'm just getting to old for this. But I can still read Jitterbug Perfume today and enjoy it as much as the first time 20 years ago."},{"Title":"Jitterbug Perfume","review":"Very nice the way he melds fantasy and fiction; he does it so well in fact that I almost want to try the methods described in the book.

It contains the typical element of combining the deepest dark ages with eternal youth and today's Mexican cuisine with a twist of Tequila.

Es un riesgo que deberemos tomar&quot; nos dice Tom Robbins desde una especie de prologuito dedicado a &eacute;ste morado vegetal al comienzo de Jitterbug Perfume, quiz&aacute;s no su mejor o m&aacute;s famosa novela pero en la que se verifica de manera m&aacute;s evidente el particular m&eacute;todo de escritura de Robbins. Porque, s&eacute;palo el lector, Tom Robbins escribe de a una oraci&oacute;n por vez, perfeccion&aacute;ndola hasta quedar satisfecho y reci&eacute;n all&iacute; es cuando pasa a la siguiente, sin saber (al menos conscientemente) qu&eacute; va a pasar luego en la novela, de qu&eacute; se trata &eacute;sta y c&oacute;mo va a terminar. Cuando uno lee una novela de Tom Robbins t&eacute;cnicamente est&aacute; leyendo el primer borrador de la misma. Y es &eacute;sto lo que hace que sus libros sean una extra&ntilde;a mezcla de temas ligeros y profundos, arranques y desv&iacute;os, con erupciones de una her&eacute;tica filosof&iacute;a New Age hedon&iacute;stica que no se toma en serio a s&iacute; misma, reflexiones sobre el lenguaje y el realismo en la literatura salpicados con chistes y retru&eacute;canos de diverso calibre, todo encadenado en una sucesi&oacute;n de desconciertos, bromas y enga&ntilde;os hacia el lector y que nos va conduciendo hasta un final inesperado quiz&aacute;s incluso para el mismo autor. Y dig&aacute;moslo antes de que sea tarde : Salvo Still life with woodpecker, que una editorial mexicana publicase como Naturaleza muerta con p&aacute;jaro carpintero y de la cual el &uacute;nico ejemplar que quien les escribe vio en su vida estaba en el desaparecido Centro Lincoln, lamentablemente las novelas de Tom Robbins no parecieran haber sido traducidas al castellano (o si lo fueron, resultan absolutamente inconseguibles), as&iacute; que s&oacute;lo quien comprenda el ingl&eacute;s podr&aacute; disfrutar del apasionantemente ir&oacute;nico universo de un escritor obsesionado con las pr&aacute;cticas pre-cristianas, las tradiciones que se remontan al neol&iacute;tico y el misterio imposible de resolver del principio femenino del mundo. Advertido el lector traductodependiente, sigamos adelante. Jitterbug Perfume es una novela rara y atrapante, en la que tenemos que llegar casi a la mitad del libro para poder anudar las cuatro historias pseudoparalelas que alternativamente se van sucediendo. Y en todas ellas la mencionada remolacha juega un papel omnipresente pero secundario (salvo a Alobar, el protagonista de la primera historia, a los de las restantes tres misteriosamente alguien les est&aacute; dejando remolachas en las puertas de sus casas) hasta que, bueno, los cuatro cauces confluyen y la presencia de dicho vegetal se hace clara, evidente y l&oacute;gica. Todo esto como base vertebral de una novela en la cual la b&uacute;squeda de la inmortalidad, el retorno a pr&aacute;cticas paganas y la confecci&oacute;n de un perfume perfecto son los temas que sostienen un suspenso ir&oacute;nico salpicado por personajes absurdos y situaciones sainetescas que, como dice la contratapa, &quot;empiezan en los bosques de la antigua Bohemia y no terminan hasta las nueve de la noche de hoy (hora de Par&iacute;s)&quot;.Decir m&aacute;s ser&iacute;a comenzar a narrar la novela, introducirnos en las historias particulares cada uno de los personajes, revelar tramas, escribir palabra por palabra lo que ya Tom Robbins escribi&oacute;. Por eso s&oacute;lo queda recordar que Jitterbug Perfume comienza con una remolacha y preguntarnos si se cumple la otra mitad del proverbio y realmente la historia termina con el diablo. Obviamente, es tarea del lector descubrir si es as&iacute; o no, no de este comentador que ya arruin&oacute; bastantes sorpresas de un libro que se deja atravesar sin escollos y con disfrute, que nos va envolviendo en su m&aacute;gica y humor&iacute;stica trama y cuando nos queremos dar cuenta ya estamos en la &uacute;ltima p&aacute;gina protestando porque la diversi&oacute;n se acaba y queremos m&aacute;s. Lo que no es casual que ocurra con un libro que trata sobre lo absurdamente corta que es la existencia humana, para qu&eacute; negarlo."},{"Title":"Jitterbug Perfume","review":"This is one of my favorite Tom Robbins books. But, what am I really saying? Every Tom Robbins book is one of my favorites! As usual, his prose is pitch perfect and his voice rings authentic as a storyteller.

One of the best books to read. Very exciting."},{"Title":"Jitterbug Perfume","review":"I simply cannot believe it has taken me until now to discover Tom Robbins. As with the content of the book itself, it makes me wonder how much else in this world I'm missing!This book is a tour-de-force; an epic undertaking, which takes the reader on an exhilarating and profound ride through history, religion, philosophy, sex, esotericism and more ... whilst introducing as memorable and exotic a range of interesting characters as you're likely to find anywhere.I read it from start to finish yesterday (Christmas Day), and I'm hard-pressed to recall a Christmas I've enjoyed more.In our largely depressing homogenised and corporatised modern-day existences, books like this are needed more than ever. The world would clearly be a better place if we had more whimsical, playful and irreverent folk like Robbins around. It didn't surprise me at all to find he had been good friends with other free spirits like Timothy Leary and Terence McKenna.It is always extraordinary to me that even with a novel like this, which shines like a priceless gemstone, there are those who will give it one and two stars. Are they clueless? Certainly. Bitter? Probably. Shameless? Absolutely. Ignore them completely ... for me such people may as well be a different species (trolls spring to mind as a possibility!).Do yourself a favour and take the Robbins trip. At the very least, it should make you think outside your current boxes and have fun while you're doing it.

Recently, a very cool, funny & cerebral young lady rented the spare bedroom in my apartment and (having never forgotten the enjoyment of reading this book over & over again) I re-bought Jitterbug Perfume for her as a welcome gift. Inside the cover I wrote a Robbins reminder for my new roomie: \\"A sense of humor, properly developed, is superior to any religion so far devised.\\" This philosophy has helped me pull myself out of the mires of fear, self doubt, regret and loss to - at the very least - be able to conjure a wry smile at the trials and tribulations of life in the face of looming despair. BACK OFF big D, I will NOT succumb! At most, it has given me the ability to laugh and thumb my nose at nay-sayers and people with funky negativo vibes. Keep searching for that elusive beet and enjoy the journey. This novel is a \\"must read\\" for 20 or 30 or 40 or 50 or 60 etc. somethings!

The man is funny, silly, thought-provoking and spiritual.Jitterbug Perfume is my favorite of all Tom Robbins'. I love the characters, their play in time and what is time, after all. What better way to eternal life than Kudra and Al's.Perhaps my favorite part in the book, which I have read several times (I buy used copies and give them to anyone who will take one)is at the dock where the ferryman sends people one way or the other.

In Jitterbug you will follow a path across the continents to meet the ancient gods, find wisdom, lose it again, and maybe end up smelling a little better to boot, one things for sure, you'll end up happy.

This isn't just a story about immortality; this is a commentary about how to live Life NOW. I have quoted this book many times in my own writing, as I appreciate Robbins' unconventional yet sage approach to Life. Alobar and Kudra are the consummate Hedonists, and want their lives to mean something as well. Their journey back to each other is remarkable. My life has been altered by great books like Jitterbug Perfume. That is the true purpose of great writing. Any other kind of writing is slag and rots the mind."},{"Title":"Jitterbug Perfume","review":"Having read &quot;Another Roadside Attraction,&quot; I was eager to get right into my next Tom Robbins book. This novel takes everything one could want in a fictional work and presents it to you in a way that only the amazingly witty Tom Robbins can present it. This story centers around a journey by one man and his quest for immortality over a period of a millenium and ties in the present day workings of perfumeries in New Orleans and Paris. The characters are interesting, humorous, and full of emotion. The story is an adventurous quest for self-realization that all men must go through, taken to the extreme. If u enjoy a good read and a book that's hard to put down until it's done, Jitterbug Perfume is one of the best."},{"Title":"Jitterbug Perfume","review":"This novel probably wouldn't make much sense(at the beginning)to anyone who didn't become alive during the '60s - not born but alive. The novel is not only well researched and written but is also, to those of us fortunate enough to have resided in Seattle, Paris, and New Qrleans(or with litiary imagination)it is both a revelation and a rejunvenation of spirit. His history of perfume is almost too accurate to describe unless one has kept up with with recent developements in philosophy, psycharity, human evolution and,of course perfume. But beware! The book is so easy to read that the concepts he explores can easily become one's own. ENJOY, happy Mardi Gras and may you live forever!"},{"Title":"Jitterbug Perfume","review":"WITHOUT A DOUBT, THE MOST FASCINATING BOOK THAT I HAVE EVER READ.BE PREPARED FOR ADVENTURE. COMING FROM THE WORLDS BIGGEST VONNEGUTFAN, THATS SAYING A LOT. PLEASE DO NOT MISS THIS ONE.GENE ADDINGTON"},{"Title":"Jitterbug Perfume","review":"Jitterbug Perfume might best be described in terms of Alobar, its most central character and a fifteen hundred or so year old man who, as someone wrote, has no trouble getting laid. (Why couldn't this have been my story?) I mean, everlasting life--that could become a drag after a while. But everlasting life that was fun--who wouldn't want that?JP has the vibrancy of everlasting youth, wild plot contrivances, surprisingly inventive and satisfying resolutions, sci-fi and fantasy elements, a small kaleidescope of colorful and often larger-than-life characters. It has a conscious playfulness with language, not to mention the requisite occasional (but important) outright philosophizing. JP carries with it its own message, one well in keeping with its hippy era heritage, but yet one that's broader than its era.As the novel goes on and all the major characters have been introduced, including Alobar and the god Pan, as well as modern day inhabitants of the US and France, I was waiting to see how Robbins would tie all the loose strands together, but was still often surprised.It took me a while to get into it. But either because it got better or I got used to it, or both, after about a hundred pages or so I was hooked. Perhaps JP wouldn't have seemed quite so jarring at first, particularly with its over-the-top situations and linguistic overreaching, had I not picked it up after Mishima's Spring Snow. Talk about something perfectly written! But perhaps some of JP's message had already insinuated itself in my brain during those first hundred pages. Could it have been that gentle, delicious waft of oh-so-sweet jasmine anchored by the subtlest bass note of je ne sais crois (I-don't-know-what), emanating from who knows where?"},{"Title":"Jitterbug Perfume","review":"I think the 1 star reviews are funny.This book is not for the pretentious writer, it is for the free spirit.One of the things I love about Robbins is how he researches the small details of his subject...in this case perfumery. He is a metaphorical wizard and has such a visual writing style that I can clearly picture each character, expression and even, dare I say it...smell.This is my favorite of his books. The fact that you can even bridge the gap between a King in the middle ages to a bisexual coke-snorting genius waitress is enough to keep me interested. He is funny, astute in observation and spiritually revolutionary.Some questions that we all pose in our spiritual journey (those of us who know we are on one) are explored in this book with humor and it's share of irony.Out of the many books I have read, this is the only one I continue to re-read throughout the years so that I can smile and not take myself so friggen seriously."},{"Title":"Jitterbug Perfume","review":"I read Jitterbug Perfume about 20 years ago. I have just reread it again, and underlined a good bit of it. Tom Robbins explores and philosphizes about Life, immortality, sexuality, rebirthing, the purpose of life in a grand theory of everything as he weaves four story lines into one whole piece of cloth. Astounding, wonderful, funny, insightful. The metaphors alone are worth the read. I love this book."},{"Title":"Jitterbug Perfume","review":"This book is one long trip. You'll be confused and you'll be amazed, and you'll question everything that you know...and then it all concludes in a neat little package.

And someone please make a movie."},{"Title":"Jitterbug Perfume","review":"A few years ago I was in the midst of a huge Robbins kick. Presently, although I wouldn't say I've wained in my appreciation, I haven't read much of Robbins. That is, until the other day when I remembered how much I had enjoyed reading \\"Jitterbug Perfume.\\"Robbins tales are always familiar to anyone famililar with more than two of his books. I mean, typically you've got a female lead, toss in a couple sex scenes, mild drug use, off-the-wall absurdity, and perhaps a meta-textual talk about painting the typewriter while in the process of creating the story.\\"Jitterbug Perfume\\" was the sixth or seventh book of Robbins I read. The first being \\"Still Life...\\" I had been disapointed with \\"Fierce Invalids...\\" and I never made it through that, so I originally didn't have much faith in \\"Jitterbug.\\" But this story spans a few hundred years, taught me more about beets than I ever thought knowable (especially the somewhat diabolical personality of a beet). Most importantly, this book, as opposed to \\"Fierce Invalids...\\" and \\"Skinny Legs...\\" seems faster paced. Perhaps this is crucial to my enjoying them.If you liked \\"Still Life...\\" (it seems to be most people's introduction to Robbins) try \\"Jitterbug\\" as soon as you can!"},{"Title":"Jitterbug Perfume","review":"Jitterbug Perfume: Beets and Jasmine and Magick, Oh My!Jitterbug Perfume is all about beets, and Tom Robbins gives the underappreciated, homely vegetable its due in a story that spans centuries and circles the globe, weaving his unforgettable characters into a powerful story of the quests for love, knowledge and survival.Jitterbug Perfume is Tom Robbins' fourth novel (published in 1984) whose major themes include the striving for immortality and the metaphysical meanings behind the sense of smell, sex, love, and religion. One small section of just a couple of pages, a soliloquy on the \\"evolution of floral consciousness,\\" alone is a priceless work of imaginative literature.Beets and the stinky stud-god Pan figure prominently. The novel is a self-described epic, with four distinct storylines, one set in 8th century Bohemia, and the remaining taking place in modern day New Orleans, Seattle, and Paris.Briefly, a powerful and righteous 8th century Czech king named Alobar narrowly escapes death at the hands of his own subjects (it is their custom to kill the king at the first sight of aging, as in graying of the hair). Fleeing his homeland, no longer a king but an impoverished peasant, he travels through Europe and Asia, eventually encountering the goat-god Pan, who is slowly losing his powers (and his existence) as the world turns toward a new-fangled Christianity.In India, Alobar bumps into the adult reincarnation of a child he used to know, Kudra, who becomes his wife, his life and his undying love, their lusty mutual aodration quite like something out of a fairy tale.After an encounter with a mysterious group of monastic recluses known as \\"The Bandaloop Doctors\\" Alobar is set down the path towards eternal life, to be attained by a consistent regimen of controlled breath work, sex and ritualized bathing. Alobar and Kudra, now effectively immortal, prance about Europe until the 18th Century, when they attempt a sort of new transcendental meditation technique and become accidentally separated into different astral planes.Meanwhile, in present-day Seattle, a \\"genius waitress\\" named Priscilla struggles with a miserable job in a low-end taco joint. A dedicated but amateur perfumer, Priscilla is going slowly mad in her attempt to identify a base note for her new fragrance, something she believes will confer almost magickal powers of attractiveness on its wearer, a fragrance she discovered in the chance gift of a thousand-year-old bottle containing a few drops of the substance.Meanwhile, a mysterious stranger keeps delivering beets to her apartment.In New Orleans, Priscilla's stepmother, Madame Devalier, is a successful but small-time perfumer, and is also working on a fragrance of her own, intent on taking on the big commercial perfume houses of Paris. She also seeks something magickal -- the unimaginably powerful, ultra-fragrant jasmine obtained from a mysterious little man accompanied by a halo of swarming bees named Bingo Pajama.In Paris, the LeFever Parfumaire is concerned about their eccentric leader, Marcel, who equates smell as the most important factor in the forward movement of the evolutionary process. After witnessing an eclipse, he is obsessed with his own scent.The story lines eventually converge into a climax in New Orleans, with a brief stop in another dimension.The novel's premier message is summarized in the cryptic proto-Germanic/Glagolitic Slavonic idiom \\"Erleichda,\\" loosely translated as \\"Lighten up!\\"An extremely imaginative, deliciously engaging work with all the amazing wordplay one has come to expect from Tom Robbins. Reading \\"Jitterbug Perfume\\" isn't \\"like\\" stepping into an alternate reality; it IS stepping into an alternate reality!"},{"Title":"Jitterbug Perfume","review":"Robbins' best.

Weaving his way through the ages, following the characters as they change before your eyes, and examining the grisly wonder of death, Tom Robbins is at his best. I appreciate all of his books, so there is no surprise that I liked this as well. What was surprising was the immediate urge to re-read, rare in this reader. I emphatically recommend this book and think any Robbins fan (or really any reader) will certainly enjoy this masterpiece."},{"Title":"Jitterbug Perfume","review":"Yes, as you may have read in other reviews, this one is about longevity. It has great insight and philosophy regarding the evolution of the human brain and its flowering potential. Wow!

Of course, in order to have written such an idea, one would have to have thought about it.

For now, until I devise a proper review, all I will say is that words, ideas, and thoughts are all I ever needed to get myself out of bed in the morning! SEA"},{"Title":"Jitterbug Perfume","review":"This is a wonderful book if you have never read Tom Robbins this is a book to start with. It is full of history and imagery wih a few gods and immortals added to the mix. The story begins in ancient Bohemia with King Alobar attempting to find a way to avoid his impending death sentence at the hands of his subjects. He escapes his death with the help of his favorite wife Wren, and goes in search of immortality, which he finds. The rest of the story is about his life for the next 1,000 years.During this time he meets a dying greek god Pan, several Nymphs, and a new wife. To say more about the story would spoil it.This book is about Robbins view of life and relgion. Robbins uses symbols such as beets, and perfume to symbolize diffrent aspects life. These symbols are fun and leave the reader thinking long after they have finished reading the book. If you are not a Robbins this fan this book will convert you."},{"Title":"Jitterbug Perfume","review":"I picked this book up as a huge fan of Still Life with Woodpecker. I had read Another Roadside Attraction, but was not nearly as impressed. This book rejuvenated my amazement with this author. Tom Robbins' writing is descriptive in a playful, humorous manner. I can only compare his plots to an episode of Seinfield, where all characters start out in very different places and then end up all together in the end. And none of it seems like a stretch. By the end, you believe that this is the way things should end. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone, but I also recommend reading an excerpt since we have never met.

The sheer scope of Robbins' knowledge, his wacky humour, and knack for metaphors make it a piece that is unforgettable. His creativity in developing the characters of Pan, Alobar, the beets, the brothers LeFevre, and the complex plot are beyond impressive."},{"Title":"Jitterbug Perfume","review":"I first became aware of Robbins back in the late 70's, but never actually sat down and read anything by him until this classic came along. I've since read his entire body of work with the exception of Fierce Invalids (gotta get that one soon) and of all of them this is my favorite by far. The plot is incredibly intricate, spanning some 1500 years and every single loose end is tied up at the end. It's a very spiritual book. It also is excruciatingly funny. My favorite comic passage is his description of the philospher Descartes serving in the court of Queen Chrstina of Sweeden which has been overun with fleas. I won't give any more away about that passage for anyone out there reading these reviews who is considering taking the Robbins plunge. I would hate to spoil the joke.As with all of his work, Robbins roots for individual spiritualism as opposed to organized religion. His knowledge of mythology and theology is incredible. I can picture a very funny scenario with Jehovah's Witness at his front door. In my opinion, he states his case more eloquently here than in his other novels, which by the way, are all worth the read."},{"Title":"Jitterbug Perfume","review":"It's clear from the other reviews that most people either love or hate this book. That's not really surprising, though, because the best and worst of Tom Robbins are definitely in here.First the good bits: Robbins is a great writer. He isn't the most carefully crafted writer, but he's very clever with words, and does a good job of creating an interesting, complex plot that draws the reader in. When you reach the end of the book and can see the whole picture, you can't help but be impressed. And his wordplay is unique and very interesting, the sort of thing you read and think, I never would have thought about it like that, but that's perfect.However... Tom Robbins *knows* that he's a very clever writer. There are places in this book where the prose is obnoxiously clever, in a self-satisfied, smug way. It's difficult to describe, but it absolutely takes away from telling the actual story. There are also points where he gets fairly preachy, which both surprised and bored me, and also detracted from the story. And I'm definitely of the opinion that Tom Robbins can't write female characters (do yourself a favor and don't read Half-Asleep in Frog Pyjamas if you agree with me). The ones in this book are pretty standard mis-identified, sex-crazed, two-dimensional Robbins women, with the exception of Kudra who's somewhat well-developed.Despite the pretty strong negative points in this book, I would still recommend reading it, especially if you write or are interested in writing. It's a mostly enjoyable read, and does a good job of showing some really impressive writing and storytelling, along with some things to avoid."},{"Title":"Jitterbug Perfume","review":"It's incredible that this book was first published in 1984 and still attracts a constant new stream of excited converts. Although the can 'o beans, stick, conche shell and spoon of 'Skinny Legs and All' give us all a good reason to persevere, it's Jitterbug's bloody red beet and the mysterious blue bottle that really tell us something is going on.As for me, I've been half asleep myself since 'Frog Pajamas' and wait readlessly for the next Robbins journey. Junkie that I am, I just can't seem to read anything else. I'm hooked.If you're looking for a oddysey to lift you out of 21st century techo tripe and make you laugh out loud at life, this is your book.Tom Robbins has the most wonderful way of illustrating life in all it's quirky glory and reminding us to lighten up."},{"Title":"Jitterbug Perfume","review":"IF YOU DON'T:1.Want to imagine what it felt like to be king or king's wife2.Want to imagine what if felt to be a Greek God with waning reverence3.Want to imagine espionage in the perfume industry4.Want to imagine living and loving eternally5.Want to imagine hog sloppy bicuriosity6.Want to laugh out loud,(spewing food & or drink) no matter where you are and who's with you7.Want to wish you could write this well in a thousand years ... okay, two.8.Want to use the friggin' dictionary and Wikipedia to clear up a few things9.Want to suspend 'reality' and imagine time traveling10.Want to read one of the most well-woven, irreverent,wildly plotted,richly charactered,funniest,sexiest, intriguing,literate,and emotion evoking novels ... ever!I love this guy's work.

I ran off seven (7) pages of reference material - a complete bibliography to include review links to all Robbins' novels, short stories, translations, and articles as well as personal interviews, dissertations and graduate theses.If you haven't read any work by Tom Robbins and you are a lit lover, you must read something by this author. As for JITTERBUG PERFUME, it will take you on a fantastic saga spanning 1000 years. The verbal painting is vivid and lasting and the quirky journey will remain with you forever.Enjoy!

It snapped me out of my funk. It has been my favorite gift to give over the years. It's one of the few books I've ever read more than once. I re-read it every couple of years. It's Robbins at his very best! You know that question, &quot;If you could have 10 people for an imaginary dinner party, who in all the world living or dead, would you invite?&quot; Well because of this book I'd invite him.Those he wrote after Jitterbug Perfume we're severely disappointing...reminded me of Phil Collins in the '80's...putting out albums because he could, not because they were good. But, I find myself forgiving Robbins for the ones he wrote after....when I think of this 'work of art'."},{"Title":"Jitterbug Perfume","review":"Imagine an entire novel whose narrative is built around the aroma of the beet. Don't need to imagine it, friend. Tom Robbins has written that novel. And boy is it fun.Structurally, the narrative is brilliant. Brief trips through the present (geographically Seattle, Paris and New Orleans set the scene) sandwich prolonged trips through the distant past. Alobar, King of Bohemia nearly a thousand years ago, is to be put to death when the first signs of old age's feebleness show themselves. He flees, not because he is scared of Death; he just doesn't agree with the way Death does His business. Alobar's adventures lead him on a sprawling globetrotting quest to find immortality, accompanied by a like-minded female companion, the exiled Indian aromatist Kudra. Their adventures are mystical, philosophical, beautiful, and poetic.Running along side these adventures -- in contemporary times -- are the everyday lives of three perfumers. Marcel &quot;Bunny&quot; LeFever is the man behind the nose behind one of Paris' most successful perfumeries. His eccentricities are legendary, such as wearing a whale mask when contemplating his next scent. Lily Devalier (and her apprentice, V'Lu Jackson) run a small but respected perfume shoppe in New Orleans. &quot;Genius Waitress&quot; Priscilla Partido works at a Mexican Restaurant where she is constantly fending off the lesbian advances of bartender Ricki. At night, she retires to her flat for experiments in perfume chemistry. These three stories, seemingly connected by a diaphanous thread, have more in common than you'd think. And just who is leaving beets on all of their doorsteps? Hmm...This is all a finely crafted excuse for some lengthy (but not too lengthy) philosophical discussion on the nature of immortality, and some seriously gifted wordplay. As in most of Tom's books, there are a plethora of inspired metaphors sprinkled throughout the action; some that make your jaw drop in jealous wonder. Please enjoy two of my favourites:\\"She realized with a shock that she was so wet that children could have sailed toy boats in her underpants\\" (a fine example of Tom's freedom when it comes to subjects of a sexual nature; there is some truly lascivious stuff here).\\"The Middle Ages hangs over history's belt like a beer belly. It is too late now for aerobic dancing or cottage cheese lunches to reduce the Middle Ages. History will have to wear size 48 shorts forever.\\"Ahh! Aren't they beautiful?\\"Jitterbug Perfume\\" is one of my favourite Robbins masterpieces (\\"Another Roadside Attraction\\" being the other). It takes a ridiculously simple yet puzzling concept, and weaves magic from its loom. I am powerless to do anything but grin mightily whenever I am within its pages.However...I've said it many a time before, but I feel it bears repeating: Tom Robbins is most definitely an acquired taste. If you run into Tom, and are put off the first time, please try try again. Imagine the virgin Robbins reader, treading through the first couple pages here, baffled by all this talk about beets. And, on a more general level, confounded by the story's unwillingness to get itself rolling. Be patient. Eventually, Tom will make clear the reason for the beets. Crystal clear. And his way with story, which I admit is most often meandering, is also quite original. He gets where he wants to go (and where you, the reader want him to go) eventually. And when he does, it's more satisfying."},{"Title":"Jitterbug Perfume","review":"I first read Jitterbug Perfume at the age of thirteen.

For someone who gets carried away with philosophy easily, it was refreshing for me to read Tom Robbins. He brilliantly strings deep philosophical themes throughout the novel and somehow left me feeling lighter, not weighed down. I started off skeptical and did not understand what I thought at the time was his pointless humor. About half way through the book though, his silliness grew on me, and I felt like I was on Tom Robbins crack. At the end, I did not know if I agreed with or believed half of what he had said, but he surely had me thinking. He somehow had me seriously thinking about the connection between dinosaurs and flora, bees and brains, and beets and immortality. I think many Tom Robbins critics get too caught up in criticizing his absurd writing and yes, sometimes \\"pointless\\" rambling, but that is not the point. The point is that before I knew it I was seriously considering adding more beets to my diet. Yes, one could attribute this to me being somewhat ignorant. Or, one could just accept that due to Tom Robbins brilliance, a reader can unknowingly be dragged into his silly world. They will then be spit right back out, feeling like they went to an amusement park and somehow came out enlightened."},{"Title":"Jitterbug Perfume","review":"Let me come right out and say this: If you like Tom Robbins, you will probably like Jitterbug Perfume. If you have read his stuff, and not enjoyed it, or have finished any of his books and said \\"eh\\" than this is not for you. It rambles, the characters are all half mad, and halfway through you being to wonder who exactly the book is about.It is typical Tom Robbins, although Jitterbug Perfume falls apart at the end. It is almost as if Mr. Robbins had too much philosophy for not enough pages- it was fascinating, but at the same time, I wondered if his ruminations on life, religion, etc, couldn't have been put in a different essay, rather than put the plot on hold for a fair while while we all sort it out.It is an interesting book, funny, though provoking, like I said, typical Robbins.

His poetic prose and metaphorical musings simply cannot be compared to any author I've ever encountered.

He's the only author I know of that can metaphorically compare a taco and the meaning in life in a single sentence, and do it in such a way that I simultaneously delve into metaphysical contemplation, laugh, and crave a taco. Each new sentence on the page is as delicious as the next, if not more so. I'm left wanting more.I was introduced to Tom Robbins by way of \\"Fierce Invalids Home From Hot Climates.\\" I didn't think that book could be topped, but Jitterbug Perfume just may. This dude is simply the best."},{"Title":"Jitterbug Perfume","review":"Love Tom Robbins' books. I'm not a literary scholar, but the way Robbins deals in both the metaphysical realm and relates it to his character development makes for great reading. However, these books aren't for the faint of heart when it comes to sexual situations, just fair warning."},{"Title":"Jitterbug Perfume","review":"A great read! I ordered this for my Kindle, and my daugher (who is 19 yo) really enjoyed it. I can't wait to read it!"},{"Title":"Jitterbug Perfume","review":"This book unveils a philosophical adventure regarding life and death and possibilities. Every sentence written is like a line of a poem.

Frankly, you'll either love or hate Robbins' sometimes hallucinatory, occasionally hysterical and frequently mind-blowing prose. Read him for surprise, enlightenment and the sheer overabundance of ideas. Jitterbug Perfume is his best... and if you're coming to him for the first time, leave your expectations and prejudices at the door and embrace the wonder."},{"Title":"Jitterbug Perfume","review":"If you want to see what good writing is all about, this book is for you. Robbins is a master at putting words together in beautiful, evocative ways. The story is classic Tom Robbins: a wild, epic adventure featuring an Indian woman escaping self sacrifice before hooking up with a former king also escaping death. Among the guest stars are Timothy Leary (aka Wiggs Dannyboy) and the Greek god Pan. But as anyone who ever read any of his novels, the story is secondary. The real treat is Robbins' writing, dialogues, philosophical insights and... everything else. This--along with Still LIfe with Woodpecker--is Robbins' best."},{"Title":"Jitterbug Perfume","review":"Tom Robbins weaves together a story for the ages.

I was sceptic about reading it only because I really didn't understand the first chapter but once you get into it; there is no looking back.

That was my experience with this book. It was the only book I had with me for 7 weeks in a mud hut in rural Africa and I still couldn't get through it. I felt like I was reading something by a high school student who had just taken a comparative religion course and wanted to show off. Preciously clever, no real character development, club-you-over-the-head pseudo-philosophy, and completely unsubtle sex & innuendo. This was the first Robbins book I've read and it will probably be the last."},{"Title":"Jitterbug Perfume","review":"Albeit this is my first Tom Robbins novel, and I did enjoy the romp through history and learned a lot about botanicals, but about midway through the book, I found myself asking &quot;What IS this all about?&quot; The book is funny, bawdy, well thought out with intersting philosphies throughout, and Robbins IS a master of wordplay and unique metaphors. But like P.T. Anderson's mess of a film &quot;Magnolia&quot;, it weaves a lot of grand IDEAS without having that much of a concrete plot. Either Robbin's editor pared it down to the point where major sections of the book are missing, or Robbins himself couldn't pull it off. The last fifty pages or so are where the plot &quot;comes together in the end&quot;, but in my opinion, it needs to be more. Too little, too late for what otherwise could be a true epic of a novel, with little explanation of character's motivations in some parts (who is the Jamaican jasmine dealer supposed to be, and WHY is he there?), or too obtuse to get (I still don't see what the point of the perfume which ties the story together is other than to cover up the scent of Pan, whom a major character throughout the first 2/3 of the novel is dropped by the wayside for the rest). Funny, clever, but not the grand tome it intends to be."},{"Title":"Jitterbug Perfume","review":"I have heard a lot of Tom Robbins from many of my friends. So, I picked this book. Maybe because I had too high expectations, but I was disappointed with him. His style was interesting. The theme, though was good in content, but could've been handled better. One of the many signs of a bad book is the visibility of arrogance and vanity of the writer. And I felt that in this book. I don't want to judge Tom Robbins as a writer by reading just one book. I am sure, if he had so many fans, he must be having &quot;some&quot; talent. I picked his other book - Skinny legs and all. I will form an opinion about him then. But this book sure disappointed me though it was good in patches."},{"Title":"Jitterbug Perfume","review":"Bible, move over! Jesus, take a back seat!

Nay, I refer to it as the year 10 A.R. (\\"after Robbins\\"; the preceding thousands of years of humanity are known by the modifier B.R.).Oh my Godding God is this book good.

Proust? Bed-ridden hack. Joyce. . .didn't he have like polio or something? What was with that eye-patch? Hack.I guess what I'm saying is is that this book totally is not an infuriatingly bad collection of faux-wry, eye-winking, contrived garbage excreted from the anus of a sad man trying to work out his juvenile and inadequate thoughts with zero wit and the subtlety of a freight train plowing into a dead cow carcass on the tracks. Is it not that. GO BUY IT"},{"Title":"Jitterbug Perfume","review":"This is without a doubt Tom Robbins' best book. It's more coherent and linear than his usual fair. A fun and engaging story that is surprisingly difficult to put down. Having read this several times, I am completely amazed that after each reading I discover things I missed during my previous readings.

Anyone who is looking for one of those books that you can't put down should pick this up. While getting past the book's initial bizzare opening can be a challenge, it is an absolute must read. It's a love story, it's a story about friendship, and about life. It awakens the mind and spirit to a new world of immortality and desire. To read this book is to find out what it means to be truly alive."},{"Title":"Jitterbug Perfume","review":"Jitterbug Perfume is my all-time favorite book. When I received a gift certificate to amazon, I thought I'd finally get myself a hardcover copy since my paperback is falling apart. The description this seller gave was &#34;Dust cover missing, book cover and text are pristine!&#34;. It isn't. The book doesn't close flat because the cover is warped. The pages are slightly discolored at the ends. It has an old book smell. The corners of the cover are dented. There is a drop of, perhaps, glue on the cover. And, worst of all, about 1-1/2&#34; of the cover has been chewed as if by mice, a rat, or squirrel. I know the book left the sellers in this condition rather than being damaged in the mail because the book was carefully wrapped in cellophane and then wrapped in newspaper and taped closed. (In fact, I was worried I would damage the book when I took off the newspaper because there was so much tape and I had to cut it.) The newspaper and Saran wrap were not damaged, dented, nor chewed.

I think you have to have an IQ of about 70 in order for that to happen.He has the same cutesy prose as Dennis Fari&ntilde;a, who only got published because he knew the right people. TR writes about sex like a creepy, impotent old man. You know, like Robert Heinlein.At least Heinlein's female characters have talents other than (....). AND his stories are cool.

Lots of other people I know loved it though and you may too."},{"Title":"Jitterbug Perfume","review":"While many of \\"Jitterbug Perfume\\"'s characters appear to us on the cusp of major discoveries and decisions, they are typically stuck spinning their wheels, caught in the muck of the author's meandering self-importance and capitulations to barely veiled literary conceits. Amid the baronial flourishes of Robbins' would-be masterpiece, full of its vulgarian panache, its droll boorishness, its self-styled rule-flouting, its delightful miscegenation of puns and philosophy, yes, despite it all, the reader is moved to occasionally snicker, roll her eyes, yawn, or become willing suppliant to the cult of clock watchers to gain egress from the author's intermittent sputters of mental flatulence. In short, Robbins is too enamored of himself, too interested in slaloming through his own cleverness, to meet the demands of this sinuous narrative."},{"Title":"Jitterbug Perfume","review":"I'm not even going to get into the story.

This is the first Tom Robbins book I have ever read, and I can assure you, it will also be the last. Just to summarize: I thought it was a really dumb story, that was amazingly poorly written, by an author who doesn't seem to know the first thing about writing fiction other than what he learned from reading Dave Barry's Big Trouble, which is the only other book this bad that I had to finish, since both were selections of our Book Club.The story line has no continuity whatsoever, and it's never really clear to me what the 3 different sets of contemporary characters/settings were doing in this story. Even the construction was poor, spending 2 or 3 pages on each of the contemporary settings, and then launching into 100 pages of ancient bohemia, causing you to completely lose the thread of who or what the comtemporary charancters/settings were all about; and then he does this all over again! And what about \\"Wiggs Dannyboy\\"??? A truly absurd name that belongs in Harry Potter, not in a work of adult literary fiction.And the images and similes in this book were nothing short of disgraceful. I could almost forgive \\"semen-greased teeth\\" or \\"toy boats floating in her underpants\\" as throw-away lines, that even Mr. Robbins probably regrets at this point, but when lines like this get repeatedly thrown at you, it becomes increasingly annoying. Consider this one, which really takes the cake: \\"The trip left the girl gaga, goofy, tainted, transformed, her nose a busted hymen through which sperm of a thousand colors swam a hootchy-kootchy stroke into her cerebral lagoon.\\"A line like that is beyond embarrassing and amateurish. My wife put it best -- she said this books reads like it was written by somone on drugs. I would embellish that statement slightly by saying that it reads like it was written either BY or FOR someone on drugs. I can just picture some stoner reading the line quoted above, and going, \\"wow, that's really heavy, man!\\"Mr. Robbins, you badly need to go back to writing school."},{"Title":"Jitterbug Perfume","review":"THIS FUNKY FANTASY IS NO OLFACTORY ORGASM.

WIGGS DANNYBOY??"},{"Title":"Jitterbug Perfume","review":"I know that Tom Robbins has a loyal following and I started the book with high expectations. However, I did not enjoy this book as it was too much work to follow his confused logic. I think that he was under the influence during most of time that he wrote."},{"Title":"Jitterbug Perfume","review":"I love Tom Robbins. I love him. I would love to meet him and give him a big wet kiss and then, afterward, I would love to make him sign this book with a note that reads \\"I know I'm awesome. Love, Tom Robbins.\\" That having been affirmed, I will now proceed with my review:This book is the first Tom Robbins book I ever experienced. My sister lent it to me and I adore her for it. It's witty, intelligent, bizarre, quirky, explicit, contemplative, and filled to the brim with beets and bandaloops. Therefore, I love it! It has a humor and writing style that fits in perfectly with my, personal mindset, and generally with the mindsets of the people who enjoy spending time with me. However, since there are a great many people who find me and my friends a little too odd, the same goes for Tom Robbins and his amazing prose.I'm willing to bet that if you're not in love with this book by the end of the third page, you will never reconcile with it and will just wind up angry and bitter for having wasted precious hours of your life on something that you could never have possibly enjoyed. This does not make you a bad person. On the contrary, it probably makes you quite sensible. However, it does not make you a Tom Robbins fan.All that having been said, I give this book five stars because I could not find a single flaw with it. However, don't take my word for it. He's an acquired taste and isn't for everyone."},{"Title":"Jitterbug Perfume","review":"and this book is not an exception for me. Living in Seattle I had always heard of Tom Robbins, but I never read him. That all changed one fateful day in 1989 while I was meandering the fiction stacks at the downtown public library. &quot;Jitterbug Perfume&quot; was the only Robbins book on the shelf. I look back on that week of reading my first Robbbins novel with fondness.It starts in the present day, then flashes back to medieval Europe and King Alobar. Alobar discovers the secret to everlasting life, and we follow him and his wife Kudra on their many adventures. They meet Pan in Arcadia and take him with them to Paris where the flashback ends and we are in the 20th century looking for the recipe of Kudra's perfume. Trust me, the plot is entertaining, and reading Robbins' prose is a pleasure.I have read all of them and my number two choice of his is &quot;Skinny Legs and All&quot;. I loved Can O Beans and Spoon. I like it when Robbins leaves reality and delves into the realm of fantasy.These two books have the most elements of fantasy, but they never leave reality completely. What an imagination he has! And they way he turns a phrase and spins a metaphor leaves lovers of language well sated.My third favorite book of his is &quot;Even Cowgirls Get the Blues&quot;. The Chink is a wonderful character and I really enjoyed his philosphy of life. I won't tell you what it is because you should read it for yourself. It is the most hedonistic of his novels.All of his books are wonderful; but this is the first one I read and it will alway be near and dear to my heart.So choose wisely: you will always be partial to the first Robbins novel that you read. Actually, you can't make a wrong choice because they are all entertaining and imaginative with phrases spun like no other author I have ever read. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Jitterbug Perfume","review":"For the first couple of chapters this book is entertaining and intriguing but doesn't seem to make sense. How could perfume, beets, immortality and a horny little pan-god have anything to do with each other? you ask. Well, keep reading and you will find that Robbins is a genius. All these seemingly nonsensical themes cleverly come together in an unforgettable way. But more than being merely entertaining, their are lessons to be learned from this book. The long searched-for secret to immortality is revealed. (I actually started meditating religiously after reading it) And, Tom Robbins religious studies also come into play in slightly off-beat ways. If you really pay attention you can learn about world religions and cultures. What more can you ask for from a novel?"},{"Title":"Jitterbug Perfume","review":"This is the novel I usually use to introduce friends to Tom Robbins. It exemplifies his storytelling abilities and entertains from cover to cover. Several stories interweave throughout the novel, coming together at the end for a fantastic finish. Robbins is the master of metaphor, and I enjoy reading and re-reading all of his books. The only thing I don't like about Tom Robbins is that he only puts out a book every five years or so."},{"Title":"Jitterbug Perfume","review":"This is one of THE great books in the English language.It is about a love that lasts a thousand years, the search for immortality, of course perfume... and, oh yes, not to be forgotten...beets.I have, in my search for the ultimate book, my search for the wisdom for the ages, (the perfect taco)searched far and wide; Quantum Physics, philosophy, religion...I have cast my net wide and thought I had left no stone unturned. Most have left me empty. Who could have guessed I should have been turning over beets? Mr. Robbins has shared with us mere mortals, a work that had me underlining quotes on almost every page, a work in which I can only hope I have allowed it's wisdom into my soul as a fragrance expands to fill ones lungs.For those less interested in \\"Literature\\", Jitterbug Perfume could be considered a \\"rom com\\" because the romance oozes from this work like the blood of its favorite vegetable. The humor is thick as the fragrance of its favorite perfume, winking at you like some ancient sojourner with tongue firmly in cheek, yet dispensing such nuggets of wisdom as only time and experience could accumulate.The language is delicious, it pours from the pages like a thick Louisiana gumbo unconstrained by the levees of an indolent corps of engineers.My only complaint is that near the end, the story slows...no car chases or epic battles for control of the titular scent which wafts thru the narrative like a carrot before the cart, but perhaps that is a metaphor as well, that encumbered as we are by our instant gratification culture, our religious pedantic political machine, the military industrial complex which governs our economy and excuse for empire, that perhaps instead, we should just all smell the flowers and dance to our life, health, and loves.May Tom Robbins live a thousand years!"},{"Title":"Jitterbug Perfume","review":"Tom Robbins is my favorite all-time author and Jitterbug Perfume is my favorite Tom Robbins novel. It is a story that covers several hundred years of one man's life. It is very well written and entertaining in Robbins' own descriptive writing style. It is full of colorful characters and outrageous situations. He has a way of making the unbelievable seem probable. This fantasy covers subjects including beets, fountain of youth, savage ceremonies, a quest for the perfect taco, mythical gods, mountain nymphs, drapes vs. draperies, love, life, happiness, bees, perfume and despair. The story begins hundreds of years ago and ends today. Years ago when I first started reading Jitterbug Perfume, I picked it up a half dozen times before I got through the first chapter. (The first chapter on beets seems pretty boring but comes into play later in the story. I thoroughly enjoyed the first chapter when I went back and re-read it.) However, since that first complete reading I keep going back and re-reading this book. After 7-8 times, I still enjoy it and continue to find something I can't believe I missed previously. This book is a perfect escape from reality and is quite entertaining. You could even find a little something in here to add to your own philosophy of life."},{"Title":"Jitterbug Perfume","review":"I have read elsewhere that Tom Robbins speaks to a particular stage in life, say the 18 to 26 year old crowd, i.e. the young and idealistic. Reading his works does seem like resurgence to youth, where the world is young and magical, and the improbable (say, living to be 1000 years old) seems possible, tangible, even simple. If youth is looking forward to the future, and age is no longer believing in the future, then I will cast my lots with youth and say that I loved this book. However, it moved me a little less than the Robbins books I read in my 20s. Perhaps I don't share the wacky enthusiasm for life extension that was prevalent in the 80s (and to some extent today). Sometimes Robbins composes lines that are breath taking, paradigm shattering, and worthy of several re-reads, followed by cringe-worthy lines of silly puns and twisted metaphors. Some of the dialogue seems true to life, and some seems to be simply extended exposition. This is ultimately the strength and weakness of Robbins: he always moves to a point, a grand realization of the nature of things that he feels compelled to spell out for you. Even the best ideas tarnish with age, and this book had some doosies. Overall, however, Robbins creates worlds and ideas that are truly his own, and worthy of exploring. What other book has so directly addressed the olfactory? Read it and see."},{"Title":"Jitterbug Perfume","review":"At times, this book made me howl with laughter. The above quote is just one specific example. Extracted from the story, it's typical of Robbins' mind-blowing descriptive narrative. It hails from the &quot;New Orleans&quot; sections of the book, which detail the poignant relationship between an eccentric French Quarter dame and her assistant V'lu, an astute African-American Creole with an accent that shakes the rafters.I had read &quot;Even Cowgirls Get the Blues&quot; and &quot;Still Life with Woodpecker.&quot; It seemed that each of these novels came into my life at the most appropriate of times, helping me through some rough patches, and always, invariably, reminding me not to take life too seriously as I am want to do. &quot;Jitterbug&quot;, however, made me weep. Yes, there's a lot packed in this book. Yes, Robbins metaphors get a little heavy-handed at times. However, the story is woven so cleverly, the descriptions so lucid, I felt as if I was a part of the book. And, afterall, isn't that the point of literature, to reel us in? As usual, after reading his work, I am forever slightly altered in my chemical makeup. Knowing that I will read the book again if I begin to backslide into jadedness, paranoia, or recalcitrant routines.Read this book. Even if you don't enjoy Robbins, it will give you such food for thought that you will have to at least tip your proverbial hat at the cleverness of his prose. Where does this guy come up with these ideas? Could we be in the company of one of the great spirits of all time with Robbins? Can I acquire such colorful language and attitudes? I certainly hope so.No philosophical, political, or sociological stone is left unturned. As usual, Robbins is in rare, if not always palatable, form. I adore him! I also understand that others may have as much disdain or disinterest in his work, as I have affection. That's a good thing. I do believe that Tom Robbins would begin to worry if he gained widespread acclaim. And that, my friends, is what makes him so sublime."},{"Title":"Jitterbug Perfume","review":"I love this book so much I have to read it at least once a year. I've enjoyed all of Tom Robbins' other books, but this is by far my favorite. If I ever go through a slump of not reading, I can pull this book out and be back in the mood. The different plotlines are woven together so well, that even though I may think at the end of a section &quot;oh, I wanted more about Alobar and Kudra now&quot; I am immediately caught up in whichever character's story has taken over. You see very early on how all the characters are linked, and the way the whole thing unfolds never gets old for me. I find this book to be hilarious, imaginative, thought-provoking, inspirational, and very hopeful. I know that every re-read will end with a smile and a sense of fulfillment. I have recommended this book to every person who has ever asked me about something to read. In fact, I buy every thrift store copy I ever come across (and I can never believe that someone got rid of this book), so I have extra copies around to give to people who haven't read it. Jitterbug Perfume makes me happy every time I read it so I feel compelled to share the experience with everyone else! Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Jitterbug Perfume","review":"This is a fantastic book. If you want to know more about life, death, world history, religion, and so on, then read this book. This book is very philosophical and thought-provoking. But unlike many \\"thinky\\" books, this one leaves you feeling very happy and optimistic in the end. Being from India, my favorite character was Kudra, and I can totally see how a heroine like Kudra could change lives in my country. Indeed, Robbins's theory of how we should avoid being \\"reptilian\\" and strive towards being more \\"floral\\" is a message that should be spread all around the world. We're living in strange times, and I wish all the politicians of our world were required to read this book. Highly recommended for everyone."},{"Title":"Jitterbug Perfume","review":"N'orleans to Paris - Middle Ages to today - Greek gods to greasy spoon waitresses: this was my first exposure to Robbins back in 1990.

But I'm not talking about the &quot;The Living Hive&quot; diorama at the metropolitan museum, or a still life painting of vegetables so ugly they should be clubbed. No, it all boils and distillates down to bee pollen and beet pollen, and that is how Robbins playfully transcends the questions of evil and death. He SOMEHOW manages to even marry the two in one amazing paragraph, &quot;If the waft that streams from a freshly opened hive is intimate to the point of embarrassment, so it is with beet pollen. There is something personal about it, and something primeval.&quot;Now, I am a devoted Richard Brautigan reader, and initially all I could think of when I was reading this book was, &quot;Tom Robbins is Salieri to Richard Brautigans's Mozart.&quot; But, I have to hand it to Tom, tongue-in-fist, this book does have some Redemption Value, except in the Silliest State of Punning (alright... some of the puns are funny). And while you can tell fairly easily what parts of the book are package and what parts are payload, and the &quot;crowd&quot; scenes in particular tend to evoke the waft of a freshly opened ear of corn to the point of embarrassment, the book still delivers its hopeful homily, which is &quot;if one has a sense of humor, one can minimalize death through irony and wit.&quot;"},{"Title":"Jitterbug Perfume","review":"This is a very, very special book. Magical, wonderful, absurd, hilarious, touching, inspiring. It's got it all and does it all. Tom Robbins does a masterful job taking the reader inside his world of wonder. I've read this one 3 times and plan to read it a few more. It's that amazing. I even know one couple who read passages from this book to each other on their honeymoon. Needless to say, this book means a lot to a lot of people. Maybe you'll \\"get it\\" or maybe you won't ... but give it a try and let this novel work its magical spell on you. Alobar and Kudra would expect no less."},{"Title":"Jitterbug Perfume","review":"The completely linear thinker; the person who demands a beginning middle and end, complete with protagonist, threatening antagonist and the girl and riches our hero gets at the end will either be mildly annoyed or intensely frustrated at the plot. There is a storyline, to be sure, but it isn't as important as what Robbins is actually saying.It took me one read-through to satisfy my curiosity. I thought \\"where is this going? And what does perfume and beets have to do with any of it?\\". Even that first exploration of the novel opened my third eye - the one I didn't know was even there.Once the basic plot was understood, a second read-through was undertaken. Then a third, and a fourth. Slowly, the perfume in its pages seeped into my consciousness, and the resulting joyous epiphany became evident. This was more than a book about an ancient king named Alobar. It transcended Pan. It detested the \\"logic\\" inherent in the western lexicon. It objected strenuously at the fallacies we accept as true, the assumptions we mistakenly adopt in our walk through life.The book enlightens as gleefully as it promotes an unapologetic lust - or blush, depending upon the reader's sensitivity. In short it embraces life on a scale that no other book I've read has been able to approach, before or since."},{"Title":"Jitterbug Perfume","review":"This is my first Tom Robbins read. I was very impressed with his literary style and humour. I loved how the plot visits different points in time, but brings it all together in the end. I so enjoyed all the different characters and couldn't wait to find out what was happening with each one whenever a new chapter began. Unique and very entertaining; would definitely recommend this book."},{"Title":"Jitterbug Perfume","review":"I really loved this book. It has everything you would want in a great novel: complex characters, great dialogue, a compelling plot. The the ending leaves you with a \\"huh\\" sort of feeling. It doesn't really wrap the book up in a nice little package with a neat bow like most books do, which you could see as wonderfully different or terrible. I found it just odd. I didn't leave you with that little sigh of relief you get when you finish a book, or the bit of satisfaction that comes with finishing something. That was probably something that Robbins intended, however I just didn't like it.However, the other 99% of the book is wonderful. I wish I could give it 4 3/4 stars."},{"Title":"Jitterbug Perfume","review":"I'm an avid reader so I tend to buy more books than will ever fit on my shelf. Therefore I only keep those which are so good I know I will read them over and over again. And of all my many favorite reads, Jitterbug Perfume is near the very top.The book has a memorable cast of characters, each unique and kooky in their own way, spanning centuries of adventure yet all coming together spectacularily in the end. Not to mention it is set in three of the world's most fabulous cities: Paris, New Orleans, and (my hometown!) Seattle. Throw in an ancient fading god, mythology, sex, love, history, immortality - I guarantee you won't look at perfume the same way again."},{"Title":"Jitterbug Perfume","review":"As with anything Robbins writes I find myself hard pressed to find a way to accurately describe his work. Or the plot, or the style or even the characters come to think of it. Perhaps this is why the descriptions on the back of his books are always so obtuse, more like pieces of a puzzle that can only be deciphered upon completion of the book so that we, the readers, armed with our literary decoder rings can go back over them and say \\"ah, yes so the main character really WAS a janitor the whole time\\". But I digress.Jitterbug Perfume is dense, and while I enjoyed the book immensely it was by no means a light read. Coming across Robbins's prose is a printed equivalent of the tunnel in the original 1971 Willy Wonka film. It's a constant barrage of light, sound, taste, smell (and because this is an adult novel) sexual stimuli that, once it gets going, refuses to ever stop until the very end upon which we find ourselves spit out the other end not sure wither we're a little worse or better for the wear.As for the plot? Oh, what can I say that all the fine folks above and below me haven't already tried and failed to say in their own words. In a literal sense the story is about a 2,000 year old janitor king and his missing bride. In a figurative one it is about the potential within the reader for immortality. And in between all this there are drunken Irish men who love little girls that get their brains bashed out, bees that seek out revenge against city officials that would do Edmond Dantes proud and plenty of beets.This is not a perfect novel, it does have some very deep flaws to it, namely the stilted and overly abrupt ending which both fits into the tone of the novel and completely destroys it's pacing. And yet despite this and many other flaws it remains a worth while read, if for no other reason than it is so completely different from anything else out there on the book shelf today."},{"Title":"Jitterbug Perfume","review":"This is the book I read in-between other author's tragedies. It makes me not explode.An amazing read, to say the least."},{"Title":"Jitterbug Perfume","review":"This book made me laugh and think constantly. Tom Robbins is a rare writer who seems to get better the more self-indulgent he gets (a theory disproved in his recent work). The guy has a tendancy to birdwalk with his narratives, if only to make a few points, or ten. It's that he never loses you through all the changes of scenery and mentality that happen here that's impressive. But it's the way this book get your mind buzzing that makes it great."},{"Title":"Jitterbug Perfume","review":"I am, and have long been, a big TR fan, and I loved the first half of this novel, it was as thought provoking as anything he has written. However, just as MY Attention was peaking, I though Tom lost interest. The last third or so of the novel was not of the same quality. My impression was of an author looking for some way - any way - to wrap things up."},{"Title":"Jitterbug Perfume","review":"Jitterbug Perfume, by Tom Robbins, is about perfume and, well, BEETS - and much, much more. Although Robbins' skilled imagery appeals to all the senses, the book is, above all, a delightfully odd and heady aromatic concoction. It is an olfactory festival of being with a carnival air. My first brief whiffs were surprising, dizzying, and even somewhat disturbing as the top notes of this fragrance are lewd, irreverent, curious, and oh-so-tart. As I continued to savor the sweet and sassy smells, the more subtle middle notes began to reveal the true tone of this perfume and initiated a warmer, more sensual, and meaningful experience. Soon, I began to breathe in the deeper base notes, which fixed the theme through humor, history, and philosophy and have lingered with me ever since. Those scented accords teased and stimulated my psyche with a bouquet of essential questions about the meaning of life, death, love, work, money, and God. Robbins has combined his wild imagination, expert character-building talents, great writing ability, and unique style to create a redolent and well-rounded masterpiece of the mind. Don't miss it!"},{"Title":"Jitterbug Perfume","review":"If you've started to take life to seriously, to the point that you might even think yourself mortal, this book is the antedote. Wrapped up in all the fizzing metaphors, sexy romps, historical beetroots and throwaway gags, you'll find Buddhism with a sense of humour, spirituality with human warmth and everything you need to inspire you once conventional religion proves insufficient. And it's a good story too."},{"Title":"Jitterbug Perfume","review":"...about this book? Seriously, I'd like to know. Granted, TR regales us with dead-Pan views of Life, Universe and Everything. Yet i find the book unfunny and perhaps even boring. ...it is a sentimental, pretentious sigh of nostalgia by a 60/70ies satyr for the psychedelic highs of the good old times. So retro."},{"Title":"Jitterbug Perfume","review":"There are two kinds of &quot;best selling&quot; author.The first type skillfully produces high level pabulum meant to numb the mind and induce a pleasant state of catatonic cognitive suspension in the reader (which explains the scourge of Danville Steel).The other kind has the ability to transport us to worlds beyond our imagination, to make us see things we've never seen, to contemplate the meaning of life, and so on. Each generation produces one or two of the second type. Tom Robbins is one of these.All of Robbins novels have graced the bet seller list for quite a length of time, which speaks to their universal appeal. Most of his major works, Another Roadside Attraction, Even Cowgirls get the Blues, Still Life with Woodpecker, Skinny Legs and All, and Jitterbug Perfume have attained the status of \\"cult classic\\" as well-each with its own unique audience. I know of no other author that this can be said of.Which makes Robbins a one-of-a-kind type of author as well.In my opinion, Jitterbug Perfume is Robbins masterpiece. A novel of epic proportions, a story of great breadth, and amazing, extraordinary, eternally memorable characters, Jitterbug Perfume took my breath away.This is the seminal work of a unique, Monstrous talent.Treat yourself to the best. Read this book."},{"Title":"Jitterbug Perfume","review":"I borrowed this book from a friend and was constantly teetering on outrage and howling with laughter throughout. Some of the things he says, can be just downright sexist, but it's so absurd you have to laugh. The story line is pagan to the core and I can see it being quite offensive to some. But I was delighted with Mr. Robbins word play and the unique way he managed to make beets the central aspect of a story. His immortal characters are much more engaging than the present day seekers of a certain scent, but given it's flaws, this book is a witty and provocative read."},{"Title":"Jitterbug Perfume","review":"Tom Robbins weaves a delightful tapestry of characters, settings, and adventures in this book, and it will hook you from chapter 1. He is a masterful storyteller, putting together seemingly random elements and creating a cohesive and though-provoking tale. He has a gift for astonishingly vivid imagery, and in &quot;Jitterbug Perfume,&quot; he demonstrates an ability to evoke SCENTS for the reader. Unbelievable.Like most of his books, this one is quite a ride. And I thoroughly enjoyed it."},{"Title":"Jitterbug Perfume","review":"Robbins gift for metaphor is undeniable, his talent for onomatopeia unmatched, and his ability to discover wonder in the mundane is an extraordinary gift.Yet, as someone who has read all the other Robbins novels (this was the last), I must confess that I come away a trifle disappointed from this one ... beyond his cultivated eccentricity of prose, which is charming no doubt,there is little which makes me change the lenses with which I view the world.Perhaps I am holding him up to his own (too) high standards...but I would still reccommend this book for anybody who can get drunk on words."},{"Title":"Jitterbug Perfume","review":"Simply one of the Finest books I've ever read !! &#34;What makes Love last?&#34; One of Life's Eternal questions!

For those of you who are young, busy, and ambitious, find the time to read JP before it becomes just one more regret."},{"Title":"Jitterbug Perfume","review":"Robbins is a true American gift. He again restores the individual sentence back to the pedestal provided by predecessors like Thoreau and Nietzsche. If you like the quick and conversational style of Hemmingway then perhaps you should leave this on the shelf, but if not then you won't be disappointed by lines that capture the imagination by twisting the language, drawing the scene, and often delving deep into the sexual nature of human thought at each turn. Jitterbug Perfume follows a story line that is split across time and space through the olfactories of our atypical cast. Whether or not you care about perfume or beets you will be drawn into this tale of ambition, love, and longevity."},{"Title":"Jitterbug Perfume","review":"Personally, I find it difficult to find fault with any of Robbins's books and this particular one is my absolute favorite. You have to love a man who so clearly loves people, women especially.There's at least a little bit of Pan in Robbins and a bit of nymph in every woman. For the love of sensuality, add this book to your list."},{"Title":"Jitterbug Perfume","review":"This is one of the best books ever written. Robbins is a literary genius and a clown.

Hands down, I love this book."},{"Title":"Jitterbug Perfume","review":"What a fantastic book. Tom Robbins is a brilliant writer, and JITTERBUG PERFUME is his masterwork. It's a book rich with audacious language, glorious detail, expressive whims and fancy, fascinating characters, and takes one a trip through the scientific, the intellectual, and the absurd. At times romantic, confounding, heartfelt, insightful and undoubtedly poetic, Tom Robbins takes the reader to new places and dangerous heights that know no bounds. Unlike many stories told, JITTERBUG PERFUME actually gets better as it moves along...eventually saving the best for last. What's this book about? There's no no easy answer, nor adequate synopsis that justifies the beauty of this book. It is not about \\"a janitor with a missing bottle,\\" as the back of the book claims. It IS, however, a \\"saga.\\" That's the one thing the back of the book gets right. Yet what is it really about, you ask? Well...it's about beats. It's about death. It's about life. It's about immortality. It's about scents and smells. It's about our biological makeup and its many mysteries. It's about sex. It's about love. It's about how we choose to live, breathe, bathe and above all else...smell. JITTERBUG PERFUME will make you think. JITTERBUG PERFUME will make you want to live forever. JITTERBUG PERFUME will transform you, and force you (literally) to stop and smell the roses. This is a must-read for anyone who appreciates love, language, scents...and damn good writing."},{"Title":"Jitterbug Perfume","review":"Enter the floral age of humanity (evidently, we're past reptilian and mammal at this point), pour your entire vocabulary into a blue glass flask, sprinkle it with a bit of Pan, sex, religion, politics, family values and war, cork it, drag it across centuries, from Bohemia to Seattle to Paris to New Orleans, then give it one last shake and spill it over pages of a book - the result will be as close as you can get to understanding what Jitterbug Perfume is about. To say its epic is to say nothing at all. There is only one thing I can say about it - after reading it, you won't ever look at the beets the same. So, go ahead, open it up and take the plunge. Don't forget to look up the skirt of a mountain, oh, and eat your beets.It took me longer than usual to be done with this book. It was so densely woven into elaborate and intricate sentences that resided in long dialogues on everything under the sun, that I had to literally dip out of Tom Robbins' mind and breathe for a day or two before being able to plunge back in. In short, I adored his beautiful allegorical sentences, but I didn't care so much for the story. Will I ever pick up another book of his? Maybe in another year. Is he brilliant? Beyond any doubt. Should you read it? YES, YES, YES. You might find yourself a kingdom you never dreamed you can reach, paved with wisdoms like this: \\"The instant the reminiscence faded, the symptoms of deterioration took over, grabbing the limelight like an insecure celebrity, drowning out, with Welkian schmalz, the shy snores of embezzlers, the out-of-sync rasps of homicidal maniacs, the nocturnal whimpers of lifelong bullyboys.\\""},{"Title":"Jitterbug Perfume","review":"My 1st Tom Robbins book and it won't be my last.

It started out fast, a page turner for me, then it turn slow while he developed the characters. I did like the way it all came together at the end. He's a master at weaving plot lines. toward the end, he turned it into his personal soap box to tell us how we need to change our country and slow down the pace of our lives. I did enjoy it and would recommend it for summer reading."},{"Title":"Jitterbug Perfume","review":"Splendid. ...Briefly the book tells you that by eating right, exercising in a special way, and thinking positively you can live up to 1000 years and may be more. What the book doesn't tell you is what good would such a life be. A life devoid of adultery, booze, prostitutes, tobacco, awfully-bad-for-you, cruelly killed roasted baby lamb. Living such a life may be bad enough for even half of a millennium... :)The book is good, very good. And one of the rare examples of an author that knows his language better than most readers. It is however somewhat void of meaning. Just as the author accuses the modern Mardi Gras of being a \\"sham\\" because it has become void of meaning.This book I enjoyed the way I enjoy call-girls. Young, beautiful, experienced, willing to please, cared for, and whatever you want to call her, [it] will not be nearly as good as [it] with a woman one had to earn. Jitterbug perfume was pleasent to read but had the book taught me anything new? Except few English words, not really. Which sets this book apart from, say, Kazantzakis' Zorbas, Hasek's Svejk, Twain's Huckleberry, Bulgakov's Master and Margarita, and Steinbeck's Tortilla Flat et al.As exquisite as Jitterbug Perfume is for me it'll never make this list.

Any errors in the language above or just plain bad English are to be blamed on me and not my English teacher who is the most wonderful woman that teaches English on this little planet of ours."},{"Title":"Jitterbug Perfume","review":"The novel starts out strong but it just peters out. It feels like Robbins peeked and then had to end it to get on some other project. It's a shame too because the hocus pocus was almost believable until a certain point and then I was like - what the hell just happened? So read it but buy it cheap and used and pass it on down the line."},{"Title":"Jitterbug Perfume","review":"I struggled to finish this book - I kept wanting to like it, kept wanting there to be some sort of fulfillment at the end, but I was disappointed. I thought the characters were monochromatic and showed little to nothing in the way of development (save the two longest lived characters). Robbins also seemed to use some characters solely as mouthpieces for exposition (Wiggs Dannyboy). It reminded me of a bad movie voiceover when the point of the book wasn't coming across clearly enough through the actions and voices of the main characters.I'm the sort of person that enjoys the writing style of books often more so than the stories they tell, but I found Robbin's style to be overly clever, like he was trying too hard to keep the reader interested by using witty remarks. The \\"moral\\" of the book was fair enough, but I walked away from it thinking, \\"That's it?\\" It didn't leave me inclined to read another book by Robbins because there was so little reward in having finished Jitterbug Perfume.For clever, modern writing with more edginess, I'll continue looking to Steve Aylett, Jeff Noon or Chuck Palahniuk."},{"Title":"Jitterbug Perfume","review":"First off, someone kill Tom Robbins before he butchers literary style again. A creative writing intructor once told me &quot;You can only break the rules of writing if you do it properly.&quot; I always imagine Robbins as the kid in the back of the class muttering &quot;I'm gonna break all your stinkin' rules, bud!&quot; This book, he sticks it to the concept of metaphor, and none too subtle. But for a nonfan, I enjoyed this book. Robbins is still an excellent story-spinner, and hits on immortality with a bawdy hammer. On that, I still recommend this book. Be wary of hs styles though (people who write in second person should be forced to read choose your own adventures in hell)."},{"Title":"Jitterbug Perfume","review":"A coworker recommended this book to me, and after school finished and summer arrived, I picked it up with enthusiasm, expecting the best of absurdist comedy, in the same vain as Douglas Adams's The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, to ensue. After 342 pages however, about 112 pages too long, I was disappointed. Which is to say, a book spanning over a thousand years, on a quest for immorality and perfume, dealing with death, love, and the afterlife, this book simply fell flat. While Robbins's book does have its moments, nothing is memorable and the author comes off as desperately annoying. One of the major flaws is that Mr. Robbins does not know how to control his characters, or simply put, he does not know his characters. While we do come to know a handful of characters, they are caricatures instead that do whatever the author wills, such as compulsive sex scenes. In the end, we come to see them as flat and we can't help but become indifferent to what they do, since they are so random and without personhood. Furthermore, while Robbins does try to add depth to this novel, displaying his philosophy on life and the human condition, his message falls under partly didactic and partially unclear, becoming a hodgepodge of a dialogue between 1960 hippies culture and various world religions. Overall, this book was an unsavory waste of time by an author who while proclaimed prolific comes off instead as pathetic."},{"Title":"Jitterbug Perfume","review":"An amusing book.

If you liked Hamlet (or even if you didn't, but saw the movie) you'll be able to appreciate Jitterbug. At the core of the novel is the main character's will to live and will not to live. The story involves choices in living that all of us must make, but few of us have the courage to engross ourselves completely, having made a choice.The protagonist, Alobar, is as bold as Hamlet in his choice of individualism over conventionality. His relationships are as tumultuous as Hamlet's and Ophelia's. His destiny is as intense, but much happier in outcome.The author, Tom Robbins is not as good as Shakespeare. Nobody's even close yet. However, Robbins is as close as anyone this century. They are comparable in their ability to create emotional content, suspense and drama. The difference (of course) is Robbin's failing on the poetic side of his prose. His sentences and soliliquays don't roll off your lips quite like the emanations of Bill. (AS AN ASIDE: ROBBINS LATEST NOVEL: FIERCE INVALIDS, IS LIKELY ONE OF ROBBIN'S LAST, HE PROBABLY ONLY HAS ONE OR TWO LEFT IN HIM AND HE ISN'T GOING TO EQUAL BILL)All comparisons aside, Jitterbug is one of the greatest novels written in the 20th Century and will take it's place among the best fiction written in the English language ever."},{"Title":"Jitterbug Perfume","review":"one of the best books of the century. anyone able to read should read jitterbug perfume before they die. t'is a piece of heaven, an orgasmic thrill cloaked with words!"},{"Title":"Jitterbug Perfume","review":"Haven't read it in years and years.

A few years later, I used the book for a paper on the biblical and mythological foundations of English literature. The story is overflowing with overt and covert references to things spiritual, religious and mythological, covering ground from ancient India, Egypt, Greece and Rome to modern day. (My \\"unorthodox\\" book selection did bemuse my elderly male professor, used to papers on Shakespeare or Milton, but nonetheless pulled off an A-minus.)It is, as the editorial description says, an epic saga and touches on many topics including spirituality, nature, true love, the best of intimate relations, everlasting life and the importance of the humble beet. (Ah yes, the beet - that large, reddish purple root vegetable, staining the lips and the tips of fingers with its deep, life affirming and luscious redness...)(...)Yes. Well. It is rather difficult to explain how beets fit into the equation, so I suggest you consider reading the book and then you'll understand completely. ;-)"},{"Title":"Jitterbug Perfume","review":"One always remembers those first time events. The first flirtation. The first kiss. The first wrinkle, and like Alobar -the first grey hair. Reading Jitterbug Perfume for the first time will stay with me forever.To be honest, I have been delaying reading the last few pages for how long now, selfishly extending the pure pleasure of reading Tom Robbins'saga. An unorthodox way of reading a &quot;not put downable&quot; book, but such is the nature of this momentous book.Jitterbug Perfume is a benchmark in contemporary writing, defining an era. It is also powerful enough to start a beet revolution. Food lovers, take note: &quot;The beet is the most intense of vegetables.&quot;"},{"Title":"Jitterbug Perfume","review":"_Jitterbug Perfume_ is Tom Robbins' droll, absurdist, and often hallucinatory vision of man's continual quest for eternal youth and immortality. Wiggs Dannyboy, a Timothy Leary-like man (with an Irish brogue which keeps fading in and out) theorizes that humans have evolved from the brutish reptile, to the higher level mammal, to finally the highest plane of all: flower loving creatures, motivated by their olifactory powers, who no longer believe in violence and war. He hypothesizes that people with the greatest longevity have, among other traits, abolished death and dying from their lexicon. He also gives strong credence to the restorative powers of flowers and other odors. Dannyboy utilizes as his paragon Alobar, a former king, whom he meets while both of them are serving time in prison. Both Alobar and his equally youthful wife, Kudra, have already been living a thousand years and both, in their earlier years, escaped execution: King Alobar due to showing signs of aging and Kudra, narrowingly escaping ritual burning because of the death of her first husband. A Parisian perfumer and a New Orleans perfume retailer hope to recreate the scintillating, elusive, and soon to prove very significant odor of the few drops of perfume (formulated by Kudra many years before) still remaining in an ancient and exotic bottle that was recently retrieved from the sea, and which had the likeness of Pan, the Greek God of the woodlands and the flocks on it.Tom Robbins works on a vast canvas. The novel begins in Europe during the Dark Ages, then journeys to India, then back to Bohemia. The contemporary sections of the book transport the reader to Paris and New Orleans and back. The author deftly recounts the various myths and legends of ancient times related to love, sex, longevity, and the negative impact of religious influences. Pan figures strongly throughout the book, although Pan has been slowly fading from existence due to the public's loss of interest in him. In the old days Pan had an allegedly stimulating sexual affect on those he passed by while serenading them on his flute. The final irony is that although Pan eventually fades altogether in the modern world, his influence still remains strong, as does the desire to enhance one's youthfulness and sexual attraction."},{"Title":"Jitterbug Perfume","review":"This is one of my favorite books ever.

Robbins' takes the reader of a journey through the past couple of thousand years and, with insight and humor, uncovers such weighty dilemmas as religion and the quest for immortality. Everytime I read this book I fall more in love with the characters Alobar and Kudra and see something that I missed on a previous reading.

Combining eastern thought, love, metaphysics, and religion you have to hand it to the author of this wonder in modern literature....

I strongly recommend this to anyone who has been touched by the stick of creativity and imagination."},{"Title":"Jitterbug Perfume","review":"For over a decade no other book has been able to push this one from the top of my list.

It is a celebration of life that is superbly written. His ability to describe everyday life events is amazing. He has an outstanding command of the English language. His work is a joy to read. You will walk away from this book feeling the necessity to live life to the fullest."},{"Title":"Jitterbug Perfume","review":"Here is a simple recipe for making yourself grin so wide it hurts.1) Read Jitterbug Perfume. Absorb it. Learn it. Love it. Remember especially the scene where our hero smokes a rolled-up slipper while walking through a field. Write down the recipe for immortality. Breathe the fading odor of Pan.2) Listen to the song 'Pan Is Alive' by the Waterboys, on the CD 'Dream Harder.' Sing along with the lines &quot;Pan is dead! Long live Pan!&quot; and &quot;Some say the gods are just a myth / But guess who I've been dancing with?&quot;3) Mix well. Drive with all the windows open. Scream in delight.This is a fantastic book.And this is an author, a man, whom I would trust to design my eternity."},{"Title":"Jitterbug Perfume","review":"Robbins has an amazing command of the English language. Fans of his view his words like dazzling wild flowers. Detractors don't like the aroma emanating from them. He is verbose and his words bleed feeling, but you either love or dislike those feelings. He will pull you away from the plot on tangents, which is too disruptive for some but exceptionally entertaining for others. Tom Robbins is just that kind of author.Jitterbug Perfume is often viewed by fans as his best. And, it might be his most conventional. Therefore, this should be the one to recommend to all unfamiliar with his work."},{"Title":"Jitterbug Perfume","review":"Wow You just never know where Tom is going to take you in his books.......... But you always love it when you get there."},{"Title":"Jitterbug Perfume","review":"I love and own all of Tom Robbins books. Jitterbug Perfume is by far my favorite.

Wish I could thank him. I just loved this read! Funny, entertaining, surprising, interesting characters. Lovely. Though I finally had to Google \\"mangle-wurzel\\" as my British childhood memories were of a yellow root, not red. It is indeed a yellow beet, not red as Tom Robbins has it. Poetic license, of no import, just interest."},{"Title":"Jitterbug Perfume","review":"This book forever changed what I thought fiction was capable of. For a moment, i was uncertain that fiction, without being abstract or overly long, could describe a story impossible to tell within the confines of the film medium. I was wrong. This book totally rocked my world."},{"Title":"Jitterbug Perfume","review":"A hoot to read. I liked this one better than others he has written. In some ways it gently bashes organized religions, which I appreciated, but others may not."},{"Title":"Jitterbug Perfume","review":"This book moves through time from the ancient to the modern, and follows the story of an ancient couple that has learned how to live as long as they choose.When I first started reading it, I was questioning if it really was my kind of book. I'm glad I stuck with it! Robbins has this incredible writing style that combines well written prose with clever similes and metaphors. Just like David Letterman, he will be writing something serious and out of the blue he'll throw in something that adds a decidedly comedic mood. So it's not an easy read, but extremely enjoyable.On of the most refreshing things about the book is the way that Robbins will be writing about ancient times, and driving his points home with modern and humorous images. He was \\"shaking like the shuttle in an overachiever's loom\\" or \\"The Middle Ages hangs over history's belt like a beer belly.\\" I don't know if everybody would appreciate this kind of writing, but I loved it. I'd recommend this book to anybody."},{"Title":"Jitterbug Perfume","review":"Tom Robbins demonstrates how random and seemingly unrelated events, things and people affect each other. His beautiful perception of the characters, combined with his profound understanding of history, art, religion, geography, love, and everything else comes together to help us understand everything we don't and find the treasures that exist within this crazy world. I highly recommend Jitterbug Perfume for people who want to be entertained, intellectually stimulated, and inspired. In this book you travel through through space and time and see things from perspectives you never imagined, hang out with Mythological gods, and emerge feeling a little better about tomorrow. I can't get enough of this book or its amazing author. Period."},{"Title":"Jitterbug Perfume","review":"JITTERBUG PERFUME is among Tom Robbins' top three novels--and that's saying a lot, considering that, as far as I'm concerned, Tom Robbins is the best.In JP, Robbins takes us from Ancient Bohemia to Paris, sometime tonight, starting off with five apparently unrelated stories that are told so intricately that before even noticw, they've become one.If you're looking for a thoroughly compelling cast, a fascinating plot and some interesting discourses on the part of the author, then you shouldn't give it a second thought. Buy this book, and be glad that you did."},{"Title":"Jitterbug Perfume","review":"I thought that this book was a wonderful 'weekend at the lake; kind of book. Tom Robbin's writing is funny and filled with nuances that are rare in these these type of books. Normally, this kind of read doesn't exctie me, but I am a Robbin's fan now, and will certainly read some of his other books. The characters are spectacular, and the backround histories that appear throughout the book are almost reminiscant of Douglas Adams. Excellent book; I would suggest it to anyone- even though I prefer fantasy novels, this was an enlightening and fun read."},{"Title":"Jitterbug Perfume","review":"Looking for the meaning of life? your destiny?

Tom Robbins has always been tops at reminding us just where we stand in all this, and JITTERBUG PERFUME is his finest work. Whenever I'm feeling more than usually disgusted with it all, I reread JP. I like to give it as a gift to special people"},{"Title":"Jitterbug Perfume","review":"I couldn't put it down. This one is possibly one of Tom Robbins' best. His exploration of the human psyche and, quite frankly, his humour make this book a blast"},{"Title":"Jitterbug Perfume","review":"Anyone who likes to laugh out loud while reading, inspite of the raised eyebrows and sidelong looks, willenjoy Robbins' witty wordplay in this &quot;epic&quot; novel aboutlove, eternal life, adventure, history, perfume, humannature, and beets (that's right, beets!)"},{"Title":"Jitterbug Perfume","review":"Sure, you'll find perfume in here. You'll also find immortality, love, sex, ancient religion, beets, wisdom, revenge, double agents, lust, humor, thoughtfulness, philosophy...And wonderfully phrased statements that will make you read them twice.Jitterbug Perfume is probably one of the only books that I can honestly say that the journey really is the destination. I've never quite read anything like this before. And it's really not so much the plot of the story that keeps you going as the fully-developed characters, the ideas, and simply to see what Robbins is going to say next.In a way, it's like a train wreck: you HAVE to watch because you're overly curious, but this train wreck is more for your reading palate.But I have to admit, Tom Robbins will wear you out. There were occasions while reading this book, I put it down for something easier to read. Something that didn't make me think as much. Something that I felt I could skim and still get the author's full effect rather than a book I wanted to read every single word because of how the words were put together and written on the page.However, I will probably read this book again. I'm sure there are lots of things I missed-and if I \\"get\\" them on only a second reading, I'll be surprised.This is one of those books that will intimidate you if you are a writer. I looked up Robbins' writing style and read that he writes one sentence at a time-making sure it is the PERFECT sentence before going on to the next. His books are published as the publisher receives them and not edited. When you're reading Robbins's work, you're reading his thoughts, in the exact order he thought them in.Yes, intimidating. I couldn't do that-I'd never have anything written, period, much less have other work. But the man is a genius. And as a friend of mine stated, \\"Robbins is never inside the box.\\""},{"Title":"Jitterbug Perfume","review":"\\"Louisiana in September was like an obscene phone call from nature.

Sometimes it even sounded like heavy breathing\\"If books were fellatio then Jitterbug Perfumes sucks on a cosmic level. YES that is a compliment and high praise indeed. READ THIS BOOK oh and also eat your beets"},{"Title":"Jitterbug Perfume","review":"I've got to imagine that Tom Robbins is one of those authors that you either love or you don't. If you don't, you can probably skip most of his works; though you owe it to yourself to at least struggle through one. Me, I love Tom Robbins. His writing is quick, witty, and engaging. I found myself unable to stop turning the pages of this book (after I'd read them of course). The basic premise of the book is odd and the books takes odd twists and turns, but ultimately I felt like all was as it should be. In parts I felt like I wasn't getting the whole story, though; I wanted to get to know the non-primary characters a little better. Towards the end the book feels a little rushed and Robbins seems to take a 'Ayn Rand' approach to finishing the book by just telling you the philosophy of the book rather than leaving it up to the reader to come to the conclusion themselves. All in all, though I found this book very enjoyable and would heartily recommend it to anyone who doesn't mind a little sex every now and again."},{"Title":"Jitterbug Perfume","review":"This is my first Robbins' reading, recommended by a good friend with great taste in books. This book has just about everything I could ever ask for in a read: amazing, memorable characters that are so strange and unique that they feel all too real; dialouge lovingly rendered for each character; a wild ride across the globe, through history, customs, food, clothing, mating rituals, social class, and mythology; an amazingly intricate and creative plot that eventually ties up in the end; and finally, a grand theme that serves as the foundation to this whole wonderful, wild, imaginative, freeing ride.One gets the feeling that Robbins had a grand time writing this book. I was laughing out loud on one page, underlining passages of exquisite wisdom the next. Everything flows so naturally; the feel of this book is LIGHT, airy, featherweight. Yet like a drone or mantra, its rhythm and texture winds its way into you until you have been relaxed by Robbins' prose into another mindscape: HIS, or perhaps, yours, expanded.Robbins is a master of metaphors. And comedy. And when he combines the two, you WILL be re-reading passages wondering &quot;how did he do that?&quot; Robbins is truly a master and has a strong, unique, comedic, wise, wild, creative voice. Highly recommended. I guess I will soon be reading &quot;Jitterbug Perfume&quot; for a second, third, fourth, etc. time."},{"Title":"Jitterbug Perfume","review":"Damn, if Tom Robbins' &quot;Jitterbug Perfume&quot; isn't one of the most original, beautifully written books I've ever discovered! It is a novel that manages to be classical, comical, and comtemporary at the same time. To say that the plot involves a century-hoping effort to bottle and market the spirit of youth is like saying &quot;Being John Malcovich&quot; is the story of an actor's life.Part of what makes this book irresistable is its clever and lyrical language. Robbins describes a character getting out of a spring this way: &quot;when he surfaced, spewing and sputtering, dead leaves and the addresses of a dozen hibernating frogs strewn throughout his beard...&quot;. He describes one character's internal experience this way: &quot;... inside her swelling head... a music was rising, a happiness was rising; her dumpy old heart was rising, made buoyant and girlish again, a lost beach ball blown miles across a levee, illuminated by heat lightening.&quot;The book is amazing, really. I'm not sure I've ever seen a more unusual plot handled so deftly, or read a book with as full a canvas of unusual characters and locations. Most of all, the language will keep you hooked from sentence to sentence. There could be no plot at all and you would still keep reading."},{"Title":"Jitterbug Perfume","review":"If you have not discovered Tom Robbins yet, RUN don't walk to the bookstore or library. I have read every novel this man has put out and I can't wait for the next one. Jitterbug Perfume is by far the best, though. It's about a king who fears growing old, not because of the usual reasons, but because in his kingdom, the rules require the king to be put to death as soon as he starts to show signs of aging. When King Alobar wakes up with a gray hair in his beard, it's time to move on. He fakes his death with the help of his favorite wife and goes off into the pre-Christian world to find the secret of youth. From ancient Rome to modern New Orleans, he meets a cast of incredible characters and finds the love of his life who follows him through the ages. This is a book I've had to buy a few times, since I've loaned it out to people who loved it as much as I did. That's ok. I don't mind contributing to the best author I've seen in a long time."},{"Title":"Jitterbug Perfume","review":"As Tom Robbins is my favorite author, I may perhaps be a bit biased when writing this review. But I can honestly say that this book changed my life. I am a writer, and never before has someone taken the boundaries of the metaphor and ignored them completely. His writing style, while unconventional, is fabulous and engaging, and he manages to draw the reader into the story in the first couple of sentences. In an age when books are deemed good by people like Oprah, and Danielle Steel is making millions, it's nice to know that there are still some people out there with a complete mastery of language and plot. This book is a treasure, a quick read, and a tribute to anyone who ever believed that maybe they could live forever - if they just wished for it hard enough."},{"Title":"Jitterbug Perfume","review":"On a scale of 1-5, this book deserves a 7. Poetic, hilarious, deep, magical, honest and thought provoking, I cannot imagine a better book at this moment. This is my first Tom Robbins novel, and I so enjoyed his mixture of theory, humor and insight. Kudra and Alobar are my favorite literary couple of all time. To say much more about this completely absorbing, complex but understandable tale would be doing a disservice to the would-be reader. This is a story where the less preconceived notions one has about it, the better. It is a rapturous fable of flowers, scent, humanity, our fear of dying, lust and beauty. The essence of this book cannot be captured in a paragraph. It must be EXPERIENCED and savored. If you are into subtly, wit and the delight of \\"wordsmithing\\"by a master, read this amazing novel..."},{"Title":"Jitterbug Perfume","review":"This was my first Tom Robbins book - and I must admit, I see why he has such a passionate and devoted following. The plot is a little complicated to go into detail here - suffice it to say that it involves a Bohemian prince, Alobar, his lover and partner, Kudra, the god Pan, and a mysterious, alluring perfume that several characters in the present are near finding the secret recepie to.While the plot was entertaining, I was also smitten by Robbins' writing style. As another reviewer remarked, it is \\"cute\\" in some places, and perhaps some may even think it a bit vulgar. I found it clever and wholly enjoyable. His metaphors (and imagery) were unlike anything I have previously read. Whether it was \\"forced\\" or not is a matter of opinion; I liked the word play, which added to the playful, frolicing tone of the book. This is clearly not intended to be serious literature, and should not be read as such. Yes, Robbins makes some wry observations about perfume, the month of February and politicians - but the book is fun - and joyful and entertaining. And based on these merits, I strongly recommend it."},{"Title":"Jitterbug Perfume","review":"There can be no doubt that Tom Robbins is one of the top writers of our generation. Along with Kurt Vonnegut, Salman Rushdie, and a select few books from a select few authors, the reading generation of the last 30 years would be much worse off had these 3 authors not gone the way of the pen. Jitterbug Perfume is one of the books that gives Tom Robbins that distinction.While probably not his absolute best work, it certainly stands as a testament to Robbins' writing prowess. In this, he combines everything he excels at and produces one of the better products of his fine writing career. From cover to cover, this is rife with word elegance and plot intrigue. From discussions on immortality to ordinary topics as the beet, Robbins wows you with his words and draws you with his story. No page goes by without something making sure you admire the book at hand.This is my 2nd (or possibly 3rd) time reading this book. Over the past few years, years which bears witness to Robbins entering the later stages of his career, I have begun to wonder if these later works have tailed off, or if I might be losing my taste for his kind of writing. Two of his last 3 books are what I would call sub-standard compared to his previous works. At some point, It struck me that I just might not enjoy his writing anymore. While not thinking it probable, I picked up one of his better books to see what transpired. Sure enough, the classics are still classics. I'm not sure what that says about his later works, but his early works still stand the test of time.From a whale mask to 'lighten up' to Pan to beets to the Perfect Taco to jasmine oil and Bingo Pajama, the narrative takes twists and turns you would never expect. Not remotely ground in anyone's observable reality, Jitterbug Perfume attempts to crack the facade in your mind to represent the world you think you live in - but only to a point. Converse to this, this is an unreal world, an unreal entity, an unreal set of circumstances. Not to be confused with a metaphysical book which explores the inner you and ignores the reality of observable phenomenon around you, this book is still very much placed in the world you live, at least philosophically. This is a book that will make you laugh, wonder, and most of all think.Tom Robbins - and Jitterbug Perfume - is not for everyone. It's hard to say who will like Robbins and who will not. Either way, it's safe to say that if your favorite author is John Grisham or Tom Clancy, you probably don't want to bother. That is, unless you want your literary world (and more) to expand rapidly. Robbins lives in another snow globe than most of us. The flakes falling on his LaConner home are a different color and substance than most. Sometimes it's nice to get a glimpse of what that feels and looks like.It's strange to give a good review then not recommend a book to everyone. But this book is certainly not for everyone. A first time reader might love it, or might despise it. I'm sure there are plenty of people who dislike Robbins more than I like him. I would recommend reading some of the sample chapters before you go out and buy something of this ilk. As it so happens, I'm one of the people who really like his work, especially the early stuff. This is a perfect example of that."},{"Title":"Jitterbug Perfume","review":"Who would have thought that longevity was so closely tied to a diet high in beets and an exercise regiment consisting almost entirely of carnal aerobics.I was sold...except for the bit about beets.There is no author \\"like Tom Robbins\\". If anyone ever says, \\"Read him - he's the Tom Robbins of...oh I don't know...period westerns\\" for example --- be SKEPTICAL. In fact, do yourself a favor and never read the recommended book. You cannot immitate this author. You can attempt to re-create his lyrical prose and somewhat sequiter story-telling - but you will fail. Robbins is an absolutely singular wordsmith.Jitterbug Perfume is perhaps the best example of his superior craft at its very best. The story is an adventure spanning centuries and starring a cast of characters including the Great God, Pan. It's about perfume, beets, romantic love and lust, New Orleans, God, Society, Immortality, and humanity. Yet while tackling some of the biggest concepts and subjects near and dear to the human condition - he manages to tell a very tight sexy and compelling story.If you read just one Tom Robbins book, read this one.

This book has everything. It's basically a love story with many many great sub-plots to keep you off from doing anything else. I'm smiling just thinking about it right now.I'm very thanksful that I discovered this writer. It's very hard to define his genre 'cause his books have everything thrown it.

On the surface is a great epic story filled from start to finish with incredibly, deftly crafted witticism woven together like a nuclear Singer sewing machine on sheets of hallucigenic fuel cells, but under the surface swims a giant spiritual whale engulfing mere mortals like Fat Albert bobbing for apples. This book has been one of the most thoroughly satisfying reads since Hesse's &quot;Siddhartha&quot; or Bukowski's &quot;Pulp.&quot; Put them together in a secluded ranch in Bill Gate's backyard and you might get something half as amazing as this diamond mine that Robbins has bequeathed unto us unwitting humans. Mr. Robbins, may you live to be 1000+. That is, if you want that."},{"Title":"Jitterbug Perfume","review":"\\"Jitterbug Perfume\\" is one of the best books I have ever read. Anyone who is looking for one of those books that you can't put down should pick this up. While getting past the book's initial bizarre opening can be a challenge, it is an absolute must read. It's a love story, it's a story about friendship, and about life. It awakens the mind and spirit to a new world of immortality and desire. To read this book is to find out what it means to be truly alive."},{"Title":"Jitterbug Perfume","review":"in a year that has us brinked on the end jitterbug takes us back to a time where the human mind and heart and soul gives a sense of nostalgic belonging and relentless question of &quot;why&quot;"},{"Title":"Jitterbug Perfume","review":"I had never heard of this book or the author until I fell in love with a song from the band Now is Now that was inspired by this book so I had to read it. To call this book the most original piece of fiction I've ever read wouldn't do the book justice. As quickly as I thought I knew what was going on it would turn left and then right before I could get my bearings. The writing style is so unique, simple and eloquent all at once that I loved every page of this book. I was extremely down when it came to an end. I wanted to know more, but I'm glad that it was left open for me to imagine! What a great book!"},{"Title":"Jitterbug Perfume","review":"Tom Robbins is EXCELLENT! This book is a masterpeice and if you haven't read any Tom Robbins before I would suggest starting here. Although, I am not ashamed to say that you almost can not go wrong with any one of his books that you pick up. He's is truly a genius with writing that is politically charged, yet fun and inspiring. I would highly highly highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Jitterbug Perfume","review":"I had resigned myself to the fact that no book would ever compete with the loopy fun of Skinny Legs and All - not even another by Tom Robbins. But good lord, Jitterbug Perfume does it. This one's not as far over the top as his others, but is hilarious and warm at the same time. It's fun and insightful.As with his other books, Robbins has a few things to teach us about the world. In this book we get the nature of beets, what zippers think about, we stop to ask a fox in the woods if he's seen which way our protagonists went, we follow an ancient god through the last several centuries of his life. All this and the secret of immortality to boot. And the whole shebang is written strangely enough, primarily from the olfactory sense, making sight and sound secondary.The elegant ending is implied rather than explained: we know how it ends without actually witnessing it. A pleasing decision to end a pleasing book."},{"Title":"Jitterbug Perfume","review":"I am a newcomer to the world of Tom Robbins. I always heard of him but I really didn't know what his style was like. One day on my way home from work there was a guy reading this book on the subway. He kept laughing to himself as he read this book, so i had no choice but to read it myself to see what all the fuss was about. I must say there were many more elements of fantasy than i figured, but what a story! Who comes up with this stuff? It's somewhere between a forth grade fairy tale and a Vonnegut masterpiece. A definite recommendation to any fans of the surreal and the fantastic. 4 1/2 Stars."},{"Title":"Jitterbug Perfume","review":"I am down on my knees, waving my hands up and down in the air at the feet of the master writer, Tom Robbins, the KING of metaphors! Never, ever have I read a book that literally blew my mind on every page. This man writes as no one I've ever read before. His irony and sense of humor are sparkling. I plan to read this book over and over and over. He is the soul of wit! I LOVE YOU TOM and thanks ANGIE-BUG for turning me on to &quot;Jitterbug Perfume&quot;. I owe you for this one!"},{"Title":"Jitterbug Perfume","review":"Still Life With Woodpecker is my favorite Robbins, and this is a close second. If you like the English language at all and if you have any sort of imagination, you simply have to love this guy.He spins words in dizzying patterns, pulling thoughts and concepts and connections out of thin air like a literary magician. Even when he misses his mark you've got to give him credit for his daring. Not afraid to digress down endless allies of goofiness, Robbins occasionally finds the light at the end of the tunnel and is thrilling at those moments.The rest of the time his polymath mind teaches you all sorts of things about all sorts of things, while keeping a smile on your face. I still recall this book when I eat beets, even 20 years later.There's some very real genius in parts of Jitterbug Perfume.This book will make you think in ways you have never thought before, and learn about your mind in the process; what more can you ask of art?"},{"Title":"Jitterbug Perfume","review":"Tom Robbins is a master of the English language.He takes at least 4 different and seemingly unrelated stories (except for the one common thread of beets) and though there are times the reader has no idea how or when these stories will come together, Robbins beautifully intertwines them into a fantastic and brilliant ending that all of a sudden makes the whole story make sense.Don't take the words of those who haven't finished the book. At times it may seem like it will bog you down, but it is all worth it. This is a magnificent book."},{"Title":"Jitterbug Perfume","review":"This is such an interesting, well-written book, that I don't even know where to start. You could say the book is about searching for life everlasting. You could say the book is about making perfume and seeking the perfect fragrance. You could say the book is about a really cool 1,000-year old king named Alobar and his smart, sexy 800-year old wife. Then there's the guy with the whale mask, and beets! Lots of beets.It's hard to put a finger on what the plot actually was. But it's easy to say that the book is a fun read, it's intelligently written, and the characters are well developed and lovable.I highly recommend this book for a good time and some thought provoking dialogue."},{"Title":"Jitterbug Perfume","review":"While I loved this book when I was reading it, after I put it down, I would often pick up something else instead. I'm not sure why that was. As a whole, the story is a masterpiece of intertwined lives which all come together in the end.Personally, I found Kudra and Alobar's quest for immortality the most riveting. They were grounded. I found the other character's motives less pure, and their stories less gripping.Especially toward the end, Robbins seemed to veer off with long metaphysical quasi-scientific naraatives through one of the main characters. I found these hard to follow, and they detracted from the story for me. I was disappointed that the book ended with one of these narratives instead of with all the characters.I'll never think about beets the same way again! They always bring a smile to my face now."},{"Title":"Jitterbug Perfume","review":"Did you ever happen to read &quot;the unbearable lightness of being&quot; (written by Milan Kundera)? No? well, from a certain point of view it's a pity because Jitterbug Perfume works in a much similar way. The plot, the storyline if you want, is often a mere excuse that allows the author to make speculations on the nature of men, women, love, the universe and... well, bits of everything. Sometimes they're sarcastic ones, little more than quips, other times they're more profound... at times they'll make you smile knowingly, other times they'll push you to think about arguments that you've never pondered before. But while in Milan Kundera's novel the plot is boring and the focus is almost solely on the speculations, Jitterbug Perfume has a marvelous plot, funny and entertaining, like a fable with a wide array of characters (all of whom are interested in perfume or immortality... or both), set over the span of many centuries. That alone will get you hookes, trust me!"},{"Title":"Breakup Girl to the Rescue!: A Superhero's Guide to Love, and Lack Thereof","review":"This book contains great advice for anyone breaking-up, making-up, or anything in between. Lynn Harris (i.e. &quot;Breakup Girl&quot;) is like a wise older sister dishing out practical, down-to-earth and to-the-point advice to the lovelorn. Though most of the advice is just plain common sense (well, for me anyway), it's helpful for those who don't seem to have a lot of &quot;common sense&quot; about relationships. (And if the questions from readers are any indication, there are A LOT of people out there like that.) The book covers all the &quot;external&quot; issues of breaking-up: rebounds, reunions, post-breakup friendships, dealing with singlehood again, finding love again, even HOW to breakup. What it doesn't cover are the &quot;internal&quot; issues of breaking-up: this is not a psychological self-help book that tells you how to heal a broken heart and deal with the inevitable emotions. (For that purpose, I would recommend &quot;Mars and Venus Starting Over&quot; by John Gray.) It didn't give me a lot of new insights or advice, but it did help to reaffirm what I've known all along. This book would be more helpful for younger people who are new to relationships and facing a breakup for the first time.I was disappointed that the book didn't have more of the &quot;Breakup Girl&quot; comics that I came to love back when it was online (I still don't know why Oxygen Media decided to discontinue it). There are a few comics with a continuing storyline that illustrate the advice and situations presented in the book. They're a nice complement, but I was hoping for more."},{"Title":"Breakup Girl to the Rescue!: A Superhero's Guide to Love, and Lack Thereof","review":"As a person who's been dumped and been involved with way too many artistic moody types, this is a great book to read to reassure yourself that you aren't the one who is nuts."},{"Title":"Breakup Girl to the Rescue!: A Superhero's Guide to Love, and Lack Thereof","review":"Breakup Girl To The Rescue!: A Superhero's Guide To Love, And Lack Thereof is one of the most engaging, reader-friendly, approaches to understanding relationships and how to begin, maintain, ending, and recovering from them. Lynn Harris demonstrates an uncanny insight and a witty ability to offer advice that readers can enjoy and substantially profit from when it comes to matters of the heart. Breakup Girl To The Rescue! is enthusiastically recommended reading for anyone old enough to fall in and out of love."},{"Title":"Breakup Girl to the Rescue!: A Superhero's Guide to Love, and Lack Thereof","review":"One of the joys of looking through this very funny book, besides the generous, knowing, and very helpful relationship advice, is seeing yourself and your friends reflected in letter after letter, page after page. It's funny because it's all true--all of these things probably happened to you or someone you know one time or another, and you really identify with the plights of the real people asking Breakup Girl for her witty help. There's loads of helpful words to soothe you through any problems in any stage of a relationship, and enough really great stuff to keep you highly entertained throughout the rest of the book. And hey, an original Breakup Girl comic adventure to boot!"},{"Title":"Breakup Girl to the Rescue!: A Superhero's Guide to Love, and Lack Thereof","review":"You don't need a current hole in your heart to profit from Breakup Girl's sly and provocative wisdom. Don't be deceived--she is much more than Dear Abby with better hair, a delicious sense of humor and probably a Mensa card. Breakup Girl is a shrewd chronicler of urban angst and The Way We Are Now. Her talent for capturing complex feelings of need and entitlement in the Millenial variety of relationship issues never fails to amuse (e.g. on Long-Distance Relationships--&quot;If you really loved me, you'd take the Concorde.&quot;) Breakup Girl is an original-- online or off. I suggest that anyone who wants to discover a new way to enjoy the famously painful quest for a partner ought to click the Shopping Cart bar without further pause."},{"Title":"Breakup Girl to the Rescue!: A Superhero's Guide to Love, and Lack Thereof","review":"The very same day I got this book, a friend came to me for advice. Thanks to the few chapters I had read so far, I was able to help her out. This book is helpful for everyone who is in a relationship, who wants to be, or who hasn't recovered from the last one. Even if you don't consider yourself in any of those categories, the advice is useful to know--when your friends come to cry on your shoulder and ask what's wrong in the world, you'll be able to help them out. (Also, as adamantly as you may not be looking for a relationship, sooner or later you'll find yourself in one, or at least wanting to be in one, at which point you'll be glad you have it on the shelf.) The book is very engaging. It's clear prose is very direct, but still entertaining. Throughout the chapters, real e-mails sent to her web site are printed to illustrate the points (and remind the reader he/she isn't alone). That, perhaps, points to the primary strength of the book: Ms. Harris is only an expert because she's been through it all. Her book is very knowing, entertaining, and (the bottom line) helpful. Highly recommended to everyone who isn't in an arranged betrothal."},{"Title":"Breakup Girl to the Rescue!: A Superhero's Guide to Love, and Lack Thereof","review":"Anyone who's a follower of Breakup Girl's website will not be surprised at how good this book is. It's full of the wisdom and wit I've come to expect from this terrifically sharp and funny lady--and more. There are essays and comics and Breakup Girl Maxims and tons of good stuff. For someone going through a breakup, it's a must. But it's enormously helpful for anyone, in or out of a relationship. And it's a great read. Breakup Girl always has smart things to say--and always says them in a funny, entertaining way. You can't help but love and learn from this book! I sure did."},{"Title":"Breakup Girl to the Rescue!: A Superhero's Guide to Love, and Lack Thereof","review":"Who can figure out relationships? If anyone can, it's the author of this book. I can't stand the glut of self-help books comparing men and women to extraterrestial aliens or wounded inner children.

For women, men, and anyone interested in exploring the confusion and nuttiness of &quot;relationship,&quot; -- Breakup Girl is THE heroine for the Millenium."},{"Title":"Breakup Girl to the Rescue!: A Superhero's Guide to Love, and Lack Thereof","review":"I was first introduced to breakup girl online.

Also, Wolf Rider is addicting, so you can't stop reading it. I liked this book because it is realistic enough for you to feel like you know the character really well.

Andy's friend, Paul, was next to him when he got the call and he called the police, but they said it was just a prank call. Paul also thought the call was a prank.

I was truly disappointed. The whole story is based on the premise that no adult authority figure takes a responsible teenager seriously when he reports receiving a phone call from a man who claims he has killed someone. His father, a college professor, who supposedly has a very close and positive relationship with his son, just blows him off. Then the police, school counselor and others begin to think the teenager himself is to blame, and is suffering from emotional distress over the death of his mom a year ago. But these conclusions are never justified by the boy's actions, which are reasonable.Eventually the boy becomes totally disillusioned with the authorities as well as his father. I'm afraid that youngsters reading this might find the story more plausible than it is, and also become disillusioned and less likely to share their concerns with trustworthy adults.This is a depressing story, as well as very implausible."},{"Title":"Wolf Rider","review":"When I first read the first page of this book with the phone call saying someone was murdered, I was reluctant to read on, but I'm glad I did.

I could see and feel the characters in that book, I was soo into it that even a knock at my door sent me chills, this is definitely a book that you should read if you want to get your mind away for things. I strongly recommend people to read this book especially if you like mysteries or even if you don't, I'm not too fond of mysteries, but this was an amazing book.amandaBRMS"},{"Title":"Wolf Rider","review":"Wow, that was the best book I have ever read.

I would say that Andy's character is well developed but he is not the main focus of this novel. The main focus is the fact that Andy is always doing the things that are right for others. Also, the book is mainly told through Andy's eyes. What I loved most was there was always something going on, and there was never a dull moment.The story begins when Andy receives a phone call. A voice Andy didnt recognise is on the line. \\"Hello\\", says Andy. \\"I just killed someone\\", sayd the man on the line. \\"I dont understand\\", says Andy, shocked and confused. \\"I killed her, I killed Nina\\", says the voice.

You're in for a ride when you read this!"},{"Title":"Wolf Rider","review":"The book, Wolf Rider, by AVI, I considered to be an immensly suspensful and well-written book. The main character of the book is a boy named Andrew, (who is called Andy for short)who's a normal teenager until one day he receives one out of the ordinary phone call late one night. I would say that Andy's character is fairly well developed. I wouldn't say that one of the main focuses of the story is on Andy's personality traits, though. The main focus is the fact that Andy always wants to try to do what's right for others. But, his personality and relationships aren't deeply discussed in the book. Also, the book is mainly told through Andy's eyes; occasionally you are able to see things through Lucas' eyes. It is mainly a quick-paced book, where something is always is always happening. The story begins when Andy receives a phone call. A voice Andy doesn't recognize is on the other line. \\"Hello?\\" says Andy. \\"I just killed someone,\\" says the man on the other line. \\"I don't understand,\\" says Andy shocked and confused. \\"I killed her, I killed Nina.\\" says the voice. Paul, Andy's good friend walks in the door. The man on the other line starts describing Nina. He said that she wouldn't go dancing with him so he stabbed her. Andy is in shock. \\"What should I do?\\" asks the man. Eventually the man says that he has to go and hangs up the phone. Andy, both stunned and scared asks Paul if he thinks that call was just some joke. He says yes, but Andy still isn't convinced. In the book it seems to be that Andy is the type of person who will fight for things that are right. For example, Andy searches and searches for clues to who has been calling, just to protect a life of which he hardly knows. So, who knows to what extent he would go to help a loved one.Finally, after searching for clues, Andy knows that, since he just recently moved to his home, not many people have his phone number. So, he figures that, since his dad left their number with his secretary, the caller might have been someone from his dad's work. Andy had tried all the numbers but one and so far none of the voices matched, until he got to the last number on the list. The voice on the other line sounded exactly like the one that had called him saying he killed someone. \\"May I ask who this is?\\" says Andy. \\"Lucas,\\" says the man on the other line. Andy asks his dad if he knows who Lucas ia and his dad says that he did and that Lucas' office was near his. His dad also said that Andy was taking all of this way too seriously abd shoudl go on a vacation to visit his aunt to take his mind off of all this stress.So Abdy ignores his dad's advice and decides to call Lucas and tells him to meet Nina at one of her acting class buildings(since they went to school together, but they really didn't know eachother that well). Lucas agrees and hangs up. Andy had told Lucas that Nina had wanted to meet up with him abd was eager to see him, even though all of that was a lie. So Andy waits near the building behind a tree to see if Lucas arrives. Finally, Andy hears footprints and thinks \\"Lucas must be arriving,\\" when suddenly a hand comes up behind him........."},{"Title":"Wolf Rider","review":"Wolf Rider is an epic story of a boy named Andy who gets a phone call. On the other line he hears \\"I killed someone,\\" as Avi, the author writes. The story is about the boy, Andy trying to find the guy who called himself Zeke on the phone. Andy's dad said he hadn't heard of any killings at the college. Since Andy's dad works at the college Andy tries to find the college student that Zeke said he killed. No one believes Andy that the call is real, so Andy has to do everything himself. The way Avi writes will leave you hanging every paragraph.

But he is bound and determined to prove it is true, looking all over for help, and trying to find his own proof. It's not the most realistic book, but still is a book that keeps you on the end of chair, and on your tips of your toes. The cover or title didn't catch my eye.

I highly recommend it to you."},{"Title":"Wolf Rider","review":"Maybe I'm extremely weird, but it's been nine years since I bought this book, and I still read it just for fun every once in a while. The characters are great, as well as the plot. What may be this novel's most endearing quality is that it not only shows suspense, but it also accurately portrays the volatile relationship between a father and a teenage son. That's rare in a young adult book. And I'm so tired of reading thrillers about wimpy girls who can't take care of themselves, but this book didn't have that. This book had no trouble keeping my attention."},{"Title":"Wolf Rider","review":"Wolf Rider is a well written book with a lot of suspense and drama. Avi does a nice job of getting the reader's attention in the very beginning of the book, drawing him/her in with a extremely mysterious phone call. Aside from a few confusing parts in the middle and towards the end of the book, Wolf Rider's plot is almost flawless. Avi uses deductive thinking skills and almost unoticable clues to help stregthen the story line and make the novel more interesting. I would recommend Wolf Rider to anybody who really likes to see or read about mysteries unfolding or those who just are interested in critical thinking problems in general."},{"Title":"Wolf Rider","review":"CodyHuntley Middle School12-6-04Wolf Rider 0-02-041513-3SAVIWhat would you do if a guy called and told you that he had killed a girl? What if he also told you where he was and why he did? Andy, the main character, had hung up from the phone with a suspicion that he really killed someone. His dad is a teacher at the near by college. When he had called the police they said that they would take care of it. He figured that the police would have found if he had really killed her. Andy then calls the police and is told that there were no killings and that he probably was a prank caller. He waited a few days and started to get bothered by the fact no one believes him. He then tries to research who this guy was and how he got the number. The weird thing was they had changed numbers 3 days before the call. Andy then finds out that there is a girl with the name the killer had said.I bet your asking if this is really a good book to read, right? Yea, this is probably one of the most interesting stories I have ever read. I am into exciting books where you can't actually predict what happens. This is defiantly a page-turner. The first five pages will make you want to keep on reading. I am a hard person to get my attention because I lose interest fast. It was not that hard to concentrate on the main focus of the story. I think that I made a connect to the main character because he sticks to what he believes in like I do. He knows that nobody will believe so he takes matters into his own hands. I mostly enjoy this genre of books because mysteries are unreliable stories. I enjoyed how AVI wrote the book because of the whole topic of the story. The part when Andy meets the girl with the name the killer mentions pretty much freaks out about him. This book is defiantly not boring but every chapter ends with a cliffhanger because of how Andy solves this mystery. The plot of the book was written by one of the greatest authors of all time."},{"Title":"Wolf Rider","review":"The phone rang three times before Andy picked up. \\"I killedsomeone.\\" That was the first thing said in this amazing wonderful book.

He finally decides to investigate himself. That gets him into more than he bargand for.I think this book is amazing and very energetic. It keeps you guessing all through the book. I was speechless by the end of the book. You start to feel what the characters are feeling scared, excited,and clueless about who the prankster is. You wont want to put it down.

We are given no proof as why none of the adults even listen to him. Does he have a record with the police concerning crank-calls? The answer is no. So why aren't the police in this book doing there job? The answer is the author never throughly thought this story through. This story play upon the paranoia of a teenager as being the outsider, the outcast, standing alone in the world, and trying to be a hero in the end.

This book has a lot of interesting aspects. It&iexcl;s full of some unanswered questions. Most questions you have to figure out yourself.This novel is full of determination coming from a young man named Andy Zadinski, he is the main character. His determination is toward showing everyone that &iexcl;Zeke&iexcl; is real. This man Zeke called Andy and started saying that he killed someone and asked Andy what he should do now. Andy started talking to the man and asking him questions. Then the man on the other line hung up and Andy called the police. The police told him it was probably a prank but Andy and I believed not.There are a lot of characters mentioned in this book. But there are only few main characters. First there is Andy, I told you a lot about him already, but there is more to be mentioned. Andy is a young man, with a lot of courage and determination. He sets his mind to one thing and doesn&iexcl;t let it go until people believe him. Now I should tell you about this mysterious Zeke guy. I think he is kind of freaky. He sounds like an old man. But you never know, it could be just a mean prank call.Andy&iexcl;s house is kind of big. Andy has a big room too. He and his dad spend most of their time out of the house or hiding away in their rooms. Nina&iexcl;s house is kind of big too. She doesn&iexcl;t spend much time there though. Nina spends most of her time at the university. The university is where she goes to school and she also works as a librarian. It&iexcl;s got a lot of students, rooms, and teachers.I think that&iexcl;s all I&iexcl;m going to tell you about this book because I will probably give the ending away (that&iexcl;s the best part). It&iexcl;s best told by AVI. So you better go check it out from your local library. Read this awesome book."},{"Title":"Wolf Rider","review":"Tyler Lawrence 11/26/04Wolf Rider, Avi, ISBN 0-02-041513-3\\"I just killed someone.\\" How would you feel if someone you didn't know said that to you on the phone. Would you take it as some sick joke and hang up, or would you take it seriously and really be worried? Well that is what happened in the book Wolf Rider. Andy Zadinski, a high-school student who lives in the Madison, Wisconsin area, is at his house with a friend when he gets a phone call. The phone call is supposedly from a guy named Zeke saying that he just killed a girl named Nina Klemmer. Andy's mother had just recently died so he doesn't take this as a joke. He calls the police and they say that it was probably a joke and tell him not to worry. One day however, Andy discovers that Nina Klemmer is real and is alive. Can Andy uncover the mystery of Zeke? Read Wolf Rider to find out.This book was very good and fun to read. Avi makes it such a good book by placing many cliffhangers and putting in suspense throughout wanting to read more. The genre was realistic fiction because even though these characters aren't real, this could probably happen in real life and probably did at some point. This makes the story a whole lot easier to understand and to connect to the characters. The one character that I could connect to the most is Andy. This could happen to anyone at anytime in real life. I don't know what I'd do if someone called me and said that. It must have been really hard for Andy. I recommend this book to anyone who is the entire book. I enjoyed the genre of this book a lot. I could not stop reading it! Every time that I was about to call it quits for the day, I ended up interested in the realistic fiction genre. The age, though, is probably ages 11 and up. Younger kids might not understand fake calling and saying that they killed someone. Besides those ages, this is a book that everyone would enjoy."},{"Title":"Wolf Rider","review":"This book is about a boy named Andy Zadinski.Andy gets a strange phone call from someone who just said that they had killed someone,so Andy wanted to figure out who had just called him and if he really did kill someone.So Andy went searching for the person that the person on the phone said he had killed.So if you guys want to figure out what happened,you will have to read the book on your own time.I gave this book 5 stars because it starts off with someone saying that they killed someone and it makes you want to keep on reading it to see what happeneds.The book has a lot of action and mystery in it."},{"Title":"Wolf Rider","review":"The book \\"Wolf Rider\\" by Avi is about a boy named Andrew Zadinski and his mysterious call by a boy named Zeke who had just killd someone. The book contains 202 pages of entertaining suspense. It takes place around present time in a small-unrevealed town.At first Andy was convinced that the caller who had just killed a girl named Nina Klemmer was serious. Shortly after he had his best friend Paul call the police at a payphone so Andy could keep the caller named Zeke on the phone as long as possible. A few days later Andy had been at a college where his father, known as Dr. Zadinski worked. as Andy waited for his father in his office he looked through school files to see if the so-called Nina Klemmer was real. He soon learned that Nina Klemmer was real and had happened to still be alive. Andy became confused and wanted to get to the bottom of this.As I read the book I found the plot to be interesting as well as entertaining. The characters such as Andy, Zeke, Paul and Nina seemed as though they were real people and yet believably wwritten. The story consisted of wild twists and turns like around the beginning when Andy realized that Nina Klemmer had existed and still alive. After he discovered this, Andy wasn't sure what to believe.I think the book was a good story to read but it wasn't the best because it is the kind of story people have either experienced, and/or heard of. But other than that I think it is a good book for people who are in the mood to read a mystery.What I thought wasn't necessary for the story was the part where nobody did anything about the situation just because they didn't believe Andy's story. In real life if somebody were to come to the police about something like that, they'd be on that case in a matter of minutes.In conclusion I found the book to be a little easy to read because it is another typical mystery. But as I stated earlier, the book was a good story to read because it had a little suspense, a little lust and a turning point toward the end.So if young adults and older are looking for an easy mystery to solve than I'd recommend \\"Wolf Rider\\" by Avi."},{"Title":"Wolf Rider","review":"It was great you cant put it down (I'd know I read it in one day).

It's about boy named Andy. One day while in the comforts of his home, he recieves a mysterious phone call from a stranger saying, &quot;I just killed Nina&quot;.

I thought it was clever of him to try to lure the caller into giving him extra information. He also called the police and told his father about the call, but they didn't belive this call was real and blew it off as a joke. However, Andy had that gut feeling. He knew that that person was out there, and he would find this mysterious &quot;murderer&quot;. I felt that this novel was very suspenceful and kept me turning the pages.

It all starts out with a 15 year old boy whose name is Andy. He has just moved into a new house with his father. Then, one day a mysterious guy calls him and says that he just killed a girl named Nina. While everyone thinks that this was a fake or a prank call Andy thinks that the call was real and wants to get to the bottom of it. While he tries to find out information on Nina she ends up saying that he was harrassing her, but she doesn't press any charges. She dosen't believe anything that Andy was trying to tell her. If you would like to find out what happens in the end you will have to get the book and read it. When I read this book it made me want to keep reading. When you stop reading it, it will leave you hanging. You will want to find out what happens next. If you don't like to read after you get done you will want to read a lot more.

The chain of eventa is kinda slow until the last couple of chapters. Personaly, I think that this could have happened to a real person. I also think that this book could use a little more &quot;zip&quot;. This book seams to be of the horror and nonfiction-yet-still-fiction type of book. I would recomend this book to people that read on grade levels between 4 and 7, no more and no less. Also for those people that like a horror story without the gory details.

She is an amazing author. This book has a lot of interesting aspects. It's full of some unanswered questions. Most questions you have to figure out yourself.This novel is full of determination coming from a young man named Andy Zadinski, he is the main character. His determination is toward showing everyone that \\"Zeke\\" is real. This man Zeke called Andy and started saying that he killed someone and asked Andy what he should do now. Andy started talking to the man and asking him questions. Then the man on the other line hung up and Andy called the police. The police told him it was probably a prank but Andy and I believed not.There are a lot of characters mentioned in this book. But there are only few main characters. First there is Andy, I told you a lot about him already, but there is more to be mentioned. Andy is a young man, with a lot of courage and determination. He sets his mind to one thing and doesn't let it go until people believe him. Now I should tell you about this mysterious Zeke guy. I think he is kind of freaky. He sounds like an old man. But you never know, it could be just a mean prank call.Andy's house is kind of big. Andy has a big room too. He and his dad spend most of their time out of the house or hiding away in their rooms. Nina's house is kind of big too. She doesn't spend much time there though. Nina spends most of her time at the university. The university is where she goes to school and she also works as a librarian. It's got a lot of students, rooms, and teachers.I think that's all I'm going to tell you about this book because I will probably give the ending away (that's the best part). It's best told by AVI. So you better go check it out from your local library. Read this awesome book."},{"Title":"Wolf Rider","review":"I think Wolf Rider is an interesting book. It is easy to keep up with and read.

Well... this has happened to a kid named Andy Zadinski in the novel Wolfrider. Andy is convinced that the call is real, but there is one problem, no one in town believes him, not even his father. When he goes to tell the school counselor, she explains the story of the boy who cried wolf. Then when he goes to explain the phone call to his Dad, he said that someone was playing a joke on him. The police tell him the same thing. One other main reason Andy does not think death is not a joke is because his mother had just died recently, and Andy took her death pretty badly. Since no one believes Andy, he decides to go on an investigation of his own, but he soon finds out that he has got himself into something deeper that he had anticipated.In the book Wolfrider Andy shows us to believe what we want to and to never give up on what we believe in. In Wolfrider this theme runs throughout the story. Andy received a phone call that he believes is authentic, but no one will believe him. In the scene where Andy told his Dad about the phone call, the dad said, \\"Sounds like a sick joke.\\" Andy said, \\"I believed it.\\" In the example it shows that Andy believes the phone call is not a joke, but Andy receives the same response from everyone else he tries to let know about the phone call. So he decides to continue his investigation on his own. Soon he finds out that the phone call was false, but the killer has a plan to kill Nina. If Andy had never given up on his investigation he would not be able to protect Nina.I recommend this book to middle-aged readers, between the ages of 12- 14. I recommend this book to this reading group because I feel that the book setting and plot are a little confusing for any one younger. Also, the way the book is written, a person would probably imagine blood and gore. I also believe that if a younger person reads this book he or she might get scared. For example, when Andy was in the middle of the phone call with Zeke, Zeke tells Andy that he has the body right in front of him. \\"The man who said he was Zeke could see the body in front of him.\\" Also, I think that you need a good remembrance of details in the beginning of the book to the end of the book. In the phone call Zeke said Nina had a car. \\"She has a car. A red Ford. An Escort. I don't have a car.\\" At the end of the book he had seen Nina and her red Ford Escort at the park. I really enjoyed reading this book. In conclusion if you like murder plus a mystery, this is the book for you. Read this book."},{"Title":"Christmas Town (Love Inspired #48)","review":"This was only an average read. I wasn't \\"excited\\" about anything that happened in this book.

I also agree with one point from some of the other less complimentary reviews that Webb's narrative does not hold any punches with regard to her opinion/feelings about Mormonism. She was bitter and it does come through (to say the least). If she were around today and had taken a memoir class or two, she'd have been able to wrestle that bitterness out of the narrative for improved readability (it just gets a little thick from time to time and hard to wade through). But IMHO, the bitterness does not at all make her story less credible. I forgive the loaded negative opinion. Through experience, she earned the right to express it. She's like a war vet turned war protestor. Her truth may represent uncomfortable emphasis... the worst of it. But it's certainly believable. A fascinating, unsanitized, raw personal account from a controversial time and place in American history... delivered by an unexpected *female* narrator."},{"Title":"Wife, No. 19","review":"It was one of the most boring books I've ever read.

It is a classic work. Ann Young made alot of money off of this book, as did she touring the united states on the same pulpit. For that it deserves five stars. It had a profound effect upon how non-Mormon AMericans perceived Utah Mormons. With that said, i was disappointed to see so many reviews tout this as \\"true\\" or valuable history in and of itself. Such reviewers need to step back and take some courses in both AMerican history and critical thinking and theory. You read this book to know what nineteenth-century Americans were being told about Utah polygamy, not as accurate history of what really happened. Such is identical and equally intellectually naive and embarrassing as saying Maria Monk's expose (written in the 1830s) of catholic convents was also true history. For literature on the historical placements of such nineteenth century novels and exposes see Terryl Givens, Viper on the Hearth; Sarah Gordon, The Mormon Question; Ann Douglass, The Feminization of American culture, and Franchot, Roads to Rome."},{"Title":"Wife, No. 19","review":"I read about 1/3 of it and lost interest. I was especially interested in Ann's book since she was in a position to offer an intimate insight into the life of Brigham Young, which is when most of the policy of polygamy was formed. I praise Ann for her courage in escaping the only life in which she was raised and had known and deciding on her own beliefs. She was obviously very traumatized by the whole ordeal. Every sentence spews a bitter hatred not only for polygamy but for the whole religion and supporters. I don't believe her account of events is very accurate. It varies too much from other accounts I've read and the overwhelming bitterness makes me think she was too affected to give an accurate account."},{"Title":"Wife, No. 19","review":"I just want to make clarifications on some of the reviews I have read here. First off, Anna Young was not Brigham's 19th wife. A brief look at his family history will clarify this. Furthermore, most Historians agree that Young's autobiography lacks significant substance when it comes to her accusations against both Brigham Young and the Mormon Church. Her writing style is at best entertaining, reflective of similar accounts of frustration with Mormonism. See T.H. Stenhouse's &quot;Female Life Among The Mormons&quot; as an example published in 1872. More critical accounts of polygamy and the like can be found. Consider reading Van Wagner's &quot;Mormon Polygamy&quot; or Hardy's &quot;Solemn Covenant.&quot;"},{"Title":"Wife, No. 19","review":"Ann Eliza Young was President Brigham Young's 19th wife. This book is a reproduction of her own autobiography. It is obvious in the book that Young expected much more from her marriage with President Young than he did. She apparantly expected Young to be much more attentive, affectionate, and caring for her. Young for whatever reasons, (running a church, a territory and having 20 other wives might have something to do with it), was not able to offer Ann Eliza the marriage she wanted. Ann's problem is more with Brigham Young as a husband and father than the Mormon church itself. One reading her tale should sympathize with her but should be wary about her bias in telling about Mormon beliefs."},{"Title":"Wife, No. 19","review":"Autobiographies of polygamist women who leave the faith in the 19th century are hard to find and I treasure this one. The book is written by Ann Eliza Webb, wife of Brigham Young, who leaves the faith and exposes the world of Mormon polygamy. Many women were victims to the abusive \\"highest principle\\" of the Mormon faith.I have trouble reading some of the negative reviews from people calling this victim \\"disgruntled\\" or expecting too much from her marriage. Here is a woman who was born & raised into a polygamous family and indoctrinated into a religion that teaches she will be damned to hell if she leaves the church, and makes unimaginable sacrifices in living her religion. She was brave enough to escape and apostatize from the faith, losing her eternal salvation and even risking her life.It's interesting that a victim of religious coerced polygamy has her story labeled as fiction and lies by some reviewers. Would these same Mormons judge the current FLDS polygamist women who escape and tell their stories as liars and disgruntled?What I found fascinating was her steadfast faith in God, despite the indoctrination she was forced to deprogram herself from. She spent the rest of her life educating the public about the abuse of living in the culture of 19th century Mormon polygamy.This is not a book for exact historical dates or statements (she is not a historian) but an excellent book for what polygamy was really like for the women behind closed doors. The messages they gave in public forums were for the church and encouraged by the leaders. Having a first hand account of living \\"the principle\\" in 19th century Mormonism makes this book very unique.I highly recommend the books \\"Mormon Polygamy\\" by Richard Van Wagoner or \\"In Sacred Loneliness\\" by Todd Compton for further information on Mormon Polygamy."},{"Title":"Wife, No. 19","review":"Ann Eliza Young was a 19th century LDS woman who was born into the second generation of Mormon polygamy. One of the most heart-wrenching parts of the book recounts how her mother heartbrokenly went from being her father's only wife for years before polygamy was introduced, to being only one of his wives, after church leaders pushed polygamy on their congregation.Mrs. Young (she was married to Brigham Young himself) finally decided to escape and speak out against the polygamist lifestyle she and so many other women in her community found devastating. Although the book was written well over a century ago, it exposes many of the same problems as contemporary polygamy memoirs (such as Escape, Shattered Dreams and His Favorite Wife, all of which I recommend). These are:1. The lower status of women in polygamist society;2. Men (even wealthy men) who do not provide financially for their huge plural families;3. Lack of education, and children pressured to quit school early and work to support and care for their father's plural families;4. Pressure on women to marry against their will;5. Physically and/or emotionally abusive behavior of husbands whose religion and community give them total power over their wives;6. Husbands who dote on favorite wives while neglecting the others;7. Unhappy households that feature intense jealousy and competition among plural wives;8. Most of all, the profound and lasting pain felt by good, loving women whose religion and community compel them to share their husbands (they are told there is no way to heaven except through polygamy).This is an excellent primary source about early Mormonism in general (it contains a first-generation family narrative that describes the church's history) and polygamy in particular. Highly recommended to anyone interested in either subject."},{"Title":"Wife, No. 19","review":"Having grown up in Utah I have always had a romantically clowded historical view of the Mormons, (as conveyed by the Mormons of course). My eyes were wide throughout this book as I turned page to page I have read other accounts of Mormon history with none being as honest as this. And to think this &quot;land of Zion&quot; was built upon such evil and hypocricy If you have ever lived and learned in the state of Utah, I strongly reccommend this book. I personally will never look at the LDS Church the same again, and I don't think you will either."},{"Title":"Wife, No. 19","review":"If I ever had any warm and fuzzy feelings about the Mormon Church and especially its founders and early disciples, this very credible eyewitness account sent those feelings into the dustbin of history.Though the writing is not perfect by today's standards, Ann Eliza Young's personal story is very believable (I believe it is authentic) and yet incomprehensible (I am astounded that so many people put up with the religion she describes) at the same time.This is the quite detailed personal memoir of a girl who grew up in a Mormon family and became the 19th polygamous wife of Brigham Young. She finally became so disillusioned that she took the very dangerous and rare step of leaving him and divorcing him. Even more astounding for her day and age, she went on the lecture tour and exposed the Mormons and polygamy for what it was (from her point of view at least).Anybody looking for details of the sex lives of polygamous spouses will be disappointed, as there is no information on that matter whatsoever. (At the very end of the book she hints that there were gross injustices and humiliations of a personal and private nature that she would not reveal.)I enjoyed reading the book though I was appalled at the story it told. Any student of the history of the Latter-day Saints should read this book. I bet it isn't to be found in the bookstore of Brigham Young University."},{"Title":"Wife, No. 19","review":"This book was amazing. My childhood education on Mormonism was very biased as you would expect growing up in a Mormon family.What struck me about this book, were the parallels between what Eliza went through and what a modern day LDS girl goes through. One being that you are fed only what you are allowed to believe and controlled through emotional/financial/social measures. Today it is different from the extremes that Brigham Young took, but it is very interesting to see where it all started.One reviewer commented on how taking a wife was compared to 'buying the cow'. I have heard this comment made before; in a different form, but still comparing a woman to a cow.Polygamy is positioned within the Mormon church as a one-time(time period) earthly necessity - that the women 'needed' the men to care for them. It is obvious from Eliza's account that this arrangement had NOTHING to do with caring for women and children. Reading her story reinforces my adult assumption that of course polygamy was instituted for other reasons. And the way that it was instituted is another story.The hand carts were another part of the story that horrified me. Today, I am told that the youth of the Mormon church are encouraged to actually dress up as emigrating saints and pull a hand cart across the mountains for a few days with only the necessities(little do they know that they should be carrying less necessities and should be stuck in the freezing mountains - not beautiful summer). So that they can appreciate how hard life was for the early saints, and grow their faith. When I hear about these productions, I am sick to my stomach thinking of the real suffering that these people went through; for example, how they were lied to in order to persuade them to make this trek, and how church leaders actually jeapordized their safety.If you were raised in the LDS religion, the stories in this book will be eye opening when you compare with what you have learned and experienced. You must read it for perspective!!If you are not LDS, please do not let this be your only source - as with any historical gathering of evidence.Eliza's story is historically interesting; because it is an autobiography, it is like an old friend telling the stories from their life.I highly recommend it!"},{"Title":"Wife, No. 19","review":"This is an amazing book about the founders of a new faith in a new world. It's no wonder that the Mormon church tried to destroy these. My mother found a first edition copy of this book at an estate sale, and so we bought it here because we were afraid to read the old one (it might fall apart). It's a well told story by a brave woman who speaks with clarity and force about the beginnings of the Mormon church in Utah.Mormons will not like this book. Non-mormons with open minds probably will."},{"Title":"Wife, No. 19","review":"I have the original 1875 book. Ann-Eliza Young's writing style is wonderful. I did not want to put the book down.She brings you right into the story/history of the Mormons and of her family.I would recommend this book to anyone."},{"Title":"Wife, No. 19","review":"This book is one of the most interesting accounts of early Mormon life I have come across. Not only is the author a gifted storyteller, she witnessed the incredible events related to the establishment of the Utah Mormon stronghold. Most Mormon witnesses are reverential, sanctimonious, and overly respectful. This author paints a picture of the various &quot;Saints&quot; as human, flawed, and totally believable. Her portrayal of her husband, Brigham Young was fascinating--revealing his strategies for holding onto power and controlling his subjects and giving an unvarnished view of his personality and character. The story of the emmigrant hand-cart train from England to Utah was heart wrenching. Meagerly equipped with poorly built handcarts, the weak emmigrants were sent West in an ill-fated attempt that resulted in the deaths of 5/6ths of the pitiful pilgrims. The machinations of Brigham Young and his apostles were clearly exposed in a compelling and honest fashion. This book should be read by every student of Western U.S. History, early Mormon history, and students of religious movements. It has clear parallels to some of our current religious and political movements--the Koresh types and the survivialists. Absolutely outstanding!"},{"Title":"Wife, No. 19","review":"This is a non-fictional book on 19th century polygamy in Utah.I think everyone interested in Mormon polygamy should read this book, because the author made an effort to defend her position despite everybody's opposition, including her beloved mum's.This book is really touching and it broke my heart to see how sad her childhood in a polygamous family was.When I read that Heber Kimnball, one of the 12 LDS apostles at that time, compared taking a wife with buying a cow, I thought the author went too far; surprisingly, Kimball's version in Mormon literature (Journal of Discourses vol. 4 page 209 and vol.5 page 22) claims exactly the same, so we can trust that Ann Eliza's book is reliable.It is interesting to know that Mormon and anti-Mormon literature, which often present different accounts on the same matter, agree about polygamy and the condition of women.According to Mormon sources (Journal of Discourses vol. 17 page 159) women, who don't have men's same privileges in this life or in the next, had to submit cheerfully to their husbands' desires to take additional wives, otherwise they would be destroyed.In view of this, I strongly believe that this book is perfectly matched with Mormon beliefs and can help not only to reflect about how it is to live a life in bondage, but also to understand the current Mormon mindset."},{"Title":"Wife, No. 19","review":"The book is a haunting vision of how Brigham Young treated wife No.19. I cannot believe that to this day no one knows what happened to her or where she died. Ann Eliza has a honest and forthwith way of explaining her view of what happened to her. Anyone that has ever wondered how one of Brigham Young's wives lived and was treated, this book is for you."},{"Title":"Wife, No. 19","review":"This book is a moving first hand account of a woman in the early days of the LDS church and of her struggles to free herself from it. I found it very hard to put down once I began it."},{"Title":"Wife, No. 19","review":"Wow, Brigham Yound was a scoundrel and really used his power to abuse his wives and other followers. He had 55 wives and married over a dozen in 1843-1845. I turned this into real homework assignment and downloaded a list of all the wives and tried tokeep all the details straight. Wife No 19 did an amazing job of chronicling the times and the effect of polygamy on women and children."},{"Title":"Wife, No. 19","review":"Ann Eliza doesn't add a lot of fluff, but her descriptions of the people and situations are great. I'd recomend this book to anyone who wants a real account of the Mormon pioneers."},{"Title":"Wife, No. 19","review":"A first person account of life as ONE of the wives of the original Mormom religions husband. NOT a practice of today Thank the Good Lord!"},{"Title":"Wife, No. 19","review":"I thought this book was pretty good. I thought it was pretty repetitive and redundant and i didn't care for the amount of back round the author provided about the origin of Mormonism and polygamy. I thought a lot of it was unnecessary to the plot and even took away from it a bit"},{"Title":"Wife, No. 19","review":"This book was written in the mid-1800s by Wife No. 19 of Mormon Leader, Brigham Young. Her writing is clear, well-expressed, and holds the interest of the reader as she lives from childhood through the time of her leaving the Mormon religion.I expected a book that was stilted and awkward and was pleasantly surprised that, although written over 160 years ago by a woman in \\"bondage\\", it was an informative and attention-holding work. It has interested me in reading more, getting different opinions about the religion, and even to read the recent novel written about the author of this book--Ann Eliza Young."},{"Title":"Wife, No. 19","review":"Wonderful book even thou the subject matter was pretty shocking. I thought I knew a lot about the Mormon Religion but what an education this book gave me."},{"Title":"Wife, No. 19","review":"The book gives a detailed look into the Mormon lifestyle. The young lady who wrote the book was raised by parents who joined Joseph Smith at the begining of the church.She writes very well and you can see the abuse the people who joined (never paid for work). Especially the women ( handed off to men to marry without their consent).People who became disilusioned after Brigham Young became head of the church were usually found dead. Brigham was a man who only thought about what the church would bring him, in money, luxuries, aduration.This young lady was brave enough to leave the church and helped by Christians from the area.I started to read this to get an understanding of Mr Romney, I can see him in Brigham Young. Mitt Romney's father on the other hand was a very loving and giving man"},{"Title":"Wife, No. 19","review":"Wife #19 is told in such a straightforward, honest narrative that it is completely believable and intriguing. There is nothing \\"sensationalist\\" about this book, but has the honesty of A Tree Grows in Brooklyn. The early history of Joseph Smith and Brigham Young, told from the perspective of first a child and then an adult, is a new perspective on the origins of the Mormon church. The suffering of women (and of some men as well) under the institution of polygamy is revealing, as told from one of its captives. This book is highly recommended for any thoughtful reader of history."},{"Title":"Wife, No. 19","review":"This great book needs to be read by every American as the LDS church still believes in polgamy as being the order of heaven and where even today men can marry many wives in the temples. For example, I worked as a court clerk for a highly respected LDS Judge in Utah who forcibly kissed me telling me that he would marry me in the temple; I was 17, he was 74. I quit due to this trauma and betrayal. Utah today has the highest Pornography subscription and internet searches in the nation for two years running (Deseret News Feb. 2009). This is a truthful book as Ann Eliza Young tells about how good the church was in the beginning before corruption began. Joseph Smith was warned (D&C; 3:1-11) about following \\"his own will and CARNAL desires... or he would fall\\"This book exposes the horrors of polygamy, masonry, murder, and justified theft of member's property by church leaders in the past. No repentance of these historical truths have ever occurred. Rather, the history is white washed for \\"faith-promoting\\" history. And the members are told \\"the Prophet will NEVER lead you astray.\\" What a dogmatic lie, with the blindly obedient people believing it! My husband's gold mine, \\"The Bullfrog mine\\" and Alan Cook's multimillion dollar ranch were both stolen through Zion's Bank so it still goes on today. The highly advertised merger of Zion's Bank with First Security in 2000was stopped due to an SEC investigation finding double books.D. Michael Quinn, award-winning historian wrote \\"The Mormon Hierarchy: Origins of Power which corroborates these atrocities. He also found, unknown to most members, that Joseph Smith repented of polygamy and masonry (pg 645-6) just before he was masonically murdered. Mason Brigham Young didn't want to stop the lusting and sex? - (Quinn). Reading both of these books; one eye-witnessed, the other historically and impeccably researched and the truth is exposed.No wonder the \\"church is under condemnation\\" as prophetically warned of in the Book of Mormon (the \\"great and abominable church\\" who removed (altered) the \\"plain and precious truths\\" from the BoM) and declared by repenting Prophet Ezra Taft Benson (General Conference \\"Pride\\" talk) before he was silenced... The Cleansing of the Lord's House is prophesied in the Book of Mormon also... Scary religion requiring blind obedience even today!!!Just one example: Why did Alan Barnes die (son-in-law to Prophet Gordon B. Hinckley) soon after he confessed to the FBI regarding his writing bribery checks (scholarships AND prostitution) for the Winter Olympic Scandal??? See the Salt Lake Tribune article \\"The Silent Witness\\" for confirmation."},{"Title":"Wife, No. 19","review":"ALL I want to say is that your reviews speak of polygamy in the past tense. It is still going on in our country right under our nose. To think a university was names after Brigham Young that scoundrel and pedophile. The mormons are a despicable religion and don't think for a minute that they don't know what is going on in their state to this day. What I want to know is how who is paying off government officials to allow this to happen in the 21st century? I was so appalled by the information in this book that I am inspired to do something to save these poor young girls who are living in sexual slavery."},{"Title":"Wife, No. 19","review":"This book lets an outsider look into the early life of the Mormon church and its second Prophet. Shocking stories that change the perspective of many of the main figures and martyrs that helped to establish the church as one of the largest religions in America. Mrs. Young does a great job of just telling her story(with love) and lets the reader decide the accuracy of her tales. This is all done with a apparent genuine love for her friends, family and children."},{"Title":"Wife, No. 19","review":"For anyone leaving or wanting to leave the Mormon religion, this is a must-read. Brigham Young's 19th wife lived the life of Mormonism when the religion was young. She gives her first hand account of what her mother went through when her father brought home another wife. She describes her own bondage to Brigham Young as one of his wives. Ann Eliza Young is an astonishingly good writer!"},{"Title":"Wife, No. 19","review":"This book is both fascinating and horrifying at the same time. Ann Eliza Young was very brave for speaking out against the Mormon church and polygamy. After escaping the all-powerful Brigham Young and his minions, she considered it her mission in life to do everything within her power to speak out against and end polygamy. This is well-written and eye-opening. Knowing more about Brigham Young, it is completely shocking that the Mormons continue to hold him in such esteem! A university named after this polygamist and (alleged) murderer? How is that? That polygamy continues in this day and age is criminal (literally). Another great book on the subject is Escape by Carolyn Jessop:Escape"},{"Title":"Wife, No. 19","review":"This book is good, but I'm disapointed in the printing. With the cost what it was I really expected a book that I could at least make out the pictures. They are so dark and blurry that I can't see what they are. The print is also not clear in some places."},{"Title":"Wife, No. 19","review":"Gives a sense of life as a mormon in the 1800's. I am about half way thru this long book. It's interesting enough to get one past the slow read aspect/ repetitious points without further specific evidence. The illustrations are of very poor quality."},{"Title":"Wife, No. 19","review":"This is an excellent and moving autobiography. While it is understandable that most of the other reviews of this book are about the practice of polygamy in the earlier days of Mormonism, it is also a detailed inside look at the character, personality and dealings of Brigham Young, who continues to be honored as a guiding light, hero and \\"star\\" of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints.This book documents and corroborates many, many other records and writings which establish Brigham Young as a lying, thieving, scheming embezzler who advocated, encouraged, conspired in, gave the orders for, and afterwards approved of, the murders of many innocent men, women and even children, not merely during the notorious Massacre of innocent settlers crossing Utah to reach California, but as an ongoing practice against non-believers or those Mormons attempting to leave the church.The Latter-Day Saints of today can argue all they want about the fact that they abandoned polygamy and no longer practice or approve of it, at least in this world.But how can they possibly account for and justify the fact that they continue to honor and revere the memory of Brigham Young? I find that fact to be absolutely astonishing! I sure would to see that \\"explained\\" away."},{"Title":"Wife, No. 19","review":"A very long, but interesting take on Mormon history. I'm not Mormon so I don't have any other perspective but found her account of history and polygamy compelling."},{"Title":"Wife, No. 19","review":"A great book. An eye opening, first hand account of the beginning of Mormonism. This book is also amazingly well written and easy to read, considering the age it was written in."},{"Title":"Wife, No. 19","review":"I couldn't believe what I was reading. How people can be sheep. How one man's craziness can rule a entire civilization. Ann Eliza does a good job of telling the raw truth of the Mormon history. She is very lucky to have lived to tell her story. The story she eludes to ,and was to much of a lady to tell, is the real horror of this book. Well worth the read if you are interested in history."},{"Title":"Myths of Free Trade: Why American Trade Policy Has Failed","review":"What's in a word? Plenty, when that word is the adjective \\"free\\" in front of the noun \\"trade.\\" The positive connotations of \\"free\\" have clouded the debate between free traders and those wanting to protect specific U.S. industries through regulation of foreign imports.In \\"Myths of Free Trade,\\" U.S. Rep. Sher rod Brown, the Lorain Demo crat, puts to work the con siderable knowledge he has gained through his efforts on the House subcommittee on commerce, trade and consumer protection to make his argument against untrammeled free trade.He maintains that he is on the side of the angels, and that the mass public supports his views, no matter how often political and media elites label him an extremist know-nothing.If leaders of our institutions would take the time to listen to people who work with their hands, they might learn something about the reasons for workers' anxiety, about the hopelessness with which many look to the future, and about social justice,\\" Brown writes. \\"And they would see that unregulated free trade hurts more people than it helps - not only in the United States, but throughout the world.\\"Brown argues that an unregulated global economy does not automatically operate efficiently according to some magic formula of American capitalism. He goes further to say that the harm of free trade outweighs any benefits.Those harmed include a Cleveland-area child \\"who eats raspberries grown in Guatemala by poorly paid farmers who use pesticides banned in the United States; the unskilled, minimum-wage worker in Los Angeles who loses her job to an unskilled, five-dollar-a-day worker in Yucatan; the machinist in New York who takes a wage cut because of his company's threat to move to China and the Chinese prison camp laborer; the tomato grower in Florida who has to sell his farm; and the peasant in Chiapas who must flee the native village where his family had made its home for dozens of generations.\\"Brown criticizes both political parties for what he sees as blindness to the facts and wonders about the gullibility of presidents Bill Clinton and George W. Bush, about economics professors, about journalists and about his colleagues in Congress.Wondering about so many allegedly misguided souls, Brown can sound self-righteous at times. That tone, however, is ameliorated by the quality of his evidence. He might not be correct in some cosmic sense, and he might not convert anybody already on the other side of the debate. But his examples are plausible and well-presented.\\"Our political leaders support - and excuse - authoritarian leaders in China and Indonesia because our corporate leaders have identified these totalitarian societies as ideal places to invest and reap huge profits, almost always selling back into the U.S. market the goods that slave labor or underpaid workers produce,\\" he writes. \\"Big business has ignored or put aside Chinese human rights abuses, security threats, theft of intellectual property and loss of American jobs.\\"Trade policy is a hot-button issue when jobs come or go because of it. It is difficult, though, to explain the ideas undergirding trade policy. Here, Brown delivers information about an issue usually under the media radar."},{"Title":"Myths of Free Trade: Why American Trade Policy Has Failed","review":"This is a tremendously informative and well written book. Short and to the point and in a language that anybody can understand, it should be required reading for anyone vaguely interested in the economic future of America and, indeed, the whole world.Mr. Brown's book is not a populist war cry but a sensible and well reasoned debunking of all the \\"free trade\\" rhetoric one normally hears.One warning: This book may well leave the reader angry with the status quo!"},{"Title":"Myths of Free Trade: Why American Trade Policy Has Failed","review":"I received the book prior to Christmas; since we shuffled furniture around, the book's gone missing......can't wait to recover it and read it!...God Bless Sherrod Brown!"},{"Title":"Myths of Free Trade: Why American Trade Policy Has Failed","review":"Brown,a Democrat and a liberal,has written a very good book on the severe deficiencies(for instance,the vast number of workers ,who obtain jobs in second and third world countries as a result of outsourcing and globalization, are paid incomes that are far too small to buy any American exports at all.The result is the creation of additional excess supply and decreases in the standard of living everywhere brought on by deficiencies in aggregate purchasing power)that exist as a result of globalization.The same deficiencies were noted by Ross Perot in three books written in 1992,by Pat Buchanan in 1998 in his \\"The Great Betrayal\\",and by Lou Dobbs in his recent \\"Exporting America:How Corporate Greed is Shipping American Jobs Overseas\\".All three are authentic conservatives who have broken with a Republican party establishment that has,since 1978, substituted the libertarian anarchist globalization arguments of Grover Norquist,Murray Rothbard,Milton Friedman,Ayn Rynd,Ludwig von Mises,Fredrich von Hayek,Arthur Laffer,and George Gilder for those of conservatives such as Adam Smith,David Ricardo,George Washington,Alexander Hamilton,Douglas MacArthur,Dwight D Eisenhower,and ,yes,Richard Nixon.Unfortunately,the title of the book was poorly chosen.There is a sound and valid free trade position that opposes the special interests of oligopolistic industries.A better title for the book would have been\\"Globalization is not Free Trade:The Myth of Globalization\\".Authentic free trade is based on comparative advantage,not the absolute advantage that is the foundation of the libertarian anarchist argument for globalization.Unfortunately,B does not deal with the fact that Smith and Ricardo would be opponents of globalization(Only Dobbs mentions this fact).Globalization is not free trade,as free trade is automatically defined within the context of the theory of comparative advantage.It is of vital importance that anyone concerned about the misrepresentation of the authentic free trade position read Part IV, chapter II,pp.420-440 of The Wealth of Nations.For instance,Smith is opposed to tariffs (and quotas)only if it is the case that the purpose of the tariff is purely protectionist(sought by a special interest group of oligopolistic manufacturers)in nature.Smith would support retaliatory tariffs against countries engaging in obvious protectionist behavior,such as violations of GATT,manipulation of international currency values and/or massive dumping,such as China,India,and Mexico, as long as there is some probability that the counter tariff\\"...will procure the repeal of the high duties or prohibitions complained of\\"(Smith,p.435,Modern Library edition).Only if there is no probability of getting the offending country to stop its behavior would Smith forgo retaliation.Finally,Smith is a moderate supporter of the revenue tariff,on balance. He imposed such tariffs when he became a customs official in Scotland.We can end this review by taking Jack Kemp as an example of a conservative who has been completely misled/confused by the substitution of the libertarian,athiest,anarchist arguments of the two von's,Mises and Hayek,for the moral,conservative,deist arguments of Adam Smith.Libertarian Anarchism has nothing to do with conservatism.These philosophies are completely opposed on political,social, and economic grounds.This was the case at the beginnings of our Republic.Washington,Hamilton,Madison,Jay,Franklin,and Adams are the conservatives.Mason,Randolph,Henry,and Paine are the libertarians."},{"Title":"Myths of Free Trade: Why American Trade Policy Has Failed","review":"Sen.

This book is similar to Jagdish Bhagwati's \\"In Defense of Globalization\\" simply because they both use little to no actual evidence and both make broad sweeping claims that fall well outside the realm of what they have attempted to prove (despite both books arguing against one another). For example \\"Myhts of Free Trade\\" has 8 chapters, each with a title that sums up the thrust of each chapter. However, Brown then goes into detail about how great his battles have been on capitol hill and fighting against the evils of the Bush administration, and Multinational corporations. But he offers few statistics, little data, but lots of out of context quotations. He will imply that a piece of legislation because \\"it hurts the steel industry\\" ,for example, without ever telling us how it hurts the steel industry or proving that it does in fact hurt the steel industry, or even showing us evidence that it could hurt the steel industry beyond implying that the U.S. steel industry faces \\"unfair\\" foreign steel manufacturing. In chapter 2 he tries to persuade the reader that free trade is not linked with the war on terrorism, a claim that I thought would be easy enough to prove, but he relies on simple assertions that it is not correlated, but no proof, then goes on to discussion authorization of fast track authority and the showdown between Democrats and Republicans.Clearly Senator Brown has not written this book for mass consumption, but rather rather for his target audience, the Union workers, environmentalists, human rights audience and the rest of the anti-free trade crowd. There's absolutely nothing wrong with that, But don't take this book too seriously, if you're looking for a good solid critique of free trade in the modern era, don't bother buying this book.On the other hand if you want to buy a book that reinforces your opinion that republicans and free trade generally are bad (along with the corporations, WTO, IMF, World Bank) then by all means buy this book.Personally, I find this book insufferable not only because of the lack of actual evidence, but also because all Senator Brown talks about is his time in congress and how much of a crusader he is for anti-free trade legislation and view points. After all who doesn't enjoy reading about the individual battles of the house of representatives from a democrat under a republican majority?

DeWine, an unCatholic avid supporter of Adolf Bush and global Nazism, is facing a challenger whose support comes from Labor as well corporations. Brown's challenge is the most serious among the challengers from other parties - the Democrats, Libertarians and Greens - seeking to unseat the statist DeWine and retrieve Ohio from America's slide down the slippery slope to Nazi Germany.This book was no doubt ghost-written by Brown's interns rather than his journalist wife Connie Schultz - it has no bibliography. It does have an index. But that's as far as it goes in trying to be a real book. It's more like a rant in the genre of Lou Dobbs, although like a Jehovah's Witness book, it will cite a source within the text minus the page number it came from: \\"The distinguished American economist John Kenneth Galbraith said about the 'Wealth of Nations', 'It is much celebrated by the ministry of the righteous right, few of whom have read it. Were they to do so - disapproval of the corporate form, approval of a wealth tax - they would be greatly shocked'\\". That's it. No page number. I could go to Galbraith's book, then where to look? I hope Galbraith's book has an index, then I could at least look up the pages on which Adam Smith is cited. Then perhaps I can find this quote and see what else Galbraith had to say on the topic.That said, this book begins with a four and half-paged 'Introduction' followed by seven chapters titled 'Myth 1: Americans Believe in Free Trade', 'Myth 2: Free-Trade Agreements Are Necessary to Fight the War on [Freedom]', 'Myth 3: Free Trade Is an Extension of American Values Abroad', 'Myth 4: Free Trade Leaves Most People Better Off - In Rich and Poor Nations Alike', 'Myth 5: Free Trade Will Bring Democracy, Human Rights, and Freedom to Authoritarian Nations', 'Myth 6: The North American Free Trade Agreement Has Been a Success', and 'Myth 7: Free Trade Is a Great American Tradition'. Chapter eight is titled 'A Model for Fair Trade and a Call to Action'.Brown is confused over the term \\"free trade\\". When corporatists use that term to describe their economic fascism, Brown uses that term too rather than \\"economic fascism\\". In fact, the two terms are dichotomies. But by ignoring the creation of the corporation by the State and its resulting status as offspring of the state - thereby just as inefficient and bureaucratic as its parent, Brown is telling only half the story. The problem is corporations AND its parent - the State.As Adam Smith knew well - in a free market, there are no corporations; corporations are creations of the state - they are \\"artificial persons\\" that are granted Constitutional rights by its parent. The problem is NOT free trade, which is not practiced anywhere on this planet - but corporatism camouflaging itself under the false rhetoric of free trade. This state-generated problem is one I hope Brown will address as a Congressperson. This book should sit on one's shelf beside a copy of Paul H. Weaver's \\"The Suicidal Corporation\\". And I wish Brown good fortune in unseating the Nazi-American in his Senatorial race. But don't be the other side of the same coin."},{"Title":"Shadows of the Heart: A Spirituality of the Painful Emotions","review":"I am 51 years old and a full time psychology student. I feel that I have been on a spiritual journey most of my life,trying to solve the mystery of life, and the Whiteheads had just added a big piece to the puzzle.I have been given a whole new perspective on the painful emotions, ones that most of us find very difficult to deal with - shame, anger and guilt.

The recording of poetry by their authors was half the reason I ordered it. I returned it."},{"Title":"Dylan: A Biography","review":"(This was written for a course assignment.)Though already ten years old, \\"Dylan - A Biography\\" by Bob Spitz is an incredible, often uncomfortable look into singer/songwriter Bob Dylan's life. \\"Uncomfortable\\" because Bob Dylan, admired and even idolized by so many, named the spokesman of his generation in the early 1960s, and supposedly a prophet of peace and goodwill, is uncovered as a frequently complete and utter jerk. But at the same time, Spitz writes with an understanding pen. \\"Dylan\\" is by no means a tabloid-style hatchet job, Spitz having set out to \\"unmask the hero.\\" If anything, \\"Dylan\\" shows us that Bob Dylan, the man, the myth, is indeed both a man and a myth. He is and always has been a human being, and one with his fair share of faults.Reviews of \\"Dylan\\" on the Internet are rather critical of Spitz, using terms such as \\"mean-spirited.&quot; Due to Spitz having dramatically different reviews for his other works, it seems as though these other \\"Dylan\\" readers don't want to face the idea that their icon is not the quintessential humanitarian, despite the legend. Spitz interviews and quotes countless people from Dylan's past who give first-hand accounts of his own mean-spirited dealings with those who've cared about him. In doing so one feels foolish thinking of Dylan as among the world's greatest humanitarians.Lack of personal knowledge created the void that \\"Dylan\\" was hoped to fill. Two topics in particular were eagerly awaited to be expounded on. These included Dylan's mid-1960s &amp; life-altering motorcycle accident and Dylan's flirtation with Christianity, followed by his return to Judaism. Neither topic was satisfactorily covered, though it appears that the second part of the latter simply occured after the book was published a decade ago. As for the first topic, it appears due to the less-than-heavy emphasis and the implication that the accident was not nearly as serious as the public was lead to believe that it is for this that the topic was given little concentration.The 550 pages that make up the main text of the book, including the prologue, chapters, and epilogue, certainly comprise a work that is significantly longer than easier-read alternatives for the topic, but it was hoped that the book would live up to its promise. At the bottom of the cover is a quote from esteemed writer Greil Marcus, \\"No other book captures it so well, understands so well...\\" An autobiography by Bob Dylan was also available, but to get the objective story, it is best to stay away from such self-promotion. In the author's notes preceding the prologue, Spitz writes that he was offered exclusive interviews with Dylan as well as access to countless treasures including photographs in return for allowing Dylan control over the final manuscript. Based on Dylan's notorious history of publicizing half-truths and outright lies about himself, Spitz refused.&quot;Dylan&quot; is a recommended read."},{"Title":"Dylan: A Biography","review":"A few months ago, I read Bob Spitz's biography, The Beatles. When the Beatles first came to America in 1964 the one person they wanted to meet was Bob Dylan, who according to Spitz turned them on to marijuana as the Plaza Hotel. I found Spitz's book so entertaining and engrossing that I ordered his biography of Bob Dylan, even though it was published in 1985.As a teenager growing up in the 1960's, Bob Dylan was one of my great folk heroes. I was also a great fan of Pete Seeger, Dave Van Ronk, Phil Ochs, Peter Paul and Mary and of course Joan Baez. Bob Spitz's biography of Bob Dylan takes us on the incredible journey as Robert Zimmerman travels to New York to reinvent himself as Bob Dylan. One of the problems of reading a detailed biography of a famous person is that there are risks that as you turn the pages of the book, you may discover unsettling and disturbing facts about the main character.If you need to perceive Bob Dylan as a kind and empathetic person to enjoy his music, don't read this book. Spitz reports how Bob would use his friends, steal from them and manipulate and abuse the people who loved him. He also examines his genius of writing and performing songs that transformed the music business. I loved the book and while Bob Spitz showed me the dark side of Bob Dylan he also has whetted my appetite to revisit and listen to many of his CDs'."},{"Title":"Dylan: A Biography","review":"The author seems concerned only with Dylan's popular appeal in his analysis of the man's career. For instance, if an album sells well, then it is great. If it does not sell well, then it must be awful. Amazingly, Spitz refers to the brilliant Basement Tapes as &quot;awful.&quot;His conclusions seem to cast Dylan as a washed-up has-been from about 1976 onward. Of course, this leads Spitz to discount some very good later works, and to generally belittle the many variations of Dylan's career.The only reason this book doesn't get one star is because of the early chapters detailing Dylan's childhood, which were well-written and very interesting."},{"Title":"Dylan: A Biography","review":"This Bob Dylan book by Bob Spitz i felt was quite intrigueing. I have always wanted to learn more on Bob Dylan and this book, i felt really expressed a lot of his thoughts and how his has lived his entire life."},{"Title":"Dylan: A Biography","review":"Bob Spitz manages to waste this thoroughly researched and at times enlightening document of Bob Dylan by practicing a single-minded interpretation of content with the determination one uses to keep a preconceieved idea of a subject in line from beginning to end without sacrificing preconceptions for truths that arise between. Spitz wanted a unique portrait of Dylan and he did what shaping was necessary to achieve it. The book does provide real insight into Dylan's childhood, except for the strange ommision of anything related to writing from the would-be poet."},{"Title":"Dylan: A Biography","review":"Mixed metaphors make a mess of this. I am in the publishing business and only hope this writer goes back to his job in the music business as he has no business writing."},{"Title":"Dylan: A Biography","review":"Mr. Perle's disclaimer does this book an injustice: Spitz's sequel to the Scaduto and Shelton biographies bears the aspect of a &quot;tabloid-style hatchet job&quot; unmistakably. Nevertheless the amazing quality of Spitz's even-then-still-timely research remains irreducible, and his book cannot be responsibly neglected by scholars of the topic.As for Perle's claim that &quot;An autobiography by Bob Dylan was also available,&quot; well, if only!

Linda gives you solid exercises to do when you're searching for an idea and helps you when you're stuck in the middle of a screenplay.

I'm recommending this book to all my screenwriting students at UCLA."},{"Title":"Making a Good Writer Great: A Creativity Workbook for Screenwriters","review":"Linda Seger offers a number of ways to re-start the creative process; if only one of them works for you, the book is worth it.Just reading through the exercises in this book was enough to get me through a serious case of writer's block. She includes an entire chapter on tapping into your religious/spiritual side to flesh out characters and deepen plot, but don't worry: If that won't work for you, she suggests skipping ahead -- there are plenty more idea-provoking suggestions to come.It's a resource to turn to again and again, whenever a dead end looms."},{"Title":"Making a Good Writer Great: A Creativity Workbook for Screenwriters","review":"I've always felt this book had an unfortunate title and may have done much better without the \\"Screenwriter\\" addendum. The fact is that the advice and exercises that Seger gives is germane to all writers - the novelist, short story writer, as well as the screenwriter.The \\"Creativity Workbook\\" aspect is a true title, however. This is a wonderful book for those of you who feel you're suffering from writer's block. The only solution, of course, is to just write. Even if you're writing \\"I don't know what to write...this is awful...I have no idea what to write...\\" still do it. Eventually you'll have a break through. Seger hides this simple fact into her ingenious exercises, giving you situation after to situation to write about, all the while developing characters and plot ideas.Her focus is to truly help you develop as a writer, not merely beef up your script with cheap, dime-a-dozen plot methods. In that aspect, this book is rather unique and very successful.

One of my favorites is Dr. Linda Seger's, Making a Good Writer Great: A Creative Workbook for Screenwriters. The title, unfortunately, is too narrow for its own good. It should be: Unleashing Your Creative Genius: Screenwriting as a Metaphor for World Peace...or something just as ostentatious. I'm serious. First, using Linda's techniques just replace all forms of the term \\"writer\\" for whatever job you're in: \\"engineer,\\" \\"teacher,\\" \\"mother,\\" \\"assembler,\\" \\"unemployed,\\" or \\"politician.\\" (On second thought, strike that last example.) Second, insert YOURSELF as the protagonist of YOUR PERSONAL story. Third, pick the problem you're having difficulty solving. And finally, using Linda's techniques and exercises creatively think your way to a solution just as you would the fictional character in a story. The problems that face all of us--writer, repressed child, or okay, even world leader--can be solved by using Linda's 12-step program. Here they are in my own words. 1. Discover your mission (or goal). 2. Articulate your values. 3. List the obstacles. 4. Plot turning points around the obstacles. 5. Stick to your passions. 6. Master your powers of observation. 7. Attach meaning to your experiences. 8. Accept your flaws as reasons to persevere. 9. Leverage the opposing forces. 10. Purpose to change the world. 11. Ask God for supernatural inspiration. And 12.

Still, anyone publishing a new basic textbook faces stiff competition. The more expert and experienced the author, the more accurate the information presented is going to be, and Renick is certainly a widely-known and respected author and lecturer, as well as an experienced teacher. Moreover, she combines attention to the most essential lessons in fundamental genealogical instruction with an easy, informal style, successfully walking the narrow line between textbookishness and superficial offhandedness. She expects her audience to include not only complete novices, but those who attempted unsuccessfully to carry out family research without foreknowledge of methods and sources, and also those who have picked up bits of information on the Internet and don't quite know what to do with them. Of course, any well-written text can also serve as a refresher for the experienced family researcher.For all these classes of reader, the author makes her key points early and often: Start with yourself. Record everything you find, and everything you don't find. Cite your sources for all of it. Don't throw anything out or disregard information that might be useful later, or to someone else. Don't make assumptions about names or dates or places, or anything else. There are excellent chapters on basic method (including answers to such beginners' questions as \\"How far back can I go?\\"), interviewing relatives (because Renick assumes you're interested primarily in researching your own family first, not someone else's), assembling your results in a logical way that identifies your next set of questions (organization is everything), and why and how to profitably use computers in keeping track of your research (without taking sides over the question of \\"best\\" software, though she uses Legacy for examples). She tends to spend less time on the best genealogical use of Internet resources, referring the reader instead to Online Roots, another volume in this series which is reviewed below. She'll show you in detail how to begin what she calls the Survey Phase and how to progress through it to the Research Phase, including how to document your search, how genealogists prefer to handle dates and abbreviations (and why), and goal-setting as a research tool. She covers libraries of all types, writing and reading queries, commercial electronic databases (though I wish she hadn't mentioned Brderbund's World Family Tree series so uncritically), and the evaluation of compiled sources and published family histories. Then comes the Evaluation Phase, including how to properly evaluate data and construct hypotheses for testing, and how to recognize success when you experience it. (It's not always obvious.)Finally, she addresses the questions of publishing what you've discovered (not just to stroke egos but to preserve your labors for future researchers), preserving photographs and fragile documents, whether or not you should consider joining lineage societies, and the role of serendipity, which genealogists learn early never to underestimate. You may need to consult a professional at some point, perhaps to carry out research for you overseas, and she provides excellent advice on all aspects of this complex subject. You may even want to become a \\"professional\\" of some kind yourself. And throughout all of this, Renick strews carefully targeted, tightly drawn anecdotes, taken mostly from her own diverse family, as illustrations of what she's saying.So: Is this the \\"best book available\\"? It may well be. It's certainly a very strong contender. Anyone teaching a basic genealogy class could do far worse than to adopt this as their textbook. If you have a younger relative you're trying to interest in taking up the family's history, give them a copy. If you think you're too experienced to need a book with \\"101\\" in the title, read it anyway. You won't regret it."},{"Title":"Genealogy 101: How to Trace Your Family's History and Heritage","review":"This is a great book!! And a must-have for beginning and intermediate genealogists.

There has always been a unproven rumor in my family that he is a cousin through my maternal great grandfather Mather's side of the family tree. As a result, knowing nothing about geneology, but being retired and having time to do research, maybe now is the time. I therefore bought a book with the most logical title, Geneology 101, written by an accomplished and enthusiastic geneologist of her own family, Barbera Renick, to get some general idea of how to proceed and what the ground-rules are.Barbera Reneck has spent the last 30 years looking into her family history and seems almost like an evangelist for geneology. As a result,I found that her book was more information than I was looking for; but, then again, I need the lay of the land, and too much information might not necessarily be bad. She cautions us how important it is to cross-check and analyze information; for example, it is a good idea to double-check dates to make sure a person's age at birth, marriage, first child, and death flow and coordinate properly. Also, one should analyze the relative accuracies of the sources. A case in point is a death certificate, which is likely to be more accurate than an article in the paper covering the death, or a note in the family bible covering the death. She also recommended hooking up with a geneology society, reading geneological articles and newsletters, taking classes, and doing whatever you can do to get connected with the subject matter you are seeking.I was a little surprised that she seemed to want to find every distant cousin and great great uncle in every branch of the family tree. Maybe I'll change my mind later, but now I am just interested in tracing my heritage back in time in a focused way, just going after direct ancestors. Who knows, maybe I'll change my mind later, and expand my research.Since I hope to do most of my research online, I was pleased for the websites she recommended, and especially for recommending a follow-up book called Online Roots.The book seems like a good starting point for someone new like myself.

Abbey's descriptions of the canyon lands are heart felt. You can just picture hundreds of tourists, driving a loop road through Any National Park, USA, and feel his frustrations. But more importantly, he describes wilderness to hundreds of people who might never experience it."},{"Title":"Desert Solitaire : A Season in the Wilderness","review":"I originally read the book in the early 1980's and continually reread it to refresh my memories of the most compelling, stark, unforgiving, beautiful, lonely, introspective, sensative, sensational and sensual landscape in the world. The author and his book are monuments, and unfortunately perhaps lone sentinels, to the passion that the red rock desert of the American Southwest inspires in the people who love it."},{"Title":"Desert Solitaire : A Season in the Wilderness","review":"Desert Solitaire is one of Ed Abbey's best known books and exemplifies his unique talent for turning the medium of the essay into something both highly artistic and down to earth. Though apparently proud of his rough exterior and offensive, controversial opinions, Abbey demonstrates in his non-fiction the heart of a poet. This book is worth reading for the amazing sentences alone. If you know the West, this book will bring it home to you. If you do not, it will infuse some fierce love into your soul that, I believe, will eventually draw you to it"},{"Title":"Desert Solitaire : A Season in the Wilderness","review":"This book is awsome. It is hard to believe that 30 years later some of the same problems exist for the NPS. Abbey definitely was a visionary. This book is the best account of real life in a fabulous place. It takes you back to those National Park visits when life was simple and people didn't mind getting out of their car and walking. Today everyone thinks they can &quot;experience&quot; a park from their car, Abbey understood this was coming and didn't mind giving his idea's on the subject. The descriptions of wildlife, flora and fauna are fantastic. You can almost smell the wild flowers. If you really want to experience the canyonlands of Utah, read this book!"},{"Title":"Desert Solitaire : A Season in the Wilderness","review":"This book does a wonderful job at describing and invoking how it feels to be in the outdoor West--in the hot sun, on the barren mesas, wandering lost and happy through the deepest canyons.Edward Abbey was a strange yet understandable contradiction of a man--a man who wrote that it would be worse to kill a man than a snake yet who once killed a rabbit with a rock just to see if he could do it. A man who passionately opposed the destruction of the West, yet who admitted to anarchistically throwing beer cans out his truck window as he drove.Edward Abbey wrote about the West as if it was a place where not everything was ruined yet, as if there was still a sort of bright, outdoor innocence about things, as if it was a place where a person could soak in sunlight reflected off orange canyon walls, splash in a muddy desert stream, or drive a dusty road with the windows down.And it was.And it is.This book is a protective love of the West in a nutshell. It's a series of orange canyon walls distilled into english. It's hawks and vultures and rising heat transmuted into letters and punctuation. It deserves its reputation.I buy almost every used copy I can find of this book, and I give them away just as fast, to my friends from the East who come west, and to all my friends who love the desert.Read it, buy it, and see what he's writing about for yourself. You'll be glad you did."},{"Title":"Desert Solitaire : A Season in the Wilderness","review":"Mr. Abbey has filled this book with many thoughtful observations of the desert, and life in general. This book should be mandatory reading for any present day backpacker or outdoorsman."},{"Title":"Desert Solitaire : A Season in the Wilderness","review":"Abbey receives a sympathy vote from me for several reasons: This is one of his first works, and it's also the first one of his that I read. But my review here is based upon re-reading the work almost 20 years later.Edward Abbey is a man at home with himself. One gets the impression reading Desert Solitaire that he is always by himself, even though he was married, and had several children. I've no doubt he was a loner, and the ideal world he portrays is one where Abbey travels the world alone with nature - talking to snakes, chasing wild horses and cows, and observing nature's interplay, far from the meddling influences of humanity. As a ranger in utah, he views the intruding, artificial world of we termite-people with disdain. As a writer, he builds on this and other themes in a matter-of-fact, yet deeply challenging way. This is the style of writing he came to be known so well for in his later works.Environmentalists like to claim Abbey as their spokesman, and Abbey definitely gave the appearance of a nature-lover. But I'm more inclined to think of him as a &quot;human-hater&quot;. I think he knew deep-down that humans are nature's spawn, and nature has always been powerless to be pro-active in perserving its various features. Nothing is sacred, including the wonderful architecture of the Colorado Plateau. Abbey was deeply in love with the alone-ness that the area represented to him, and was every bit as deeply angered by the ever-increasing ranks of people intent on despoiling it. If that's an environmentalist, then so be it. But in Desert Solitaire, there is never any pretense that man and desert could ever be compatible. Indeed, if there is any point to be made, it is exactly the opposite.You'll find it tough being the bad guy. Nevertheless, it'll be every bit as hard to put this book down. Read it and weep."},{"Title":"Desert Solitaire : A Season in the Wilderness","review":"Edward Abbey's collection of essays about his work at the then Arches National Monument(which he calls National Moneymint to mock the villains who wish to pave over everything). Abbey does have some good points, like we should stop trying to pave over things to make it more convineat to see nature. The whole Glen Canyon tragedy is told, foreshadowing the novel &quot;Monkey Wrench Gang&quot;. I did like his wide knowledge of philosophy and the desert fauna and flora, and I relate to his love of the desert, but his prose is a bit(forgive the pun) too arid, and I had to slog through parts of the book. On the whole, I recommend it."},{"Title":"Desert Solitaire : A Season in the Wilderness","review":"Great read for anyone looking to escape the city. This author is incredibly insightful and makes this book not just a liberal nature walk. Worth the read even if you are not as much of a conservationist of nature as he is."},{"Title":"Desert Solitaire : A Season in the Wilderness","review":"This is all over the map. It's a hermit's reflections on a world that moves too slowly for the rest of us to see. It's a naturalist's insight into the behavior of animals and people. It's a political extremist's commentary on unchecked development and resource depletion. Best of all, it's a delicious anthem of love that sings from the pages, affirming the connection some humans have with the natural world of sun, snow, snakes, and stone. You can't read this and remain untouched by its sincerity, even if (or perhaps because of) Abbey's attitude: a cactus bloom, all fiery beauty encased by sharp needles. Like a masterpiece painting, it really doesn't matter what it's \\"about\\" (some dude who becomes a park ranger for a year); it's really just a vehicle for communicating the deepest realizations of an honest questing soul."},{"Title":"Desert Solitaire : A Season in the Wilderness","review":"We read it for book club, and while some members liked it and some thought he was anti-animal, it really did not leave much to be discussed.

The imagery kindled my excitement still to this day!"},{"Title":"Desert Solitaire : A Season in the Wilderness","review":"Published in 1968, Desert Solitaire narrates in journal-style Edward Abbey's trio of summers in the desert surrounding Moab in southeastern Utah. Although he was there during the mid-twentieth-century, before the Department of the Interior had commercialized and touristized Arches National Park's 33,000 acres quite to its current condition, Abbey is close to prophetically critical about rape of the land by government and industry in order to accommodate outsiders and garner profits, actions that began to ruin it as habitat for native species. In other ways, the author chronicles with no apparent sense of shame his own complicity in ruining the land by littering, in violating animal creatures who depend upon it for sanctuary.I truly enjoyed how his clear, elaborate descriptions of the desert scape and its flora transported me back to countless times I've visited and loved Utah's (Arizona's and New Mexico's) desert spaces, though half as many words would have conveyed the flavor just as well without getting as plain boring as it sometimes did.Apparently Desert Solitaire became somewhat of an undergrad / hippie cult essential (note the publication date). Although I'm happy to place it on my list of famous books I've read, and I found its reputation way overhyped, indeed it is \\"good in parts.\\" The desert has been one of my own best healing places; it must be because \\"Love flowers best in openness and freedom.\\""},{"Title":"Desert Solitaire : A Season in the Wilderness","review":"We share Abbey's love of the desert southwest. We enjoyed his descriptions of the native flora and fauna. We also admired his willingness to explore the back country with a minimum of the comforts of home. Abbey is highly literate and his prose is excellent.He does have the arrogance that we see in so many state and national park employees. Namely, the parks are so sacred that really only a special few should be allowed in them. Preferably just us (the employees). He is able to say anything he pleases about the park patrons because he is a public employee whose check will be there at the end of the week, pretty much no matter what he does or says.In the end, we can forgive him though. We will not judge him as he has judged those of us that enjoy national parks. He does drink, smoke, and eat too much fat (sorry, I judge). The national parks of southern Utah are spectacular. I have toured most of them on my motorcycle (sorry Edward, but it does get very good mileage and it has a quiet muffler). Arches and Canyonlands are must sees.The book is a worthwhile read, ok, I read it twice."},{"Title":"Desert Solitaire : A Season in the Wilderness","review":"An interesting book dealing with much more than the desert. The author combines facts, sub stories and opinion to create a very thought provoking book. I have recommended it to one of my sons who lives in Albuquerque."},{"Title":"Desert Solitaire : A Season in the Wilderness","review":"As someone who has spent numerous summers as a wilderness ranger for the National Forest Service in the mountains in Wyoming, I was able to relate to many aspects of this book that others may not without seeing the \\"inside\\" workings of the NPS/NFS. However, any experienced naturalist would be able to relate to the authors observations. I liked his method of presentation, using notes from his journals yet performing a narrative. He has had the experience and time to observe and think and I appreciated his views on the subject matter. A good read for anyone interested in the day to day of living with natural surroundings and the superimposed element of humans fingerprints. This is NOT a National Geographic Special...but a very REAL presentation of the subject and the authors obviously educated opinions of it. I am glad I bought it, and at an exceptional price."},{"Title":"Desert Solitaire : A Season in the Wilderness","review":"Probably one of Edward Abbey's greatest works. Have read it many times (including once while I was camping at the Arches...best way to enjoy a book...read it at the place that it takes place). The depth of his understanding of people and places is awesome. When I was an undergraduate in Colorado, his works were required reading in some classes. They opened our minds to the world and challenged us to take a active part in trying to make things better.geogbob@hotmail.com"},{"Title":"Desert Solitaire : A Season in the Wilderness","review":"Ed Abbey was way ahead of his time. Just as the Beat Writers of the late 1940's and mid 1950's were decades before the socially conscious Hippie Movement of the late 1960's. It's ironic that so many years after, \\"Desert Solitare\\" was published in 1968, in a modern world obsessed with pressing toward progress and pushing the envelope with entertainment, it is still a polarizing piece of literature. Abbey's observations about society at the time were right in step with his observations of the natural world around him at Arches, the Canyonlands, the undammed mighty Colorado, and even the dead man at Grandview Point. Abbey writes things down in print that cross all of our minds at one time or another, that is - if you lived in the American Southwest. He was brave enough to publicly attach his name to his innermost thoughts. Abbey's collage of stories chronicalling his years as a volunteer Park Service Ranger are well thought out, and equally well communicated to the above-layman reader. The book is a collection of stories from years gone by. Even as Abbey claims in the introduction, these places (the ones that the specific stories describe) no longer exist. That's true in the context that society had moved forward. This context in which Abbey viewed his surroundings no longer existed. The actual natural sights will outlast humans. That simple late fifties, early sixties world is what is gone. It was through those eyes and that heart Cactus Ed penned his greatest novel. If you ever spent anytime in the American Southwest, this is a must read. If you've never traveled West of the Rockies, you owe it to yourself to read this book. Some of the ideas and prose may seem alien to you at first. That's OK. The novel conveys the mindset of living in a remote area of the Earth where yes, there are no other humans around for prolonged periods of time. Your perception of yourself changes as a result. You become more important in your eyes, because all you have to ponder on is yourself. That's the point many negative reviewing readers miss when reading, \\"Desert Solitare\\". Yes, Abbey is consumed with himself at times. THERE IS NO ONE ELSE AROUND! No people, no new \\"news\\", no radio, no TV, just a man and his thoughts. A wonderful tale of a bygone era!!!"},{"Title":"Desert Solitaire : A Season in the Wilderness","review":"Wonderful and classic work by Abbey. His descriptions of his desert surroundings take my breath away. Less engaging are his diatribes against the forces bringing in \\"progress\\" to the wilderness."},{"Title":"Desert Solitaire : A Season in the Wilderness","review":"This book was formative for me and my appreciation for nature.His bigger contribution though is that of philosopher and poet.The new forward is a gem.

After spending many, many hours hiking through the desert around Tucson, I realized Abbey's attraction to it, as well as his warnings about it. Great read and an appropriate introduction to the work of Abbey. If you're at all interested in desert life, look no further than Desert Solitaire.Too bad Tucson is such an terrible city to live in. Tucson doesn't deserve its beautiful surroundings."},{"Title":"Desert Solitaire : A Season in the Wilderness","review":"Excellent. A must read for all with a concern for the American West."},{"Title":"Desert Solitaire : A Season in the Wilderness","review":"When this book first came out, it started a nationwide cult, primarily of college-aged students, who suddenly became entranced with nature and began to rally against the forces trying to contain it. Although he had written three prior books, this was Abbey's first major success as he relates stories from his two summers as a Park Ranger in the Arches National Monument in southeast Utah. There is no straight narrative here, just bits and pieces from his experiences in this desert land. He also finds time to boat down the Colorado River through the Glen Canyon before it is forever flooded by another massive dam. Although I stuck with this book to the end, I found it more sleep inducing than inspiring. Although written well, Abbey seems to find it necessary to include the names, both English and Latin, of every single plant and bush that grows in this desert. He even endlessly names the rocks. Then he goes on to the stars! And that trip down the river was mostly repetitive glimpses down side canyons. However, this is a forerunner to one of my favorite books, Abbey's \\"The Monkey Wrench Gang,\\" as he gives us glimpses into the beginnings of eco-terrorism with the pulling up of surveyors' stakes and the destruction of billboards. I have read the \\"Gang\\" many times, \\"Solitaire\\" will just be once."},{"Title":"Desert Solitaire : A Season in the Wilderness","review":"It must be difficult when you are right, you know you are right, and the rest of the world is wrong. For Edward Abbey you release your frustrations in the form of an endless rant. While the few places he writes about the desert and Arches National Monument (now a National Park), make for a good read, the rants are both endless and idiotic.He rants and rants about letting tourists drive their cars into Arches. He proposes, \\"No more cars in national parks. . . . [K]eep the automobiles and the motorcycles and their motorized relatives out.\\" Of course he drove into Arches to the house trailer he would be living in while in the park. You can bet the house trailer was towed in by a motorized vehicle. He got a delivery of 500 gallons of water via a tank truck on his first day. He also got a Park Service truck delivered to him to drive. He also got permission to drive the truck to town once a week for supplies. He continues to rant on and on about allowing vehicles into any Nation Parks. He does show his softness by allowing the aged and infirm to be transmitted by shuttle buses. For children too small to be carried in or to ride a bicycle in, he would not permit entering. What a guy! The word hypocrite seems to fit here.He launches into the problems of the Navajo. He provides a simplistic monologue of how they could better them selves. One of his amazing quotes is, \\"He (referring to the Navajo people) lacks the drive to get ahead of his fellows or to figure out a way and means of profiting from other people's labor.\\" He goes on to suggest solving the problems of the Navajo, \\"[W]e may soon have to make birth control compulsory.\\" I won't even comment on his solution of the Navajo \\"problem.\\"Then he suggests that wilderness is necessary. Here is his quote, \\"We may need it someday not only as a refuge from excessive industrialism but also as a refuge from authoritarian government, from political oppression. Grand Canyon, Big Bend, Yellowstone and the High Sierras may be required to function as bases for guerilla warfare against tyranny.\\"The ONLY reason to read this book is to discover what a complete idiot the author is. He describes himself as a desert rat. Perhaps he spent too much time in the desert sun without wearing a hat."},{"Title":"Desert Solitaire : A Season in the Wilderness","review":"I just read a Kindle version of this in hopes of giving my first trip to Moab some special meaning. What a disappointment. I had read some Amazon reviews proclaiming this book as some type of masterpiece. In all due respect, those readers must not get out much. This book was more than just boring; it rambled on without any structure or cohesiveness. The fact that it was so poorly written could be overlooked if at least Abbey had an interesting story to tell; he did not. Do yourself a favor and skip it."},{"Title":"Desert Solitaire : A Season in the Wilderness","review":"I picked up this book because I thought it was written by a nature lover. I was misinformed. The only good thing I can say about this book, written by a ranger at Arches National Park, is the fact that the author died at the relatively young age of 62. Why is this good? Because in his book he mocks and then jokes about the accidental death of a visitor to his park, a 60 year old gentleman who got lost and died of exposure. Abbey thought this was a good death--the man found a perfect place to die. Great view! Besides, at this man's age it was time to go-- old people need to make room for the young (him). The \\"old man\\" certainly did not die a good death, unless you consider exposure and dehydration a pleasant experience. Try reading \\"Touching the Void\\" by Joe Simpson to discover what such an experience might be like.To be certain, Edward Abby is not a nature loving man. In one chapter, he picks up a rock and kills a rabbit just for the fun of it, and then talks about how he felt no remorse, only power, as if he had received the \\"spiritual energy of the rabbit\\" after killing it. He was energized afterward, extremely pleased with himself. No, he didn't kill the rabbit for food like any self respecting hunter would do, he did it because he wanted to, because he could. He shows an admirable respect for snakes, but that isn't enough to make up for the absolutely disgusting, cruel way he treated the cows he and two other sadistic individuals were paid to round up. He beats them mercilessly with wet ropes, comments on how ugly they are, is indifferent to the many calf's crying, the animals' heat and exhaustion and laughs when another \\"cowboy\\" kicks an exhausted cow to death. Cows don't matter to him at all, and Abbey thinks they deserve the meat hook at the end of their journey.He repeats a tall tale people swear to him is true, about how a corporate miner swindled a gullible potential miner out of his money, seduces the man's wife, and then shoots him in the woods. No big deal, he's just retelling a story he's heard, right? But then he goes into great excruciating detail about the likely last days of the murdered man's ten year old son and how much agony and pain he endures after days and days of trying to survive in the canyon all by himself. You realize pretty quickly there is no way anyone could know these things--what the boy felt as he starved and ate the psychedelic plants, whether or not he floated in and out of consciousness while the sun burned third degree burns on his back. The boy is supposedly found alive, still clutched to the back of a tree after floating naked down a river, but dies without ever regaining consciousness... and it's not surprising at this point because you knew he was making up the story as you are reading, but you have to wonder for a moment why anyone would take so much pleasure describing such a horrific ordeal. He tells this story with so much relish, you have to wonder at his motivation and sanity.In this book, you will not find interesting insights one might expect from someone having spent so much time alone in nature; instead he reveals a truly cold heart and his rants are not so much inspiring or full of truth as they are self absorbed pontificating by an individual who thinks he's a poet just because he has an imagination. I actually took a match to his book just to watch the edges curl. Too thick to burn, I reluctantly hosed it down and threw it in the trash where it belongs.If you love and respect nature, this is not the book to read."},{"Title":"Desert Solitaire : A Season in the Wilderness","review":"Sorry, but I didn't care much for this one. I could not detect that the author had much love for the desert, just a lot of hatred for humankind. Let the reader be prepared for that, and not expect a pretty documentary about the desert."},{"Title":"Desert Solitaire : A Season in the Wilderness","review":"Abbey spent three summers as a naturalist at Arches National Monument in Utah and recorded his experiences and shared his opinions on tourism, wilderness, government, religion, and Nature. Through Abbey's eyes, readers experience the desert's intricate and delicate web of life. Moreover, Abbey interprets the significance of water and geography in the austere environment and connects these subjects to desert life forms. Abbey condemns our dysfunctional relationship with the environment and our abuse of national parks, but he offers practical and effective solutions.I have a unique perspective on Desert Solitaire having worked for the National Park Service for a decade, including a season in the Utah desert. I read Solitaire on a road trip through the Southwest, and it so inspired me that I applied to parks throughout the region. Five months after reading Solitaire, I accepted a job at Zion National Park in southeast Utah. However, I missed the fine print in Abbey's introduction: \\"Do not . . . rush out to the Canyon country hoping to see some of that which I have attempted to evoke in these pages. . . .most of what I write about in this book is already gone or going under fast. This is not a travel guide but an elegy.\\"Zion, like all the other parks I worked at, had been surrendered to tourism. Abbey uses the term \\"Industrial Tourism\\" to describe the modern method for visiting national parks. It involves completely isolating oneself from the environment in a motorized tin can or house-on-wheels and racing from park to park to park. Tourists linger only momentarily at designated picturesque pullouts for a snapshot or to read a line from an interpretive placard, and they quickly hop back in their infernal rattling death machines and zoom past extraordinary scenery on the way to the next park and its overcrowded, military-compound-style campgrounds or luxurious lodges. Many linger in large visitor center museums searching for soda machines and bathrooms or looking at exhibits and buying post cards when they could be outdoors experiencing at the real thing they (supposedly) came to see!Tourists have lost touch with the true wild. Most don't get out of their cars except to eat, sleep, or to use the bathroom.However, the National Park Service's founding charter, the Organic Act, was written with loftier goals in mind when it stated the NPS's \\"purpose is to conserve the scenery and the natural and historic objects and the wild life therein and to provide for the enjoyment of the same in such a manner and by such means that will leave them unimpaired for . . . future generations.\\" Over the past 85 years, park managers have focused on \\"provide for the enjoyment\\" while shunning the command to \\"leave them unimpaired.\\" Their brains dulled by years of paperwork and pointless bureaucratic meetings, they fail to consider the impairments park \\"improvements\\" have created.To impair means to worsen or harm. One can find countless examples of Industrial Tourism impairing national parks. Take for instance the Zion Canyon Scenic Drive. Built in the 1920s, the Virgin River's flash floods invariably destroyed sections of the drive. In order to protect the road, and thereby provide for the enjoyment of Zion Canyon for those too lazy to walk, managers added gabiens and rocked the river banks. Success! The river overflowed its banks less often, and as a result, it became channelized. Jump ahead 80 years: since the river no longer floods, seed beds for cottonwoods are not prepared, and the cottonwoods in the canyon are dying out. To mitigate this problem, managers plant seedlings and install irrigation line. To keep beaver and deer away from succulent saplings, chain-link fences were erected. The solution, however, is remarkably simple: remove the road and allow the river to flood again. But managers insist that the roads are needed.Abbey makes some sensible proposals for the salvation of both parks and people. First, he urges \\"No more cars in national parks. Let the people walk. Or ride horses, bicycles, mules, wild pigs, anything, but keep the automobiles and the motorcycles and all their motorized relatives out.\\" Secondly, he calls for a ban on new road construction in parks and demands the Organic Act be implemented rather than ignored.Abbey discusses the \\"dusty milling confusion of motor vehicles and camping machinery\\" at Yosemite and the Grand Canyon. A serious problem in the 1960s, auto overcrowding has reached a crisis state. Motorists, finding parking lots full, park along the road or in open fields which heavily impairs plant and animal life and scars the landscape. Their vehicles emit noxious toxins and pollute the air with noise. There is no pandemonium worse than an incessant car alarm in a national park.Some parks have only recently taken Abbey's 40-year-old advice. In 2000, Zion instituted a mandatory propane-powered shuttle in the Canyon from April to October. Before the shuttle, visiting the Canyon was an oredeal; there was no place to park and bicycling was extremely dangerous. The Canyon reeked of exhaust fumes and the drone of traffic carried up the canyon walls as motorists circled for a half hour looking for parking. Sans cars, the Canyon changed drastically as Abbey predicted. I could bike and be the only person on the road. Picnic areas reverberated with natural sounds. Abbey accurately described the scene: \\"Fortunately the parks, by the mere elimination of motor traffic will come to seem far bigger than they are now; there will be more room for more persons, an astonishing expansion of space.\\"A few people complained about the shuttle system. One old geezer called it \\"part of Al Gore's socialist scheme to lock up the parks.\\" (The shuttle system was proposed in the late 1970s, and Al Gore had nothing to do with it.) When another senior citizen complained about the hardship of riding the shuttle, I explained that it would have been far more difficult to enter the canyon 100 years ago on foot. He took offense and said the shuttle was unfair to seniors. Perhaps they should have visited when they were younger, I suggested. Outraged, he clamored that seniors did not have money when they were younger, and I replied that I did not let money stop me. Just before leaving, he quipped that he hoped I would feel the same when I was old. I replied that I also hoped to feel the same way when older.As Abbey states, \\"The aged merit even less sympathy: after all they had the opportunity to see the country when it was still relatively unspoiled.\\" He also talked about providing shuttle buses for those \\"too old or too sickly\\" to walk. However, some will always complain about leaving their cars behind.Unfortunately, attitudes change slowly and managers do too little. People seeking to escape the drudgery of city life bring cell phones, pagers, R.V.s with satellite television and hike in high heels while quarreling with each other amongst the most magnificent scenery the country has to offer. Many visitors never get more than a few hundred yards from their cars and never leave trails. They are destination-oriented. They are unaware.Wilderness and national parks were sacrificed long ago to Industrial Tourism. For decades, we ignored the sacredness of the land, but Abbey believes that \\"we are learning finally that the forests and mountains and desert canyons are holier than our churches.\\" But our holy lands have been whored out to the tourism, auto, and oil industries. Sadly, we treasure and protect what we know and love, and we no longer know or love the wild."},{"Title":"Desert Solitaire : A Season in the Wilderness","review":"I picked up this book on accident--I had maybe $6 left on my gift certificate and browsed through random books. It sounded interesting, so I bought it.I was so moved the first time I read it. Everything written was so eloquent and Abbey expressed himself amazingly. It kept me drawn to read on and devour the entire text.A year later, I volunteered for the National Park Service completely forgetting about Abbey's book, but I just so happened to bring it along with me on the plane 1700 miles from home. It was the first book I read while in Washington. Aside from the $10 stipend a day and government housing deals striking so close to home, it really made me realize what an amazing place I was in (Mount Rainier National Park). It makes you look at all the details of life and appreciate it all.You tend to get a little critical of tourists though. Especially the ignorant ones...\\"Are there any dangerous animals around here?\\" -visitor\\"Only the tourists.\\" -Abbey"},{"Title":"Desert Solitaire : A Season in the Wilderness","review":"I have read only about half of the book -- and that's a mark on me, not on the book. It's really complicated and deep, and I needed to take a break from it. If you don't have a good background in biology or geology, long passages must be read and re-read in order to try to lock in the meaning and the imagery that Abbey projects. It's worth it, but you have to concentrate very hard, or else the words just slip by in meaninglessness, like the names in a Russian novel.What I've taken from the book so far is the feeling of beauty and loneness (note that I didn't say loneliness) that Abbey experienced in Arches National Monument. Most of us can't handle that amount of solitude, even if we are aware that it's only temporary. We have lost the ability to wander through terrain and finding one fascination after another, or to watch the stars for hours on end.Abbey takes us with him as he had this experience, which is almost impossible to get in modern America. My sensibility is richer for his experience. And I look forward to tackling the book again."},{"Title":"Desert Solitaire : A Season in the Wilderness","review":"I'm lucky enough to have a first edition copy of Desert Solitaire by Edward Abbey. I brought my old dog eared copy out and re-read it last night. My quest was to examine Abbey's walks within this classic.Edward Abbey wrote his own introduction. This is something he did for many of his books...he often quipped that nobody could write a review of his books better than he could. I guess the same applied to introductions. An introduction should concisely condense the themes of the book, without taking away the need to read it. Abbey did that, and he quickly introduces us to how he feels about walking. He writes:\\"Do not jump into your automobile next June and rush out to the canyon country hoping to see some of that which I have attempted to evoke in these pages. In the first place you can't see anything from a car; you've got to get out of the goddamned contraption and walk, better yet crawl, on hands and knees, over the sandstone and through the thornbush and cactus. When traces of blood begin to mark your trail you'll see something, maybe. Probably not.\\"Amen.His first walk happens on page 12. \\"I take my walking stick and go for a stroll down the road into the thickening darkness. I have a flashlight with me but will not use it...\\"He goes on to say: \\"There's another disadvantage to the use of the flashlight: like many other mechanical gadgets it tends to separate a man from the world around him. If I switch it on my eyes adapt to it and I can see only the small pool of light which it makes in front of me; I am isolated\\".Imagine what Abbey would say about an Ipod!Walking with a flashlight starts Abbey off on a theme. A beautiful description follows of writing a letter with the generator on. I can relate; I use a generator at times. Abbey subtly introduces us to his Ludditian theme that machines isolate us from the real world. True.Walk Number Two for Abbey takes up a whole chapter. \\"I take my cherrywood and go for a walk before breakfast\\". 15 pages of beautiful description of the Arches National Park flora and fauna follow. Simply marvelous descriptions with vintage Abbey antics and philosophy i.e. killing a rabbit by throwing a rock. Primal.Walk Number Three for Abbey happens on page 59. A survey crew arrives making plans for a new road into the park. Abbey waits for them to leave and then for five miles retraces the route of the survey crew \\"I pulled up each wooden stake and threw it away\\". This is the end of his chapter on what he calls \\"Industrial Tourism and the National Parks\\". A crusade against the automobile, which was ahead of its time. I've visited two National Parks where cars are curtailed or not allowed. Abbey had the idea first in 1968.In all, I counted around sixteen walks described in Desert Solitaire. Abbey walked his talk."},{"Title":"Desert Solitaire : A Season in the Wilderness","review":"I realize 'Life-changing' may seem a bit of hyperbole when talking about a book, but this book really did that for me. Or, rather, it was the straw that broke the camel's back; the camel in this instance being my rather mundane, workaday life of working for Boise Parks and Rec in the summers and a ski resort in the winters. Edward Abbey can't claim to be the perfect environmentalist, that's for sure (he drove cars, wrote many books that were published on tons of paper), but who can? I liked this book because I identified with many of the author's feelings towards people, especially their interaction(s) with the outside world, and his own feelings that most Americans saw nothing wrong with paved roads running through wild places. Mostly I was just fed up with a couple of dead-end jobs and this book, along with Peter Fromm'sIndian Creek Chronicles: A Winter Alone in the Wilderness, propelled me to quit my jobs, move out of my apartment and hit the road. That road led me, ironically, to the largest roadless area in the lower 48 (a vast region in the dead center of Idaho) and then to Tokyo, but that's my own story, not Edward Abbey's. Desert Solitaire is filled with just the kind of characters I met in the mountain west, with their wry wit and a more grizzled approach to activism and environmentalism than just canvassing for the Sierra Club and making sure the recycling is put out every week. I could fully identify with Abbey's experience of being alone in a wild part of our country, and with his feelings of condescension when he met others ('tourists') who dared approach his newly discovered sanctuary. All that was nearly 20 years ago and I've come to learn a lot since then; mostly that the people I used to vilify are just regular Americans, same as me. I believe Abbey wrote Desert Solitaire while he was in his 20s, the same age I was when I read it, so perhaps his feelings also changed over the years. Regardless, this is a great book. It's written well enough that I felt I was living right alongside the author, feeling the bitter cold mornings as he waited for his coffee to heat up as well as the smoky darkness of his nightly fire."},{"Title":"Desert Solitaire : A Season in the Wilderness","review":"The sixties are often labeled \`tumultuous' which is as accurate as any label ever gets. For the first time since the Great Depression, a large number of rational and often intelligent Americans openly questioned the right of the duopoly (Democrat/Republican establishment) to govern and the real value of the military industrial complex to national security. The Civil Rights and anti-War Movements served as the catalyst for these Americans, but their questioning of established authority went beyond social injustice and a lunatic war. Unfortunately there was no unity of purpose, but many splinter movements looking for different rainbows. One of these splinter movements was driven by environmentalism and within this rubric was the drive to preserve U.S. wilderness areas in pristine condition as refuges from the gasoline civilization that the U.S. had become in the fifties.All of which brings us to this remarkably good and ageless 1968 book about one man's experiences as a part time ranger at the Arches National Monument in South Eastern Utah. Abbey is a marvelous nature writer, who reflects the sixties view of preservation perfectly. His argument is really quite simple: there were many places in the U.S. that really ought not to be developed into suburban enclaves or massive parking lots. He takes the U.S. Park Service to particular task because under the guise of increased accessibility it was ruining wilderness areas with an excess of paved roads, commercialism, and general suburbanization. Like many thinkers of the sixties, Abbey argues against the homogenization of American Society, the mindless construction of dams (and canals), and, of course, the commercialization of everything.Well he and his fellow \`activists' from the sixties were absolutely right and, even before Global Warming became the political football it is today, they saw humans as stewards an increasingly fragile earth. It is too bad they lost all the arguments they put forward and the establishment won. Drill baby Drill!"},{"Title":"Desert Solitaire : A Season in the Wilderness","review":"There's not a whole lot I can add to all of the reviews posted thus far, so I'll keep this brief. Abbey was ahead of his time in foreseeing the problems that would overtake not only the canyonlands area, but the nation and the world. He wasn't afraid to speak honestly, even if it meant exposing the sometimes contradictory nature that was inherent in Abbey (and that is present in all of us). While some of Abbey's other books were perhaps not up to par, Desert Solitaire is truly a great book. Some have said that it has the power to change lives. I can attest to this personally, because it changed mine."},{"Title":"Desert Solitaire : A Season in the Wilderness","review":"When he wrote this book, Cactus Ed did such a great job in describing the canyon country of southern Utah that you can recommend it to everyone who likes widerness. Not the pseudo-one we have today, no, the real one, where you can truly be in touch with the universe. I live overseas and, each time I miss the colourful landscapes of Utah, I read this book and the desert appears before my eyes. But there's not only descriptions, Abbey also try to find solutions to preserve this unique region from all the dam and road builders only looking for profit, and that's not the least interesting part ! Well, if you prefer action, read &quot;The Monkeywrench Gang&quot;. Oh yes, Ed's sometime contradictory, but who's not ?

I thought no book could transport me back there, such an unworldly experience as it was. But I underestimated the power of Abbey's language.

While some books make you feel like you're tackling a mountain, or headed towards a destination, Desert Solitaire successfully echoes the meditative, yet ruthless quality of the desert. His views about the protection of natural beauty are passionate and infectious. It can make you think twice or thrice about the fruitlessness of our petty, material lives. I plan to enjoy this one over and over, as I would a favorite song"},{"Title":"Desert Solitaire : A Season in the Wilderness","review":"The anger in Abbey's prose has been justified as every year we see more and more of our wilderness trampled, cut, paved and polluted. Desert Solitaire should be re-read every 3 years to remind us of what we're doing to our open spaces. His voice needs to be kept alive as one of the great spokesmen for the land. This is an excellent primer for anyone interested in preserving our natural heritage."},{"Title":"Desert Solitaire : A Season in the Wilderness","review":"I bought this book about 13 years ago from the sale table at a book store. Reading it was a veritable baptism into a new world. Abbey has the ability to draw you into his world, so that as you read you feel like you are walking right beside him. His writing will endear the natural order to you. What a fascinating mind this man has...I have collected all of his nature essay books. They are all spellbinding."},{"Title":"Desert Solitaire : A Season in the Wilderness","review":"I give this book 5 stars for Abbey's beautiful and vivid depiction of the Southwest landscape, and his ability to evoke a powerful sense of what's already been lost and what's at stake. This should be a must-read for anyone who loves the Southwest and cares about its future. At the same time, I have to say I agree with some of the comments by other reviewers about how he sometimes seems to be much more aware of how others impact the pristine wilderness areas than of how he does so himself. After reading his biting observations in the &quot;Down the River&quot; chapter about campers who left an old shoe in a spring and a dirty sock hanging from a bush, I was a little taken aback when he started the next chapter with the following story: &quot;On the way we stopped off briefly to roll an old tire into the Grand Canyon. While watching the tire bounce over tall pine trees, tear hell out of a mule train and disappear with a final grand leap into the inner gorge...&quot; Then on to the next adventure, with no further mention of the poor mule train or of the tire which will probably be there for hundreds of years longer than will the old shoe and sock. What makes that attitude even harder to understand is his obvious deep love for the natural beauty and wildness of the region. At times his lyrical reflections almost pass into the realm of the mystical and sublime, such as during his journey through the doomed Glen Canyon. Despite the occasional contradictions, this book is a classic, and I would strongly recommend it to anyone with an interest in the Southwest."},{"Title":"Desert Solitaire : A Season in the Wilderness","review":"A classic book that I have read over and over and never tire of.

Thank you, Mr. Abbey."},{"Title":"Desert Solitaire : A Season in the Wilderness","review":"Crass, abbrassive, crude, brilliant and poetic. A vivid look at a vanishing sanctuary and the piece of humanity that is fading with it. One of the most profound pieces of work I have come across."},{"Title":"Desert Solitaire : A Season in the Wilderness","review":"I read this book shortly after returning from a trip to Canyonlands. I have gone to most of the places that he Mr. Abbey discusses. He describes the land exactly as it is: The most beautiful place on earth. He is very articulate and descriptive in this book. One would not have a hard time visualizing all that he has described. He takes a different view of nature by getting down and laying in the dirt. He becomes a part of nature, not a tourist traveling through. More people should appreciate nature the way he does"},{"Title":"Desert Solitaire : A Season in the Wilderness","review":"The American experience has given to the world two priceless things above all: the fullest development of the idea of the worth and dignity of the individual life, and love and value of wilderness for its own sake. Desert Solitaire is a monument to, and a celebration of, both. It is one of the most important books of all time, for in it is the evolution of human conciousness. I'm grateful to Ed Abbey for his book, and for his encompassing, inspiring vision of the American West."},{"Title":"Desert Solitaire : A Season in the Wilderness","review":"This is the best book I have ever read. This author far exceeds any in explaining the feelings that are felt through the love of nature and the frustration with society today. This book made me feel alive, the adventure, excitement, sadness, elation that this book can stir in you is incredible. If you only read one book in your life then this is the book for you."},{"Title":"Desert Solitaire : A Season in the Wilderness","review":"Edward Abbey IS the voice crying in and for the wilderness.This book makes my whole being ache with emotion. For the wilderness that is being tamed without consent. For the people who saw it. For those who could have seen it. For those who shouldn't have seen it. And most of all for those who will never see it. What am I saying, NOBODY should just see it. They must BE it to understand it. If you've never read the book I sound like a fool. Read it. LIVE it. Ed Abbey is the only one to have even approached the indescribable beauty that is the Canyonlands country.My favorite quote which is a key to understanding this book:&quot;A man on foot...will see more, feel more, enjoy more in one mile than the motorized tourists can in a hundred miles.&quot;"},{"Title":"Desert Solitaire : A Season in the Wilderness","review":"In Desert Solitaire, Abbey puts to words my feelings every time I've visited the desert- &quot;the ideal place, the right place, the one true home.&quot; He captures the beauty, but also the grit, the isolation and sparseness, the simplicity-- and the wonder. At moments, Abbey's novel is an expression of humility in the face of perfection, at others, an all-out rage against the raping of these lands for purposes of economic gain and tourism for the masses. If you're looking for a pretty travelogue, don't bother. If you truly love the Desert Southwest, or any of our last remaining fragments of true wilderness, and hurt every time you see the land treated with ignorance and disrespect, you'll love this book. We need more voices like Abbey's."},{"Title":"Desert Solitaire : A Season in the Wilderness","review":"This is the cover and version of the book I purchased at the UC Santa Barbara book store in January 1977. Edward Abbey, a true curmudgeon, writes beautifully and with passion about his American Southwest, with his narrow and sometimes brusque dismissal of \\"technology\\" being excused by his obvious love for the desert and the rocks and the snakes et al. His writing glows with that energy, and provided me a springboard from which to raise my own environmental sensibility. A life changer, and a damn fun read, still, thirty plus years on."},{"Title":"Desert Solitaire : A Season in the Wilderness","review":"This is where the cranky hardcore desert conservationism of Edward Abbey truly took wing, and the book is a well-deserved classic in environmentalist circles. In the late 60s, Abbey wrote about his season as a ranger in Utah's then-little developed Arches National Monument (now a heavily \\"improved\\" National Park), plus his explorations of the nearby mountains, canyons, and deserts. Of special importance here is the story of Abbey's rafting trip down Glen Canyon, one of the last such journeys before the horrendous dam was built, plus an extremely rare exploration of \\"The Maze\\" area near Canyonlands National Park. Abbey surely found his lifelong love of the desert during this time, and the book's philosophy runs toward what would now be called \\"hard ecology,\\" in which humans are given no place of importance in the natural world &#8211; except for those humans who can \\"really\\" appreciate it. Of course, Abbey and his cohorts qualify.Abbey's philosophy at this point was rather unfocused and contradictory, as he doesn't mind bragging about carving his name in a tree, or rolling an old tire into the Grand Canyon, while complaining about tourists who don&#8217;t have the proper level of respect for nature. His writing is undeniably cranky, irreligious, anarchistic, antisocial, and even anti-human at times, such as the infamous line in which he says he'd rather kill a man than a snake, plus frequent musings on wrecking the monuments of human civilization. However, Abbey's worldview extends far beyond these problematic details, in that he defined the philosophy of communing with nature, which has become incredibly influential to outdoor lovers and serious conservationists. This book is the ultimate resource in learning about how living without the conveniences of civilization can really shape a person's appreciation for the Earth.

He agrees very strongly with you. Here he tells stories from his time in the deserts of Utah and Arizona. His description of Glen Canyon, before it was flooded to create Lake Powell, is the best I have ever read of a place. This is a great, almost poetic description of a place, the desert, that Abbey held a special love for. It is hard to read this book and not bring away your own love of the canyons and mesas, arches and dunes, of the southwestern desert."},{"Title":"Desert Solitaire : A Season in the Wilderness","review":"Edward Abbey reflects and reports on a summer he spent as a ranger at Arches National Park in Utah. At that time, Arches was in a pre \\"industrialized park\\" state. Desert Solitaire is his tale of adventures and his book of memories. Below is a sprinkling of quotes to give you a taste, a flavor, of what you can expect.\\"Every man, every woman, carries in heart and mind the image of the ideal place, the right place, the one true home, known or unknown, actual or visionary\\" (p. 1).\\"... I have personal convictions to uphold. Ideals, you might say. I prefer not to kill animals. I'm a humanist; I'd rather kill a man than a snake\\" (p. 20).\\"Don't actually care for ants. Neurotic little pismires\\" (p. 30).\\"We need more predators. The sheepmen complain, it is true, that the coyotes eat some of their lambs. This is true but do they eat enough? I mean, enough lambs to keep the coyotes sleek, healthy, and well fed. That is my concern\\" (p. 35).\\"We are kindred all of us, killer and victim, predator and prey, me and the sly coyote, the soaring buzzard, the elegant gopher snake, the trembling cottontail, the foul worms that feed on our entrails, all of them, all of us. Long live diversity, long live the earth!\\" (p. 38-39).\\"An increasingly pagan and hedonistic people (thank God!), we are learning finally that the forests and mountains and desert canyons are holier than our churches. Therefore let us behave accordingly\\" (p. 60).\\"A man could be a lover and defender of the wilderness without ever in his lifetime leaving the boundaries of asphalt, powerlines, and right-angled surfaces. We need wilderness whether or not we ever set foot in it\\" (p. 148).\\"'Ralph Newcomb', I say, 'do you believe in God?''Who?' he says.'Who?''Who.''You said it,' I say\\" (p. 180).\\"'Newcomb, for godsake where do we come from?''Who knows?''Where are we going?''Who cares?''Who?''Who'\\" (p. 185).\\"But the love of wilderness is more than a hunger for what is always beyond reach; it is also an expression of loyalty to the earth, the earth which bore us and sustains us, the only home we shall ever know, the only paradise we ever need - if only we had the eyes to see. Original sin, the true original sin, is the blind destruction for the sake of greed of this natural paradise which lies all around us - if only we were worthy of it\\" (p. 190).\\"What does [the desert] mean? It means nothing. It is as it is and has no need for meaning. The desert lies beneath and soars beyond any possible human qualification. Therefore, sublime\\" (p. 219).\\"I am almost prepared to believe that this sweet virginal primitive land will be grateful for my departure and the absence of the tourists, will breath metaphorically a collective sigh of relief - like a whisper of wind - when we are all and finally gone and the place and its creations can return to their ancient procedures unobserved and undisturbed by the busy, anxious, brooding consciousness of man\\" (p. 300).Enjoy. Abbey is a writer first, a naturalist second. He takes liberties as necessary to tell his story, so this only seems like an autobiography. Obviously, he was less concerned then about \\"political correctness.\\" I suspect he would be as irreverent today."},{"Title":"Desert Solitaire : A Season in the Wilderness","review":"If only we could travel back in time to a world less paved... Abbey's adventures in Utah and Arizona are adventures many crave and find it harder and harder to find in today's small world. This book is special, provocative, a tad crazy, and above all, a wonderful experience. A must have for any lover of the wild."},{"Title":"Desert Solitaire : A Season in the Wilderness","review":"This is a collection of romance stories. Romance between a man and the land. Edward Abbey writes lovingly about the stark beauty of Arches National Park -- a hard edged place of immense and awe inspiring beauty.Weaving impressions of a summer spent as a park ranger living in a trailer with minimal comforts, Mr. Abbey exhibits his virtuosity in taking us out where the stars touch the desert. The place has a completely unique personality of its own and Abbery describes it lovingly and raw.After World War II Moab, Utah became a boomtown for uranium mining. The wide disparity between nature's splendor and man's desire to build weapons of destruction set the stage for one unforgettable chapter, &quot;Rocks&quot; that I've read at least a half a dozen times.After reading Desert Solitaire you'll want to go this magnificent part of Utah. If you've been to that part of the country and want to go back, read it. The sweep of the country and Abbey's wry wit is a thoroughly satisfying reading experience."},{"Title":"Desert Solitaire : A Season in the Wilderness","review":"Desert Solitaire is definently worth reading. Edward Abbey is humorous and informative. His writing is very thoughtful and his plan to get rid of cars and roads in national parks (which has not been very successful) is a great idea. Too many people don't get away from the business of every day life and spend time alone with their thoughts. The book can be dry at times when he writes about twenty different kinds of flowers and their scientific names, but he is a great story-teller when he tells of his adventures."},{"Title":"Desert Solitaire : A Season in the Wilderness","review":"Abbey's &quot;Desert Solitaire&quot; is a classic, and I can hardly add to the adoring comments others have already made.However, I can point out the irony the book itself represents. The people who hold the book up as an icon of the wilderness movement are often the very people Abbey would have deplored. For example, the mountain bikers who treat the Arches National Mounument as their own personal playground--who throw beer bottles around, play loud music, and leave bycicle skid marks on the slick rock--love Abbey's book and think of him as a &quot;righteous dude,&quot; but their cavalier treatment of this natural wonder represents the very thing that Abbey condemns in &quot;Desert Solitaire.&quot;I shed a tear everytime I reread &quot;Desert Solitaire,&quot; for Arches has become worse than Abbey's greatest fears."},{"Title":"Desert Solitaire : A Season in the Wilderness","review":"Reading this book is, I feel, an unspoken duty of all people with any interest in what allows them to live. Unlike some readers, I interpret Abbey's vision of the best lifestyle as a balance between roots (nature) and future (society). He is not a Luddite, nor is he an anarchist. This book offends many due to its strong views (name one person that made a difference about something they were ambivalent over). The key to understanding Desert Solitaire is; (yes here comes the platitude); keeping an open mind. There is no better way to phrase it."},{"Title":"Desert Solitaire : A Season in the Wilderness","review":"Abbey perceives the west and wild places in a way people overlook, by getting the word accross (In a crude Abbey humor way) that there Isn't a need for paved roads and parking lots in beautiful secluded places. He also tells about his adventures in serene senic places before Industrialism or &quot;Industrial tourism&quot; arrived. This book put me in a different place, a place I cannot put into words, from a view other than the car window. Read it."},{"Title":"Desert Solitaire : A Season in the Wilderness","review":"First of all, Edward Abbey proves here that he is a good writer, not just another naturalist looking to snag a sympathetic ear. This is a book written with clarity and confidence, unlike other similar works. The passages are obviously painstakingly distilled from larger compositions by a master editor -- in this case, Abbey himself, who gives the reader only the best observations he first formulated during his summer as a Ranger in the Arches National Park several decades ago. Nothing is hesitant here, there are no arms or legs that do not belong. Above all, it's just a good story, an entertaining read. A soul spending a season mostly alone in one of the more remote places in the United States, and the triumphs and trials he encounters therein.Most of the descriptions are in form somewhat like the desert Abbey is attempting to accurately portray: precise, sparse, even dry. Nothing is there which should not be, no statement jars the poetic ear, each sentence is precisely placed, and no passage is needlessly embellished to create what would otherwise be your typical humdrum travelogue.And even the problems I find in the book are not so much faults that exist in the writing itself as differences in opinion between Abbey's conception of humanity and my own. Basically, his patronizing attitude towards people who are not as naturally-inclined as himself made for a less entertaining read, at least in my case. In other words, I could have done without all the bitter sarcasm and thinly-veiled insults hurled at the natural wonders I consider no less significant than any sunlit desert arch: human beings.I don't think the great wonders or mysteries of the world should be accessible only to some self-appointed few, for example, who have (temporarily, anyway) the good fortune, youth, and strength to be able to get out there and grasp their totality, while I do think that any great city is just as marvellous as any great desert, and that a single man is worth more than any mountain in the world.Basically, I didn't enjoy the background noise to the stories, but I liked the stories themselves.Purely personal review, but what else can a review be, right?"},{"Title":"Desert Solitaire : A Season in the Wilderness","review":"Actually, I really liked that he was so passionate about experiencing nature, and unwilling to bow to the demands of industrial tourism. The cedars, primrose and LGB's (little gray birds) need an advocate, and Abbey was a stirring, uncompromising voice for life and wildness."},{"Title":"Desert Solitaire : A Season in the Wilderness","review":"As with so much in life, what you think of this book will depend on the circumstances of your encounter. I was fortunate to find it in the \\"old\\" Jerome Hotel in Aspen in the early 1970s and read it out loud with my girl friend of that summer as we traveled the West. There is no greater READING experience than to sit on a rock above the Goosenecks of the San Jaun River and, reading aloud at sunset, discover Abbey's fierce voice and love of the very place you are.A wonderful read it was, but I wonder how that voice would sound today. I'll not jeopardize my memory and reread it, but if you haven't, get it and see for yourself. You won't forget it."},{"Title":"Desert Solitaire : A Season in the Wilderness","review":"In this fascinating ecological memoir/rant, Abbey takes us along during his time as a park ranger in the heart of Utah's harsh red rock landscape to expose its beauty and contradictions. While some things have changed since the book's publication in 1968, the majority of Abbey's thoughts and experiences remain timeless. A true classic of environmental nonfiction."},{"Title":"Desert Solitaire : A Season in the Wilderness","review":"A story about giving it all up and living in the wild. It is about a year spent living out in wild country in Utah, and all the happenings that go along with it. Really just a classic book that should be read by everyone. I read it every year, and it just makes me want to quit my job and move out into the desert, which I probably will do one of these days.Bob Rodgers"},{"Title":"Desert Solitaire : A Season in the Wilderness","review":"I can't rave about this book enough, It was required reading for a literature of the outdoors class I took in college a decade ago and I've probably read it 20+ times since then. My copy is tattered, highlighted and written all over. Growing up in rural Utah I feel Abbey's pain towards the paving and developing of these beautiful areas. I crave the solitude that he writes about, understand the attachment towards random small creatures and can't help but laugh and nod my head in agreement at his rants. Anyone who spends time in pristine wilderness, redrock desert or not, will appreciate this read."},{"Title":"Desert Solitaire : A Season in the Wilderness","review":"While Ed Abbey preferred to be remembered for his novels - and they are worth remembering - it is Desert Solitaire that is his magnum opus. It is a brilliant and astonishing book, that is much more than a memoir. It is at once a plea for preservation of the last vestiges of the wild American West, a harangue against the department of transportation and the automobile idolatry, and a philosophical-political treatise on society and solidarity and surfaces. As metaphysics, Desert Solitaire challenges the dichotomy of appearance and reality, of surface play and essence. Abbey writes in the intro: \\"Here I must confess that I know nothing whatever about true underlying reality, having never met any...For my own part I am pleased enough with surfaces -- in fact they alone seem to me to be of much importance.\\" As a political treatise, the book argues for a limited government, that leaves some things untouched, and for the individual need to have some place to go and escape from the regulations and routines that define normalcy. He appeals to the lover of nature, that the wild no longer remains wild when it is universally accessible; the job of a good park service should be to limit easy access in order to promote real contact. The book is full of surprising and wonderful descriptions of red rocks and cliffs and snakes and jack rabbits and ruggedly wild plants; it is brimming with outrageous suggestions that start out sounding funny until you wonder that he may mean them seriously and further begin to wonder whether he may be right to really mean them. Perhaps most touching and powerful are his reflections on the way down the Colorado river on a raft, as the clock was ticking for the end of it all with the coming of the Glen Canyon dam and the artificial Lake Powell. A masterpiece of American literature, on par withWalden."},{"Title":"Desert Solitaire : A Season in the Wilderness","review":"A look at Arches National Park and the environment surrounding Moab, Utah before paved roads and development, when the area was still pristine and human traffic was sparse.

You will especially enjoy it if you have an affinity for deserts, the southwest, or Moab country."},{"Title":"Desert Solitaire : A Season in the Wilderness","review":"This book is a moment in time. A meditation on what was in the face of what was to come. It despaired a bit in the imagined future of the Arches, but, ultimately, reveled in the moment.But the moment is the only real thing. The future is what it might be, and the past is something only dreamed upon. And this moment in time is one worth spending with Ranger Abbey. This is a moment spent in a little tin trailer with the most perceptive man available. This is a moment spent that you know is real.There is a poetry of solitude that few can capture. A longing for the universal, but a need to stand alone. A bit of a dichotomy, but one that you might be able to wrap your head around...Suffice it to say that the howl of pain and ultimate aloneness in a bowl of water where you might possibly die alone is a powerful moment. An embarassing excursion that puts your life on the line. By uncareful accident.But you really haven't lived your life until that has happened to you, now, has it? Welcome to Abbey's road.

I expected informative and interesting descriptions of the desert southwest, and there is some of this. However, the author gets so carried away with inappropriate political discussion and criticism of almost everyone and everything, it really detracts from the story. I actual skipped through some of these parts. When he does stay with the natural descriptions, the author is knowledgable and actually quite poetic. Some of his descriptions are over-the-top though with tedious classical and cultural references. Would not recommend this book.

The casual cruelty to various animals is bad enough; the condescending racism against the Navajo is more subtle but much worse; the author's self-admitted loathing for the rest of humanity seals it up in a nice neat packageI give this book a \\"5\\" because it actually delivers something quite valuable in today's world of packaged sound bites, and practiced and wholesale misrepresentation: an in-depth and accurate view into the \\"liberal environmentalist\\" soul. Abbey lets it \\"all hang out\\" here, and this book is a \\"must read\\" for those undecided in their moral judgment of the environmentalist mindset."},{"Title":"Desert Solitaire : A Season in the Wilderness","review":"This is the first Edward Abbey book I've come across. At first enticed by his espoused love of desert beauty, I stopped short in mid-sentence somewhere early on, disappointed, disgusted and disillusioned; I had been led unsuspectingly into witnessing his sudden, heartless, unprovoked murder of a completely harmless small animal. I couldn't agree more with the words of another reviewer; \\"he [the author] picks up a rock and kills a rabbit just for the fun of it, and then talks about how he felt no remorse, only power, as if he had received the \\"spiritual energy of the rabbit\\" after killing it. He was energized afterward, extremely pleased with himself.\\" Abbey sounded alarmingly close to psychotic. For all his lovely use of language, seemingly profound nature-loving insights and proclaimed appreciation of animal and plant life, Edward Abbey is an insensitive jerk. Obviously it will be the LAST Abbey book I ever pick up. If this review saves just one person from spending money for an insensitive slap that can take your breath away, then the time I spent to warn others will have been worth it."},{"Title":"Desert Solitaire : A Season in the Wilderness","review":"This was just a travel log...almost just a daily journal.

When it ended, I was shocked, and my response was, \\"that's it?\\""},{"Title":"Desert Solitaire : A Season in the Wilderness","review":"You've got to admire a man known as the quintessential evironmentalist who writes so gleefully about trashing nearly everyplace he goes. This book is above all humorous and that by itself would make this book enjoyable. Abbey is also a good story-teller. And Abbey is a good naturalist also.The book chronicles a few seasons Abbey spends as a seasonal ranger in Arches National Monument (now a Park). Abbey describes the environs adequately but in no great depth. What is fascinating is how Abbey relates to the environment and how he interacts with it. Also included are a few other excursions like his float trip down Glen Canyon prior to its flooding by the dam.My favorite parts are the dumb things Abbey does in the environment. Maybe Abbey is saying that is why we need wilderness. We need someplace to lay naked in the sun, burn down, carve initials into trees, or to get away from tourists. My favorite story is when Abbey lights a wildfire in Glen Canyon with his careless bumbling and runs and jumps on his raft just as the flames roar up to the beach. And Abbey seems to enjoy trashing the environment whenever possible doing stunts like rolling old tires into the Grand Canyon (through a mule train) and continually laying naked out in the boondocks somewhere. He also likes carving his initials in various places. His antics with the tourists who seem to bother him in spite of his job being to help them are priceless. There is also a humorous account of being a part of a search for a missing (and dead and bloated) tourist.All in all, an amusing read more for the insight into Abbey than into the places he visited. And let me also throw in a quote from Abbey's intro. \\"The time passed extremely slowly, as time should pass, with the days lingering and long, spacious and free as the summers of childhood. There was time enough for once to do nothing...\\". Anyone who can think and write like that deserves to be read."},{"Title":"Desert Solitaire : A Season in the Wilderness","review":"This is a totally enjoyable and recommended book. My only problem is that the author as a National Park System ranger does so many dangerous things that cannot be condoned. Please do not follow his example. It is very dangerous to do the following, as he did.1. Hike through the desert without a supply of water. 2. Climb a 13,000 foot peak alone with no one to go for help if needed. 3. Sliding down a 2,000 foot snow slide without proper equipment. 4. Rafting down the Colorado River without a life vest. 5. Descending alone down a canyon for a short cut and getting stuck in a deadly position, with no way to get help. 6. Hiking many places off of established trails all alone. 7. Hiking so far that it requires a more dangerous return in the dark of night. 8. Starting wild fires due to carelessness with pipe smoking. 9. Trying to capture a wild horse all alone and getting run over. This was done while all alone with no possibility of getting help if injured. 10. Drinking water from any available creek, pond or seep. Western water is now dangerous to drink in all western national parks. Treatment is necessary. 11. Eating five eggs and half a pound of bacon for breakfast. Is this the reason he died so young?Many tourists may read this book and follow his bad examples. I wish that he had given more words of caution. Follow the advice of more knowledgeable park rangers.

His ideas are fascinating, and as more and more of our national parks and monuments are paved to make them user-friendly, Abbey's book becomes more and more important, especially in light of our current administration's (lousy) attitude regarding the environment.

After finishing it, I wish I was introduced to Abbey sooner. The book clearly defines the boundaries that exist between the desert and civilization. Abbey's focus is on the enjoyment that people can have by leaving their inhibitions and mechanical inclinations behind before they venture into the desert. The most interesting aspect of the book is Abbey's belief of anthromorphism(behavior that is similiar to animals). At times, his writing can appear crude and sexist; however, the book is a great read for anybody who is interested in nature."},{"Title":"Desert Solitaire : A Season in the Wilderness","review":"I had to read this for my American Literature class.

Abbey does a fantastic job describing the canyonland region. I live about three hours away in Durango,CO and I fell blessed to be able to visit the old stomping grounds of Ed whenvever I want. If you can't visit Moab currently, you can at least get some understanding, from this book, on why this area is so magnificent. If you love the 4-Corners area and want a feel for what it was like before tourism emerged please read this book--it will give you a whole different view point of the desert."},{"Title":"Desert Solitaire : A Season in the Wilderness","review":"This book is for anyone with any love of the outdoors. Every time I pick it up and read it, even if it's only for a moment, I see the desert. Abbey has written an astonishing memorial to mother Nature. A must read."},{"Title":"Desert Solitaire : A Season in the Wilderness","review":"If you've ever visited the four corners region of the country, you know the irresistable romantic lure Abbey talks about in this book. Utter isolation is really what this book is about, and no matter what level of outdoors preson you are, you'll have no problem empathizing with what Abbey has to say. Great Book."},{"Title":"Desert Solitaire : A Season in the Wilderness","review":"I discovered the Desert Southwest a decade ago, and re-read this classic whenever I long to return but can't. Abbey's spare descriptions of an equally spare country that he obviously loves are an eloquent plea for the preservation wild places around the planet, not just in the slickrock regions of the Colorado Plateau."},{"Title":"Desert Solitaire : A Season in the Wilderness","review":"Abbey's writing is stellar! His excellant use of similies and metaphores make his worka page turner! I perchased two paperback copies to share with friends."},{"Title":"Desert Solitaire : A Season in the Wilderness","review":"A beautifully written book. The author's prose is poetic in its description of the desert, but doesn't leave the reader to wonder his meaning. Mr. Abbey is not a pretentious writer. He is an outdoorsman expressing himself in a folksy manner.For anyone who has visited the desert, e.g. Grand Canyon, Zion, the Eastern Sierra, you will soon visualize Edward Abbey's words and feelings. He describes the desert and its inhabitants (animal and plant life) in such a way that the reader will soon find himself walking along with him. You will also realize the time of year you are exploring the desert and canyons, watching the cloud formations, feeling the touch of the rain or snow, and experiencing the bitter cold or extreme heat.Mr. Abbey can also get crusty at times, especially when he expresses his philosophy about the protection of the wilderness. He is especially negative about the presence of an abundance of automobiles invading the National Parks and other wilderness areas. Justifiably so!My only regret is that I purchased this book as an e-book to be read on my Kindle. I have only myself to blame! This is the kind of book that should be shared with others, which is difficult to do with a Kindle. I would also like to go back and re-read certain sections of the book or locate certain quotes, which is not impossible, but again difficult. Gosh, I miss a Table of Contents. I highly recommend buying the print edition."},{"Title":"Desert Solitaire : A Season in the Wilderness","review":"A great into to a wonderful part of North America and what is happening to it, to us as well over-develop every square inch.

Prices are great and I stock up on the frequently to give out. Love it!"},{"Title":"Desert Solitaire : A Season in the Wilderness","review":"Ed Abbey was right, correct, spot-on.Visit Arches National park, try to backpack there and you'll discover that many areas are off limits. Why? The living crust of the soil is damaged by foot steps. Now a handful of people stepping on the soil won't creat irrevocable harm but thousands of boots, shoes, sneakers and sandals each week have a way of doing just that. How is it that so many feet trample this fragile ground? The damned roads the park service built to ferry auto tourists in to nearly every notable geographic feature is why and Ed Abbey predicted it decades ago in Desert Solitaire. Hell I've seen an incredible amount of change occur there since my first visit in '84 or '85 and its not the good kind of change.So if you are of the mind to walk to these places with a pack on your back and enjoy the healthful beauty of it all, you are S.O.L. you'll just have to drive, pumping more green house gases into the atmosphere going up and down the hills.Desert solitaire is a great book, written by an actual human being with faults and worthy ideals that he might not have always lived up to but which are nonetheless valid. Its almost a guidebook to the area and I'm glad I picked it up 30+ years ago."},{"Title":"Desert Solitaire : A Season in the Wilderness","review":"I really enjoyed this book overall, and think you will too if you like reading about the American Southwest---before speculators, land developers, and other capitalists came with intentions to \\"develop the land\\" and make money off it. Abbey loves the southwest, and loves being alone in it, to revel in the mystery and beauty of the desert canyon country. How refreshing to read about Arches National Monument--which had a dirt road entry instead of a paved highway. Abbey gives you a glimpse of how this vast canyon region, and Glen Canyon was before WE came. There is an incredible chapter about his float down the now under water and dammed Glen Canyon.This book is a compilation of adventures, musings and rants from his time in the desert country of Utah. Some parts better than others. I can't say I agree with everything Abbey says, or put him on some pedestal where he is beyond reproach--which he certainly isn't. For example he comments on Jazz music saying \\"Jazz is indoor music...from melancholy nightclubs and sad nighttime rooms...a joyless sound, for all its nervous energy\\". Being a Jazz lover I couldn't disagree more, and I think here Abbey reveals his own narrow (dare I say ignorant?), misguided opinion of Jazz music as a genre. To describe Jazz as \\"joyless\\" is laughably wrong.In any event, this is not a book about Jazz--but a great tome waxing about the beautiful desert country of the American Southwest! I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Desert Solitaire : A Season in the Wilderness","review":"Awesome book, very informative, no Complaints at all!! I can't put it down Great read for anyone looking for more info on the subject."},{"Title":"Desert Solitaire : A Season in the Wilderness","review":"I'd say this is number one favorite nonfiction outdoor book ever. One of the best nonfiction books I've ever read."},{"Title":"Desert Solitaire : A Season in the Wilderness","review":"E Abbey is brutally honest and true to his love of the desert SW. I love his writing style. It's beautifully descriptive and innocently funny. He can rant and rave like only a lover can. I bought a copy for each of my favorites on the old Christmas list."},{"Title":"Desert Solitaire : A Season in the Wilderness","review":"I bought this book seeking some insight into my own desire to escape to the Southern Utah region several times a year. Instead of a wise and intelligent 'father' of modern envirolmentalism... I found Abbey to be a hypocrit. He throws trash into the desert, thinks himself above the law, and disturbs fragile ecosystems as much or more than the people he rants on and on and on and on about. Disappointing."},{"Title":"Desert Solitaire : A Season in the Wilderness","review":"There's a hard to find video about Edward Abbey, that I bought at Ken Sanders Rare Books in Salt Lake City, UT. Check out their website if you're interested in seeing the video. It's a collection of interviews of friends and family of Edward Abbey, and the best story told in this video was the following.A daughter relates a story of her mother bumping into Edward Abbey at a party. After getting acquainted her mother confessed that she had never read any of his books, and she asked Abbey, that that if she were to read just one, which book should she read?Edward Abbey then took her into a separate room, and made a suggestion to her, the suggestion unknown to the rest of the guests. The daughter smiles, and says, she could never get her mother to tell her what book it was he suggested, because she was sworn to secrecy.However, one day she found in her room, a copy of Desert Solitaire.Desert Solitaire is the novel, along with The Monkey Wrench Gang, that Edward Abbey is best known for. Abbey claimed to never understand why the book became so popular because it took the least effort for him to write. I think that's what makes this book so powerful. It's told straight from the heart, mind and journal of Abbey's experience as a park ranger at Moab, Arches National Park.The novel very much is a stream of consciousness novel; a series of essays, with no effort to make a segue to the next. Yet the themes that stay constant throughout - passion about the wilderness, its protection and nostalgaic reverence - make it unnecessary.Some of his ideas were considered revolutionary and inflammatory then, but now we can read it and call them the voice of reason. Take in point, present government plans to create a parking lot outside of Zion National Park (which Abbey jokingly refers to as Zion National Parking Lot), so tourists riding bulky campers among other things will have to take a shuttle into the park during peak season.At times his stories are very political, then the next chapter can become very raw and personal. His story of getting trapped in a narrow canyon tributary of Grand Canyon is riveting, honest and really offers a surprising contrast to his &quot;tough and rough&quot; demeanor he takes on in many of his essays in other novels.Overall, the images and emotions he expresses are a gift to many outdoor enthusiasts. I know no one else who has put the desert experience better into words than Edward Abbey. And if I meet someone who knows and loves this book, I know that person has experienced the desert (whether or not they actually have set foot in one) much like I have.Edward Abbey tried throughout his life to write the Great American Novel. Though he never admitted it in press or writing (as far as I know...the only reference was when he gave Desert Solitaire a B+ I believe, in one of his introductions), I think he knew Desert Solitaire was his best novel. It was his most personal (this along with Black Sun), and thus, I think the reason he never embraced it publicly."},{"Title":"Desert Solitaire : A Season in the Wilderness","review":"As someone born and raised in Moab, Utah 5 miles from Arches and Canyonlands National Parks this book has been a foundational read for my life. The emotional attachment one experiences when surrounded by the desert and red rocks are captured in Abbey's beautiful writing. He saw in 1970 what was going to happen as \\"we discovered\\" the desert and we began to love it to a point of exploitation.This book is a masterpiece in environmental writing and a call to awareness that the earth deserves better than we humans often deliver. It also is the foundation for great writers like Terry Tempest Williams and builds on the legacy of Wallace Stegner.If you haven't read it, read it. If you have read it, read it again."},{"Title":"Desert Solitaire : A Season in the Wilderness","review":"Stumbled onto this in my late teens in the early 80s and never looked back. Abbey's extreme love of nature and his well-defended loathing of what we've done to our natural world add up to a real eye-opener for those, like me at 18, who haven't thought much about how great this place must have been before we got here.Abbey's love of solitude and comfort in being in the middle of \\"nowhere\\" inspired me to seek out remote places and my life has been all the better for it. His irascible attitude towards government also strikes a strong chord, but the main joys here lie in Ed's awe and wonder at the magnificence of the canyons and mesas he happily lives with before the bulldozers and mindless tourists inevitably arrive. The bits about people driving in for a few minutes and then leaving after taking pictures are truly classic; Ed can be one of the most hilariously dry nature writers when the mood is upon him.I've since read most all of Abbey but still think DS is his masterpiece.This book should be in EVERY high school English curriculum."},{"Title":"Desert Solitaire : A Season in the Wilderness","review":"I think this is far and away Abbey's best book. The prose is careful, precise, thoughtful. In my first year teaching, I would read a short section of this book every morning before climbing into the trenches, to remind myself what beautiful prose could be--regardless of the subject matter. (As an animal lover and vegetarian, I still have a hard time with his description of beaning the rabbit.) The book, I think, is definitely a \\"guy\\" book--but that's how my taste in reading goes, so I loved it back then, still love it today."},{"Title":"Desert Solitaire : A Season in the Wilderness","review":"Somehow this book has gotten the reputation of being an extreme environmental rant. In fact, Abbey's recommendation for traffic control has been implemented in Zion to excellent effect.The book on the whole is very well written and is a poetic description of the desert southwest when it was still quite wild: before Arches became accessible and before the Glen Canyon dam created Lake Powell.My only complaint is that the cover of my edition shows a photo of Monument Valley, which is only briefly mentioned, instead of Arches, which is the whole book."},{"Title":"Desert Solitaire : A Season in the Wilderness","review":"This book is the author's memoir of the time he was a park ranger at Arches National Monument in Utah. Edward Abbey was a true believer in maintaining the pristine, natural beauty of the desert area under his guardianship. Abbey was extraordinarily hostile to what he called &quot;Industrial Tourism&quot;: the construction of a system of roads through this desert wonderland which would brings thousands of tourists, their automobiles, and eventual ruination to the environment. He mentions the many pressure groups who threaten to turn Arches National Monument, and other national parks, into picnic grounds. Abbey admits that he would be happy if no tourists ever visited his park.Abbey describes desert scenery of great natural beauty and wonder. He often hiked in the desert area on unmarked trails, carrying with him the barest provisions, often risking his life on the possibility he may never get back. Abbey concerned himself with getting to his destination first, then worry about getting back afterwards. Tourists would never even consider taking such journeys. _Desert Solitaire_ is written in a style nearing poetry--blank verse--and was a total joy to read."},{"Title":"Desert Solitaire : A Season in the Wilderness","review":"I recently visited Arches National Park. It is a place of beautiful contrasts -- stone eroded into unusual formations, standing red against a bright blue sky. Unfortunately, the park was experiencing difficulties associated with a skyrocketing number of visitors: destruction of trails, traffic congestion, parking shortages.Edward Abbey was a ranger at Arches Park during the 1960s, before a single paved road traversed the park, when it was an entirely different place. &quot;Desert Solitaire&quot; details his season spent in the wilderness, when he grew increasingly familiar with the power, beauty, and intensity of the Utah desert. His writing, much like the landscape, possesses a captivating depth and clarity.Sadly, Abbey foretold that his book would be an elegy to a place that would cease to exist. The Arches Park that he wrote about with such passion has disappeared, replaced by the colassal traffic jam he prophesized. Abbey's book stands as a warning to those who would pave over and develop even more of the natural world. It is already too late for Arches."},{"Title":"Desert Solitaire : A Season in the Wilderness","review":"This book is a must read for lovers of the desert. Abbey's writing conjures up such vivid images that you feel as if you are with him on his rafting excursion or sitting with him behind the trailer that he lived in as a park ranger. He pulls no punches in his opinion of how we have abused our national parks. Abbey tells of his experience as a ranger in Arches National Park and if you have been there, his stories make you long to go back. My favorite story is one that he shares about a horse that fled its owners and lived in one of the side canyons. Abbey makes it a point to visit the horse. I won't say anymore lest I spoil it. I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Desert Solitaire : A Season in the Wilderness","review":"This is at once a hilarious and disturbing book - hilarious in that Abbey's flippant attitude and \\"I value nature more than mankind\\" take on life is refreshing and leads to a lot of awkward encounters; disturbing in that it highlights just how much environmental degradation North America has undergone. If Abbey was railing this angrily decades ago, one can only imagine what he'd say about today's state of affairs.Many people who've written negative reviews here have taken digs at Abbey's less-than-perfect character and belief system, but let's start with the book itself.Abbey undeniably has the gift of clarity. The genuine tenderness and reverence with which he evokes a lizard ducking behind a rock or storm clouds dumping a distant flash flood on the mesas rolling through the skies - it's really beautiful and evocative. You're THERE. The book consists of a great many loosely-connected chapters purportedly recounting \\"a season in the wilderness\\", when Abbey worked as park ranger at Arches National Monument in Utah. He explains that actually it was a couple of seasons, and various other anecdotes and trivia are thrown in throughout.Abbey cooks lonely meals, watches the dust and clouds blow by, helps ranchers rack up their stray cows for extra cash, gets lost in the mesas, and generally treats naive and arrogant tourists with a good deal of spite. Along the way, we're treated to his views on our decaying civilization, which he feels is relentlessly smothering the few remaining 'wild' places on the continent - which is essentially undeniable. His greatest qualm seems to be with the 'automobilizing' of the National Park system - adding paved roads throughout many of the parks so that one can simply drive through and 'see it all' from the comfort of one's vehicle. I couldn't agree more with his tirades on this topic, and I think the 'criticisms' of it here are worthless. These places should be explore by the power of one's own two feet - or barring that, by horse or donkey, or even mountain bike; but not by station wagon, for God's sake!!! As Abbey himself so succinctly puts it, the ones who are too young and small to handle it - they'll have their chance soon! And those too old and infirm, well, they already had their chance! One reviewer on here self-righteously declared (to paraphrase): \\"Well, I would NEVER be so selfish as to deny handicapped people the pleasure of visiting the National Parks by removing the roads!\\" But this strikes me as absurd viewpoint: to cut roads into so many wonderful places, to pollute them and so drastically upset the ecological balance within, for the insanely small number of actually totally handicapped people who would thus benefit... it is just not a fair deal for nature. Besides, if the billions of dollars spent paving over natural areas and forcing nature not to reclaim these roads by maintaining were, say, dedicated to research on better prostheses, cures for motor-impairment diseases, and improved BCI's (brain-computer interfaces, which promise to eventually allow even paraplegic or 'locked-in' individuals to manipulate various means of robotic conveyance merely using their thoughts), this problem would probably have been solved by now.Actually, considering how little actually happens in the book, it is a thrilling and addictive read. Abbey's solitary walk in the desert is enthralling, the way he writes it.Some people have pegged Abbey as a cynical old hypocrite, and in some ways this can't be denied. HE wants to enjoy the spaces, but OTHER people are just 'the masses', they just get in the way of his peace and quiet. He wants to remove all the roads from wilderness areas, but then takes off on the weekend and drives right into just such a place to relax on his time off. Etc. But I feel that if we're honest with ourselves, deep down everyone feels that way about nature, or travel, or what have you. Everyone wants to do these things, but they always find it getting spoiled to a greater or lesser degree by all the 'other people' in the parks, or all the 'tourists' on their foreign adventure - failing to recognize that everyone else, we are those 'other people' and those 'other tourists.' I think everyone is guilty of this.One final note on the infamous rabbit incident: yes, Abbey senselessly kills a small rabbit, but it is an accident. He is imagining what his situation would be if he were truly trapped and lost in the wilderness with nothing but his bare hands: would he be able to eat, to survive? He picks up a rock and tries to bean a rabbit just to experiment and to his great surprise actually nails it and kills it, though he's not lost or hungry. He walks away feeling a strong 'sense of power' but I don't think this is a reference to his blood lust - it is the sense of power and confidence he gained from realizing that even with no tools or equipment to his name he could potentially survive on his own skills and wits. That's how I interpreted this scene, in any case.True, Abbey can be a cantankerous old bast*rd, but I gotta say I like his style. I think he is fundamentally correct that the environment must come first, and human needs (and especially human wants and comforts) come in a distant second. After all, if we keep putting ourselves first, where exactly are we going to be living this 'better life' if we wreck our habitat along the way?"},{"Title":"Desert Solitaire : A Season in the Wilderness","review":"If I were stranded on a deserted island and could have one book with me, I would choose this one. It angers me, saddens me, offends me, and elates me. But most of all it inspires me. Each time I read it I uncover something precious and unique. It never grows old. If you truly love all that is convenient and commercialized, if you revel in the gifts technology brings you, don't read it. It's too good for you. If you truly love and are capable of appreciating the serene beauty of the wilderness buy it, read it, then cry. For it's all gone. When you read, read beneath the text. Read deeply into the subtext of this book. It's all about surfaces. Abbey proves that we cannot truly see, experience or appreciate anything unless we can look below the surface as he did."},{"Title":"Desert Solitaire : A Season in the Wilderness","review":"Reading Desert Solitare was like revisiting The Desert of Southern Utah.

It offers a compelling story, interesting history of our country's struggles between preservation and population expansion, and thrilling prose contrasting the peacefulness and dangerous natural wonders of the West. I may actually have to read it again!"},{"Title":"Desert Solitaire : A Season in the Wilderness","review":"Though more than 30 years old, this book is a classic that still holds its own today. Edward Abbey's months of living alone in the vast, uninhabited lands of southern Utah, which most of us will never do, provides a unique perspective on the beauty of the Canyonlands and the outdoors in general. His rafting trip down the Colorado River before it was dammed gives an excellent taste of an adventure that is, unfortunately, no longer possible. And his descriptions of the Maze and its remoteness seemed almost like a fantasy - to amazing to be true. Though reading about the beauty and uniqueness of this area of the country is nothing compared to visiting it, his comments on tourism and the sprawl of American society are particularly relevant today. Coming from a man who is integral in defining the modern conservation movement, this book is a must-read for any outdoor enthusiast."},{"Title":"Desert Solitaire : A Season in the Wilderness","review":"no other author relates the spirit of the southwest like abbey. his undying love and acute perceptions make this book a must read for anyone traveling into the desert. hey even if you aren't going anywhere near sand you should read this just to see what you're missing."},{"Title":"Desert Solitaire : A Season in the Wilderness","review":"The summary above is a direct quote from Edward Abbey's introduction to Desert Solitaire, written in 1967. Utah's Canyon country, Moab, and Arches National Park must have been a remote, wonderful, wild, and inspirational place when Abbey was a seasonal park ranger there. The industrial tourism in US national parks, to which he so strongly objected, has indeed come to pass. This book is an eloquent and passionate plea for the preservation of wild places. It is a must read for anyone who has ever visited southern Utah or plans to do so. Highly recommended"},{"Title":"Desert Solitaire : A Season in the Wilderness","review":"I read this book primarily because it is known as a \\"classic\\" piece of environmental literature. In my opinion, it does not deserve to be considered as such primarily because it is shallow. The basic message that there is value in wilderness for its own sake is obvious. Maybe it was not apparent in the fifties but is obvious now. In terms of preservation, Abbey does not offer any insights other than: stop building roads, stop population growth, keep things as they were in good old times when there was nobody around and i could build fires anywhere i wanted, throw tires in the Grand Canyon, and cut down trees if i felt like it. Not much of an insight."},{"Title":"Desert Solitaire : A Season in the Wilderness","review":"In 1968 Edward Abbey wrote a memoir, Desert Solitaire, A Season In The Wilderness, that would instantly be hailed as a nature classic, as well as his bestselling work. While familiar with EA's name the only work of his I'd read up to this point was a woeful collection of the man's \`poetry'. Believe me, when I say there's a definite reason for the quotes around the word poetry. Apparently the work is considered somewhat of a nature hymn, along the lines of Henry David Thoreau's Walden. This is a perfect example of poor criticism propagating myths down through the years. This is not to say that there is not some fine writing in DS, but neither its consistency nor tone are akin to Walden's....Although these events happened over 3 seasons, the book condenses them down into 1, for dramatic effect. It's a technique that can see such startling contradictions in the same book as this reluctant admission-\`As I type these words, several years after the little episode of the gray jeep and the thirsty engineers, all that was foretold has come to pass. Arches National Monument has been developed. The Master Plan has been fulfilled. Where once a few adventurous people came on weekends to camp for a night or two and enjoy a taste of the primitive and remote, you will now find serpentine streams of baroque automobiles pouring in and out, all through the spring and summer, in numbers that would have seemed fantastic when I worked there: from 3,000 to 30,000 to 300,000 per year, the \`visitation,' as they call it, mounts ever upward....Down at the beginning of the new road, at park headquarters, is the new entrance station and visitor center, where admission fees are collected and where the rangers are going quietly nuts answering the same three basic questions five hundred times a day: (1) Where's the john? (2) How long's it take to see this place? (3) Where's the Coke machine?'-& this contrapuntal admission that he basically understands why the previous lament was written:\`Standing there, gaping at this monstrous and inhuman spectacle of rock and cloud and sky and space, I feel a ridiculous greed and possessiveness come over me. I want to know it all, possess it all, embrace the entire scene intimately, deeply, totally, as a man desires a beautiful woman. An insane wish? Perhaps not--at least there's nothing else, no one human, to dispute possession with me.'While the book is not going to make the reader drop the book & take a breath, like the best of Loren Eiseley, Edward Abbey's Desert Solitaire is a book worth reading, not nearly so much because it is a paean to nature, although it occasionally is, but because it is an excellent portrayal of a man's state of being- a man who could be hypocritical, childish, write poorly, then surmount these flaws. If the same were true of most of EA's readers this last sentence would not be as cogent."},{"Title":"Desert Solitaire : A Season in the Wilderness","review":"Well-beloved and much-reviled prophet of the wilderness and of the wild places, Abbey, like his uvre, covers a lot of ground. Desert Solitaire is probably his best work -- a statement Cactus Ed would spiritedly deny (right before busting my head with a rock).Conceived mainly while Abbey worked as a ranger in Arches National Monument (now National Park), the book is, in turns, a poetic evocation of the desert, a clownish middle finger upthrust into the face of the cosmos, a tirade against middle-America, and, above all else, an uncompromising voice bawling itself hoarse on behalf of nature.Do not misunderstand me; Abbey was no environmental activist, nor was he above decorating the Eisenhower Highways with his empty beer cans. Abbey howled for freedom; freedom from the tyranny of roads and universal access, freedom from development, freedom from the encroachment of the city and its ungainly cousin the suburb, freedom from any form of regulation or oversight... up to and including laws against littering.None of this has ever prevented the old iconoclast from becoming a patron saint of the environmental movement. Nor should it have done. Perhaps he littered the roads, but I love the cranky old bastard all the same. But for Abbey, how would I -- or any other member of my generation -- know what was lost when they flooded Lake Powell? Resist much, obey little.Check this one out, then drink a toast to Cactus Ed. Out of a can."},{"Title":"Desert Solitaire : A Season in the Wilderness","review":"One of the greatest books written about the environment - still I do not understand why we would kill trees to print this and not have a kindle version available..."},{"Title":"Desert Solitaire : A Season in the Wilderness","review":"I have always wanted to visit the desert southwest. Last year, after 33 years I finally got the chance. Abbey, in a very small book, encapsulates in a big way the essence of what I saw and experienced in my two week stay in Northern Arizona, Utah, and Nevada. Slow, uncrowded, earthy natural beauty. His prose is witty and sometimes self loathing or loathing of people in general. The kind of personality that would be right at home in the surroundings that he writes about. In another life Abbey and I probably would have been twins (or the same person). Heck, I'm even from the same area of Pennsylvania that he was from. His love for the desert and aloneness I found to be in kindred spirit. A sole voice crying from the wilderness."},{"Title":"Desert Solitaire : A Season in the Wilderness","review":"Edward Abbey was recommended to me 3 years ago when I was backpacking through the Utah Wilderness. This book brings about a dire longing for anyone who loves the wilderness and solitude. You can only imagine what National Parks and wilderness areas of Eastern Utah and the United States were like before commercial interests got a hold of them. He was a man ahead of his time."},{"Title":"Desert Solitaire : A Season in the Wilderness","review":"If you love the desert, you should already have read this book if not bought a copy or two. Abbey's descriptions of Arches National Park are wonderful, especially for those of us who can't visit there as often as we would like."},{"Title":"Desert Solitaire : A Season in the Wilderness","review":"Reading this book is, I feel, an unspoken duty of all peoplewith any interest in what allows them to live. Unlike some readers, Iinterpret Abbey's vision of the best lifestyle as a balance between roots (nature) and future (society). He is not a Luddite, nor is he an anarchist. This book offends many due to its strong views (name one person that made a difference about something they were ambivalent over). The key to understanding Desert Solitaire is; (yes here comes the platitude); keeping an open mind.
