Jan Karon writes the way these North Carolina people talk, and the reader can actually \\"hear\\" them chattering away. Once you go to Mitford, you can't wait to go back, can't wait for the next book, and the next and the next! There are pages that will make you smile, laugh out loud, make you cry, too, and send you down your own memory lane because many of the people in this book are like people that you know. So, start reading about Father Tim, his nosey secretary, and his huge dog Barnabas who responds to commands so much better when they're accompanied with a Bible verse--and it doesn't matter what verse, any will do. And that's just the beginning of the list of citizens of Mitford who await you!"},{"Title":"At Home In Mitford (The Mitford Years #1)","review":"I'm giving this one five stars even though I did not personally care for it. Why? Because the author has rendered a magnificently-written, coherent story (albeit, a pretty unreal one) which achieves a high enough level of literary excellence that I'm compelled to call it \\"American Christian Literature\\". I believe that the writing is equivalent in quality to that of some past great American authors, say James Thurber, Lloyd C. Douglas, etc.Some people are simply tired of reading filth and trash (not me -- I LIKE filth and trash in terms of seedy characters, furtive activities and lewd language, except I'm not a fan of pornographic writing nor do I like stories where anything bad happens to kids). If you are a person who's had enough of smutty dynamics and you'd like, for a change, to read a story of fiction that is targeted for adults and yet does not contain foul language or deviant characters, then \\"At Home in Mitford\\" might just be for you.Of the various dillemmas which arise for \\"Father Tim,\\" I can definitely state that I'd personally solve them all in 30 seconds without a second thought, although not in the thoughtful, concerned, sensitive way that he does *.* These are NOT monumental problems that we're talking about here... they are (from the reader's view) humorous little enigmas for the most part, but clearly important to the lives of the potentially affected characters in the book. The level of melodrama in this book definitely did not make my heart pound but that's what comes of my having worked in law enforcement for over 25 years -- I've seen it all and have pretty much gotten numb to the worst of it.So, this is a nice, charming, warm, little story which I think many life-long Christians will find some relief in. The moral lessons do not really interfere with the story and, in fact, provide more of a \\"covert undertone\\". And the good news is that this one is but the first entry of a series. Some might compare this author's literary posture with that of C.S. Lewis -- I think that Karon's work here is far superior to anything that Lewis ever published -- that's just my opinion and perhaps Lewis fans would not agree.In summary, for me, this book was as boring as a box of Quaker Oats. BUT, my tastes in fiction are hardly in line with those of regular, normal people (I loved \\"Fight Club\\"!) and I must, to be fair, award credit where I feel it is due. This work is nicely presented and I would highly recommend it for appropriate readers... those Christians (or other spiritually-oriented people) whom are seeking some really light escapism."},{"Title":"At Home In Mitford (The Mitford Years #1)","review":"Jan Karon is one of my favorite authors and this first book is one of her best. One of the reasons it's so enjoyable is that she covers the whole spectrum of Mitford as she introduces you to her characters and their town. Karon is a master at characterization, plot and setting--no wonder her books can't miss! She sprinkles them liberally with humor, as she brings in some serious subjects, but is never heavy-handed. Her books are a joy to read and to re-read, which certainly cannot be said of every author."},{"Title":"At Home In Mitford (The Mitford Years #1)","review":"I got this audio book CD for my mom (60) for Christmas. She has a long commute and she has really enjoyed entering the world of Mitford to pass the time. She feels like she knows the characters. She enjoyed it so much, that my dad got her the second book in the series as soon as she was done with it."},{"Title":"At Home In Mitford (The Mitford Years #1)","review":"If you grew up in a small, slow moving town, or you just wish you had, this book captures that feeling. The characters are delightful and could easily be someone I have met in my lifetime. Unimporatnt mysteries all through the book involving several members of the community, making no difference in the story line just adding a bit of spice. It moved slow, was very descriptive. I could see every detail in my minds eye. This would make a wonderful Halmark Hall of Fame movie."},{"Title":"At Home In Mitford (The Mitford Years #1)","review":"My Mom loved this series. She really enjoyed the book and thought it was humorous."},{"Title":"At Home In Mitford (The Mitford Years #1)","review":"I have never experienced such a wonderful and touching book as this.

It truly warms the heart."},{"Title":"At Home In Mitford (The Mitford Years #1)","review":"This is the literary equivalent of a mug of tea on a cold day. I enjoyed the variety of characters, and found many of their stories to be touching. There was also a great deal of truth here, stated in a quiet way. Earthshaking, no, but comforting and fulfilling."},{"Title":"At Home In Mitford (The Mitford Years #1)","review":"As someone who has always lived on the ocean, I've often wondered what life in the interior provinces was like.....and now I know. Jan Karon cranks things down a couple of notches and shows us the some of the more simple pleasures about life--although I must say I'll pass on that livermush stuff. Mitford's a great place to visit, nice folks, slower pace and just detached enough from the real world be to safe place to seek temporary exile from fax machines, beepers, the Bloomberg screen and Federal Express packages. Really, when you need a break and can't spare the time for a week in Bermuda, a brief visit to Mitford will be just as good. Okay, so try this: Get a copy of the book from Amazon.com (yeah, yeah it's their web site, so as long as you're here you may as well order it), lock the doors, take the phone off the hook, fix a pot of tea, put on a Mozart on the CD player, settle back and just escape."},{"Title":"At Home In Mitford (The Mitford Years #1)","review":"My sister-in-law gave me At Home In Mitford as part of a &quot;care package&quot; when I was in town for my father's funeral. Little did I know at the time, but it was a book that would change my life forever. I fell in love with Father Tim and the zany characters of Mitford. Book I of this six book series made me crave for more. My &quot;sis&quot; and I agree that &quot;there's a little bit of Mitford in all of us&quot;. Enjoy meeting the characters in Book I. They become the kind of people you want in your life. My spiritual faith was being tested with the illness and subsequent death of my father. Mitford renewed my spirit and made me focus on the really important things in life: the simple compassion of a place and its people. It was the perfect gift. You'll love Mitford and you'll yearn for more."},{"Title":"At Home In Mitford (The Mitford Years #1)","review":"This book took me back to a forgotten time in my life in the small hometown I grew up in. The feelings came rushing back and I thank you, Jan Karon. After enrolling my daughter in a nearby university near Blowing Rock (alias Mitford), I became totally absorbed in the town and the people, and I find it hard to come back to life in Wilmington. I would love to call upon Father Tim to counsel my daughter who is homesick and is having problems being 300 miles away from home. What a blessing it would be to have these people in our everyday lives. I can't imagine anyone not loving this book and the others to follow. I just finished the last one tonight and the characters, fictional as they are, will always be near my heart. What a loss to be at the end of such a treasure. Please write more."},{"Title":"At Home In Mitford (The Mitford Years #1)","review":"This was my first Jan Karon book, and I have now read the entire Mitford series. She does a great job of integrating relationships among characters and delivers a moral lesson or inspires simple laughter from her character situations. It is wonderful to have such wholesome enjoyment and relaxation in the midst of today's jaded society."},{"Title":"At Home In Mitford (The Mitford Years #1)","review":"Illegitimacy, alcoholism, insanity, death, emotional abuse, organ transplants, loneliness, poverty and homelessness--they happen Here in Mitford, so why are Ms. Karon's books so popular as an escape from the miseries of &quot;real&quot; life? I think the answer is this: readers saturated with the dark side, the problem and victim attitude to contemporary life, don't recognize that it's within their power to cast a different light on all that happens. This is what makes Mitford seem like a heavenly retreat from reality--a shift to the view that a loving human community and the presence of God in everyday life can make even the ugliest of life's realities into sources of blessing. It's not that Billy doesn't suffer from the misery of living for 40-odd years with a mentally-ill wife, it's that he and the whole community around him and Rose see her as human, not as a socio-psychological problem. Her oddities are not so much in need of treatment, as of love. It's not that Miss Sadie hasn't been subjected to cruel and unnecessary deprivations of human affection, it's that she goes on loving and giving generously. It isn't that Dooley hasn't been dumped by his alcoholic mother, it's that a loving community can provide homes for its children. In fact, the only &quot;unreal&quot; thing I found in this novel was Dooley's very mild expletives. Find me an eleven-year-old boy today whose worst cuss word is &quot;poop&quot;, and I'll give you a dollar! Karon wrote the novel as newspaper episodes, and so it is packed with incident. This loading on of good stories one after another in such a small space of time may test the beliefs of some readers, but having grown up in a small town myself, I know that this isn't fiction, it's observation. Still better, find yourself a church and settle down--whether in Manhattan or Chicago or Mitford, the community of loving friends will likely be there for you. You just have to be able to look at the world with a Mitford point of view."},{"Title":"At Home In Mitford (The Mitford Years #1)","review":"Life in this sleepy (but never dull!) town of Mitford is absolutely refreshing to the soul. I am not a Christian, but I found the Karon books to transcend religious lines. It's all about people having faith and doing the right thing: I'll vote for that any day. After being weighed down with Oprah's selections (who can take one more rape/incest/child abuse victim novel?), I was utterly refreshed and uplifted after reading the Mitford series. Brava, Ms. Karon!"},{"Title":"At Home In Mitford (The Mitford Years #1)","review":"Jan Karon is a master at characterization. Not only are her characters real, so is the life that surrounds them. I got such a feel for what Miss Sadie's house was like, with her in it; what the Rectory was like with all its guests and wares; what the church office was like and not to mention the Grill. I loved every ounce of this book because it is such a beautiful composition of beauty, grace and relationship. At odd moments, I would find myself thinking of Mitford. Once while I was talking to a friend as I was leaving a party, I thought to myself,&quot;Tonight I want to go to Mitford.&quot; So I picked up the book and kept reading til I was nearly done! The peace and healing that is in this book is immeasurable and it gave me a real sense of how we all stop, others begin and how God steps in."},{"Title":"At Home In Mitford (The Mitford Years #1)","review":"For all those who indicated this is unrealistic you obviously don't live in the South. These characters are much more real to me than many other characters out of popular fiction. I am a 29 year old woman who can relate well to Cynthia and Father Tim, Dooley, Puny, and Miss Sadie. Who doesn't know a meddlesome, irritable Emma Newland? There are those of us who still value honesty, integrity, faithfulness and love for God and community. These are not values from the 50's. They are still alive and well in the 90's. Thank you Jan Karon for giving us a beautiful story to remind us of the simple pleasures of life and to inspire us to treasure our relationships."},{"Title":"At Home In Mitford (The Mitford Years #1)","review":"At Home in Mitford is a book about a small North Carolina town.

I liked the idea of a priest as the main character because I like to see religion treated as an important part of people's lives. Ultimately, I was disappointed in the book. The characters were too predictable and problems resolved too easily. The book was too &quot;cute&quot; for my taste. Mitford is charming, but about as realistic as Mayberry."},{"Title":"At Home In Mitford (The Mitford Years #1)","review":"I have read every 1 and 2 star review above and I agree with each and every piece of negative criticism that has been penned. But I still enjoyed reading the books. No, they're not thick in plot and yes, the characters are predictable and one-dimensional. However, for someone who wants a light, quick read these books are perfect. If you're looking for a meat-and-potatoes novel you're not going to like the series. However, if you're up for desert this series will quench your appetite.One criticism I'd like to add - by the second and third books I got annoyed by the author's redundancy in describing the characters. Did she have to explain who the characters were every time they reappeared throughout the story? I felt like I was reading footnotes."},{"Title":"At Home In Mitford (The Mitford Years #1)","review":"If a grouchy Unitarian can find something to like in this book, you know it must be good. Sure, it's sweet, but if you eat a balanced diet and get plently of exercise you'll have nothing to fear. The cynics who are appalled at the nice people in this book and the wish the world would be better if we were kinder to one another must be dead to hope."},{"Title":"At Home In Mitford (The Mitford Years #1)","review":"The popularity of the Mitford series only shows how far our taste and expectations have fallen.If bestsellers like the Left Behind series are the benchmark, yeah, I guess this stuff is genius.If, however, you think the likes of Jane Austen, Flannery O'Connor, George Eliot, Tolkien, Conrad, Sayers, or any of the great storytellers set the artistic benchmarks, with perhaps Agatha Christie or James Michener as standards for quick, popular reads--you'll be amazed that these lightweight books are so gushed over. It's a laugh-tracked sitcom set down as a novel, about as sustaining as a tiny watercress sandwich at coffee hour.Whoever said Karon was the contemporary Flannery O'Connor never read Flannery O'Connor. You might as well shove poor ol Tiny Tim into the ring with the Terminator as compare the two.Just because a book is &quot;Christian&quot; doesn't mean we Christians have to pretend it's better than it is. And as Christians, we ought to get out and read a little more before employing superlative adjectives."},{"Title":"At Home In Mitford (The Mitford Years #1)","review":"Anyone who is looking for car crashes, sex and murder should stay away from this wonderful book. It is a glorious change of pace from the &quot;contains explicit sex and language&quot; tomes that permeate our bookshelves. One should enter the world of Mitford with the expectation that everything will turn out alright, and sometimes turns out wonderfully. Yes, it's a bit of a fantasy, but isn't that what real reading is all about? I loved this gently paced, thoughtful book and look forward to reading the remaining four novels in the series. Father Tim and his village are real to me when I curl up in bed at night and escape. Anyone who feels as I do will also enjoy the Miss Read series, again, small village life but in England. Take me away!!!!"},{"Title":"At Home In Mitford (The Mitford Years #1)","review":"Like a walk after a gentle spring rain, Father Tim's Mitford will revive your soul. Gentle handling of very real and up-to-date issues, with grace and blessings along the way, await the reader. John McDonough reads these books wonderfully, though I recommend the books themselves for the lovely quotes and thoughtful passages to savor. This book is the first of the series, and introduces us to Father Tim and the assortment of delightful characters that make up the North Carolina mountain town of Mitford. A gentle reminder of what is truly important, and likely the first of many of Ms. Karon's books you will seek. From an early teen to my 92 year old Great Aunt, these books have something for everyone."},{"Title":"At Home In Mitford (The Mitford Years #1)","review":"I loved the Mitford series. At times, they are somewhat slow but I found them all hilarious and relaxing. No confusing plots, no fly-by-the-seat-of-your-pants love scenes, no complex characters, which, in this day and age, is somewhat refreshing.

In these high, green hills, the air is pure, the village is charming, and the people are generally lovable.\\"Yet Father Tim, the bachelor rector, wants something more. Enter a dog the size of a sofa who moves in and won't go away. Add an attractive neighbor who begins wearing a path through the hedge. Now, stir in a lovable but unloved boy, a mystifying jewel theft, and a secret that's sixty years old.\\"~From the back cover of the paperback edition----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------We've all dreamed of it - life in a small town where the people are stubbornly old fashioned and the grocer knows everyone by name, where there's a church on every corner and the aroma of fresh baking lingers unceasingly on the air. Welcome to Mitford, the ideal small town conjured up in the imagination of Jan Karon and based on real-life Blowing Rock, North Carolina, where the author resides. Against this backdrop of mountains and farmland, Karon expertly weaves together an engaging tale of the lives of her village residents through the eyes of Father Tim, the 60-year-old episcopal priest who seems to run into no end of provincial adventures.One of the beautiful things about this book, contrary to most contemporary Christian fiction, is that God and his role in the lives of his people, the importance of prayer, and the divinity of Christ, in addition to the fact that salvation comes only from him, is made blatantly clear for every reader, believer and non-believer alike to see. Because of the unpopularity of this narrow view of salvation, it is amazing to me that this book made it to the New York Times best seller list. But indeed, it did make it, as it well should, and I can only imagine that it has revealed the good news in a tangible way for the first time to many of its readers.Though set in one of the most aesthetic and peaceful places you could possibly imagine, Mitford is not a fluffy town full of blissfully happy church-going folk who live out a dream life while completely oblivious to a suffering world. Karon has masterfully balanced the scales between comedy and tragedy, making this a real page turner that will allow the reader to step out of the hectic modern lifestyle and escape to a slow-paced mountain village where the simple life takes on a whole new meaning. As one Amazon reviewer so aptly put it, \\"This novel goes down like a cool glass of lemonade on a hot summer day.\\" A resounding two thumbs up!Part of: The Mitford SeriesAt Home in Mitford (Book One)A Light in the Window (Book Two)These High, Green Hills (Book Three)Out to Canaan (Book Four)A New Song (Book Five)A Common Life (Book Six)In This Mountain (Book Seven)Shepherds Abiding (Book Eight)Light from Heaven (Book Nine)"},{"Title":"At Home In Mitford (The Mitford Years #1)","review":"While this book has a central character, Father Tim, it doesn't so much have a central plot as it provides a glimpse, a cross-section of a minister's life in an idyllic North Carolina town. In that sense, this book isn't really \\"about\\" anything, but that's exactly what makes it the literary equivalent of a leisurely summer picnic. Yet there's nothing boring here, as there are a number of subplots (ranging from heartwarming to comedically outrageous) that illuminate the depths of each character, especially Father Tim. Jan Karon's writing style is surprisingly expressive for its simplicity. This is the perfect nothing-to-do read to carry with you in airports, waiting rooms, buses, etc. One warning: If you've always wanted to live in a sleepy southern town, this book will only make it worse!"},{"Title":"At Home In Mitford (The Mitford Years #1)","review":"In the 1st book in the Mitford series, we are introduced to Father Tim, a kindly rector who is overworked, overwhelmed, and is thinking of leaving his town parish in Mitford, North Carolina. He doesn't eat right, exercises only in his walks around town (he gave up his car for Lent 9-years-ago), and will not take a vacation. Being called the \\"portly priest\\" embarrasses him, but it is not until he discovers that he has diabetes does he make major changes to his life. Cutting out his beloved Little Debbie snack cakes, jogging three days a week, and finding house-help does much to improve Father Tim's physical health. But his mental health still suffers from his lack of time to relax. And several events that happen to Father Tim over the course of this lovely story initially only add to his frustration and fatigue.First, he becomes adopted by a huge, furry dog that he names Barnabas, and quickly learns that the large dog is controlled only by the bellowing of scripture. He then takes in an orphaned boy, whose alcoholic mother decided to \\"get rid of\\" all of her five children. The boy, Dooley Barlowe, goes to stay with his grandpa, and when he becomes gravelly ill, Father Tim steps in to care for the boy full time. One of Father Tim's closest friends becomes romantically involved with a dying woman after the recent death of his wife, and Father Tim worries about the heartache that his friend will feel when he loses another loved one. And, after over sixty years of living alone, Father Tim discovers a romantic stirring in his own heart over his new neighbor, Cynthia Coppersmith. In the end, Father Tim realizes that all of these things have been a big blessing in his life, and that the Lord does indeed have big plans for himself and his cherished home in Mitford.Taking a break from the cozy mysteries that I normally read, I was looking for a series that both my mother and I might enjoy. Based on the many glowing recommendations that I found, I picked up a copy of the books on tape for both of us. We both loved this charming and lovely book! As other reviewers have mentioned, the book grew on me the longer that I listened to it. It took awhile for the story to unfold, and for the characters and setting to become real to me. But after that...I found myself unable to read anything else, or stop myself from listening to the tapes! My mind kept drifting off to Mitford, wondering what Father Tim was doing, or if he would finally express his interest in Cynthia. I laughed, I cried, and at times I yelled at the cassette player. Father Tim can be exasperating at times...he won't take a break, and he bumbles his way around a romance with Cynthia. But, he is also kind, gentle, devout to Christ, and selfless...all of the things that make him such a rich, charming character. I can't say enough about this wonderful series...except that I was more content and felt more blessed in my own life after listening to it.The next book in the series is called \\"A Light in the Window\\". Enjoy!"},{"Title":"At Home In Mitford (The Mitford Years #1)","review":"These books are beautiful little works of art - Thank you Jan Karon. If you are looking for a bit of comfort, look no further than Jan Karon's books."},{"Title":"At Home In Mitford (The Mitford Years #1)","review":"When I first started reading this book, I kept thinking, \\"Boring, I can't get into this.\\" But I kept reading and realized after awhile I was hooked on the characters. I ended up loving these books. I was surprised to find out Ms. Karon lives in Blowing Rock, NC (I live right next door in Boone) and that this town was supposedly based on Blowing Rock. Blowing Rock is a ski resort. The main street of Blowing Rock is about 3 blocks long, and it's usually so overun with tourists that you can barely walk down the sidewalk. It is a charming, quaint looking little village town, though, with a grill, shops, library and pretty much everything within walking distance. Ms. Karon has obviously eliminated the tourists from her Mitford town. Her description of the church actually makes me think of a little church in Blowing Rock down past the shops on the main street as you're heading off into the mountains. I've watched the people come out of that church on Sundays, and they all look like they've probably been there for about a hundred years. I thought these books were very nice--they give you a good, cozy feeling."},{"Title":"At Home In Mitford (The Mitford Years #1)","review":"As a voracious reader, having read hundreds and hundreds of books over the past twenty plus years; I can honestly say the Mitford series has been the best yet! Never has a fictional book touched my heart as these have. As I began reading the series, I found myself making changes in my life brought about by Ms. Karon's writings. Familial relationships, friendships, my faith, and my personal contentment have all been enriched by Father Tim, Barnabas, Dooley, and the residents of Mitford. In her writing, Jan Karon empowers her readers to find peace, happiness, and contentment in their own lives through the lives of her gentle characters.The series of five books begins with \\"At Home In Mitford\\" which introduces the reader to Father Tim, a cherished Episcopalian rector in the town of Mitford. The residents of Mitford will surely come to take up residence in your heart as you read through this heartwarming series of miracles, love, mysteries and everday life which take you into the lives of Mitford's charming, eccentric, and lovable citizens including Father Tim's big black dog, Barnabas, who can be instructed to behave with a mere verse of scripture!"},{"Title":"At Home In Mitford (The Mitford Years #1)","review":"I absolutely loved 'At Home in Mitford'. It is probably the best book I have ever read. As a mother of three small children, I rarely get to read anymore. I was surprised by a friend with a gift of this book. When I started reading - I just couldn't hardly put it down. I looked forward to my quiet reading moments with an unquenchable enthusiasm and finished it in record time (finishing a book is alone a record for me)! The characters were so vivid - I felt I knew each one. One negative reviewer criticized the character &quot;Catherine&quot; when the name is actually &quot;Cynthia&quot; (makes me wonder whether THAT interviewer actually read the book) and she is a character so full of life,so quirky, happy, and fun-loving; she reminds me of my incredible mother. Another one of the few negative reviewers said that it was boring. Well, I don't want to give any of the many interwoven plot lines away so I will just say that a lot of real &quot;action&quot; doesn't happen on the show 'Friends', for instance but you watch it for the characters. It is more 'on par' with &quot;Steel Magnolias&quot; than &quot;Hunt for Red October&quot;. Another great asset of this book is it's DIALOGUE. I just laughed throughout the entire book. I would LOVE to meet Jan Karon. And finally, this book was an incredible blessing to my Christian walk. To read a 'picture' of caring people SHOWING their love was so uplifting. I pray that it will bring many blessings to many others. I am looking forward to reading the rest of the Mitford series."},{"Title":"At Home In Mitford (The Mitford Years #1)","review":"Call me crazy, but I'd LOVE to live in Mitford--a place where nothing happens but your occasional dog-napping, jewel-thievering, and finding strangers in your attic.Sound boring? Oh, but what a nice, calming change of pace that would be! Jan Karon has written a terrific, wholesome story about a small village in North Carolina where wonderful and sometimes strange things happen. Written through the eyes of the Episcopalian priest, Father Tim shows us a refreshingly old-fashioned life where goodness and kindheartedness prevails. You get to meet many lively and eccentric characters who quickly become your friends and who make life in Mitford such a pleasure and a privilege.At Home in Mitford is the perfect diversion from the hustle and bustle of our busy lives. A calm, relaxing novel full of charm and sassy wit that &quot;celebrates ordinary people leading ordinary lives.&quot; Though not for everyone, especially for those who need lots of action in their reading, this novel goes down like a cool glass of lemonade on a hot summer day. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"At Home In Mitford (The Mitford Years #1)","review":"My neighbor recommended this series to me. I never imagined when I began with At Home in Mitford that I would become attached to the little town. I became upset with myself that I had purchased Book 1 by itself. I found myself wanting to go straight to the next one. I purchased Books 2 and 3 together so I didn't have to wait to go on. I only hate that I have completed the series. I passed the books on to my mother who quickly completed the series and passed it on to her neighbor, then my sister (who I never thought would enjoy this type of writing), who in turn passed it to her mother-in-law. Everyone I know who has read these books has thoroughly enjoyed them. The books brought great comfort to me and created inner peace in a way I never experienced before. I hope that Jan will soon add to the series and I look forward to collecting the Mitford Village when it becomes available."},{"Title":"At Home In Mitford (The Mitford Years #1)","review":"At Home in Mitford is a gentle escape from the stress of modern life. Set in the mountains of North Carolina, Mitford is a town, seemingly lost in another age, asleep while the rest of the world marches on. I read this book at bedtime and it was a wonderful way to fall asleep. Father Tim is an Episcapol priest, who at 60, has never been married. His life is predicatable, a little boring, but fairly enjoyable. He is loved by his parish because of his folksy approach to fulfilling his role as their priest. He is a familiar, gentle old shoe to the entire community, and he radiates with pleasure from the town's eccentric and predictable daily life. This is a town buzzing with quaint goings-on that bring fuzzy warmth to an open reader. I read some of the complaints about this book, such as there is no plot and the characters aren't developed. It's true, the plot is simplistic and most of the characters the reader only meets on the surface. But we only need to glimpse these characters as Father Tim does. They are interesting and amusing, but they don't all offer the challenges and interruptions of Father Tim's life, and they don't need to do so. There is Barnabas, the dog, Dooley, the neglected and &quot;lost&quot; kid from the poor, unapproachable ghetto-village up the mountain, and Cynthia, the novelist-new neighbor to fulfill the story's need for character development. And of course, there is Father Tim. This story is not one to receive literary prizes, but it does deliver, in a big way, to the need for a place where everyone helps one another, where the worst thing that happens doesn't spill blood, and life is predictable and reassuring and treasured and it's safe to go jogging at night."},{"Title":"At Home In Mitford (The Mitford Years #1)","review":"When I read the book, I was at a time in my life when I needed a lift from being depressed. This book was the answer. I laughed and cried and was impressed by some of Father Tim's comments. The comments were exactly what I needed to hear. I have shared the books with others and they also have enjoyed them."},{"Title":"At Home In Mitford (The Mitford Years #1)","review":"What a wonderful book! I am writing this after I have read the entire series and am waiting with baited breath for the next book. I love the way Jan Karon tells a story bringing in all the quirky characters of a small town and making the reader feel a part of the scene. From the time Father Tim meets the stray dog, Barnabas (who, as fate would have it only responds when Father Tim quotes scripture to him) to the scenes at different settings around town, I loved this book and this series like I've loved no other. My mother, in her 80s, has read them and then passed them on to a friend of hers (whose husband, now deceased, was a pastor in the town of Blowing Rock, NC, the town where the author lives and which was an inspiration for the town of Mitford). These are stories to be savored and read again and again. Very highly recommended!"},{"Title":"At Home In Mitford (The Mitford Years #1)","review":"I am a bookaholic. I read constantly and live among stacks of books to read, both at the office and at home. So, many of my church members bring me books constantly they want me to read. I decline politely, telling them I've got too many right now that I want to read, but can't get to.Then one member insisted this book was about me, a pastor with a big dog, who was single, than married, etc. I was intrigued. Then she gift-wrapped this volume and put it in my in-basket.With amusement I leafed through it, with honestly no real intent to do more than this. Then, I was struck my a chapter heading &quot;The Greatest Sermon Ever Preached.&quot; I was hooked. The rest is history.I love this book and series. It does remind me of my ministry. This series is wonderfully written. Such wholesome stuff. Entertaining to the max, and hard to put down. Everyone in my congregation is reading and loving it also."},{"Title":"At Home In Mitford (The Mitford Years #1)","review":"I've been interested in the reviews I've read, being in agreement with them most of the time. Those who complain about a lack of reality, etc., miss the point all together. There is enough so-called reality everywhere we turn. A reality of crudeness, selfishness, and disdain for anything gentle. Hooray for Jan Karon, and her wonderful world of Mitford. I have even missed my favorite TV shows (Law &amp; Order, and CSI), for a few hours of delight in the pages of Mitford. Father Tim and all the rest have won my heart!"},{"Title":"At Home In Mitford (The Mitford Years #1)","review":"After the depressing, cynical realism of much contemporary fiction, I was utterly smitten by At Home in Mitford. It didn't look exciting at first, but the more I read, the more I couldn't stop reading. It is utter delight! Quite like eating popcorn or going for a walk on a crisp spring day! If you want a book with good values, the &quot;milk of human kindness&quot;, clean humor, hope and simplicity, read this book. I loved its pace. It ambled. It felt like I was experiencing daily life with ordinary people; but, because Mitford is such a sweet magical place, I never wanted it to end. I was also touched by the way characters made choices that changed their lives, especially Homeless Hobbes and George Gaynor. Awesome! Read this book if you want to remember that life can be charming, simple, meaningful and lovely. If anyone else loved this book and can recommend similar books, please let me know. Thanks!"},{"Title":"At Home In Mitford (The Mitford Years #1)","review":"This book is a blessing. It is so nice to read something without tragedy, violence, cussing, vulgarity, or others immoralities. I have so enjoyed this book and cannot wait to read the others. Thank you Jan Karon for this wonderful positive series and thank you Jesus for her talent. A true blessing."},{"Title":"At Home In Mitford (The Mitford Years #1)","review":"In the 1st book in the Mitford series, we are introduced to Father Tim, a kindly rector who is overworked, overwhelmed, and is thinking of leaving his town parish in Mitford, North Carolina. He doesn't eat right, exercises only in his walks around town (he gave up his car for Lent 9-years-ago), and will not take a vacation. Being called the \\"portly priest\\" embarrasses him, but it is not until he discovers that he has diabetes does he make major changes to his life. Cutting out his beloved Little Debbie snack cakes, jogging three days a week, and finding house-help does much to improve Father Tim's physical health. But his mental health still suffers from his lack of time to relax. And several events that happen to Father Tim over the course of this lovely story initially only add to his frustration and fatigue.First, he becomes adopted by a huge, furry dog that he names Barnabas, and quickly learns that the large dog is controlled only by the bellowing of scripture. He then takes in an orphaned boy, whose alcoholic mother decided to \\"get rid of\\" all of her five children. The boy, Dooley Barlowe, goes to stay with his grandpa, and when he becomes gravelly ill, Father Tim steps in to care for the boy full time. One of Father Tim's closest friends becomes romantically involved with a dying woman after the recent death of his wife, and Father Tim worries about the heartache that his friend will feel when he loses another loved one. And, after over sixty years of living alone, Father Tim discovers a romantic stirring in his own heart over his new neighbor, Cynthia Coppersmith. In the end, Father Tim realizes that all of these things have been a big blessing in his life, and that the Lord does indeed have big plans for himself and his cherished home in Mitford.Taking a break from the cozy mysteries that I normally read, I was looking for a series that both my mother and I might enjoy. Based on the many glowing recommendations that I found, I picked up a copy of the books on tape for both of us. We both loved this charming and lovely book! As other reviewers have mentioned, the book grew on me the longer that I listened to it. It took awhile for the story to unfold, and for the characters and setting to become real to me. But after that...I found myself unable to read anything else, or stop myself from listening to the tapes! My mind kept drifting off to Mitford, wondering what Father Tim was doing, or if he would finally express his interest in Cynthia. I laughed, I cried, and at times I yelled at the cassette player. Father Tim can be exasperating at times...he won't take a break, and he bumbles his way around a romance with Cynthia. But, he is also kind, gentle, devout to Christ, and selfless...all of the things that make him such a rich, charming character. I can't say enough about this wonderful series...except that I was more content and felt more blessed in my own life after listening to it.The next book in the series is called \\"A Light in the Window\\".

It was unique enough to be entertaining but still credible enough to keep you wondering. The book had many twists that kept you pondering what would happen next and also left you waiting for just the right amount of time. This Christian book makes reading pleasurable and helps us to realize how lucky we really are. It helps to understand some of the miracles that occur everyday and emphasizes the power of prayer. While reading this book I was able to relax and not have to be befuddled by the complexity of some of the mystery thrillers that I could have otherwise been reading. Not to say that mystery thrillers aren't good, I just think this is a good read if you're looking for a nice, rainy day novel. Jan Karon does a wonderful job at letting the reader get to know the character in a way that isn't blunt. The characters in this book are very diverse and the problems that they face are tackled in a manner that is a little more realistic. Seeing life through the view of a rector gives a positive and hopeful view on some not so joyful situations. I'm hoping that all of you will give this book a try and, who knows, you might just fall in love with the small town of Mitford like many other readers!"},{"Title":"At Home In Mitford (The Mitford Years #1)","review":"At Home in Mitford by Jan Karon is the first book in the wonderful Mitford series. Through the eyes of Father Tim, a sixty-year old bachelor and an Episcopalian priest, we are introduced to the small town of Mitford. Throw in a large, bumbling dog, a young boy, and a new, very attractive next door neighbour and you have the foundation for a great read.Jan Karon is a superb writer. Her characters are believable, her wit is exquisite, and her portrayal of small town life is right on the mark.This is a series to savour and enjoy. I spaced my reading of these books as I didn't want my visits to Mitford to end too quickly.I have an aunt who is dying of cancer who loves to read. I wanted to give her books that were enjoyable, uplifting, humourous and encouraging, so I got her started on the Mitford series. She has read them all and loved them. Now her daughter is on the last book. My aunt underlined places in the books that had special meaning for her and my cousin plans to keep the books to reread and as a memento of my aunt's thoughts during her last weeks.For a marvellous read, start with Jan Karon's At Home in Mitford. However, I must warn you that other areas of your life may suffer neglect as you snatch every opportunity to return to the town of Mitford."},{"Title":"At Home In Mitford (The Mitford Years #1)","review":"If you like \\"feel good\\" books, like to laugh, smile, chuckle and just be thoroughly entertained by a book.....then you will want to read this. Then you will get to know the people so personally that you will also want to read ALL of the books in the series. I am now just beginning the second one, \\"A Light In The Window\\" and am looking forward to it. There were times in this first book that I laughed so hard I had to put the book down until it passed. It's like visiting with much loved neighbors and friends each time I pick up the book. OH...it also has some suspense, intrigue and most other things you find in just every day life with every day folks. A totally delighful find in a series. And....as an added bonus, it also gave my faith a much needed shot in the arm."},{"Title":"At Home In Mitford (The Mitford Years #1)","review":"I absolutely adore this series of books. Very refreshing, clean, easy to read, interesting... Wow! Good stuff. I highly recommend them for anyone."},{"Title":"At Home In Mitford (The Mitford Years #1)","review":"Unfortunately I was too busy in high school and college to spend time reading purely for pleasure. About 5 summers ago when I became tired or TV re-runs I picked up this book and put it down two days later ready to read the sequel and almost any other good book I could get my hands on. I recommended it to my father who is 65 and he has now read every single book in the series. As other reviewers have written this is a book for all age groups, share it with a friend. What could be a better gift for the holidays?"},{"Title":"At Home In Mitford (The Mitford Years #1)","review":"I picked this book up at a yard sale, with no prior knowledge of this series, and I was pleasantly surprised. Not only was the story engaging, but the fact that the characters illustrated biblical principles (through thought, speech and action) throughout the book made it especially enjoyable, and thought-provoking. How refreshing to pick up a truly enjoyable book without foul language and gratuitous sex.Father Tim is a wonderful character, as are the other quirky folk in Mitford. I look forward to reading the next book in the series. If you are looking for hair-raising, nonstop action, then this might not be the right book for you, but if you want an engaging, wholesome story, stick with this book. You won't be disappointed!"},{"Title":"At Home In Mitford (The Mitford Years #1)","review":"My boss has been begging me to begin read these books, but I, due to the large stacks of books already decorating my nightstand, refused until she literally put At Home In Mitford on my desk with a (demand?) to read it. So, I shoved my other books aside and began.And, I'm hooked. Jan Karon writes in very careful, thoughtful style. There are no page-turning plots, just the everyday happenstance of big people in a little town. Mitford is not a perfect place, but it is a place that I wouldn't mind living.The goal of fiction is offer an escape by inviting a reader into a larger-than-life, idealistic, or fanatical world. Karon ushers helps us escape, but brings us to a world of everyday ups and downs and personalities and problems. She gives us a glimpse of people real thoughts and desires.I thoroughly enjoy these books. The writing is so profound, so rich. The characters so lifelike and flawed. The plots so slow, yet moving, subtle, yet lifelike.Many thanks to my persistent boss for shoving me into the wonderful world of Mitford. I now feel a kinships with Father Tim, Cynthia, Dooley, and the rest of the hilarious cast."},{"Title":"At Home In Mitford (The Mitford Years #1)","review":"Finally a book about the simple pleasures in life."},{"Title":"At Home In Mitford (The Mitford Years #1)","review":"The mitford books are the most refreshing books that I have read in a long time. It is hard to find a book that dosen't contain a deep plot to put you on the edge of you seat, bitting your nails. Mitford is the vacation all book-junkies need to take. The characters are all so real, and Karon writes it in such a way that you feel instantly at home. I look foward to another Mitford book."},{"Title":"At Home In Mitford (The Mitford Years #1)","review":"I loved this book from the first page to the last. The characters are very real and accurately portray small town life and real people. And hidden throughout the stories of their lives are wonderful tidbits of wisdom which touched even a big-city girl like me. Jan Karon writes in a delightful manner which is fun and inspiring. I couldn't wait to pick up the book each evening to see what would happen next."},{"Title":"At Home In Mitford (The Mitford Years #1)","review":"I have read this book impossibly slow, leaving it in my car to read while I wait to pick up my son from school, or music lessons, etc. Rarely has a book given me such pure pleasure.At times I would find myself crying at the simplicity and beauty of the story.The world can be such a hard place, but if you take on the concern for others, and give of yourself as do these delightful charactors, the world would have to be a better place.I am already reading the next book with great anticipation of the same pleasures.Would love to hear from other readers of this wonderful book."},{"Title":"At Home In Mitford (The Mitford Years #1)","review":"I am 3/4 of the way through &quot;A Light in the Window&quot; and I don't want it to end!

I am sure that I will reread these as well!"},{"Title":"At Home In Mitford (The Mitford Years #1)","review":"If you get up every morning, read the local paper, watch the morning talk shows, and end your day with the evening news, this is the book for you! Feeling depressed? Fearful? Tired of all the gloom and doom? Come to Mitford. The wonderful thing is that Mitford does exist. Perhaps not on a map but in the hearts of those who chose to live by faith. It lives within families who choose to love each other and those around them. If you are looking for the latest sensational headlines in fictional form, you won't find it here. Instead, you will find a place that encompasses what life is supposed to be in a fallen world. There is danger, evil, and heartbreak, but there is a home to retreat to at the end of the day, and a person to lean on in the darkest hour. Take this book to heart and learn the core truth that causes the principle characters to find life worth living."},{"Title":"At Home In Mitford (The Mitford Years #1)","review":"As a voracious reader, having read hundreds and hundreds of books over the past twenty years; I can honestly say the Mitford series has been the best yet! Never has a fictional book touched my heart as these have. As I began reading the series, I found myself making changes in my life brought about by Ms. Karon's writings. Familial relationships, friendships, my faith, and my personal contentment have all been enriched by Father Tim, Barnabas, Dooley, and the gang. Thanks to Ms. Karon for empowering her readers to find peace, happiness, and contentment in their own lives through the lives of her gentle characters. I'd like to correspond with other readers about the Mitford books if anyone is interested."},{"Title":"At Home In Mitford (The Mitford Years #1)","review":"I really enjoyed this book because it is so refreshing!

I thought the characters were lovely, and most of them reminded me of individuals with whom I grew up in a small town in Tennessee. I also appreciated the Bible passages sprinkled throughout the book. It seemed as if Father Tim, Cynthia and Olivia were quoting scripture to meet my needs. Perhaps we cannot yet find Mitford on a map, but Karon encourages us to keep looking."},{"Title":"At Home In Mitford (The Mitford Years #1)","review":"This is one of the most engaging books I have ever read.

Before I was half way through the book I ordered the other 3 in the series. This book is filled with goodness and grace. Some may think the town and people unrealistic but Mitford can and does exist when people love and care for one another. From the first page I couldn't put it down and it was with a sense of loss that I finished it. I wanted this to be a never ending novel. It is very touching and you can't help reading it and feeling better about yourself and humanity in general. Long live Mitford and Fr. Tim! I'd live there anyday!!!"},{"Title":"At Home In Mitford (The Mitford Years #1)","review":"Sometimes you just want to read books that do not contain raw sex, raw language, blood flowing, etc. Some reviews talked about it being too sugarery...I think we need this every now and then.

Jan Karon makes you feel like you are a part of the little town of Mitford and you come to know each character well. It's a wonderful portrayal of life in small-town America the way it was (or we wish it were) and even if she does get a bit &quot;preachy&quot; at times, the stories are well worth reading; Father Tim, Cynthia and all the rest will become part of your life. Karon writes much in the style of the &quot;Miss Read&quot; books, stories of an English schoolteacher in the Cotswolds. Wonderful reading for a relaxing, non-stressful evening!"},{"Title":"At Home In Mitford (The Mitford Years #1)","review":"This first in the Mitford series is a wonderful introduction to characters so real that they made my heart ache with pleasure for people I grew up knowing.

The stories are so affirming and you really do feel like you've dropped into the little town of Mitford,N.C. and you're keeping up with what's going on. It really makes you want to go and find this place and these people. The stories have an &quot;old-fashioned&quot; feel to them but they are set in a contemporary time.

At the end of a long day full of stress and chaos I can hardly wait to curl up with this book and take an enchanting trip to Mitford.

Thank goodness for uncomplicated, soul satisfying reading when you need it."},{"Title":"At Home In Mitford (The Mitford Years #1)","review":"come on! please. you've got to be kidding. are you for real? holy smokes. can it be? if you loved these cliches, you'll love this book. if not, pick something with content to read, otherwise your entire college education could be evaporated by the time you finish the first book in this series. please! money isn't everything, but the author must think so. there is marketing genius and nothing else behind this series. good luck!"},{"Title":"At Home In Mitford (The Mitford Years #1)","review":"This is a satire, right?

Yes, I felt drawn into the lives of the people of Mitford and it is a pleasure to read. But you have to deal with religious fairytales or propaganda like &quot;prayers always help&quot;, at least for the characters in this book, who get healed against all odds (what about the prayers for those who didn't make it is a question that never arises here). Some behavior seemingly normal in Mitford would be considered on the verge of lunatic fringe where I live. So this book at least gives an interesting insight (correctly or not) into the thinking and feeling of a part of the U.S."},{"Title":"At Home In Mitford (The Mitford Years #1)","review":"At first I thought I was not going to finish this book because it seemed so saccharine, but I admit, like other readers, I was drawn into it and began to care for the characters, enough to want to find out more about them and their adventures. One thought: why did the author introduce &quot;villains&quot;, e.g., Father Tim's father, only as figures in the deep past. Was she unable to deal with such characters in her book's &quot;present&quot;? I guess I'll pass up the other books in the series--unless I get very sick and just want to totally escape from the full range of life's experiences."},{"Title":"At Home In Mitford (The Mitford Years #1)","review":"I had heard so many wonderful things about this book.

I finished it, but had to struggle to get to the end. I found it to be incredibly slow-paced and boring, as well as extremely unrealistic. This &quot;town&quot; does not exist in today's world; I doubt if it ever did exist."},{"Title":"At Home In Mitford (The Mitford Years #1)","review":"Do not let your Dentist know you are reading this.Your teeth are in jeopardy from all the sweetness.It is what Mayberry might have been if Andy Taylorhad been an Episcopal Priest (or Vicar).The author has created an idyllic English villagein the mountains of North Carolina, complete with tea andapple pies beside cozy fires.It was just too much for me, too many eccentricvillagers, too much good home cooking, too muchsweetness and light.Hart Hooper"},{"Title":"At Home In Mitford (The Mitford Years #1)","review":"I have read the first three books of the Mitford series and I am more interested in Cynthia, Miss Sadie, Rose, Billy, Puny, and the group at Main Street Grill than I am in Father Tim. I think Tim spends too much time wallowing in self-pity. Tim even admits to wallowing, but does nothing about it - except say thankful prayers for having Cynthia and the others who put up with him...then he continues to think of himself. Tim is a weak main character that has yet to gain any strength.I do enjoy the Town of Mitford - I hope Jan Karon gives Cynthia, Puny and the characters at the Main Street Grill a voice - I am tired of hearing about them through Father Tim.I highly recommend the Miss Read series of which J. Karon has spoken. Miss Read is a strong main character with that wonderful English wit - that only the English can master."},{"Title":"At Home In Mitford (The Mitford Years #1)","review":"This book is just too nice. And I mean that in the blandest sense of the word. Unrealistic dialogue and unbelievable resolutions to conflict made me put the book down before I was 3 quarters of the way through. I don't mind stories about clergy, but I do mind being preached at."},{"Title":"At Home In Mitford (The Mitford Years #1)","review":"At first blush At Home in Mitford can be somewhat boring. But as the pages went by, I felt myself liking it more and more. There was nothing overly special about the characters or plot or writing. Overall it kept my attention and I found it enjoyable. Basically, this is no great work of literature but a fine book to pass a rainy night. I can't quite put my finger on why I liked it but I did."},{"Title":"At Home In Mitford (The Mitford Years #1)","review":"I bought this book when I was visiting the States but a really live in Caracas, Venezuela; South America. I like buying all kinds of books to keep of with my english.I have read this book wich I enjoyed because I recently visited South Carolina wich I beleive is verry close to Mitford.

Follow the everyday adventures of the town as they face all of the critical issues of modern times with spirit, faith, and good humor."},{"Title":"At Home In Mitford (The Mitford Years #1)","review":"I was actually looking forward to this selection of my reading group and planned to read the entire series. It was agony getting through this book - simplistic and dated language prevails. I kept thinking I was reading about a priest in the 1950's rather than the 1990's. In fairness, it had some nice moments, but there is not any depth to it."},{"Title":"At Home In Mitford (The Mitford Years #1)","review":"This was my first book to read by Jan Karon. I was excited about beginning it, but once I started, I wasn't that excited anymore. I struggled through most of the book, trying to force myself to read it. I, personally, enjoy books with a climax, which this one does not have. There are a few high and low points, but that is about it. I will read the rest of the books I have at home and then decide if I want to read the next one."},{"Title":"At Home In Mitford (The Mitford Years #1)","review":"I really wanted to like this book, but it is sooo slow and sooo syrupy-sweet that I couldn't endure it any longer. I appreciate the intent of showcasing old fashioned country living, but this was ridiculous. If you like hanging around old church-going people, whose main worries, (for example), are what to cook for the annual church bake-fest, then you will love this book. Otherwise, I'd suggest passing on it, because that really is the \\"speed\\" of the novel."},{"Title":"At Home In Mitford (The Mitford Years #1)","review":"I've been plugging away at this book for two months, and I'm not done yet. I'm all for &quot;life in a small town&quot; narratives; small towns can provide the fodder for quirky and interesting plots and characterizations. Unfortunately that is not the case here.My first, and continuing, impression of the characters is that they are all stereotyped caricatures. Everyone talks and behaves exactly as I expect them to after the first page. The charmingly quirky people are unfailingly charmingly quirky. The sweet and caring are unfailingly sweet and caring. The wry and amusing are unfailingly wry and amusing. Even the dog is always lovably funny. No one ever seems to step out of their predefined character, even by a toe. So they are all predictable.I find the writing style intrusive. I kept getting the sense that the author was TELLING rather than SHOWING. The language is often stilted and mannered, and she manages to make sure we never forget that she's telling the story; she isn't invisible, one of the hallmarks of great writing. I had a mental image of her pausing over her keyboard and trying to come up with the next sentence that would reassure us that she's still there. Even her wit seems stilted and self-conscious.I have no problem with books that are essentially plotless, as long as there is character develoment or movement of some kind. In this book, not only does nothing much happen, but no one grows or changes. There is no crescendo-decrescendo; the line is straight and unwavering, page after page. So except for some mildly amusing situations, there's no particular reason to read it. You don't learn anything, there are no thought-provoking ideas, you don't come away changed in any way. Except a little older.So if you have high blood pressure or are a Type A personality or decorate your house in &quot;country&quot; style with gingham kitchen witches, this is a good book for you. Otherwise, unless you have a high boredom threshold, why bother?"},{"Title":"At Home In Mitford (The Mitford Years #1)","review":"A charming, eloquent, heartwarming and funny story. I love this story."},{"Title":"At Home In Mitford (The Mitford Years #1)","review":"When I got to page 215, I called a friend for encouragement. &quot;When is something going to happen in this book?,&quot; I asked. She talked me into finishing the book, but let's just say I was glad when it was over. I have a variety of complaints. I was disappointed that Jan Karon didn't delve more into the spiritual and religious life of the main character, Father Tim. I think she was afraid she might offend &quot;mainstream America,&quot; by going deeper into the underlying religious theme of this book. Big mistake in my opinion. Her fear denied me the substance I was desparately seeking. I would have liked to have heard more about Fr. Tim's sermons and the spiritual direction he offered his parishioners. And how unlikely it was that Father Tim never attended any vestry meetings. Hmm. I also got bogged down in the endless detail and slang. I didn't like Cynthia much, and I never warmed toward her. She just didn't feel &quot;real&quot; to me. I could also tell that this story was originally a newspaper column because it was incredibly choppy. There were no real &quot;chapters,&quot; per se, only blocks of dialogue. This was very disconcerting to me. Lastly, did we really need to hear about the corn in Dooley's dumps? Good grief. This having been said, there is only one good thing I can say about the book, and this is the only reason I made it through all 446 pages. It's simple - I liked Father Tim's character. He was intelligent and kind, and seemed grounded at all times. I liked him very much personally. I especially liked the way he grew throughout the novel; he was a changed man at the end. It appears, however, that I am the minority. Out of the 7 people in my book group who read this book, only two of us didn't like it. C'est la vive.

Perhaps being a resident of that state makes this syrupy saga more palatable but I found it discomforting that the solitary &quot;outreach&quot; program the church promoted was a bi-annual visit to one homeless person carrying some food. It was also disheartening that the only black in the story was the town matriarch's housekeeper!"},{"Title":"At Home In Mitford (The Mitford Years #1)","review":"this is a great book! i am going to read the rest of the series! i will get more mitford books!"},{"Title":"At Home In Mitford (The Mitford Years #1)","review":"I really wanted to like it, and agree with one reviewer who wrote it seems like Christian genre. If it were a movie, it would get a \\"G\\" rating. It has the tone and feeling of an idealized America, circa early 1950s, as those the characters were in a Norman Rockwell painting. Most of the folks are so good, it was hard to distinguish the cast of characters, and wish the author had listed them in a \\"who's who.\\" And while I read it to the end, it didn't grab me in a way that makes me want to read the series, which I find oddly disappointing."},{"Title":"At Home In Mitford (The Mitford Years #1)","review":"This first book of Jan Karon's sets the scene for a lot of us to 'go back' in time and reflect on our lives in a small hometown where most of have spent some of our growing up, or settling days.

I love the humor and wholesome values of these books, and I read them over often."},{"Title":"At Home In Mitford (The Mitford Years #1)","review":"The fictional town of Mitford, North Carolina is set like a perfect jewel in the rolling green hills of the Great Smoky Mountains. The series, written by Jan Karon, features Father Tim, beloved pastor of the town's Episcopal Church. The Christian message is implicit, never forced. Tim quotes from the poet Wordsworth as often as from the Bible. The tone is positive, filled with love and joy and humor but never becomes cloying or saccharine. The writing is truly elegant in its simplicity and clarity. The characters are complex and realistic, carefully etched in the most loving detail by the author. I predict that if you ever pay a visit to Mitford, like me, you will never want to leave. The first book in the series is entitled \`At Home in Mitford'."},{"Title":"At Home In Mitford (The Mitford Years #1)","review":"This was a replacement copy of \\"At Home in Mitford\\" since someone didn't return my copy.

Karon successfully creates an alternative world where good prevails. Yet if you have read several of her books, you will know she doesn't whitewash unavoidable realities of mountain life - alcoholic abusive parents, drug dealers and moonshiners, violent and desperate folk. But the rewarding thing about her books is that in this little corner of the universe, Mitford, goodness and hope dominate. And what is wrong with getting a dose of that? If I want violence, twists and turns, shabby dealings, and angst-ridden monologues, I'll just pick up the newspaper or look at aol's main page!"},{"Title":"At Home In Mitford (The Mitford Years #1)","review":"Wonderful story.

Anyone who ever lived in a small town will recognize a familiar spot. You will find yourself praying right along with Father Tim as he seeks guidance with the young Dooley, strength to face illness, and the loss of his dog.

This is one of the best works of modern fiction I have ever read. The characters seemed to move into my home with me, the wordcraft was like a fine tapestry, and the soul was refreshed and nourished by the living faith of Father Tim that rang true through the book. I was almost shocked that a book's language and portrayal of life could be so simple and yet so true.I am not in a big rush to get the next installment, only because I am still savoring the last, and dread the day when I have \\"outread\\" Ms. Karon's writing and must wait for the next.

I'm sure that the Victorian Age turned out quiet, petite females, who took whatever life handed them; not so these women who followed their dreams and were able to accomplish much of what they set out to do. Some of the women were rough and tumble, raucous, maybe some even 'shady ladies.' But the underlying element that bound them together to make history and become subjects of this book, was their independence, touch of rebellion, and strength. No pancies or shrinking violets here - a good read. I liked it."},{"Title":"Bed Linens (Chic Simple Components): Head to Toe","review":"Pretty pictures, excellent photography, lots of neat things to look at, visually stimulating--this is a great book to leave out as a conversation piece.

It was my first exposure to narrative poetry and it has been my favorite book since then. When I read twenty years later that it was also the favorite book of John F. Kennedy it reassured me that he would avoid war at all costs. It is an anti-war story, and the devastation of war, the profiles of the all too human generals and of Lincoln are an important footnote of history. The poetry is musical and sometimes stark. He is able to impart the real devastation of war on the lives of those affected by it. I would reccommend it to anyone who loves poetry and history. It is a truly American story of a war that should never have been fought."},{"Title":"John Brown's body","review":"I ordered the book with ISBN 0822205947 thinking I was ordering the epic poem by Stephen Benet. This book is NOT the poem, rather a play based on that poem.I haven't read the play. It may be good, but I am irritated at being mislead into buying something other than what I thought I was buying."},{"Title":"John Brown's body","review":"I had this book crammed down my throat when I was a sophomore in high school. It was by far my worst experience as a student - the material was far too abstract for that period of my development, and completely without any reference to my life. The entire time we spent on this was torture.Even today when I hear the name Stephen Vincent Benet I cringe in horror - some sort of literary post traumatic stress syndrome. I surely hope that high school teachers are not still inflicting this on their students.Perhaps it is a great work of literature - but it should NOT be required reading for high school sophomores!!! There is nothing in it that such a student can relate to."},{"Title":"Dangerous Affairs","review":"If you like Regency romances, spies, and intrigue, Leslie Davis's &quot;Dangerous Affairs&quot; will keep you up way past your bedtime. It's hard to put down. The heroine, Kit Winslow, visits England only to get (literally) tangled up with a spy--Sir David Sherwood. She is both fascinated by him and frightened of the danger he represents. She is tricked into an unwanted engagement to David's cousin, fights off kidnapping attempts, and insists on continuing her dangerous investigation into David's activities (as, of course, their attraction for one another grows). The suspense keeps you turning the pages until all the subplots are finally tied together in a very satisfying ending. Suspense, romance, a bit of humor, and a pleasing ending--an excellent summer read."},{"Title":"Dangerous Affairs","review":"Leslie Rosen Davis is a fresh new author. I thoroughly enjoyed this book, and am anxious to read more of her books. Set during the Napolianic wars, Dangerous Affairs is a spy thriller full of suprises and intrigue. If you enjoy Elizabeth Thornton and Candice Camp you will love the mystery in this novel. Full of historic detail and romance, Dangerous Affairs gives the reader a very satisfying ending."},{"Title":"The Pearl","review":"This book was easy to read, and it was fairly interesting.

All Kino and his wife want to do is get away from it, for it brings evil, destruction, and even death to their home. Kino wants nothing to do with it, but finds that it is too late to dispose of it. This book keeps you on the edge of your seat with its adventurous plot. It entertains and excites you no matter how many times you read it. The best part of all was when Kino and his wife Juana were forced to flee their home and make a run for their lives. This story presents a satisfying plot with well-drawn characters and a thrilling adventure for all readers."},{"Title":"The Pearl","review":"A great little book.

It is a pretty good plot, but it just carrys on too much. There should have been more sub plots to it if it were 100 pages. Its not that great of a book but it is ok. A mexican family finds a pearl, the greatest pearl of all pearls, he trys to sell it but nobody wants to buy it because they believe it is fake. His wife thinks is brings evil to the family and wants to throw it back... READ IT AND FIND OUT WHAT HAPPENS.

I would recommend this book for everybody because it is a good story about how a person's life can change so quickly. A poor Indian family didn't have the money to take their sick baby to the doctor until they found \\"The Pearl of the World\\" and it turned their lives around. Kino (the main character) doesn't think twice about all the things they can get with it. Greed starts to take over Kino and the pearl turns to evil. At the end Kino finally realizes that the most important thing to him is family, but it's too late."},{"Title":"The Pearl","review":"The human nature which is bad or good is well implied in this book. John Steinbeck doesn't use the expression sentences such as &quot;He is angry.&quot; He used a very special way to present what kind emotion the main character has such as &quot;There is a song of enemy.&quot; On the other hand, at the end of this story, although the character gives up his wealth and dreams, he finally realizes what is the most valuable thing in the world --- not the pearl, not the wealth, it is his family."},{"Title":"The Pearl","review":"Kino, Juana, and their baby is a very poor family.

It shows how good things aren't always good and how they can bring bad things into one's life. Kino killed for the safety of the pearl. This book shows how evil arose in a man by a simple thing of value and beauty. Money doesn't buy happiness, health or love, we have all been told this and The Pearl is a perfect example of this. Everything has a price and Kino learned that that price was high. And he learned that price cost him alot."},{"Title":"The Pearl","review":"This book was well written and very imgonative, but the writting was very simple.

It shows a lot of symbolizm and can be interpreted in many ways and meanings.

I am not a good reader but I still think it was great. It was a action packed book with great characters.I read The Pearl in Archbishop Ryan High School, I am a ninth grader and my teacher told me if I read this book I will never read another book in my life but i told her i wanted to so i did. I now want to read more but i can't because of school and sports. I just wanted to say I loved The Pearl."},{"Title":"The Pearl","review":"The Pearl is a pretty good book which is well written and is very descriptive. John Steinbeck has better books, but this one isn't to bad. The plot of finding a gigantic pearl and trying to get the best price for it is a good setting. The book shows how some people are taken advantage of, and how far people will go to get what they want. Overall, it's a fairly good book."},{"Title":"The Pearl","review":"The book The Pearl by John Steinbeck had a meaning to it that I thought was great. His descrition of the characters to the beliefs they had, it was all great. The struggle and evil of this pearl made the whole book even more interesting. I found that I could read it all over again."},{"Title":"The Pearl","review":"The Pearl taught a very good lesson about greediness. It taught me that you shouldn't let money or possessions get in the way of family and friends. Even though the pearl had some good lessons I couldn't really get into it. Kino and his life were so different from mine that I just couldn't relate. This book was a mix of good lessons and sad situations. I would rather read a book that teaches me lessons in a less sad way. The book had a very sad, unexpected ending that just kind of left me hanging."},{"Title":"The Pearl","review":"THE PEARL is a book you would really enjoy if you are into the really deep literature.If you don't dig deep into books to find meaning I dont think you will understand the concept of the novel.There is more to THE PEARL then you think.It's a really good book and you should give it a try.The main characters are kino Jauna and there son coyotito.It is a story of class struggle and shows how such small things have a great impact on us all."},{"Title":"The Pearl","review":"This book is very simplistic &amp; straightforward. A poor couple have their lives turned upside down when they come into posession of a giant pearl. Their once simple, happy lives are now filled with turmoil. The pearl is symbolic of the &quot;money is the root of all evil&quot; concept. This book didn't teach me anything I didn't already know, and is really best-suited for young people."},{"Title":"The Pearl","review":"After reading the book The Pearl I realized many things. One of the things that I realized is that it is human nature for people to be greedy and it is alright unless you go to far. I think that John Steinbeck did a great job getting the point across. He used a lot of examples of how greed affects our lives. I thought that the plot was well thought out, and it kept you reading on to see what happens next. Steinbeck's characters were also very interesting and likable. He did a good job of linking all the characters under greed and how everyone is affected by it. Even the priest in the novel was greedy. The characters were also very well rounded and had charateristics that I liked and characteristics that i dislike too. I think that the ending was also well thought out. The way that Steinbeck took away all the burrden from Kino and his family. I could not put this book down and enjoyed reading it trimendously."},{"Title":"The Pearl","review":"I am a 15 years old student from New York. I have read a book name &quot;The Pearl&quot; it is written by John Steinbeck. This story is about a very poor fisherman named Kino and his wife Juana. Their son was bitten by a scorpion. They went to see the Doctor, but the Doctor dont want to see them because they dont have any money. Then Kino found the great pearl. He thought this pearl will make his family happy. But this pearl brings them many troubles.If you want to know more just read this book. You will like it and you will learn many things from this book."},{"Title":"The Pearl","review":"I thought that The Pearl was boring. There were only a couple of exciting parts, but the rest was boring. The story teaches a good point, though. It teaches that riches can't buy happyness, but can ruin a family. I think that Steinback could have said the same thing, but made it more interesting. The story could easily be a true story, and I'm sure its based on one, but it isn'y really a likable storyline. I think that the story was supposed to be symbolic because every sound that happens is translated into music. Kino, the main character hears the &quot;music of the family&quot;, the &quot;music of the enemy&quot;, the &quot;music of the pearl&quot;, etc. so it gets kind of boring. Every so often, there is a word in Spanish, and if you don't understand Spanish, it is a little confusing. The book is okay, but I definatly wouldn't recomend it."},{"Title":"The Pearl","review":"THE PEARL IS AN EXTRAORDINARY BOOK WRITTEN BY JOHN STEINBECK.

HE DOESN'T HAVE MONEY TO PAY THE DOCTOR SO,HE STARTED SEARCHING FOR THE PEARL. THEN HE FINDS THE GREAT PEARL.THIS GREAT PEARL SHOULD BRING HAPPINESS TO KINO AND HIS FAMILY.

The beginning is like all other stories and is easy to understand. But the most weird thing is that it has more than one conflice: Man vs. Man, manvs. Himself, Man Vs. nature, and Man vs. the society. Its is very interesting"},{"Title":"The Pearl","review":"&quot;The Pearl&quot; is a book I will always remember. It is such a beautiful book, I loved it! It has emotional moments but murder, also! It keeps the reader entertained throughout the entire book. To understand it, the reader must be pretty mature, but if you read it carefully I think you'll see why it is so wonderful."},{"Title":"The Pearl","review":"This book was a very classic american tale. It was quite boring and if it wasn't for a book report I would have stopped reading it on page 6. It was short and was extremely easy. I suggest you read Of MICE AND MEN if you can."},{"Title":"The Pearl","review":"I thought that the pearl was a moderate book. The pearl was a very short book. It was not so much an easy read because you had to comprehend a lot of things while reading the book. It had a lot of good twist in the book. My favorite part was when he found the pearl because the author used very good imagery because I can just see the happiness in Kino's eyes when he sees the \\"magnificent pearl\\". He was very descriptive showing him how Kino or any other character felt like if there was blood rushing through his veins. The book also had a very good moral to it. It talks a lot about good and evil and how the evil in something could take over you. Even if the thing didn't help you it could still took over you. Another aspect of the story is if you do not like sad ending this is not the book for you because it is really sad. As soon as he finds the magnificent pearl he starts getting over powered by the beauty of the pearl causing him to go crazy for the pearl. The book also shows the differences in classes in towns because when he goes to the doctor for his almost dead baby or at least what they thought. The doctor did not take the baby because he assumed that if Kino was poor that he could not pay for the bill the doctor was giving him. But as soon as the doctor noticed he had the baby he came to Kino's house to tend to the baby because he wanted to get him to pay him. It really shows that the evil in something can persuade you to do almost anything if it shows something good. The main plot of the story is how Kino, A fisherman, Juana, his wife, and Coyotito, the baby, are in a problem. The problem is that the baby, Coyotito, Has been stung by a scorpion causing him to get what they thought was sick. And then Kino prays for a miracle and what he gets is what he thinks is more than a miracle. He finds the biggest pearl they have ever seen. It is quickly know as \\"the Pearl of the World\\" and everyone is amazed by it. But as he has the pearl he is getting very bad luck caused by the pearl and things start not going his way. And then something terrible happens and he must try and resolve it. But you must read the book to find out if he will. That is basically my version of what the back of the book should say. But overall, if you like John Steinbeck's style of writing you would like this book. As it says on the front of the book it really is a timeless and unforgettable novel of men and women -and good and evil. But overall, the book is a good book and I recommend it to older readers that like a good developed book."},{"Title":"The Pearl","review":"The Pearl is a compelling novel with many interesting discussion points for advanced readers and literature fans. Though The Pearl is a good action book also. The Peral discusses behind the scenes political ideologies, corruption by money,economic theories,and the political ideologies are particulary specified about the theories of that time. Though if you want a blatent action and chase book with some violence this is also a great book for you. The Pearl was a great read."},{"Title":"The Pearl","review":"The Pearl by John Steinbeck, is an exciting story about a man named Kino, who is a poor diver, and one day he finds a pearl in the ocean. He thinks that is the most valuable pearl ever. However, his wife Juana thinks that the pearl is going to bring them the evil. She is afraid and worried, and wants Kino to throw the pearl back into the ocean. Kino does not listen to the wise words of his wife though, instead he goes on thinking about the pearl's value, and how much money he could make from selling the pearl. When he goes to sell the pearl he finds out that it is barely worth anything. He thinks that he is being cheated. The book shows how people often go corrupt over money. He, his wife Juana, and his baby son Coyoto run away from the village. They run to the mountains to get away, but they are followed by the town's trackers. They have to try to escape from the trackers in order to survive. It is an amazing story with an unforgettable and totally unpredictable ending."},{"Title":"The Pearl","review":"The Pearl is a classic John Steinbeck storyline, oddly enough the main plot is from an old Mexican folk tale. John Steinbeck took the storyline and crafted it into an intriguing, 90-page novella with questions, a few answers and lots of emotions at the end.The story is simple. A scorpion stings the baby of Kino and Juana a couple barely surviving. Kino is a fisher of pearls. Juana is his someday wife. Death is feared for the baby, they go to the doctor's and he shuts them out, Juana tries to stop the poison every way she knows how but still the couple is left worried. Kino and Juana go out to sea, to fish for pearls. While Juana prays dearly that they will find a big pearl that will allow them to see the doctor, Kino dives in search. He comes up with many oysters, he opens one: empty. The second one though reveals a large, beautiful, perfectly shaped pearl. They call it the Pearl of the World. The pearl though leads only to havoc as the colonist doctor cheats them and the pearl traders try as well. Kino is attacked and attacked and the pearl becomes more and more sinister. Until finally...I really enjoyed reading this book: the plot is quite gripping, the characters are morphed into a new shape by the end so realistically, the story is grounded in a deep meaning and it's written incredibly well.The way it was written was one of the things that made the book for me, it's done in such a fresh style. He used the songs of the people and made them into Kino's emotions and Kino's way of sensing danger. The songs battle each other for precedence in Kino's mind. The main songs that battle throughout are the Song of Evil and the Song of Family. Intertwined with these songs are the Song of the Pearl and the Song of Undersea.I'm very glad I read this book and I would recommend it to people who like a good story and a lot of description. John Steinbeck lays the land out so well, describing it better than anyone because he knows it better.The Pearl is an excellent and quick read. If you haven't read Of Mice and Men, I would suggest reading it first because it's a better John Steinbeck novel with the same length and some of the same themes. But if you want to just jump into this novel be my guest, it's a great book."},{"Title":"The Pearl","review":"I thought that this book had a good christain moral to it. It talks about how a person like Kino who had found a pearl and became a very greedy person. Someone who is greedy, is a person who wants that object all to themselves and share it with nobody at all. I like this book alot and it shows us the difference between right and wrong. I didn't like how Kino treated Juana and his people. I also didn't like the fact that the people in town treated Kino and his people like dirt and also like they were a nobody. When Coyotito got stung by the scorpion and they took him to go see the doctor and the doctor didn't want to help them because they were Indigenous people and he will only help them if they had money. Kino and Juana were poor people, they didn't have alot of money and they wanted the doctor to help Coyotito get better and not die for this scorpion bite. The doctor was mean and rude, he didn't want to help Kino and Juana, just because that they are Indians."},{"Title":"The Pearl","review":"I had to read this book for school, and it did not take me that long since it was so short. I didn't particularly like it. It din't make that much sense to me and was quite boring. i didn't much like the \\"songs\\" theory in the book and found that it was just used as a subject for the first two chapters, and then only brought back 2 or 3 times later in the book. Also, I don't understand why Kino was keeping the Pearl, even though he knew it was evil, and didn't throw it away until the end. It seems very stupid to me.The book seemed to go very quickly in the first 2 chapters, the next two were just explaining all the metaphors, and the rest went by very slowly. There was not much plot in trhe novella, and when there was, it either wasn't very good, or went to quickly and I had to stop and rest because of the speed. I din't really like the characters also, and thought the the author thried to make them act as one woould act if this had been a ovie instead, like when Kino took the pearl from Juana and kicked her in the side, then walked awaty and killed somebody (again, going very fast).The bad luck spree was a very common one- the character kills somebody, loses his favorite/ only material possesion, his house burn down and then he runs away. i have seen and read this happen many times before, and find it very tiring and repetetive when this happens.All in all, I didn't really like the book. I think it could have had a thicker plot and could have had a better character structure. I liked some of the metaphors, though, and liked some of the events that happened in the novella."},{"Title":"The Pearl","review":"IN the novella The Pearl by John Steinbeck, KIno a poor pearl diver discovers that the infrastructure that governs his life is working against him. I call it a long parable because there is a complex lesson to be learned throughout the book. I call it a short story because if you are dumb, you will get no meaning out of it what so ever. This is a book that takes you back in time to the simple life of a village man vs. the society that he longs to join."},{"Title":"The Pearl","review":"The Pearl is a simple yet powerful story of greed, corruption, and desire. But it is its apparent simplicity that makes it a true classic.Kino is a poor pearl diver, just as his father and grandfather were. His wife Juana is a patient, though somewhat disobedient, wife who always has her spouse's best interests in mind.The story grabbed my interest within the first couple of pages and never let go. I read the entire thing in a single sitting. Granted, that isn't such an amazing feat, it's not even ninety pages.The hope that the pearl represents at the beginning turns to doom by the end, which Kino must realize for himself despite Juana's constant warnings. Steinbeck flawlessly made Kino's village into basically a single character.Overall, it was just a very enjoyable novella. Like all of Steinbeck's work, it will give you something to really think about."},{"Title":"The Pearl","review":"I'm a sevy (13-yrs), yes, and we read this novella in school. I thought it was going to be boring, but I randomly loved it. It is a sad story of hope, greed, and despair that is fantastically writen. Steinbeck does an outstanding job to describe Kino's animal-like behavior. There are a few minor bores, but it turns out to be a great novel or novella.4/5 stars (A-/B+)"},{"Title":"The Pearl","review":"John Steinbeck did a really good job on The Pearl. He usually writes nine-hundred to one-thousand page books but this one is exactly ninty pages long. I don't own this copy but the one with the blue cover (I think that is the newer version). This is about a man named Kino and his wife Juana and his baby son Coyotito. It starts off as his son, Coyotito, gets stung by a scorpion. Kino and Juana try to get him cured by the doctor but the doctor is too ignorant and wouldn't serve poor Indian people. Then Kino goes oyster fishing for big pearls. He finds the Pearl Of The World. Soon the doctor serves to him in exchange for his pearl. But Kino doesn't quite want to give up his pearl yet. Will the doctor steal it? Or will he persuade Kino to give it to him? You really got to read this book to find out!"},{"Title":"The Pearl","review":"I got this delivered to my Kindle Fire in about ten seconds after which I spent a few day reading it. I wish I'd read it sooner because I was deeply impressed by the clarity with which Steinbeck depicted the fall into despair of a small family living so simply as to be free from the cares of the world. Buy it / read it / be impressed / reflect in Steinbeck's mastery."},{"Title":"The Pearl","review":"Steinbeck's The Pearl is an excellent read about how life can be beautiful when you have a loving family, despite poverty, and how everything can change when the opportunity of getting rich suddenly appear.

Though I read it for a required school assignment, I enjoyed reading it very much. The story was... grim, but it is well written and it was enjoyable to read, just as I expect from a wonderful writer like John Steinbeck. Four stars out of five, because it was good, but there were some points in the book that I did not enjoy (I won't say what, to prevent upsetting any readers with spoilers)."},{"Title":"The Pearl","review":"This is a classic \\"must read\\" and highly recommended. It is also a quick read that is hard to put down as the story unfolds. The author uses beautiful imagery in the tale leaving no stone or pearl unturned!"},{"Title":"The Pearl","review":"John Steinbeck's classic novella, The Pearl, is a tale about the tragic consequences one family faces in achieving the American Dream. For many people, this dream consists of acquiring wealth, and perhaps even fame. The recent craze over the Mega Millions lottery that was going for over $500 million is proof. People dream of the kinds of things they could do with that much money. Or we dream of fame through means of acting, singing, or writing a novel. I've encountered many teens in an urban school setting who believe school doesn't matter because they'll be rich one day due to their imagined singing talent. This dream isn't critically analyzed, and these teens fail to realize that failure is more common than success, and success, anyway, doesn't always get you where you want.The main characters, Kino and Juana, discover a magnificent pearl, the Pearl of the World, and they take it back to the village. With the money they can get from the pearl, Kino and Juana can get married, buy clothes, and afford an education for Coyotito. Their future path has been laid before them. Their neighbors and friends, and soon the whole town, learns about the Pearl of the World, and everyone is dreaming of what they will buy with its wealth, though it belongs to Kino and Juana. This pearl represents the dreams of everyone.Everything quickly goes wrong. The doctor comes to their hut and plays a mean trick to make Kino and Juana believe he has cured their child of the poison, and then he gives them the bill. In the night, somebody tries to steal it and Kino has to fight off the intruder. And when they try to sell it, the pearl buyers act as though the pearl is worthless and they low-ball Kino, which angers him. Things escalate even beyond this, but I will leave the rest for you to discover.Elements of this story may sound familiar to you. We hear how lottery winners spend or loan out all of their money in a matter of years and fall into deep depressions. We also see the consequences of fame through celebrity gossip that paints the famous in a negative light. People grow envious of the success of others and seem to find joy in seeing them topple over. Britney Spears was a beloved singer until she got married for a brief time, and Christina Aguilera had a brief stint as a dirty girl that will not go away in the public eye, despite some beautiful music she has written since. And she's put on weight, celebrity gossipers are quick to point out. There are too many premature deaths: Amy Winehouse, Heath Ledger, Chris Farley, Michael Jackson. One has to wonder what toll fame and success takes on those who achieve it.Steinbeck sees wealth as a corrupting force. He believes in the goodness of impoverished people, like Kino and Juana. They would have been happier had they not found the pearl. I don't think Steinbeck is discouraging people from dreaming, but providing a warning that achieving your dream won't fix all that ails you. In fact, it might even make things worse."},{"Title":"The Pearl","review":"Purchased book for grandson. Delivery took longer than I expected. He needsed the book for his summer reading program .I was surprised at the size of the book, it was not as I expected . Thank you"},{"Title":"The Pearl","review":"I really like this story. It is a really short easy read. Steinbeck is a magician with language. He proves to be an articulate storyteller. What power, wisdom, emotion and wealth in this tale. The characters are crafted with such caution and are depicted humanely. If you haven't read this book you should read it. You'd definitely be missing out. I recommend this book to kids and adults. The themes here are greed, humanity, colonization. I was so impressed by this story. I was never interested in it before and judged this book by its cover. I had to read it for school thankfully and I think everyone else should read this, too. It is a sad story composed with beautifully and careless perfection. Deeply moving and very touching."},{"Title":"The Pearl","review":"The pearl is a classic novel that has been read now by three geberations of my family.My grandson just finished reading it as part of his summer reading assingments.The price was very inexpensive and had quick delivery."},{"Title":"The Pearl","review":"This might have been the most well written book I have ever read. The amount of detail Steinbeck puts into such a short book is wondrous. It is about a poor man named Kino who finds the perfect pearl, and the troubles that seem to follow him after he finds it. It is set in La Paz, in fairly recent times. The ending, while saddening, perfectly finishes the idea of the story, that jealousy, greed, and misfortune tend to follow the fortunate. I would recommend this book to anyone that reads on a high enough level, and would gladly read it again."},{"Title":"The Pearl","review":"Steinbeck is a great story teller. I thoroughly enjoyed reading this, as I did his other works. However, I'm not sure I agree with the main stream thought regarding money is the root of all evil - and how it changed Kino.I see Kino as the victim here! What did he really want with the money? Give his kid an education, pay for a true wedding for him and his wife, get a new harpoon (for work) and a rifle. I'm not sure these are the things made of greed.Everyone else in town, on the other hand, had thoughts of greed. I mean really, whats wrong with a guy trying to make a buck and provide for his family?OK, true one bad thing occurs between him and his wife, which seemed a little out of character for Kino - maybe it was a cultural thing \\"I'm a man\\" and all? Not sure.Other than that, the evils that occur are by others as a result of Kino's HARD WORK finding this pearl - no the devil didn't give it to him, he got up and went to work and found the pearl when he was...pearl diving (his job)! He has the right to own that pearl, just as anyone has the right to their paycheck for the job they do...I'm just saying! Thanks for reading my review! Via con dios!"},{"Title":"The Pearl","review":"For English,my class had to read the Pearl. Being used to having to read 200-250 pages long books, I thought that the Pearl, being only 90 pages long, was going to be a breeze. However, I found that this book was quite a drag to read, and took way longer than expected.I could never quite get why Kino did things as how he did, or what kind of person he was. This left me disconnected from the book, and made it hard to read. I never managed to see what was up with all the \\"Songs of the Enemy\\" and \\"Songs of the Fanily\\" and all that stuff, because there was no intro to it, to introduce those new ideas. I think it could have been an interesting book, if only Steinbeck would have taken the time to inrtoduce things such as him thinking with songs, instead of just thoughts.Some of the characters, particularly Coyotito, made no sense to me either. I was never able to fiugre out why he was in the book, and for what reason. I mean, great they have a kid, but who cares?! Aside from being bitten, and being shot, he doesn't do anything other than being a punchingbag for conflicts that have to push along the plot, since the author can't seem to come up with original ideas.Overall, this book wasn't bad, and I realize that I maybe just don't get it, and other people think this book is great, but to me this book was a dissapointment, and I hope i'll never have to read it again."},{"Title":"The Pearl","review":"This book \\"The Pearl\\" by John Steinbeck is a story about a family of three that live in poverty but they have thier morals to live by.

After they found what was said to be \\"The greates pearl of the world\\" every one in town wanted part of it. So greed aroused in La Paz. Kino's family was attacked and tricked. Accidents,murder,rage and drama happend throughout the book.I gave this book two stars, because this book I would say is for bigginer readers or for a younger audience. It was an interesting novela.

A scorpion strikes Elizando's child and the distraught father seeks the town doctor, a pompous and mean spirited man, who will help at the right price.The next day, Elizando finds \\"the Pearl of the World\\" perfectly shaped and colored, and as large as a small bird's egg. Elizando imagines his child going to school and learning how to read - this knowledge would give the family the power it needed to know the truth's of the world and stop relying on superstitions. However, through greed and class conflict this wish for his child is only a pipe dream.Great book, better than the other so-called short novellas like Catcher in the Rye. Read this!"},{"Title":"The Pearl","review":"As an assignment for my sophmore class in Honors english 2, we were to read the John Steinbeck classic &quot;The Pearl&quot;. For a teenager, depending on your priorities, this can be a rather boring book or a book with a deeper meaning that leaves you searching for something that might be left behind. It may leave you with a sense of discomfort. It certainly doesn't give the platinum-ideal of an all loving world. It portrays a historical view, as well as an ethical view. The discomfort and disgust with society you may find in this book is relevant to take into consideration-Steinbeck is noted for that. It just depends on what you get out of it. The only thing i felt it lacked was too much definition-That could just be my adolescence talking but I did get bored at times. I have read thousands of books within my library and if i can read through Tom Clancy's delightful &quot;Rainbow Six&quot; then i thought that absolutly nothing could bore me. Well when it takes a whole page just to describe what Kino thinks between steps i kinda felt like &quot;okay now this book is getting full of itself&quot;. Maturity might indeed be needed to get what some might get from this book, But many Professors and teachers among literature majors find that this book is essential in building a, Value-base(if you will) in reading many other books. So it seems maturity is needed to read this book but you need to read this book to find maturity."},{"Title":"The Pearl","review":"I can enjoy a moral or allegory as much as the next man, but I wanted something more than this from Steinbeck. The novel seemed stripped down compared to his others, like a skeleton."},{"Title":"The Pearl","review":"The premise and plot of The Pearl is excellent. The struggle of man against money and other man is a hard one, and this book brings it all out. However, the dialogue is very dry, and there's hardly any of it. The book is enjoyable in some parts, but only some, and you find yourself reading to finish it, not reading to actually enjoy the book. I have to give John Steinbeck some credit for expressing the thoughts and feelings of the characters through the music of Kino, but, bottom line, be glad its only ninety pages."},{"Title":"The Pearl","review":"John Steinbeck took an interesting folk story and thoroughly overprocessed it. He doesn't spoonfeed you the morals of the book, he uses a big shovel. That poverty is blissful, and wealth will only destroy happiness, is ground in from page one. It doesn't take long (a few days?) for anonymous residents of Kino's otherwise utopian village to burn his house down, steal his boat, try to kill him, and chase his family out of town with horses and guns. All for a pearl which the brokers won't buy....To achieve a similar effect, hit yourself on the head with a rubber mallet and read a few chapters of the Bible. This way you will experience tedium, moral lessons, and a headache without paying ... for an 80 page book."},{"Title":"The Pearl","review":"This book seemed very passable to me. I had nothing but criticism for this book because i was honestly very dissapointed. The dialogue seemed very repetitive, with Kino continually saying,\\"The song of the [insert noun of choice here]\\" throughout. It seemed very redundant. Also, the story dragged and I was just waiting for something big to happen the whole time. In my opinion, the only redeeming feature about this book was the moral. It maintained a good moral; Money can ruin you and your family. But honestly, i expected more than a fortune cookie moral out of John Steinbeck. Truly a dissapointment, and ultimately passable."},{"Title":"The Pearl","review":"I believe The Pearl encapsulates Steinbeck's strengths in its short but rich pages. The structure is remarkably strong in that it delivers compelling characters and events in its condensed space. The symbolism is ever present and, having read this book many times, ever revealing. Steinbeck weaves man and animal, hunter and prey into a suspenseful morality tale. As an author his works were significant in social commentary, particularly in championing the common man while lamenting his lot in a frenzied, materialistic world. The main characters in The Pearl are similarly portrayed and, despite the miles and time apart from them, I feel very conected to their struggle to balance what is good and pure in love and family with what is desired and sought after, sometimes mistakenly in their name."},{"Title":"The Pearl","review":"By NickYou have won the lottery. Your are instantly on a rise for the stars. Striding higher and higher, life can't be any better, right? John Steinbeck demonstrates a similar situation in the literary classic, The Pearl. It is a masterpiece of love, hatred, deceit, trust, and barriers unraveled in a plot where pain and misery is naturally part of daily life. The sorrow of the main character, Kino, can truly be felt, as he in his trivial pursuit to succeed, always fails in his attempts, falling back into an abyss of despair.Kino is a poor Mexican peasant living in Baja, California in the early 1920s. His only companion in life is his wife Juana. They both reflect their lifestyle in their character, for they portray nave, simple, uneducated commoners, shunned upon by the civilized and sophisticated. When a poisonous scorpion stings Kino's son, Coyotito, he must determine a way to pay for doctor's attention, so like so many others before him, he goes diving for pearls. Under the water what appears to be any ordinary pearl, turns out to be a gateway to a life of no labor and hope for dreams Kino always wished to accomplish. As Kino emerges from the sea and takes his first gasp of air, his eyes bestow on a pearl the size of a seagull's egg. He gazes in astonishment, as the water trickles from the surface the sun radiates its milky white color, it is as smooth as Kino's own skin, for it holds the promise of hope and its superior excellence catapults Kino into a state of amazement. Though its surface may reveal a guarantee of a better life, contained deep inside the crevices of the pearl, is a raging, horrid evil released upon those who simply touch it. This pearl almost cost Kino his own life, and the life of some one else.Does wealth always deliver good fortune? Can we truly break from the shell of one's persona? Kino faced these issues in The Pearl. He learned greed is a sin; it brings jealousy and distrust into your life. Additionally, he learned no matter all the opportunities, he would still cast a forceful image of being unsophisticated and simple-minded. Though, this reality is true, and we face it almost every day. The Pearl is a book of an elaborate and dynamic tale of woe and anguish leaving a lasting and genuine impression upon the reader. The reader will truly treasure, and carry this story wherever life takes them. The Pearl is for those who love a heart felt story and for the ones that have read this book before, it will rekindle a love for a lost favorite. Its opaque beginning only contributes to its transparent message. I felt great affection for this book, and you will to. \\"And the music of the pearl drifted to a whisper and disappearance\\" - The Pearl"},{"Title":"The Pearl","review":"The Pearl by John Steinbeck was set at a little village called La Paz in Baja California, Mexico. In this book the main character Kino has Live in this small village with his wife, Juana and his son, Coyotito. Although that they are poor, they all has a great life, until Coyotito had been bitten by the scorpion. Kina had no money to pay for the doctor to treat his son. So they went to the gulf to try to find a pearl, so that he can pay the doctor to treat his son. Fortunately he had found the pearl, and it is not just a little pearl, it is \\"The Pearl Of The World. \\"It is as perfect as the moon and as big as the sea gull's egg\\". First Kino thinks that this pearl will bring a good future to him and his family, but instead this pearl is the root of all the evil. It has brought fear and evil and also a lot of problems to Kino and his family. Will Kino and his family overcome all the problems or will the problems get them?I think the book \\"The Pearl\\" is a very nice book and also a helpful book for everyone, and I will rate it with five stars. I think that everyone should read this book, because it is a very interesting book and it has all kinds of conflicts. And most important is that it tells people never to be greedy, when people are greedy, or want a thing too much, they will never get those things that they want. Instead, they will get something evil."},{"Title":"The Pearl","review":"Over and over again in life, people judge things before knowing what they are really like and what they can actually cause. In the novel The Pearl by John Steinbeck, the very same thing happens to Kino and his wife, Juana. Kino and his people are poor and have been cheated all of their lives. Their houses are made of brush, and the floors of their houses are the earth itself. All of a sudden Kino finds a huge pearl, and never once could think about it leading to anything except good. But as the good and content lives of Kino and Juana started to fade away, he realized that the pearl was causing changes in his life and the lives of many others; in some good, but generally evil ways.A scorpion had stung Kino and Juana's son Coyotito, but almost immediately after Kino found the pearl, the swelling and the poison went out of Coyotito's body. Kino howled with excitement because of his son's recovery and the finding of the pearl. The daydreams and visions that Kino and his family had about the riches they thought the pearl would bring them made them very hopeful for their future lives. Kino fantasized about many things he could pay for and obtain with the pearl. He wanted to get married to Juana, and have new clothes for his family. He also wanted a rifle and new harpoon. Most importantly Kino wanted education for his son. Thinking about these things time and time again made Kino and Juana happier every day.Kino thought of the pearl as a great treasure and only being able to be comparable to the birth of his son. But, after all of the evil that happened he felt differently. Kino thought that all of the townspeople were on his side and were happy and excited for him, but Kino was really every man's enemy. The pearl was creating greed and evil that surrounded Kino and his family. People started to make attempts to steal the pearl, including someone the doctor sent. The pearl became part of Kino's soul and it was all he could depend on. Juana soon realized the best thing to do would be to throw the pearl back into the sea. When Juana tried to do that, Kino beat her to the ground and punched her across her face. He even killed four people and his house was set on fire. Juana and Kino had to flee from La Paz. &quot;Human trackers&quot; hunted them down and a rifleman's shot hit Coyotito in the head, and killed him. That is what the pearl caused and it only left Kino with the definite feeling of uncertainty, wrongness and the cry of death.In life we all desire and wish for something. Throughout the novel Kino, above all, wanted education for his son. When Kino found the pearl, just like it would for any other person, it gave him hope for what he wanted. Kino depended too much on the pearl and let it take over his mind. In the end, after all of the evil that took place, Kino had lost not only the pearl, but also his son, whom he was fighting for the whole time. No matter how priceless or beautiful a pearl, diamond or jewel is, it doesn't mean it will bring happiness to our lives. It will just cause greed and evil to take over. Money is not everything."},{"Title":"The Pearl","review":"This is a true classic about how a poor yet content fisherman finds a pearl of great value. He believes that the wealth of the pearl will bring he and his family happiness yet discovers that the greed of others, especially the repressive Spanish can get in the way of his dreams."},{"Title":"The Pearl","review":"I find it interesting that the vast majority of the negative reviews come from people who can barely craft a coherent sentence, a point I made to my 9th grade GATE class. Nonetheless, THE PEARL is not my favorite Steinbeck work, either. However, I do think that one of its messages is pertinent: that education and knowledge are keys to power and freedom from abuse. Another theme I got from the book was that it is tempting fate to try to raise one's position in the world (e.g. witness what happened to Kino and Juana when they dared dream of a better life via the pearl). I'm not sure I agree with that sentiment, although perhaps the underlying message is that a person has to *work* for what he/she earns, rather than be given it.Certainly, the book made me think, which to me is one of the hallmarks of a successful work of literature. Unfortunately, it mostly made me think rather dark thoughts."},{"Title":"The Pearl","review":"The Pearl is a novel about the transitions a family goes through when Kino, the father, finds a giant pearl when he is on one of his fishing trips. When he brings the pearl home to his family in Baja California, the poor family gets hope from the pearl thinking it will bring them riches. As the family soon realizes having riches doesn't mean happiness. This book is a great book for anybody who wants a good read in a short amount of pages. Although this book is only about 90 pages in offers the same amount of emotion of a 300 page novel. The best think about this book was the moral at the end of the story. It expains to the reader that being rich or famous doesn't mean happiness, and that the person has to bring his own happiness. I would recommend this book to anybody over the age of 12 because it does deal with some very sad subjects that a 12 year old may not like. Overall this book was excellent and this book was one of Stienceck's best works."},{"Title":"The Pearl","review":"I want to first start out by saying I understand why this book was written. I also understand his message of how greed and wealth kill. I was just not excited about the way the book was presented.I think the main reason for me not liking the book was Kino. Being a poor diver from Mexico, it is understandable why Steinbeck chose to fill most of the novel with descriptions rather than dialogue. This was thought out and deliberate but I just plain didn't like it. Steinbeck made Kino the perfect character for the intent of the book. There was nothing wrong on the author's part.I feel like Kino had a definite paralysis in which he suffered a great deal from. On one hand, his very ill son needed to see a doctor which requires money, but, he never wanted to lose his appreciation of his family. Sadly, he had to pick one or the other, and in consequence had to say goodbye to his son. I'm sure for his entire life he longed to be rich which to use a terribly overused saying of \\"The grass is greener on the other side\\", is true to Kino. It's heartbreaking that he had to lose a son to see if the grass is greener.Going from GRAPES OF WRATH with vivid descriptions and ample dialogue and the gripping tale OF MICE AND MEN, it was very hard for me to settle down and pay attention to the details and look at descriptions with limited dialogue that made me not like it. I appreciate the variety of writing Steinbeck has given to the American public but I very much had a hard time with this style. I came out feeling awfully depressed and so sorry for this family. Though wonderfully written, this was my least favorite writing of Steinbeck so far."},{"Title":"The Pearl","review":"We pretty much all had to read The Pearl in School. But that was a time when you really didn't want to read, especially when someone told you to. I was one of those pupils. Well, I just finished The Pearl, and I really read it this time...what a great simplistically told story about the concept of \\"The Root of All Evil\\" In a nutshell Kino (a pearl diver) finds the largest pearl in many years in his community...immediately the neighbors and shop owners show jeolously and contemp, for the peasant suddenly turned wealthy by the pearl. Everyone wants the pearl, yet everyone tells Kino it is worthless and not up to par. An obvious lie.Similar to the long faces of the people you work with who didn't win the lottery after you just did. From this point the villigers treat him with contempt and are willing to steal the pearl if that means robbery or possibly murder? Kino is aware of this and he takes his wife and newborn son on the lamb after he is wanted by the law. (NO Spoilers here) From here we see how far a man is willing to go to keep the one thing he wants more than anything, only to lose his soul in the process. It is a nice crisp, simply told story of how money and wealth breeds contemp the of others. On another note, this story was so short and light, you can finish it in an afternoon. Steinbeck was able to take a complex idea and make it exciting and educational to the reader. I see now why it was a required reading in school. I do not know if they still offer this as a reading selection."},{"Title":"The Pearl","review":"This is Steinbeck's eighth novel or more accurately a novella. The writing is exceptional and it must be ranked as average or better, but it is short and cannot be compared with his best known novel \\"Grapes of Wrath.\\" It is almost as good as his other famous novella \\"Of Mice and Men,\\" which was his first novel. However, \\"The Pearl\\" is very short and some might not like it. I have read most of his works including the present, which is an interesting and a must read for Steinbeck fans. It has interesting prose and good drama, and it is very well written. I would rank it just below \\"Cannery Row\\" and \\"The Moon is Down.\\" It is similar to but better than \\"Tortilla Flat\\" in my opinion - based on the writing.It is about a young family living in a warmer climate where the couple earns their living by fishing. They have a single child who becomes ill. It is a story about greed and how it can change lives.John Steinbeck (1902 - 1968) was among the best known American writers of the 20th century. He won the 1962 Nobel Prize for literature. His 1939 Pulitzer Prize winning novel, \\"Grapes of Wrath\\" has over ten million copies in print.Steinbeck was born in rural California, went to Stanford, and spent most of his life in California. He has been associated with the plight of farm workers and others. His books have been very popular and many were made into movies and stage productions. He won an Academy Award nomination for best story in 1944.I have read a number of his novels and am still surprised with the quality of his work - especially his short stories and short novels and this is another good example. The present work is short and probably ranks among the middle of his 17 novels and novellas. Readers will appreciate the clarity of the prose even if the story is short.It is not a heavy read and takes one evenings to read. I liked the book and give it a positive recommendation, and it would be high on my list of Steinbeck novels.As a suggestion, do not buy the book alone, but rather would buy it as part of a collection such as Steinbeck's book: \\"The Short Novels of John Steinbeck,\\" from Viking Press in 1953, and updated versions of that book."},{"Title":"The Pearl","review":"In my opinion, the author should write more after Coyotito died, how his parent live do they die or they have another child."},{"Title":"The Pearl","review":"The first literary novel I ever read was &quot;The Pearl&quot; by John Steinbeck. It seemed boring at the time but I was forced to stop at the last chapter and write my own ending to the story. I wrote that the baby and the family survived through skill and coincidence. I was very proud of my ending, and recieved an &quot;A-&quot; grade. As I have grown older and read the &quot;The Pearl&quot; over, I understand it more and have a greater concept of what the author is trying to say. The story is based in a different time than we live in today, but there are so many similarities that refere to our times, not only the people, but the hierarchies, the politics and the beauty of culture. Steinbeck always considers all of these elements in his works, and much more. Although I at one time felt this novel boring, I now revel in what it says about every human being alive. There is a reason it is a classic, and it isn't because it's required readi! ng."},{"Title":"The Pearl","review":"My name is Hitomi Yamazaki. I'm from Nagano in Japan.

This book is incredibly easy and is about at a 9th grade level, and we are in horizons.Some are prejudiced against mexicans which is really sad seeing as i am half in my blood.I will not tell you anything about this book, only to just give it a chance.

In a country where pearl-fishing is a main industry, I can truly emphatize with Kino...each time a pearl fisher dives for pearls, he risks his life, yet he is the one who gets the least money in the deal. This book gives a different insight everytime it is read...I've read the book at several stages in my life...and still it always gives me certain surprises,especially on human nature...HURRAY for those readers who are truly perceptive and have realized the significant human experience drawn from this story.

Right on!!"},{"Title":"The Pearl","review":"I know it seems impossible to dislike a book where the moral is &quot;try to better your position in life, and you will have to bring home your dead baby in a bloody sack,&quot; but somehow, through Steinbeck's writing, this story turned out to be the worst I have ever read.The dialogue between the characters struck me as very awkward and forced. It was even hard to read because it was so unnaturally written. I found myself needing to read sections over again in order to get the point they were trying to convey.While the writing is tedious and unenjoyable, the story itself is also unpleasant. As I said before, the moral doesn't make much sense, yet it is beaten into the reader from line one.I hate to say it like this, because I know I won't be taken seriously, but this is really a stupid book. I would never suggest it to anyone (I would actually warn people to stay away from it). Don't waste your time.

This book was my process of studying. But it was very boring book. So, I give a content of this book 1 star. This book has not only boring story but also a lot of difficult words.This was sad story. In a story, a poor Indian family lived fishing. By the way, one day, unfortunately, a scorpion bit their son. But they just sucked his blood. The doctor, although, pretended not to know them or their son's poor life. However, if they know about their emergency situations accurately, they, at least, could save their little baby. I think, because they did not go for looking for the pearl together. One could have looked for the pearl for money, another could have looked for another doctor, or another person who could help them.Frankly speaking, I don't want to recommend that kind of book, however, if there is a reader who likes this kind of stories, I recommend it. The reason why I don't want to recommend that book is that book is boring and so, a reader who read the book may be tired, in my view.

The two main characters in the book are Kino, a Mexican pearl fisher, and his wife Juana the mother of their only child. Although these two characters a very closely related because they are husband and wife it is really much deeper than that. One would think that Kino would be a very strong individual because he is on a boat all day long battling the sea looking for the pearls. You would also think this because he talks about the song of the family and the evil music of the enemy. When in reality he is very strong but when it comes to being emotional and having to think quickly he is not really the man for the job. Then you look at his wife Juana and she is the typical mother. When the scorpion bit her son Coyotito she knew exactly how to act. She knew that she had to get him to the doctor but the only one was in town and she knew that he would not see him because he never deals with the people that live on the other side of the brush fence. Despite all of this she had to try so she decided to go to the doctor herself. I really liked this book even though it was not really fast paced it was very catching and page turning.

The pearl had become his soul.This taught us not to be greedy. i recommed it to the high school students because it is a good lesson for us to learn."},{"Title":"The Pearl","review":"THE PEARL by John Steinbeck is an exciting and tedious novel. It is about a family of poor Indians who find a pearl and try to use it to pay a snooty doctor to help their son, Coyotito, who was bitten by a scorpion.I think that the theme was that Kino finds a pearl and he wants to use it to pay the doctor to heal his son from a snake bite but his greed overcomes him and he ends up doing the wrong things. The theme was engaging and trivial. It made me think if I was comprehending the book the right way. It was scary at some parts and not scary in others. Sometimes I knew what was going to happen.Kino is the father of Coyotito. Juana is the mother of Coyotito. Coyotito is the baby that gets bitten by the snake. The author explains them in the beginning of the story.The setting is in Mexico and La Paz.I think it is sometime in the 40's or the 50's. There is no cars or anything that we have now mentioned in the book.He has an excellent style. He is not redundant with his words and he has ways to make you think about what something looks like. Like the way he describes the pearl. I read the book and noticed these things about his style.I recommend this book to readers that like moral books."},{"Title":"The Pearl","review":"The Pearl was an okay book, although I would not suggest it to anyone who wanted to read. I did like certain parts of the book, and it taught good lessons about life. It also let me see the world through a different point of view than my own. My favorite character in the novella was probably Kino for his human characteristics. He had so little, yet he was satisfied with what he had. He was strong all through the book, although his wife, Juana, appeared to be stronger at times. The Pearl has sort of a mysterious plot, and sometimes it was hard to follow along with what was happening. I definitely did not expect it to end as it did, and I was somewhat disappointed and surprised in the end. It's not your typical Hollywood plot. The Pearl had a good moral, but I do not think I would suggest you to read it for enjoyment."},{"Title":"The Pearl","review":"Well, I have to say I really enjoyed reading The Pearl. I will admit it was a little boring in the beginning, but in the last chapters it began to strike my interest.I was sad to see how greedy humans could be. Kino found the pearl of the world and all the town could do was tell him it was fake or want it themselves. When Kino's son got bitten, the doctor wouldn't even treat him, but when Kino found that pearl all of a sudden he was more than happy to help him. I think it shows human nature at it's best. I would recommend this for anyone to read, it teaches you some very important values everyone should take notice of.Even though Juana knew the pearl would hurt and destroy them, she stuck by Kino side threw it all. The end really touched my heart; after all that the did to have a life for their family, the baby ended up getting killed. It was so sad to hear and yet it made the story a bitter sweet ending."},{"Title":"The Pearl","review":"The pearl is a novel that tells how something material is thought to be a blessing, but is not compared to the loss of a loved one. The book wasn't all that bad. But the only thing I didn't like was when Kino and Juana threw the pearl back into the sea. Kino worked so hard for that pearl and then he's gonna throw it away like its nothing? Not me. If there's something I orked for that hard I will surely keep it."},{"Title":"The Pearl","review":"This book wasn't very interesting. Kino and his family found a pearl, and then were nearly killed by people who wanted it. You'd think that he would give up this pearl because his family was in danger. Instead he kills several men, and beats up his wife over the pearl. Then at the end, he throws it into the water after being followed by people who wanted to take it from him.This book was filled with wicked and greedy people. It was also very dragged out and full of sarcasm. I wouldn't recommend reading this book."},{"Title":"The Pearl","review":"I'm E6LMMQ!The main characters of the book The Pearl by John Steinbeck were Kino, his wife Juana and their son Coyotito. they are a poor family that lives near a town named Lapaz in Baja,California. The town's name Lapaz mean peace but, it was not peaceful because the people who live there were controlled by the evil of greediness, all this evil began when Kino's son Coyotito was bitten by a scorpion. So Kino started to find \\"the pearl of the world\\" to pay the doctor. Later on he was so lucky that found \\"the pearl of the world\\" and he thought that the pearl will bring his family a better future and life. But, when the people in town knew that, they got greedy and evil trying to get the pearl from Kino. Kino's family was started to have problems and troubles, So will kino's family have a better future and life? Will greedy people get the pearl from Kino? read it if you want to know what will happen later on.I recommend this book because it made me know that wanting a thing too much will cause troubles to myself and I will be control by the evil greediness. You will have a normal life that if the thing you want belongs to you. It will going to be yours. I think I learned a lot from this book so I will give it 5 stars!"},{"Title":"The Pearl","review":"The Pearl is one of the literture book in school and definately, i enjoyed it. It's very expressive and is pretty easy to be understood. But, does people of all ages understands the book? That's another problem as Steinbeck uses slangs and he is very expressive. In one of the sentence in the book, there's a deeper meaning in it. That makes you think whenever you read a sentence to fully understand what Steinbeck is trying to explain. I like the book as it says about racism, about the \\"blacks\\" who are not treated fairly. That reminds me of \\"To kill a mockingbird\\" by Lee, Harper. He is very expressive, but, I m still not sure if people of all ages will understand the book. But, i would definately hope that they would so to allow more people to enjoy his book which was WONDERFULL!!!"},{"Title":"The Pearl","review":"Grade nine student forced to read this awful book.

Kino became very animalistic and a perpetrator he killed a thif that was trying to still his pearl and also his only son died because of this pearl. materialistic thing are not always quite what we need to be happy not becaus you have money doesnt mean you have everything.

In the parable, it is all about Kino trying to break out of the circle of poverty, which does not happen, regardless of his efforts. The parable is stressing that you should be satisfied with who you as in the society. It states in real life that you can shape your destiny for the most part but for the others they are predestined."},{"Title":"The Pearl","review":"A good novella, one of Steinbeck's earlier ones. It's not as tight as his later works, but it's so short that it doesn't really bother one much. Not as much character depth as most Steinbeck novels, but then again, it's such a short book that there wasn't much room. An exciting, captivating read, told in the typical earthy details that makes Steinbeck so much fun to read. This is a great little book because you could probably read it all in one lazy afternoon. Get it and you won't be disappointed. A great introduction to Steinbeck if you've never read his stuff before."},{"Title":"The Pearl","review":"KIno, a poor diver, found a pearl the size of a seagull's egg,and it changed his life forever.

He went to the capital to sell the pearl for high price, but on the way trackers killed his baby. Then Kino Juana went home and threw the pearl into the ocean.This book is a good book because the desciption is perfect and the plot is just incredible. There were many \\" symbols\\" in the story which was exciting because it hooked me into the story."},{"Title":"The Pearl","review":"Kino used to live a peaceful life, until he found 'the Pearl'. At first, when he found it, he just wanted to cure his son, send his son to school, and maybe buy a new house and clothes. But he got more greedy and greedier. He became crazy about the pearl and took alot of care of the pearl, more than his family. Also, he killed a man who tried to steal the pearl, he was that obsessed with the pearl. At first,the pearl seemed to be a present from the god, but it was actually a curse from a devil, to break up the peaceful family. The scorpion was the first warning of the disaster. At last, when Kino and his family was running away to the capital to sell the pearl in a high price, they were chased by the trackers. When the family tried to escape from the trackers, their precious, the most precious first child, was shot by a rifle of the tracker. So, after that event, they, Kino and his wife, came back to their home and threw the pearl to the ocean where the pearl was found. Now everything was at the right place again, except for the empty space of the baby who was gone....This is a great book which is short, but carries lots of meaning. If you thought it was easy, you might want to read the book again, if you think about it, you would find a bunch of new things. For people who like complicated books, which contain alot of information and symbolism, I recommend this book to you."},{"Title":"The Pearl","review":"The book The Pearl by John steinbeck was not very exciting to me because of Juana and her thoughts about not wanting to keep the pearl not even if it was only for the sake of her husband Kino who thought ot ment a lot to him and his very own son as well. I agree with kino for wanting to kepp the pearl and for thinking that if it wasn't for it his son might of been dead. What really gets me confused though is why doesn't his wife see that and at least support his ideas and let her husband keep the pearl. I agree with Kino because if that would happen to me I would sertainly love to keep the pearl as well. It would of been a sigh to me as of why my child is still alive and why the doctor actually chose to help me."},{"Title":"The Pearl","review":"A sad story but well written...I had good visual of the story."},{"Title":"The Pearl","review":"The Pearl was the best book ever.

Steinbeck's simplistic style in this novel reflects what a strong influence it had on him. The Pearl is a quick and easy read and does make a strong message about greed. If you've read anything else by Steinbeck, you'll find this story fairly predicatable. Still, the short length and simple style make this an easy afternoon read that you'll probably appreciate."},{"Title":"The Pearl","review":"The Pearl, by John Steinbeck, centers on a poor family in the early 19th century in Mexico. When Kino, a husband and father struggling to provide for his family, finds a magnificent pearl in the depths of the ocean, he has a chance to lift the cloud of poverty that darkens his family's life. But the pearl not only brings hope, with it also travels greed and corruption. Now Kino must face the dangers that the pearl has brought to him and his family.I thought that The Pearl was a great story and was definitely worth reading. It offered a fast moving pace and good action. The Pearl was a slightly difficult read because of some difficult vocabulary and I would recommend it to both boys and girls from the ages of 11-14. However, I would not recommend The Pearl to readers who love cliffhangers and plot twists. Overall, I thought that The Pearl was pretty good read."},{"Title":"The Pearl","review":"Aughh!

I think that Steinbeck has well-developed characters and uses complex human emotions and responses, it may not relate to a lot of people and seemed unrealistic."},{"Title":"The Pearl","review":"This story takes place a long time ago in a mexican fishing village near a gulf. Natives live near the shore and are pearl divers. They use canoes and dive with notechnical equiptment. The divers houses are made of brush and other natural materials. The rest of the village is made of adobe bricks and mud.In this book, there are three important charectors. They are a family and their names are Kino, Juana, and Coyotito. Kino is a young man that is strong and fierce. His skin is dark and he is stubborn. He is also very brave. He is married to a lovely young woman named Jauna, who is wise and stubborn. She is very brave and optomistic. She has darkened skin and long dark hair. She loves her baby Coyotito. Coyotito is a baby who is newly born, but very tough. He is very intelligent also. All these charectors make one happy family.Kino, the fisherman finds the pearl of the world, but the pearl owners won't give him a high enough price. He knows that its worth a lot of money, so he decides to go to a nearby village to sell it. The pearl buyers try to steal it from him in a fight, but he accidentally kills one. They have to set out on foot across the land to escape the law. When they leave, the pearl buyers hire two trackers to follow them and take the pearl. When the family reaches a mountain, they find a place to hide in a cave. Kino attacks the trackers and the pearl buyer, taking the rifle and killing them all. Sadly, the rifle fires and shoots of the poor baby Coyotito's head. When the family returns home, they throw the pearl back into the sea.I think the moral of this story is bad things can come from good things. It proves the people that think wealth can erase all problems, wrong. I think thats what Stienbeck was trying to get across.The things that I like about Steinbeck's work is that it proves a point plainly and doesn't say what is already apparent. He wrote so that people could understand him and he made his stories interesting. What I dislike, is that he used lots of discription, too much actually. Also, I don't like how the baby is killed.Comparing to other books I rate this a 4 out of 5."},{"Title":"The Pearl","review":"I recommend this book to all readers because it was a good story and it was a exampel of how people can be with power. this book was not a dificult book to read i could under stand most of the words they werent to dificult to understand the grammer."},{"Title":"The Pearl","review":"The Pearl by John Steinbeck, is about a poor fisherman named Kino, who finds a pearl at the bottom of the ocean.

We were forced to buy the quite small book for five dollars. I read the book that night in an hour or less. It was not worth the money or the time I spent on it."},{"Title":"The Pearl","review":"No one should pick up this book it is not worth 5 dollars nor is it worth 5 cents I wish I had never readit please by all means DO NOT READ THIS BOOK"},{"Title":"The Pearl","review":"I give this book one star not because it is depressing or somber - but in virtue of it having a message bordering on something like nihilism. The book is about a man who is presented with sudden wealth, and of the downfall it brings him. Were he a man of already sufficient means who was presented with a fruitful lottery ticket it might be one thing, but what disturbed me about this book was that the protagonist, Kino, is a man of indisputably wretched means who initially is glad to happen across a gargantuan pearl in order that he might provide a better life for his family and rise above the unjust socio-economic caste he's been trapped in his whole life.But in the end, after the pearl causes terrible greed and destruction to both him and his loved ones, both internally and externally, he tosses it back in the ocean. The general message is clear enough: avoid potential sources of greed and materialism, and be happy with what you've got. Intrinsically, a perfectly sound message.But again, what is abhorrent about this book is it's about a man who's trying to RISE ABOVE, not gratuitously or materialistically get ahead. Unless to Steinbeck, 'rising above' in Kino's case really is just a subcategory of 'getting ahead' as opposed to 'being content.' If that is the case, that strikes me as a dichotomy unsound on every level. Or perhaps, Steinbeck's message is, or in addition is, 'don't fight the system.' (So, when people treat you like horse dung you just take it, right? Take it lying down, even if it means your children die of starvation or scorpion bites).If 'don't fight the system' is NOT the message of the book, then Steinbeck should have been more clear about what his message WAS. At best he's a confusing and ambivalent writer. At worst he's a nihilistic, sociologically sick person who can't even make a story enjoyable."},{"Title":"The Pearl","review":"Hi! My name is Fatima. I am from El Salvador. It is a little country in Central America. I have studied English for two months in The Monterey Institute of International Studies. We have a Steinbeck Class. Recently we finished reading &quot;The Pearl&quot;.In my opinion it is a fascinating book. Steinbeck has a big ability to describe the story, the places, the feelings of the characters and the situations; as a result, readers can travel in the story with the characters.The setting of the story is in a small village in Mexico's Peninsula. The main characters are Kino, Juana, Coyotito, Juan Tomas, his wife Apolonia and of course, the pearl. Around them there is a conflict between the evil and the good. The simple life of the characters is interrupted when they find the pearl. Finally, they discovered the true meaning of the pearl.I recommend this book because it is a good example of human values, the importance of family, the culture and the community. Also, I recommend this book to other ESL students because it is a very good story, it has a lot of vocabulary to learn and it is a short book."},{"Title":"The Pearl","review":"I just finished Steinbeck's the Pearl. Needless to say, I was sorely disappointed. I dearly beg that any who read it do not judge Steinbeck's writing ability by it. The only way to describe that thing is lame, lame, lame. Many have claimed it to be as good as Of Mice and Men, but how it is even comparable is beyond my mental capacity. This story was a required reading for my Sophomore English class, and it definitely turned off quite a few of the students to Steinbeck's writing. It lacked his flourish with detail and his wonderful analyses of the human psyche. If you want to read something short by Steinbeck, I would recommend Of Mice and Men. His stuff is a little bit deep, so don't bother if you just want a casual read. For those who wish to spend more time, I HIGHLY recommend The Grapes of Wrath. It is an awesome book, prolly one of my favorites at the moment, but it is rather long."},{"Title":"The Pearl","review":"The Pearl, by John Steinbeck,was a book I decided to read after a friend told me about it. It was fairly short and didn't hold any meaning. I truly think that this was Steinbeck's idea of Indians' poverty due to white man rather than a great idea for a novel. He used the two different societies and the doctor's greed to show how the white man tore the Indians apart. I think he chose a pearl as the jewel to be found because it is pretty close to white in color. The evil pearl buyers were also implied to be white people trying to kill Kino and his family for the pearl. The basic storyline could have been a descent novel had Steinbeck not thrown in all the other stuff. I would not recommend this book to anyone due to the content implied on the white man. If you must read this book, get it over quickly (you could probably finish in a day or so) and read The Count of Monte Cristo."},{"Title":"The Pearl","review":"I am in grade nine and was literally forced to read this book by my English teacher. It was dull, boring, and too wordy. It has several run-on sentences for an appraised author, and it shouldn't be considered a book for a student who is supposed to be learning NOT to be using run- on sentences to read. It does have a shocking, unexpected ending, but don't choose to read this book- only read it if you have to."},{"Title":"The Pearl","review":"Walking through middle school corridors, I'd spy kids in the grade above mine carrying John Steinbeck's \\"The Pearl\\" and think them lucky. Judging from the cover it was some kind of sea adventure, probably involving sharks and Jacqueline Bisset. This was back in the 1970s, and I was obviously confused.Flash forward to the present. Feeling nostalgic, I decide to take the book on after years of wondering. It was certainly short, and Steinbeck is a classic writer, so it seemed a good idea.A terse morality play about the pitfalls of materialism and the depravity of man, \\"The Pearl\\" is clearly a think piece rather than a conventional novel focused on characters and storyline. It made me think, too: However bad middle school was, it could have been worse.Kino is a poor Mexican Indian who lives off the meager pearls he finds swimming for oysters in the Gulf. One day, desperate for a miracle as his infant son squirms from a scorpion bite, he finds the largest pearl anyone has ever seen, large as a gull's egg and jet black. Kino sees a brighter future for himself and his family, but the jealous villagers and the plutocratic pearl buyers conspire to keep him in his place.\\"The pearl has become my soul\\", Kino tells his wife, who begs him to get rid of it before someone gets hurt. \\"If I give it up I shall lose my soul.\\"Steinbeck does nothing to make you care about Kino, his soul, or his wife and child, other than relate their poverty. They aren't people with personalities, but constructs designed to trot out points Steinbeck wants to make. Published in 1947, when socialism was fashionable and Steinbeck a recognized purveyor of the worker ideal, \\"The Pearl\\" might pass as a message about the folly of wealth and the value of living within one's means. Yet Kino and his family are clearly living below any decent standard. Collectivist comradeship may be the hallmark of socialist society, but the village Kino lives in is full of thieves and cheats.As the novel moves slowly on to a finale obvious from the midpoint of the book, one wonders what Steinbeck is trying to say. \\"The Pearl\\" is not supposed to be just a story, it's so unsatisfying in that department its clear the Bard of Salinas had other fish to fry. But what?You are left in the end not really knowing. As a classroom exercise, I guess it can provide some lively discussions if the teacher isn't too much of a tool. There's bits of good Steinbeck prose here and there, like his description of a watering hole where cats take their prey and lap water \\"through their bloody teeth\\" and the last image of the pearl itself, which captures a sense of otherworldly menace quite unexpected from this otherwise realist story. As an account of cruel nature, it works in a reductivist way.But I can't see it as a \\"classic\\" in the same sense as other Steinbeck novels I've read. It's no \\"Grapes Of Wrath\\". Maybe because it's short it makes for a more popular scholastic reading assignment than \\"Grapes Of Wrath\\". But \\"The Pearl\\" is no easy read, nor is it satisfying."},{"Title":"The Pearl","review":"This is a very overrated book. I don't hate because I was forced to. I actually enjoy reading and try to be positive about each reading assignment. However, this is a clear abomination. First of all, the story goes too slow with forced dialouge. Plus, the ending was very sad. Perhaps I shouldn't always expect a Disney ending, but come on! But what drove me nuts is how the neighbors had to FOLLOW THEM EVERYWHERE! And they had to get into a big stir over something they wanted that belonged to the white man. Sheesh! Leave the family alone for crying out loud! I know I won't get many helpful votes for this review because there will be English nuts on here who think that any time spent not interperting the meaning or symbolism on so much as a cereal box is wasted and that anyone who dosen't think that is the truth is an ignorant bum, but I had to say this.

However, when I told another teacher in the school what we were reading she seemed surprised. What she went on to say echoed my feelings completely.The Pearl is an amazing piece of literature but the plot is rather dull. If you are looking for exciting action this book is not for you. On the other hand, if you are looking for a magnificent writing this book is perfect.Kino, his wife Juana and their baby son Coyotito live in Mexico. To survive, Kino works as a pearl diver along with several others from his village. Every day, he paddles out in his canoe and dives for pearls. Things were the same day after day until, one day, when Kino discovered The Pearl of the World.The Pearl was perfect, as large as an eagle egg and perfectly round. No one, especially Kino, suspected how much evil the pearl would bring.Problem after problem befalls Kino until he and Juana are forced to flee. They head for the capital and are followed by trackers. The ending is truly spectacular and somewhat unexpected.I recommend this book for people who are looking for amazing writing, but if you're seeking the plot this book is not the best.

Kino is greedy and wants to keep the pearl. He does not know how much trouble it will get him into.The pearl is a struggle of Kino, his pearl, his family, and the people trying to kill him. The author uses much symbolism. This helps enhance the story and makes it a fun and easy read. The author creates the feeling of panic. Once Kino and his wife are on the run, Kino begins to wonder if he really wants the pearl and what will be best for his family.The setting in the pearl is described in detail. It takes place in Kino's dry dusty village. Kino lives in a small hut barely big enough for him and Juana. The author takes time to describe the setting which paints a picture in the readers mind. Because of this, a reader will feel conected to the story and have the illusion that he/she has been there before.The theme is classic. It is a stuggle of person vs. self. Kino becomes so greedy that even when the pearl begins to ruin his life, he will not give it up. This goes to show that money means nothing if you don't have happiness. When kino becomes greedy, Juana becomes more and more dissapointed. Kino says that the pearl is a part of his soul and that losing the pearl will be losing a part of his soul.

Your are instantly on a rise for the stars. Striding higher and higher, life can't be any better, right? John Steinbeck demonstrates a similar situation in the literary classic, The Pearl. It is a masterpiece of love, hatred, deceit, trust, and barriers unraveled in a plot where pain and misery is naturally part of daily life. The sorrow of the main character, Kino, can truly be felt, as he in his trivial pursuit to succeed, always fails in his attempts, falling back into an abyss of despair.Kino is a poor Mexican peasant living in Baja, California in the early 1920s. His only companion in life is his wife Juana. They both reflect their lifestyle in their character, for they portray nave, simple, uneducated commoners, shunned upon by the civilized and sophisticated. When a poisonous scorpion stings Kino's son, Coyotito, he must determine a way to pay for doctor's attention, so like so many others before him, he goes diving for pearls. Under the water what appears to be any ordinary pearl, turns out to be a gateway to a life of no labor and hope for dreams Kino always wished to accomplish. As Kino emerges from the sea and takes his first gasp of air, his eyes bestow on a pearl the size of a seagull's egg. He gazes in astonishment, as the water trickles from the surface the sun radiates its milky white color, it is as smooth as Kino's own skin, for it holds the promise of hope and its superior excellence catapults Kino into a state of amazement. Though its surface may reveal a guarantee of a better life, contained deep inside the crevices of the pearl, is a raging, horrid evil released upon those who simply touch it. This pearl almost cost Kino his own life, and the life of some one else.Does wealth always deliver good fortune? Can we truly break from the shell of one's persona? Kino faced these issues in The Pearl. He learned greed is a sin; it brings jealousy and distrust into your life. Additionally, he learned no matter all the opportunities, he would still cast a forceful image of being unsophisticated and simple-minded. Though, this reality is true, and we face it almost every day. The Pearl is a book of an elaborate and dynamic tale of woe and anguish leaving a lasting and genuine impression upon the reader. The reader will truly treasure, and carry this story wherever life takes them. The Pearl is for those who love a heart felt story and for the ones that have read this book before, it will rekindle a love for a lost favorite. Its opaque beginning only contributes to its transparent message. I felt great affection for this book, and you will to. \\"And the music of the pearl drifted to a whisper and disappearance\\" - The Pearl"},{"Title":"The Pearl","review":"THE PEARL, BY JOHN STEINBECK TAKES PLACE IN A SMALL FISHING VILLAGE IN BAJA CALIFORNIA, MEXICO.

With its hundreds of twists and turns you may never be able to put this book down."},{"Title":"The Pearl","review":"This book was written in 1945 and has sure stood the test of time. It's only 128 pages long but each page is a small well-crafted gem. The story is simple. The time and the place are not named but it probably takes place in Mexico in the 18th or 19th Century.Kino and his wife Juana live a hard subsistence existence near the sea. They are young though and have a newborn son. Life is not unpleasant for them. But then, the baby son is bitten by a scorpion and the doctor refuses treatment because the young couple has no money.Kino is a pearl diver and, in his search for a pearl that will help him pay the doctor, he comes upon a real treasure. This pearl is magnificent and unique and surely will bring him riches. He dreams of things he can buy and, most especially, he would like to send his son to school so he will not have to suffer the indignities from the powerful people who use the written word to keep Kino's people subservient.The story turns into one of horror though because Kino and his family now become the victim of the jealously of the town as everyone tries to cheat him out of his pearl. The baby recovers in spite of mistreatment by the doctor, but Kino kills a man and the small family must flee. Kino must murder several men. Then, there is the ultimate tragedy.All of this is told in beautiful lyrical prose. The message, of course, is clear. The pearl has meant nothing but misfortune to the family and must be thrown back into the sea.The story is painful to read but I was captured by the theme and by the wonderful language. My emotions were awakened and I was indeed fearful and sad throughout. I loved every word of it though and consider it a mini-masterpiece."},{"Title":"The Pearl","review":"I thought the book was good,but not as good as i thought it would be, because at the end when kino finally decides to get rid of the pearl they don't end up living the way they used to live,now coyotito is dead and its because of the pearl. The only thing kino wanted for his son is for him to be able to go to school and learn how to read and write.He wanted to give his wife the wedding she's always wanted. Kino wanted to do many things with the pearl, but at the end his dream turned into a disaster because behind the symbolism of the pearl was greed and evil."},{"Title":"The Pearl","review":"The Pearl is one of the most peculiar books I have ever read. It includes a lot of history and a family's bond with a touch of fantasy. The history is that the fishermen still fish for pearls, which occurred quite a while back. John Steinbeck makes the fantasy work with the history in the novel. I consider the evil pearl that causes bad things to happen to the holder the fantasy part of the novel. The songs and prayers that are supposed to be magical could also be considered fantasy. I loved the fantasy part of the novel for the way it is used.The main characters in the novel, Kino and her wife Juana are quite admirable characters. John Steinbeck describes both of them in great detail and with deep emotion. Kino is a very hard man who has a fiery temper if provoked. He also is very caring of his family and wishes the best to fall upon them. Juana on the other hand, is very gentle, but has incredible determination that could let her withstand great pain to finish whatever task is on hand. She also loves her family with all her heart and is a great mother to Coyotito.Overall, I thought that John Steinbeck wrote the story with many interesting themes and did quite a good job, but there is one major thing that I would suggest that he make clear.. At the end of the story he added semi-cliff hanger type event, which led me astray. I wasn't sure what was going on at the very end of the novel when Kino said he heard death noises coming from the cave in the mountain. This cave was where the rest of his family slept. Later on in the story, we found out that there was a death, but John didn't explain how the person died. That left me wondering what happened to the unlucky fellow.Other than the one part where the book got me confused, I feel the story was really exceptional. I loved the overall combination of history, family bonds and fantasy all in one. It gave me a great picture of what it must have been like for Kino and Juana in the story. I would recommend this book to any fantasy-lovers that don't dislike history.. I think that an element of the novel, the evil pearl causing horrible things to happen to people, would really interest these people.I myself am a fantasy-lover. I would rate this book a four out of five stars, because the overall story was incredibly good, but there were some spots in the novel, where I think that John Steinbeck could have added some more detail to enable the readers to better understand the story.Overall, I loved the book and I think that it is a book worth spending some time to read. It teaches you a lot about determination and family, and interests you with fantasy and exciting events."},{"Title":"The Pearl","review":"Like many others I had to read this book for my 8th grade English class. Being in 8th grade it had been a while since I had to read a book this short (90pgs). In my opinion, this book was a good afternoon read. The book's plot lacked content and certain ideas were not explained well enough for them to be used to full such as the \\"songs\\". The \\"songs\\" are in my understanding a presence or feeling. One example is the song of family, a feeling of belonging and love. Another example is the song of the enemy which Kino hears in his head when his child is stung by the scorpion. He hears the beating of the song in his head while he stomps the scorpion into the floor of the hut, making it pay for what it has done to his child.When I was reading the book, it seemed like it didn't flow right. The writing style seemed very strange to me. I don't know if this is how John Steinbeck writes all of his books because I have never read any of his other books. The book talks a lot about human nature and uses some very interesting metaphors. I think the main theme of this book is materialism because when Kino finds his wife holding the pearl, he kicks her in the side, and then he goes away and kills someone. The pearl in the book is a lot like the ring in The Lord of the Rings. Once you have the ring, you turn greedy and go mad with desire for it. You hurt or even kill people that try to take the ring from you, or separate you from it. Also, once you have it it's very hard to let it go. Obviously it is a bit easier for Kino to let go of the Pearl than Frodo the ring. All in all I thought the book was not unbearable although it could use a bit more content and detail."},{"Title":"The Pearl","review":"This book is especially meaningful if you have lived past middle-age, struggled to make a better life for your family, and then in the end realize the irony that the success in that struggle was also the source of destruction in your life. It is a gut-wrenching metaphor of good intentions taken to a fanatical end."},{"Title":"The Pearl","review":"It happens, you have 5 of the 6 numbers needed too win the lottery. At this point, you think to yourself: what is it that you most desire? A brand new car; a huge house; or just to spend every waking moment of your life with your family. John Steinback's novel, The Pearl is a perfect example of life's ups and downs. It is truly a masterpiece of hatred, misery, deceit and love. It demonstrates why wealth does not always deliver good fortune. Every- one has to work long and hard to succeed in areas they wish too.The sadness of the main character, Kino, can truly be felt as he struggles to succeed in his brand new life. Kino is a poor Mexican peasant living in Baja, California during the 1920's. He and his wife, Juana, live in a small community off the cost. Their life changes dramatically when a poisonous scorpion bites their son, Coyotito. Kino now must determine a way to pay for the treatment of a doctor. The family finds a way to pay for the treatment, and a way to make their lives better. There are many obstacles lying ahead, but depending on the root they take, could affect the final outcome."},{"Title":"The Pearl","review":"I read this book several years ago and didn't like it. Unfortunately it was the first Steinbeck book I read, and boy was it a bad first impression. Little plot, mundane prose, and boring characters. More recently I read \\"of Mice and Men\\" and thought it was one of the most wonderful, well thought out books I have ever read. \\"The Pearl\\", on the other hand, reads like a story Steinbeck wrote in two hours on a Saturday afternoon because he was bored. If you want to read Steinbeck, read Mice & Men. Skip the Pearl.(two stars only because it was written by Steinbeck)"},{"Title":"The Pearl","review":"After reading the Pearl by John Steinbeck, it reminded me of how greedy people can be. The pearl is an awsome story that perfectly illistrates the great lengths man will go while motivated by greed. I believe that the love of money is the root of all evil and that John Steinbeck had this in mind when he wrote the book. It brings the reader to a world within our own and shines the light on our own greed and the greed of others. After you read this book, I guarantee you'll be alot more careful and aware of the greed that surrounds us all."},{"Title":"The Pearl","review":"The Steinbeck review is the book called the Pearl. The Pearl was the first book that I have read this year. When you judge the book by the cover you might get turned off by the book. Sorry to say I did. Well the first page was so exciting. When the narirrator is naming the places were the baby sleep and his wife beside him I get a pictured of this little house. I see a 1 bedroom house, but the ones back in the day. Sort of like a cabin. With the wood floor with no carpet down. This book really take you back. Also when I continued to read the book gave me a feel on how the people were. They don't really notice you until you get something that's worth something. I seen how one Pearl had changed kino and his whole family veiw about the world. They killed for this Pearl and was on the run for this pearl and kino could not let it go. No matter what troubles it brought and no matter how hard he had to fight. Kino couldn't let his wife and son down. He wanted his son to go to school and that ment keeping the pearl and everything that came with it. End the end they just found out that they went in circles. The one thing that they really vauled was gone. All the troubles that came with the pearl ment loosing his son. Loosing his son and all his own dreams for his son."},{"Title":"The Pearl","review":"This book is not one of his best books, like the pony and Of Mice and Men. If you like these books, enjoy it!

This book used the word &quot;and&quot; so many times that I nearly went insane!

I read it back when i was still in high school and was so enchanted by it. Not so much because it was easy to read but because it takes the reader into the heart of a human and prepares it as a battle ground for moral values. It is a highly symbolic, timeless parable that would forever be proven true by our own existence."},{"Title":"The Pearl","review":"The Pearl had a great overall story. John Steinback uses alot of description in this book, and sometimes it gets a little overdone. I think this is a good book for young adults."},{"Title":"The Pearl","review":"the reason i like it is beacause i read every single book of John Steinbeck"},{"Title":"The Pearl","review":"I read this in 9th grade and I loved it! It's short, fast paced, and the author sounds like a poet in the whole thing! It has a great moral about human nature and should be read by evryone!"},{"Title":"The Pearl","review":"I, like many others, had to read this book for 10th grade English. I put it off until there was only a day left, and I can see why I did it. The summary on the back cover repeats what many other books do... don't be greedy. The book repeats that... in 90 pages!I think that I would have been more inclined to read a book that wasn't about wackos from Mexico. And the fact that all this guy heard was sining in his head... phew! I had some things in my head too while reding, but I'd get in trouble for saying them in school.Anyway, the book was OK (and I use the term broadly) as i was reading it, it did keep me interested. But I did not rush back to it in the morning nearly as fast as I rushed back to the other books I read, Harry Potter and The Phantom Menace.But, as I look back, this book left barely any impact on me and I doubt I'll remember it for the test. I don't see how they can claim that a book like this is a classic, if it has no effect on peoples' minds.Thanks. My opinion... buy the book if you have to, but if you don't stick to books tat you can relate to (and without names like Coyotito)."},{"Title":"The Pearl","review":"k so this book was okay...but id take a good mystery book any day! it has some good point but it was a bit borin...but i think this book is more for older people and not for like us teens...i mean im 14/f and sorry to say i realllyyy thought this book was borin...i readi it in 7th grade and i cant remember anything (so i kno itz outright boring) definately suggested for older people"},{"Title":"The Pearl","review":"This is without a doubt one of those books that many of us had to read while going through school. For me I had to read this for a freshman year English class. I decided that I would re-read this book, because I knew I had enjoyed it. Without a doubt it is still on of my favorite books, but is by far one of the most depressing books that I've ever read.If you don't know anything about this book, it focuses on a husband that is also a pearl diver and how his life is impacted when he finds \\"The Pearl of the World\\". If you are looking for some happy reading, feel free to get a different book. But, if you are looking for a great classic and a story of light and dark, pick this up."},{"Title":"The Pearl","review":"A really, really good book. Easy and short and powerful. Steinbeck has a wonderful way with words. He uses simply vocabulary to say so much."},{"Title":"The Pearl","review":"On scale of 1 to 5, I would rate The Pearl by John Steinbeck a 3. The first part, when Kino found the pearl was good, but I did not like the next part. When Kino, Juana, and their baby Coyotito escape the village, I did not like that their adventure in the desert and mountains was so short. I also did not like the ending of the book. Overall, the book was OK, but I would not suggest it to someone who likes adventures or someone who does not like sad books."},{"Title":"The Pearl","review":"The PearlBy: John SteinbeckKino, a father of 1 and a husband, one day woke up to a fine day until he saw a scorpion lying near his baby Coyotito. He tries to swat it away but it doesn't work and the scorpion stings Coyotito. Kino tells someone that he needs a doctor and the message gets all the way to him. The doctor declines Kino's need for help, so of course Kino went to him. Once Kino got to the doctor, he still resists helping him and then that's when Kino knew he had to somehow get the doctors attention. So, Kino, his wife, and son go out on his canoe to search for pearls. Kino dives down deep into the water and finds an enormous oyster and brings it up. He timidly opened the great shell and finds the biggest pearl in the world. Throughout the book, Kino and his family run into to many strange hardships such as beggars and emotions. I would recommend this book to people who like straight fact books that have high-level vocabulary.This book has good vocabulary. Such as: \\"The lip-like flesh writhed up then subsided\\". Also: \\" The gathering procession was solemn, for they sensed the importance of this day, and any children who showed a tendency to scuffle, to scream, to cry out, to steal hats, and rumple hair, were hissed to silence by their elders\\".This book also has disappointing parts. Especially when Kino didn't take the deal from the dealers. The dealers put up 500 pesos to 1000 pesos and Kino still didn't take the deal. He told them that he had thought he was being cheated and said that he was going to sell it at the capital. Then the dealer said that he might put up 1500 pesos but Kino still declined.This book is an all-around good book but it gets really boring at most parts. The book reads by fast though and has a decent amount of plot changes.J. Conner"},{"Title":"The Pearl","review":"This fairy tale with sharp edges is crafted beautifully. A classic."},{"Title":"The Pearl","review":"In an allegory-like novella, Steinbeck relates the tragic events of a poor family that cannot seem to escape crippling circumstances. In the story, the simple life of a young pearl diver named Kino comes to an abrupt and unexpected end when his son Coyotito is stung by a scorpion. Destitute, Kino could find no help. However, when he finds the mother of all pearls, he believed all his toils would end. Instead, the pearl attracts all sorts of human greed and avarice, and tribulations unseen. These things persistently haunt Kino and exact from him a great sacrifice. One can see a canvas of humanity's evils in this story, and a reflection on the condemnable cultural tendency in which the well-to-do turn a blind eye to the poor in suffering."},{"Title":"The Pearl","review":"This book was amazing. It shows how despicable human beings truly are. I enjoyed reading of Kino, Juana, and Coyotito. They were all so interesting that I read the book five times! Steinbeck is truly a literary magician. He describes the sun in such a way that you feel like your actually there. The colors, the clouds it is all described in amazing detail. When steinbeck describes Juana carrying the dead baby back into town in her dress i cried. When he writes it is as if you are watching a movie unfold inside of your head. This is by far my favorite book by John Steinbeck and would recommend it to anyone, anywhere, any age that reads. Even if you don't read, you should still by the book and just pretend you know how to read while listening to the book on tape. The book is that amazing. Honestly this book is really well written as are all of steinbeck's books. If you have read any other books written by Mr. John Steinbeck you will most definitely enjoy this one. Personally, I could not get enough of this book. The story literally jumps off of the page and jumps through your ear and into your brain showing you a movie of sorts. Overall this book is spectacular and you should buy it and read it."},{"Title":"The Pearl","review":"The Steinbeck review is the book called the Pearl.

The reason why I chose this boook was because it was the shortest, and I still had to read 2 other books, and because it was considered a classic. My Dad encouraged me to read it also because it is considered a &quot;classic.&quot; In my opinion, this bok was a very interesting book. When I finished it, I kept trying to figure out the whole moral and point of it. If this is one of Steinbeck's best, I think next time I will try a different author. Although some books really earn the name of being called a &quot;classic,&quot; this book was just an ordinary book. There was defintely a point and moral to it, but I might just be too young to understand it. In my opnion, more adults seem to find books of this genre more interesting then us teen-agers do. I just loked over the summary on my Summer Reading List for the Pearl it states: A fisherman finds &quot;the Pearl beyond the price,&quot; hoping to find peace and happiness, but learning that whats important can not always be bought.\\" Well, that's definately one way of looking at it. This book is not as bad as everyone makes it sound, but I definately think you should have some time to sit down and think aobut the moral of it."},{"Title":"The Pearl","review":"Steinbeck's storytelling should enthrall any intelligent reader more than long enough to get the book's moral across. It is told in a language similiar to Hemingway's &quot;The Old Man and the Sea&quot;, with a broad meaning and a great depth in a short, simple story. It may be depressing to some, but they seem to miss the entire point of the story. &quot;The Pearl&quot; is only boring to simple-minded. I had to read it in the 8th grade, and know, one year later, I realize it changed my whole perception of literature. Only &quot;A Seperate Peace&quot; has come close to the strength of Steinbeck's influence.

Steinbeck introduces us to a dirt-poor family in a sleepy Mexican fishing village and turns its world upside down, loosing a tumult of pent-up suspicions, envy, class division and greed in one fell swoop. Soon, Kino, the main character, focuses less on his immediate goal - affording medical care for his beloved son - and instead imagines how the whole world could be his oyster if only the power structure and his wife would cooperate. Revolutions have been built on rising expectations, so why not the disintegration of one family's values and happiness?In today's world, few if any of us enjoys the good fortune of coming up with a pearl like Kino's. What would we do? Daily living provides the answer: we ride the latest market high without selling, live in a city, apart from our family, to provide the level of financial support we think they need, or purchase the latest electronic headgear so we can wall ourselves off even further from a better understanding of our family and neighbors. Kino wanted the best for his son, and then his belly got hungrier. In the end, he pays a terrible price, and we sympathize for him, for we know all too well what drove him to the brink and how he should have restrained himself ... if only he could check his envy and appetite."},{"Title":"The Pearl","review":"When I was reading this book, it was inspiring, but also interesting. I liked when Kino, went diving in the ocean to find, the \\"THE PEARL OF THE WORLD\\". This book can also show you how money can turn a man into a very greedy person. It also shows how a family should stick together even if something goes horribly wrong. The Pearl also shows that you can have a Pearl or somthing else worth alot, but if you have excessive greed its worth nothing. Is it really worth losing your family, and freinds over money."},{"Title":"The Pearl","review":"I found this book to be a reminder of what really matters most in life. Many seek riches and fame, but not many seek the simple things in life such as: family, friends, education, and mostly living a content life with what you have. Kino and indigenous man of the town of La Paz finds the Pearl of the World. Funny how it may seem this man had a dream for his son and that was for him to obtain an education. An education? Well, if you can't read and write people will take advantage of you. The overall theme of the story was that greed and evil pervail in our society and that the poor will always be oppressed. This is a wonderful book and points out the important things in life."},{"Title":"The Pearl","review":"A short, great story of a pearl diver and his small family. He lived a simple, contented, and arguably rich life. Monetarily he was poor. He finds The Pearl of the World, and life changes. There are many themes in play - Family and community relationships, greed, poverty, hope, faith, human violence, desparation and so on. Where the darkside of human nature is concerned, I found this book to be strongly in the vein of Upton Sinclair's, \\"The Jungle\\" (the \\"pearl\\" in that story was the Amercan Dream/paycheck). There is no shortage of scoundrels. The professionals, businessmen, clergy and even the beggars are pretentious and/or crooks that exploit the laboring class (in this case, the pearl divers). All this progresses under the pen of Steinbeck who provides nonstop treats with word pictures and perfect phrases, such as describing the manipulative beggars that dwelt in the shadow of the cathedral as, \\". . . endless searchers after perfect knowledge of their fellow men\\", so as to better manipulate. One of the subtilties I enjoyed was noting Kino's (the main protagonist's) treatment of his loyal dog as a barometer of his spirit. Not necessarily a happy ending, but a great parable. So much for playing the lottery . . . ."},{"Title":"The Pearl","review":"\\"The Pearl,\\" written by John Steinbeck, is about a poor family of three who live off the luck of the gods by finding treasures at the bottom of the ocean. One day Kino and his girlfriend Juana go Pearl diving. Kino discovers a massive pearl and plans on selling it to meet all of their dreams. They go through a series of events trying to sell the pearl.Throughout the novel, whenever Kino has powerful feelings or instincts, he hears a song in his head that represents that feeling. When he is happy for his family and they are doing well, he hears, \\"The Song of His Family. Whenever Kino senses cruelty, he hears, \\"The Song of Evil. These songs are evidence to how Kino's culture illustrated. Kino has a lot of pride in his culture.John Steinbeck wrote this novel describing Kino's character to turn around. Kino was such a happy man and loved his family very much. Even though he wanted to be rich; He wanted to give his infant son a great life, he wanted to get married to Juana, and he wanted to live happily ever after. But this man changed once he got \\"The Pearl\\" into his hands. At first he was talking about their dreams coming true and their life was going to turn around. But he got over excited and he developed greed. He didn't care about anyone else but himself. His Greediness soon turned into a destructive force. He murdered people to sell his pearl for the desire of money. This behavior of Kino's led violently to Juana and the death of his son. He lost everything he planned and he had to make the decision to either let go of the pearl or to keep it and end up hated by Juana and risking both of their lives. Kino decided to throw the pearl back into the Ocean and to start over.The narrator tells Kino's story to teach a moral lesson and he treats Kino above all as a warning sign. At the same time, however, the narrator seems to see Kino as a sort of tragic hero and is moved by the human weakness Kino's actions reveal. The narrator often shows a certain respect for Kino's reach to make true of his dreams-even while recognizing the mistakes Kino makes and respect his final breakdown.This novel was short but intense. It was a novel that you couldn't put down. Once you've started, you won't want to stop until you've finished!"},{"Title":"The Pearl","review":"The Pearl is a fable of fortune. It's origins date back to biblical days. Steinbeck's original stories are so amazing that I was unable to imagine how well he would do a rewrite. I once read somewhere that great stories are perfected by repetition. Each new teller ads a piece of themself. Finding a retold story where John Steinbeck added a piece of himself was better than finding... well... a pearl.The story is engaging and heartbreaking. The pace is quick and time I spent reading it flew by.I would recommend, though, buying this book used if you can find it. I ended up paying $16 for my copy and read it in three hours. Though I would gladly pay to read Steinbeck, $5.33/hour is a little steep."},{"Title":"The Pearl","review":"In The Pearl, John Steinbeck keeps the story very short. He doesn't waste words with filler, yet he provides thrilling images, complete details included. The concise, almost perfect word choices keeps the reader hanging on every word, no matter how near or far the plot is from the climax.The short-story, full of twists, turns, and heart-stopping suspense, is about a three-member family led by a poor pearl diver, Kino, in a Mexican community. After the young couple's baby child is bitten by a poisonous scorpion, the two do whatever they can to save the infant's life. A tale of struggle, surprises, and social discrimination takes the reader through the changing lives of this Mexican family. A great, easy read."},{"Title":"The Pearl","review":"The Pearl is one of those books that nearly anyone can relate to. Why? Because it's timeless. It doesn't matter so much that it's whole storyline is set centuries ago in a Spanish-run colony near the Gulf of Mexico, because even if you've never been there, even if you know nothing of the timeframe in which it is set, you can still comprehend Steinbeck's message. It is a message that is universal and everlasting: human knowledge of good vs. evil. Living beings have been contemplating that knowledge since the beginning of time, ever since Adam and Eve took their first bites of the forbidden fruit. Kino and Juana (our protagonists) have likewise found a \\"forbidden\\" pearl. They prayed to find it to save their son, Coyotito, who was in dire need of the care of an expensive doctor. They could not imagine, however, the damage it would do to their family, to their reputations, to their hearts. All the uproar that follows is mainly rooted in greed, and thus fundamentally, in evil.Anyone who's ever read Steinbeck knows all about his lavish use of figurative language and description. In The Pearl, Kino makes reference to \\"The Song of the Family\\", and when outside forces disturb that peace, \\"The Song of Evil\\". This allusion to Song in The Pearl is an innovative use of imagery, just the kind of figurative language that Steinbeck loves to use. Music floats and sways us: it carries our emotions, our hopes and desires, our fears. Through his songs, Kino is laid bare to us. We hear everything he feels, everything he says in his heart. It's a great alternative when you're writing about people who practically never talk. The nature portrayed in the songs remains constant throughout the book, indicating all of the most dramatic moments.I would strongly recommend this book to any high school student preparing for their English Regents or other English-related tests and/or contests. It's definitely what one might call \\"heavy reading material\\" (and chock-full of messages that the Regents generally likes to quiz folks on), so if you're looking for something to read while you're on vacation at the beach, you may want to pick something else (particularly since the beach would might be a disturbing place to read this, considering the content of the book)!"},{"Title":"The Pearl","review":"Based on a Mexican folk tale, The Pearl explores the secrets of man's nature, the darkest depths of evil, and the luminous possibilities of love. Kino and his wife, Juana, are a family that live in a poor village by the sea. The men in the village dive for pearls and live off the sea for their means of support. Kino and his wife live in a brush hut with dirt floors. They have to use fire as a source of light inside their hut. They don't have beds, instead they sleep on mats made out of straw, and for food they eat corn cakes and beans. Their baby sleeps in a box that hangs from the ceiling. Kino's dream, like all the other pearl divers in the village, is to find the ultimate pearl. Then on a day like any other, Kino emerges from the sea with a pearl as large as a sea gull's egg. Kino thought his life would change in a good way after he found the big pearl. He thought he would get good luck and money for the rest of his life.I can relate to Juana in this story because I had a lucky penny that was good luck for a little while. I used to play this game with my friend when I was little. I would always take the penny with me when I would play the game because it helped me win. Then one day it started to bring me bad luck because I started losing all the games we played that day. Juana sees that the pearl is bad luck and knows that they need to put it back into the sea.I liked The Pearl because it has a lot of detail on how they lived and how the huts were made. It is a good book and also has a good moral and lesson. It kept me wondering what was going to happen next. The author did a good job describing Kino and Juana and how their life style was. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes adventure."},{"Title":"The Pearl","review":"the pearl by John Steinbeck took place in a small village in Baja California, Mexico. A fisherman lived wiht his wife Juana and his son Coyotito in this small village La Paz. The towns people called him Kino. One day, Kino heard the song of evil because his son got bitten by the scorpon. He needed money to pay the doctor. So, he tried to find the pearl. The news of kino's great find spread through the down. Kino found the pearl of the world. Then what happened to his family? How does this pearl influence their future? Can this pearl really help his family to solve their porblem? You will only find outif you read this book.I love this book. The book is great as well. It is easy to read and I learned a lot of words. And also in this book I learned something. Sometimes you have no choice, like feeling trapped. But you must face the problem. Then you would be grown up. I think you would like this book if you read it."},{"Title":"The Pearl","review":"Most people born and raised in America cannot even imagine the depths of poverty that most of the rest of the world are forced to live with. This story illuminates this fact, as we enter the world of Kino, a pearl diver and occasional fisherman, his wife Juana, and their baby son, Coyotito. All they have is a grass shack house, a few clay cooking utensils, and their prize possession, Kino's boat, inherited from his father and grandfather. The boat is the family's livelihood, providing the means to put a meal on the table and to provide a few pesos for store bought goods by selling the small pearls Kino is able to find.But Kino and his family, far from being depressed or unhappy, have a great treasure, the love they have for each other and their satisfaction with life as it is, with few disturbing dreams of greater things. But their quiet, routine life is turned upside down the day that Kino finds a Great Pearl. Suddenly Kino can dream of better things: a rifle for himself, school for his son so he will be able to read and tell what is really in the books, a real house. But dreams can be deadly things. Dreams lead to desire, and desire to greed, and greed to violence.What happens to Kino and family from this point on is not a pretty story. Now we see that underneath the quiet, idyllic seeming small town and its inhabitants lie the seeds of cheating, betrayal, collusion, fear, and murder. And we see the gradual loss of Kino's real treasures. By the end of the book, events have reached the level of real tragedy, and you, along with Kino, are liable to end up in a state of emotional exhaustion.Steinbeck's prose for this book matches his characters and situation very well, a very minimalist sentence structure and set of speech patterns. As a parable, the story has a strong moralistic point, but Steinbeck does not overdrive his thematic message, but lets his story speak for itself. One of Steinbeck's great strengths was his ability to capture on paper the characters he saw around him, and this book is a showcase for that talent. The characters of Kino and Juana are exquisitely drawn, real people you can relate to even though their lifestyles may be very far from your own. And because they are real people, it is very hard not to get drawn into their lives, where their dreams and their pains very readily become your own.This may not be Steinbeck's greatest book, as it is too short and with too limited a focus to compare to something like his Grapes of Wrath. But within its own territory, there are very few other pieces of literature that are even half as good."},{"Title":"The Pearl","review":"Referring to this novella, as a variant is in no way meant to detract from the work, or suggest that it is lacking in originality. The two other works Steinbeck's book \\"The Pearl\\" is sometimes linked to, add to the reading experience, and reinforce the transcendence of its message.\\"The Pearl Of Great Price\\" from a parable in the Gospel of Matthew, attempts to teach with the same jewel from the sea. Mr. Steinbeck was also a great reader of medieval texts, and one of these morality plays was in the form of a poem written in the 14th Century, entitled \\"Pearl\\" although the Author is unknown. These three works are separated by millennia, but their commentary on the human condition is consistent.Mr. Steinbeck wrote this after his triumph \\"The Grapes Of Wrath\\". The work was a monumental bestseller, it brought The Pulitzer Prize to the Author, and was rapidly made into a movie that is a classic in it's own right. Superficially one could argue Mr. Steinbeck achieved all that a writer might conceivably want, fame, fortune, and critical recognition.Unfortunately, like his work, often when you feel something good is about to happen, a positive change for his characters that have struggled, and fought to survive, he slams you face down on bedrock's reality. The acclaim for his work brought him great discomfort as well. He was labeled a socialist, a communist, an agitator, and became the focus of FBI attention, and not because they liked his book. He viewed and detested the treatment the racism toward Mexicans in Southern California, and witnessed the so-called \\"Zoot Suit Riots\\" that resulted.\\"The Pearl\\" might be called the lottery if it was written today. The ticket that vaults a person from the troubles of day-to-day life, and is thought to leave them \\"set for life\\" all too often is a quick financial ride up and a crash back down.Sudden wealth when thrust upon a person, changes the person, and everyone around them. All their reference points, their friends, and all that their lives have not prepared them for, surround, threaten, and many times destroy them.This book is very brief, but it communicates as much as a novel 10 times its length. The ending is brilliant, tragic, and redemptive. It is a story that few could write, and even fewer could make work. The emotional scenes he brings the reader to are at times almost violent in there reading. And then with a turn of phrase he can change the mood time and time again.A wonderful novella from an Author known for sweeping sagas."},{"Title":"The Pearl","review":"I suppose the fact that I had to read this book for school has sort of tainted my view of it. After spending at least a month disecting what the pearl represented and coming up with way too many questions about Juana, Kino and Coyotito, I pretty much had enough. In fact, I have a friend who screams at the mention of this book, if that is any indicator. Basically, this story talks about a pearl diver named Kino who finds a pearl, which ends up destroying his life. If you're looking for a feel good book, this isn't it. There are a lot of not-so-subtly disguised messages about wealth and it's power to corrupt. In fact, the whole book is practically one big symbolic thing. It is actually pretty interesting to see the underlying messages, because there are so many that once you start looking more and more just jump out at you. I give this book 3 stars because I am confident that, had I read this book on my own, I would have enjoyed it much more and not felt as if I had absolutely analyzed it to death. While it isn't the best book I've ever read, it still does deserve recognition, and if you like symbolism, this is your book."},{"Title":"The Pearl","review":"The magic of this book is that not a word is wasted and every sentence is loaded with meaning. I found it very like Hemingway's &quot;The Old Man and the Sea&quot; in its simplicity and its evocation of imagery. Steinbeck tells of a fishing family that think all their dreams have been answered when they find a valuable pearl. They believe that the status of owning the pearl will bring them riches and glory but soon find that it will only bring them grief. There are many dualities in this text; good vs evil, rich vs poor, family vs wealth, friend vs foe, dreams vs reality, and so on. The simplicity of this tale gives it a universal meaning. It also serves to remind the reader that wealth and status cannot buy happiness. After reading this text one must ask oneself what they would do if they found their pearl. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"The Pearl","review":"When Kino and his wife, Juana, find an enormous pearl in the Gulf Oyster Bed, they expect great fortune, wealth, security, honor, and a education for their son, Coyotito. Ironically, this wondrously beautiful pearl brought everything but good. Whoever touched, saw, or heard of it was immediately, and sometimes subconsciously corrupted by its size, beauty and possibilities that it would bring. Many a night, Kino's meek brush house was broken into and his life was attempted to be killed. Finally, his house was destroyed, his boat was punctured and he was forced to flee with his wife and child. Stalked by trained \\"people hunters\\"driven up a mountain. With only one thing left to do to preserve the pearl, Kino killed them. Before Kino successfully destroyed them, a shot was fired at Coyotito and he was killed. I thought that the Pearl by John Steinbeck was a wonderful novel. He described everything so wonderfully that I could picture it in my head. I loved how he put the feelings of the family, the pearl and evil into song. This book was a short novel; this was another trait that I liked. Steinbeck put this exiting, suspenseful, story into a short number of pages making it easier to read. This book was not only enjoyable to read, but educational. I learned how the Indians of Central America were oppressed by the Spanish. They were treated as animals and forced to do manual labor. I have no criticisms for this book. It was a genuine masterpiece!"},{"Title":"The Pearl","review":"John Steinbeck has written a novel with a powerful message; sometimes, things are best just the way they are.The story, based on a Mexican folk tale, centers on Kino, Juana, and their baby son Coyotito. Kino is a poor fisherman/pearl diver, relying on his canoe which was passed on from his grandfather down to him. His family lives in a small grass shack and they have very few possessions, but they have each other and they are happy. However, one day, baby Coyotito is bitten by a scorpion which made its way into his crib. Immediately, the poison begins to take hold, despite Juana's frantic efforts to suck the poison out of the baby. Desperate for their baby, Kino and Juana take him into town to see the doctor.However, once in town, they are informed that the doctor is out on another visit, when in reality, he doesn't want to see Kino's family at all. Disheartened, Kino heads for his canoe.Once out on the water, he goes through his regular routine of gathering clams and searching for pearls. But this dive turns out to be like no other Kini has ever experienced, for when he opens one of the clams, he sees the biggest pearl he's ever seen; The Pearl of the World. It is as large as a seagull's egg, and as perfect as the moon. Kino sees the immediate end to all of his problems, for with this pearl, he will have wealth beyond his wildest dreams: or will he?Almost immediately, things begin to change in Kino's life. He begins to watch people a little more closely, fearing that they may try to steal his pearl. He dreams of owning new clothes, a new rifle, and having his son attend school someday.He decides to venture into town to sell the pearl and collect his fortune. But, what he finds out there is not what he expected. The buyers tell him that the pearl is too large and because it is so large, it is not worth much money. He is offered much less money than he expected. Enraged, Kino and Juana head back to their house, and he buries the pearl in the dirt floor. But, during the night, someone sets his house on fire. Everything is quickly consumed, leaving only a few items. Kino then goes to check on his canoe, but he finds that someone has punched a hole in the bottom, rendering it useless.Determined to get what he thinks the pearl is worth, the family decides to head to the capitol and sell the pearl there. But, Kino soon realizes that they are not alone; three trackers are following them. Kino tries to stay ahead of the trackers as they head off into the mountains. Will Kino succeed in selling his treasured pearl, or will the trackers catch up to them?This is an excellent book, and it carries an important message; sometimes, things are better off the way they are rather than changing them. Kino was a humble and hard-working young man trying to raise his family the best he could, but once he found the pearl, everything about him changed. He became suspicious, greedy, and disrespectful to Juana. Granted, his intentions were good, but his actions were not. In the end, Kino ends up losing two precious things.I highly recommend this classic work by John Steinbeck. Its message is clear; sometimes, things are best just the way they are."},{"Title":"The Pearl","review":"This short novel by Steinbeck, who won the 1962 Nobel Prize in Literature, is a parable. And readers can get a number of insights into their own lives from reading this short tale. The story is centered in the town of La Paz in the southern portion of the Baja peninsula. The novel is focused on a poor Mexican-Indian fisherman and pearl diver named Kino. Even though he is poor, he and his wife, Juana, and their baby son, Coyotito, are happy. But, on one of his dives, he discovers a great pearl, \\"The Pearl of the World,\\" and he thinks that all his problems are solved: he and his wife can finally get married in a church, he can get a new rifle, his son can get treatment for his scorpion bite from the unscrupulous doctor of the town, and his son can go to school to learn to read and write. But the pearl only brings him and his family grief and pain. It doesn't bring them happiness."},{"Title":"The Pearl","review":"I am almost surprised to find THE PEARL published as a book in its own right. While I suppose that we can correctly classify it as a novella, its brevity suggests that one would expect to find it in a collection of Steinbeck's short stories rather than as an independent publication. Both the length and the straight-forward prose make the story a fast read, but its powerful imagery and strong message also make it a valuable and important read.Taken as a whole, THE PEARL is the most wonderful example of irony that one can find. Finding the one object whose value, when sold, would raise Kino's family from its abject poverty and subsistence living should be cause for rejoicing, but the Fates are fickle and care nothing for what \\"should\\" happen to men. Rather than saving the family, the great value of Kino's find results in its utter destruction. Under the influence of what should have been the most fortuitous discovery in the lifetime of any pearl-diver, Kino is metamorphosed by forces beyond his power to comprehend, much less control, into a striker of women, a killer of men, a fugitive, and, we are left to assume, an executed criminal. His son is dead, and his wife has already said that she cannot live without a man, so her future destruction is also assured.Within the overall framework of this huge irony are smaller ironies. Kino's son is named Coyotito, which, to me, suggests \\"Little Coyote.\\" The tracker whose rifle bullet ends Coyotito's tiny life thinks that he is shooting at a coyote pup in the dark.Sharing the stage with life's ironies, both great and small, are many observations on the nature of man, and none of them is positive. The local pearl buyers are all secretly employed by the same uber-buyer, and their apparent competitive bidding is a sham. The doctor, his eye on a hefty fee, creates the appearance of illness in Coyotito, whom he then \\"cures.\\" Honest townsmen, or perhaps neighbors, skulk in the night to attack Kino and rob him of his treasure. The local priest displays his hypocrisy by thinking more of the fee his church will receive for baptizing Coyotito and for marrying Kino and Juana than of any spiritual benefit to the family. The vice of avarice overwhelms any inherent goodness that may otherwise exist in the townsmen, and their malicious natures are loosed by their greed.At length, the treasure is returned to the sea that spawned it, but the damage has been done. Is man's nature so perverse, so readily sinful that he cannot control good fortune? Is man's destiny so dark and so doomed that the Fates can effortlessly turn good fortune to bad? THE PEARL affords the reader a clear and sharp view into the murky and sordid depths of man's soul and offers no promise of redemption from the universe. This---his treatment of his fellow man-is mankind's \\"original sin\\" and it is most thoroughly destructive.Depressing THE PEARL may be, but it offers the reader valuable and all-too-often accurate insight into the mind and soul of his neighbor. For that, it is truly deserving of being read."},{"Title":"The Pearl","review":"This is another one of those books I doubt I would have come into contact with, were it not for public high school. And while that doesn't distress me, I'm not sorry that I read it. Compared to the rest of Steinbeck's work, this brief novella seems stylistically austere, and that makes it a much easier quick-read.WARNING --PLOT SPOILER--- (except that, as in a great many classics, the plot doesn't matter so much as the writing and the observations and the methods that get you through it).What I recall is this: Steinbeck delivers a sweeping observation of the process by which wealth will inevitably corrupt. When Kino, a fisherman in the small village of La Plata, finds an enormous pearl, his life is irrevocably changed. The village in which he lives begins to transform, and along with his wife Juana and baby son, Coyotito, Kino begins to fear the intentions of the people around him. In the end, as the family is forced to flee the village, pursued by hired assassins, the baby Coyotito is killed. This horrible turn of events forces Kino to reexamine the situation in which the pearl has placed him, and the way in which it has corrupted his values, his community, and his life. Condemning the stone which has destroyed his life, he hurls it into the sea and renounces the wealth which it might offer him. And in this movement, Steinbeck seems to be offering a personal judgment on the importance of wealth: whatever else money may bring, it will never bring peaceful happiness. While this work was not long, or studied with the depth it probably deserved in class, I personally found it both well-written and moving.There's something to be said for an author who can make his point so clearly in such a short novel without ever actually stating it, and Steinbeck has pulled it off beautifully."},{"Title":"The Pearl","review":"Guess what everyone...Teens like Steinbeck. Thank you FTP (who gave a great review and I am not surprised you liked the book in only &quot;8th grade&quot;). I am 16 years old and have read all of Steinbeck's novels -- with the exception of some non-fiction -- and have enjoyed the richness, the quality, and the profound details of real human beings. Those of you who are stereotyping my generation are probabley reading crap like Grisham and Steel right now. The Pearl is not my favorite Steinbeck book, but it is very good in showing a light theme within the evil of greed. I felt that it was well worth my three hours of reading and was not a waste of time in anyway. If you have never read The Pearl, I would suggest reading Of Mice and Men or The Red Pony, then progress onto The Pearl.One thing about The Pearl is, is that it proves Steinbeck's understanding for culture and socitey and the human being within it, which is how he earned the Noble Prize. It is a simple allegory that can easily identify with America right now, denoting to the fact that American's are greedy and want praise -- and feel as if they can not act as one in society without it. Norman Mailer follows this philosophy within his novels (The Executioner's Song &amp; Tough Guys Don't Dance) by themes of the following nature. It should be able to teach you a harsh lesson about what can happen if you do not manage yourself mentally and physically when coming of sudden wealth. For those who have read the novel, note how Kino was attacted and encountered a mysterious person whom plotted attempted murder, and even how much the towns people respected him even more after the discovery of the &quot;Pearl of the World.&quot; If you are planning to read this novel, pay close attention to the social description of the doctors actions in the first, and I believe third chapter, denoting to the time period when Kino's son was on the brink of death and how the doctor lied and refused to treat them, speaking pompously: &quot;...I am not a veterinarian!&quot; Then observe what happens after the pearl is found.Sorry for my long-winded triangle of a review...Read the book with respect...you just might like it...And any comments...my e-mail address is on the top and I would Love to hear from you.ThanksHappen..."},{"Title":"The Pearl","review":"A tragic ending for an almost to good-to-be true storyIt happens, you have 5 of the 6 numbers needed too win the lottery.

John Steinback's novel, The Pearl is a perfect example of life's ups and downs. It is truly a masterpiece of hatred, misery, deceit and love. It demonstrates why wealth does not always deliver good fortune.

When I read it that is not what I thought at all. John Steinbeck wasn't trying to make you happy and have the book have a Hollywood ending. Steinbeck was trying to make a point. If you can't handle reality then I wouldn't recommend this book to you.Something else you think about when you read this book is the style of it. Steinbeck uses a lot of descriptions and a lot of simililies. When you finish the book if you think back to what you remeber you'll see you have remembered some powerful stuff. There are sentences that stick to you like gum to the bottom of your shoe.The reason I liked this book so much is because it has a great affect on you. You learn a lot of lessons. You might not the ending or the plot but what you learn from it it's worth it. That is why I recommend this book to you."},{"Title":"The Pearl","review":"The Pearl was an O.K. book. I thought that it had a few exciting scenes but a lot of it was fairly dull. One of the main reasons I did not like it was because it was too realistic. What I mean by this is that not everything in life is interesting. John Steinback may have wanted the book to be like that, but books that have such little dialogue and suspense do not fit into the category of books I like. Although it is boring in parts, The Pearl does have some lines that will stick in your mind when you finish reading. For instance one of the quotes from the book that I seem to remember is \\"He hissed at her like a snake.\\" I like this simile because it really gives you an idea of how it would feel like to be Juana (the wife) seeing Kino (the man who found the pearl) standing over you. Altogether The Pearl is a book that people would read for a quick story or an assignment."},{"Title":"The Pearl","review":"(...)The Pearl is an amazing piece of literature but the plot is rather dull. If you are looking for exciting action this book is not for you. On the other hand, if you are looking for a magnificent writing this book is perfect.Kino, his wife Juana and their baby son Coyotito live in Mexico. To survive, Kino works as a pearl diver along with several others from his village. Every day, he paddles out in his canoe and dives for pearls. Things were the same day after day until, one day, when Kino discovered The Pearl of the World.The Pearl was perfect, as large as an eagle egg and perfectly round. No one, especially Kino, suspected how much evil the pearl would bring.Problem after problem befalls Kino until he and Juana are forced to flee. They head for the capital and are followed by trackers. The ending is truly spectacular and somewhat unexpected.I recommend this book for people who are looking for amazing writing, but if you're seeking the plot this book is not the best. Feel free to read The Pearl though for me I've read better books by John Steinbeck"},{"Title":"The Pearl","review":"Overall, i tought The Pearl was a very interesting book.

Thank you for prompt delivery."},{"Title":"The Pearl","review":"I have recently read \\"The Pearl\\" and let me say that this one of the most powerfully realistic books I've read in a long time. We follow a man who has found a unbelievable treasure that will lead him and his family in a path of danger. In Steinbeck's novella, the story takes place in the small village of La Pez where we find Kino and his wife Juana and their infant child Coyotito.The story starts when Coyotito is attacked by a scorpion and Juana demands to see a doctor immediately. When they find a doctor but refuses to help them because them are poor they will stop at nothing to save their child. Later when Lino fishes in the sea with his family he unexpectedly find a pearl that's big as a seagull's egg and believes it's a true treasure. Then he dreams of a bright future for him and his family until his treasure starts to change him and how the pearl will change his life in a threatening journey.Despite being a mere 90 pages, \\"The Pearl\\" is filled with heart-pounding nail-biting and jaw-dropping drama. The story is so realistic that you feel like you're really there and the nature of the characters will just grab you right away. By the end I felt a bit speechless at the ending and it will surprise readers but \\"The Pearl\\" is one book I'll never forget, and one that Steinbeck readers should discover (A)."},{"Title":"The Pearl","review":"This was an ok book. Although I do admit it was very well written, had good points about human nature and greed, I didn't like it. My 8th grade ELA class had to read this book and do a character analysis on the protagonist,Kino.The book is set in La Pas, Mexico, a fairly poor town if you are poor, when the baby, Coyotito is stung by a scorpion, Kino and his wife, Juana have no means by which to pay the local doctor except eight small pearls. When that is not enough, Kino sets out to find a large pearl. He ends up finding \\"The pearl of the world.\\" The doctor treats Coyotito and the family agrees to pay the doctor back. The next day Kino, his wife and child, and the rest of the town go to the pearl dealership. When Kino cannot get a high enough price, he starts to become corrupted and storms off, being told it was a \\"novelty\\" and that it was basically \\"worthless.\\" That night, a citizen of La Pas tries to steal the pearl from Kino, and Kino ends up committng manslaughter. He and his family seek refuge at his brother Jaun Tomas' house and plan to leave for the capital city. During their journey, they end up hiding in a cave and Kino jumps on a guard who ends up killing Coyotito. Kino ends up killing all three guards and going back to La Pas with Juana to throw the pearl back into the sea from which the discovered it.Although this book easiest questions about humanity and greed, it is written in a way that to me, just didn't make much since. Why kill the innocent baby instead of the corrupt, accountable adult? This book also had some good points: Be greatful for what you do have, even if it's not much; Do not let material things corrupt you and pull your family and your community apart; Greed is a destructive force.Altogether, for a remade folktale, this was actually an ok book. Although, as I have mentioned in the title I would not have read it if I hadn't of been forced to. The only good things that came out of it were an A+ on the character analysis and a book review for my advanced reading class. :("},{"Title":"The Pearl","review":"Steinbeck is reputed to be a master of short form fiction, and in this simple book of the struggles of a small family whose patriarch has found a pearl of great worth, Steinbeck proves it. Give this little beauty a try."},{"Title":"The Pearl","review":"The Pearl by John Steinbeck is an unforgettable tale of good vs. evil. Kino a very poor Mexican pearl diver who finds the Pearl of the World, which is a pearl beyond price. He tells all of the wonderful things his new found wealth is going to bring to him and his family. He tells of all the expectations of happiness that the riches of the pearl will bring. He believes he is the luckiest man in the world until, the evil spirit of mankind prove that it is not luck at all, but a curse. Instead of bringing fortune and happiness it brings fear, dispare and heartache. Him and his family must flee to safety when they are being tracked by assassins that want to steal the pearl and will stop at nothing to get it.This is great piece of literature that is beautifully written. This Steinbeck classic proves wealth does not bring happiness and can not replace unconditional love of ones family. This story has a very strong and obvious moral message that speaks volumes. I give this book five stars out of five and highly recommend it."},{"Title":"The Pearl","review":"Kino and his wife Juana lived in a house made of brush. They had a little baby named Coyotito. Kino thought his wife was so fragile and kind, but she was a tough cookie. When Coyotito got bit by a spider, she sucked the wound and took care of him. He still needed a doctor though. Kino goes out to find a big pearl so they will have enough money to take Coyotito to the doctor. He ties a rock to himself and gets lowered into the sea. He then looks for the pearls. He ends up finding a huge pearl and thinks it is the answer to all his prayers.On thing I wanted to point out in this book is that Kino and his wife didn't feel the need to speak if it was just out of habit. If he just sighed--that was said to be their conversation. They were just fine with that. I bring this up because it reminded me of Tuesday's night's bible study. We were talking about how women like to talk and men like silence. We always think that we have to talk on long trips and things, but I it seems that men are just as happy as can be if you just be quiet.This is not the normal kind of book that I would pick out to read. I am a middle school secretary, and the Principal asked if I would read this book since one of the classes will be reading it and because he knows that I love reading. I can see why they are reading this book, and I would recommend it to others for sure. It has an awesome message. When he got the pearl it reminded me of someone winning the lottery. Everybody finds out that he has this huge pearl and they are nice to him all of a sudden, even the doctor who wouldn't treat his son because they had no money all of a sudden claims that he is his patient. I didn't expect the ending to turn out the way it did either.Here is a great quote from the book:It is not good to want a thing too much. It sometimes drives the luck away. You must want it just enough, and you must be very tactful with God or the gods. - p24CherylBlack Diamond's Book Reviews"},{"Title":"The Pearl","review":"READ THIS 20 YEARS AGO---JUST---RE-READ IT AGAIN.SCOUNDRELS---THE WHOLE BOOK IS LOADED WITH THEM---KINO INCLUDED.

It's about a small family which loves each other very much and is satisfied with their poor living style. However, not for long they become victims of cheating, betrayal, and murder. In The Pearl Steinbeck writes in a very minimalist sentence structure. The story has a strong moralistic point but Steinbeck doesn't ruin the story by telling the readers what the thematic message is, but allows the story to speak for itself. He was able to capture the characteristics of real Mexican people and created characters like them. As characters were like real people, even though the life styles of the characters were different from your own, it is easy to relate their pain yours. This book was very brief, but it was able to send the message out to the reader as much as a longer novel. The Pearl is definitely a book I would recommend to anyone, as it is an easy book to relate to one's life."},{"Title":"The Pearl","review":"Kino and his family suffer like many Amerindians at the hands of the Spanish Mexican majority.

So, please give it another chance. Now, on to the review.This short parable is about a poor pearl diver, Kino, and his wife and child, Juana and Coyotito (Ko-yo-TEE-to), respectively, who live in a small village in Mexico. They live a simple, normal life with a methodical daily routine, and although their lives are not glamorous, they are content, until, one day, their child is stung by a scorpion. They believe that they require the doctor's assistance, but the doctor will not see them since they have no money (although the irony is that they don't even need the doctor; Juana treated Coyotito's wound just by sucking the poison out). It appears that their content life will be shattered until Kino finds \\"The Pearl of the World.\\" However, the Pearl is a ticket to a better life, and suddenly everyone covets for it. Several of Kino's neighbors even attack him in the middle of the night in an attempt to get the pearl. Kino no longer trusts anyone, not even his wife, Juana, and he becomes consumed with greed. He eventually becomes so overtaken by evil that he even kills a man! All the while, Juana warned him of the Pearl's corrupt nature, but he never listened to her. The awful downward spiral continues and Kino eventually loses someone very dear to him. It's a timeless tale about greed and how a person's avarice can lead to his downfall.On a side note, I thought that the characters were very interesting. Normally in short stories characters are very flat, but I thought both Kino and Juana were very developed. Kino seemed to represent \\"Man,\\" and Juana, \\"Woman.\\" Kino is a strong, hardworking and noble provider who is at times too stubborn. Juana is a kind and motherly caretaker who's only downfall was that she tried too hard to please her husband. Of course, this could just be because of the location or time period it was written, but this book made me think a little bit about gender roles as well.I first read this in seventh grade, and reread it a year later since it was required for school. In seventh grade, I was just starting to read classic literature and although I liked this book, it didn't stand out very much to me. But now, reading it again, I can truly appreciate Steinbeck's lovely prose and knack for imagery. I would definitely recommend this to anyone, regardless of age or gender. It's simple story of family, love, and greed can touch anyone."},{"Title":"The Pearl","review":"One morning, Kino and his wife Juana were eating breakfast, as a small movement caught their eye. It was a scorpion moving down a rope that held their son's box. Coyotito, their baby infant, inside the box, saw the scorpion and began to laugh and reach his hand up toward it. When Kino was almost in reach of the box and the scorpion Coyotito jerked the rope and the scorpion fell. Kino tried to catch it, but was too late. It fell onto the baby's shoulders and struck. Kino then grabbed it, threw it to the ground, and smashed it. Juana immediately went to suck the poison out of the baby's shoulder. So begins the journey of The Pearl.The Pearl, by John Steinbeck, is a parable novel. The story takes place in the late nineteenth or early twentieth century, in a Mexican Coastal Village named La Paz, which is most likely on the Baja Peninsula. The story is about a poor Mexican family, whose son gets stung by a scorpion and needs medical attention. However, because they are poor and have no money to their name, the doctor will not treat their son. Therefore, Kino and Juana take Kino's grandfathers canoe that had been passed down to Kino, out to go pearl diving. They find a great pearl, a pearl that has never been seen before. Kino shouts when he find this great pearl, which makes everyone around him aware that he has found this magnificent pearl.Kino believes that this pearl has brought him great luck and that because of it, he will own a rifle, and Coyotito will go to school and learn. Meanwhile, the whole village watches as he makes these statements, or plans. Soon, the doctor arrives and treats Coyotito, and says that he will return in an hour; when every leaves, Kino buries the pearl in a corner inside his house. When the doctor returns, he gives Coyotito a potion to make him strop vomiting. The doctor asks about the pearl and Kino glances where he buried it. Later that night, Kino and Juana are awakened by someone who is inside their house. It was someone trying to steal the pearl. However, Kino had moved it to a new hole under his sleeping mat. Kino stabbed the attacker, but the attacker got away.Kino realizes he must sell the pearl the next day. However, the pearl buyers try to cheat him and don't offer anything close to what Kino believes is the value. He turns down all of the offers and goes away. The next night Kino wakes up as his wife steals the pearl and goes down to the beach to throw it into the sea. Just before she releases the pearl, Kino tackles her. He then beats her and returns to their house. However, on his way back a group of men try to steal the pearl. Kino manages to kill one man and the others run off. He had dropped the pearl during the fight. Juana finds the pearl and Kino on the ground with the dead man next to him. She tells Kino that he will be called a murderer and that they must leave. He agrees, but little does he know that vandals had put a hole in his canoe. As Kino heads back to his house, he finds it up in smoke. Kino, Juana and Coyotito go to Kino's brother's house, where they hide for the day.At night, Kino, Juana, and Coyotito begin their journey; their destination is the capital. They travel north, being careful about their tracks. As the sun begins to rise, they find a \\"covert shelter\\" by the side of the road. Juana and Kino take short naps. As Kino is taking his nap, he suddenly awakens. He leaves the shelter and discovers that three trackers are following them looking for the pearl. Kino decides to go up the mountain in an attempt to lead the trackers in another direction by making false trails. Kino, Juana, and Coyotito hide in a cave by a water source, as they wait for the right time to try to head back down the mountain. The trackers finally catch up with them but still do not know where they are. That night, Kino decides that he will attack the trackers. As Kino is about to attack, Coyotito lets out a small cry, which makes one of the trackers fire his rifle in the direction of Coyotito. Kino then attacks the trackers and kills them. Sadly, the shot that one of the trackers fired hit and killed Coyotito. The next day, Juana and Kino make their way back to the village. They go to the shore and Kino throws the pearl into the sea and watches it as it floats to the bottom.The main conflict in this story is that Kino finds a magnificent pearl and intends to sell it so that he can better his life by owning a rifle and giving his son a good education. But when Kino tries to sell the pearl, he claims that he has been cheated because of other people's greed. The joy around discovering the pearl turns to fear and misfortune as people try to steal the pearl. Kino and his wife believe that the pearl is cursed and no longer know what to do with it. The conflict is resolved by Kino killing the trackers and throwing the great pearl into the ocean. The lesson learned in this novel is that greed can lead to death, sorrow, and misfortune. I give this book four out of five stars, because it is a good thrilling novel. I took one star away because it was too slow in the beginning."},{"Title":"The Pearl","review":"This book is about one poor family that is struggling to have a better future.In baja california,in a section called la paz,there was a man named kino and his wife juana,and their son who made their relationship evencloser.One day coyottito was in his delicate box playing around having fun,when an evil,ugly,dangerous and untouchable scorpion was crawling on the top of box rope.The scorpion stung the poor little baby who started shaking and crying.Kino was very furious and began to hear \\"the evil song\\"An example of foreshadowing.Kino needed to find or get money to help coyottito recover and heal.luckily he found\\"the pearl of the world ,and he could now get money.The townspeople started to get greedy and became interested in kino pearl.Kino also became greedy because he wanted a higher price for the pearl.Eventually,his greed forces him to act in ways he never imagined.Kino and his family faced incredible challenges.As a high school student,I'll rate this novel 4 perfect stars.It is interesting and exciting.It has some actions and scenes that will surprise you.It's good because it talks about a foreign nation with a diffrent culture.I recommend this book for children to listen and teenagers to read."},{"Title":"The Pearl","review":"A WONDERFUL BOOK FOR READERS WHO LIKE MATURE, ORIGINAL WORKS. I LIKED IT, BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN YOU WILL.....I am fifteen and like to read ...I had to read The Pearl for my English class. I used to hate books that didn't \\"reel me in\\" in the first chapter. I couldn't finish them-they were too boring. I have found that I have started to accept books that I used to hate. If you despise boring books, don't care to even think that there is symbolism in a book, and don't have the patience to read a book with a lot of description and little dialogue, this book is not for you. If you don't like books that have sentences like: \\"The Song of the Family came now from behind Kino. And the rhythm of the family song was the grinding stone where Juana worked the corn for the morning cakes...\\" or \\"Under her breath Juana repeated an ancient magic to against such evil, and on top of that she muttered a Hail Mary between clenched teeth...\\" you will be annoyed at times by The Pearl. You will definitely not like The Pearl if you hate books that could be summarized pretty easily in just one paragraph.The Pearl is a parable (a short story that illustrates a spiritual truth. In a parable, characters are seldom three-dimensional; instead, they tend to be flat, representing qualities rather than real-life people). You can expect good character development from Steinbeck, but remember-the characters represent qualities, such as being naive or stubborn.People who would love The Pearl have patience for the plot to develop. Also remember, this book is only around 90 pages long-that's how long an average 300 page novel would take to unravel a basic plot. If you can hold on for about twenty-five pages, the real plot comes into view.I must admit, I thought I would hate this book, but I REALLY ENJOYED IT. I like Steinbeck's writing style. I sometimes did get tired of \\"The Song of Evil\\" or other strange phrases and beliefs, but what Steinbeck has created is clever and the phrases and beliefs are worked into the story quite convincingly. The Pearl's symbolism is quite obvious; the old: \\"Men ought to be satisfied with what they have,\\" or, \\"We desire nothing so much as that which we cannot have.\\" To tell you the truth, this book shouldn't really be THAT boring to most people. There was SOME action and fighting. Yes, Steinbeck does tend to overdo it with description, but is that necessarily a bad thing? He IS known as a describer (one of the best). Relationships between characters, themes, morals, and symbolism always occur in his books. If you ... want a great short story to read on a rainy day, pick up The Pearl, you should enjoy it."},{"Title":"The Pearl","review":"The Pearl by John Steinbeck is a good book. The book expresses a good theme:Money can not buy happiness. The main character in the book, Kino, a poor man who lives with his wife and new-born son are somewhat satisfied with their lives. Kino, a fisherman, goes out to fish. While fishing he finds a valuable pearl. With this pearl he thinks he could buy him and his family happiness. He soon comes to realize this pearl has brought his family more trouble then they had to begin with. Steinbeck uses his ways of writing to get the reader to feel the same emotions as Kino and his family feel. The book was interesting and makes the reader continue it. The Pearl was a well written interesting book and should be recommended to anyone."},{"Title":"The Pearl","review":"Kino is a pearl diver in La Paz, Mexico, eking out a meager subsistence living for his wife, Juana, and their infant son, Coyotito. When Coyotito is stung by a scorpion, Kino is both embarrassed and angered by the fact that the arrogant, self-centered town doctor is unwilling to help because they are unable to pay. Diving long and deep, perhaps to cool off his anger or perhaps to find an extra pearl or two so that he might have the money for his son's care, he emerges from the Gulf of Mexico with the largest, most exquisite pearl that his community has ever seen. It is quickly labeled as \\"The Pearl of the World\\".Thinking it to be the source of his family's future health, comfort, happiness and peace, Kino seeks to sell it to the local pearl buyers who attempt to swindle him, offering only a fraction of its real value. When the pearl becomes the target of sneak thieves in the middle of the night, Kino kills the thief defending himself, his family and the pearl that is now the central focus of their lives.Kino and Juana realize that the doctor, the priest and those already possessed of wealth in the town are angry that they should presume to step out of their station. While their friends, the other pearl fishermen, are happy for Kino's good fortune they are also jealous and convinced that Kino's sudden wealth will change him into a new person - a person that, in some fashion, will choose to distance himself from the people he formerly loved and valued.Steinbeck's story writing skills are eloquent, compelling, and impossibly tight and concise but, at the same time, exceptionally profound and moving. Steinbeck's writing is the very antithesis of the style of Charles Dickens, for example, another consummate storyteller, but one who never failed to write astonishingly complex sentences and paragraphs using an enormous number of words where one would do.For example, when Kino said, \\"I am a man\\", insisting that he must defend his family and his goods, Steinbeck perfectly described a woman's understanding of what a man meant when he said that:\\"It meant that he was half insane and half God. It meant that Kino would drive his strength against a mountain and plunge his strength against the sea. Juana, in her woman's soul, knew that the mountain would stand while the man broke himself; that the sea would surge while the man drowned in it.\\"On the flip side, any female reader today would appreciate Steinbeck's brief but powerful statement of his admiration of their good sense:\\"Sometimes the quality of woman, the reason, the caution, the sense of preservation could cut through Kino's manness and save them all.\\"Read on the surface, \\"The Pearl\\" is a beautifully told, sadly moving parable that expounds on the often repeated childhood mantra, \\"Money can't buy happiness\\". A slightly more sophisticated reader will also take away the message that wealth is equivalent to power which, as we all come to know, can be its own evil leading to corruption and deceit. A deeper analytical reading, perhaps from a world-weary, more cynical adult, may give rise to the conclusion that Steinbeck was also indulging in a political criticism of the wealthy class and the authorities. Perhaps he was even expounding on the virtues of socialism, a political posture that would have been, to say the least, unpopular in the USA such a short time after the end of WW II.However you choose to read it, \\"The Pearl\\" is a short novella, easily read in a mere two to three hours, that deserves to be in a library of classic American literature.Paul Weiss"},{"Title":"The Pearl","review":"There is a reason John Steinbeck is among the classic writers.

You are in for a great ride with his books, any of them."},{"Title":"The Pearl","review":"In typical Steinbeck fashion, a very well written, VERY descriptive story.

As he attempts to open the enormous clam, it tightly closes and Kino swims to the surface. Kino is a brave man with a wife, Juana, and a baby son, Coyotito. They live on the eastern shore of Mexico in little brush houses along the beach. Kino and his many neighbors, including his brother Juan Thomas, are all pearl divers. Diving for pearls day in day out is the only life style they've known and have wished for a better one for so long. On an ordinary day, while Kino is down under the ocean's surface, he sees a reflection of the sun in a beautiful glimmer. He grabs the clam that produced it and swims to the surface with it and the other clams he has collected. On his canoe with his wife and child, he opens the clam and reveals \\"The Pearl of the World\\". Coyotito had been stung by a scorpion earlier and needed medical help, but due to Kino having no money at all, the doctor did not treat his child. Kino shows everyone and rumors spread quite rapidly of this wonderful pearl. The doctor suddenly comes to Kino's house and requests to see the child. Kino allows Coyotito to be examined and treated by the doctor. The medical care provided by the doctor doesn't seem to do much, but it helps a little. The next day Kino goes into town with the whole of the brush neighborhood behind him to sell his pearl. The group arrives at the first pearl seller and he offers to cheap a price and Kino storms out knowing that they would try and cheat him. He then goes to the capital with his brother and tries to sell it there. Meanwhile, Kino's friends and family ponder the thought of The Pearl destroying Kino and bringing him into greed. No buyer at the capital buys the pearl for a fair price either and so Kino and his brother go home angry and disappointed. Kino decides to drop The Pearl back into the ocean so that he and his family are not overcome by greed and the fate that goes hand-in-hand with it. The Pearl was a selection that kept you wondering what Kino would do with The Pearl next and what the results would be. It also allows for you to see how hard the decision would be if you were in that situation. Any person that is interested in a story filled with great morals and positive characters, this is the book for you!This book puts you at the point of view of a lower class family that is hanging on, though barely, and is grateful for anything they get. Although Kino is not well educated, he is a caring and loving husband, father, and friend. Kino and his neighbors also show great commitment to collecting pearls for money and never complain about the work they must do day after day. A low class society doesn't always have to be negative and in poverty.When Kino or any of his people say they're going to do something, they're going to do it. That's one of the great elements of this selection. The characters are not afraid to do something and will know when something begins to get a little fishy. None of them will succumb to greed either; they are all team players and will help each other out when in need.Bravery is shown throughout this story too. When Kino and his neighbors go to the first pearl buyer in town, he walks into the room upright and confident. The buyer tells Kino that the pearl is big and clumsy and that he will offer 1,000 pesos, Kino doesn't just go along with this. Kino discusses with his brother and turns back to the buyer to tell him that it is \\"The Pearl of the World\\" and that it is worth at least 50,000 pesos. Three other buyers are brought in; they all say it is too big and that they don't want it or will only pay 500 pesos for it. Kino becomes furious because he knew this would happen and storms out of the office and back to his house.Wondering what would occur next to The Pearl and Kino keeps the audience reading and also prevents them from becoming bored and setting the book down. The Pearl is filled with morals and a good amount of positive happenings.J. Roll"},{"Title":"The Pearl","review":"Had to read this book in the 9th grade....did not enjoy it...at all. Very frustrating..."},{"Title":"The Pearl","review":"I like mainstream fiction. Seldom do I venture into the morbid world of Literary Fiction where self-pity and amorality hide behind artsy verbiage. Steinbeck is about as far as I can go-a tame Literary Lion. I don't sense in his works the pretentiousness and elitism that is so prevalent among his peers. Steinbeck's writing style and themes are accessible, and thankfully lack the dark, labyrinthine prose of Joyce, Faulkner, et al. John Steinbeck achieves with words what Mozart does with music. They are both masters of taking ordinary ideas to extraordinary heights, transforming the common into a higher, creative realm.As I much as I like The Pearl (especially Frank Muller's splendid audio rendition) the practical-realist in me is stubbornly put off by its high-handed preaching against materialism. The book's main character, Keno, wants to sell his pearl and secure a better future for his family, exactly what my Irish ancestors sought when they traded potato patches for Streets Paved With Gold. A fundamental problem I have with this book, and Literary Fiction generally, is that it paints such a bleak picture of humanity. I agree that rampant, unchecked greed and materialism is bad, but give poor Keno a break! He only wants what my Irish immigrant ancestors wanted-a way out of grinding poverty. Would it have been better if Keno had passively accepted his lot in life? Millions of immigrants who came to America were looking for their pearl. Were they wrong too?"},{"Title":"The Pearl","review":"This book is not quite as beautifully written as \\"Of Mice and Men\\", but it has a very powerful and true message albeit it might be a little exaggerated in this particular story. It's a tale about the power of the dreams that drives us, taking us places where we didn't dream of going, and neither wanted to go. It's a story about taking one apparently harmless step that forces you to take another step, and yet another until you end up where you didn't expect, one little step that only the wise would avoid taking. It's also a story about day and night, what happens on the surface and what happens beneath.The message becomes apparent early in the book, but it grows stronger and stronger as the main characters grow more and more ignorant towards it. While reaching the last pages my adrenalin was pumping, knowing that something was going to happen, but not knowing exactly what and I was somewhat surprised by the ending.This is the second book I've read by Steinbeck and definitely not the last."},{"Title":"The Pearl","review":"Although arrived late (daughter's summer reading), the book itself came in great condition, shrinkwrapped and all!

This was a terrible and disturbing book that was awful I reccoment highly that you do not read it because it is messed up and awful. The ending is also terrible because it is a big disapointment and you realize how much time you wasted reading this book in the first place!"},{"Title":"The Pearl","review":"\\"The Pearl\\" was the first book by Steinbeck that I ever read. It was in school (for school, because I don't think I would have thought to read it otherwise), back in middle school. When I think back on it, the most interesting thing from that quarter was sitting with a friend and mocking \\"The Pearl\\" to no end, and finally writing a very long essay about the many flaws this book has. The next year, when forced to read \\"Of Mice and Men\\", I nearly didn't make it, for fear that it would be as awful as this experience. Thankfully, it wasn't, and I was able to get over my \\"anti-Steinbeck\\" frame of mind, and continued to read his other superb works. But this? This is what I call \\"wannabe good\\". Steinbeck may have the talent (not \\"may; he DOES), but this book was a disgusting waste of time and a horrible read.Besides the fact that it's ridiculously boring, \\"The Pearl\\" has a very flimsy plotline and the main character is quite awful. Kino is beyond stupid and naive, sometimes cruel, and very foolish. He tries to deal with his luck (or problem) the same stupid way throughout the entire book. He hits his wife, but she, just as stupidly, stays with him, resulting in the death of their son. For Kino, the concept of \\"let it go\\" does not exist. He's a very frustrating main character, but unfortunately, he's also very dull.The thing about this is that it's impossible to connect to the story or to the characters. UNLIKE \\"Of Mice and Men\\" where the ending was touching and sad, the depressing ending here made me (and my whole class) go, HA. Because we hated Kino so much, it made us feel smug that he got what he deserved. At the end of \\"Of Mice and Men\\", I cried. At the end of \\"The Pearl\\", I thanked Steinbeck for not making this awful book go on.Perhaps Steinbeck was hoping for a meaningful story about poverty, class changes, and the awful calamities that result from wealth, but he only wrote a boring story with an extremely flawed, obnoxious main character that is impossible to connect to. I normally seek stories with troubled main characters, but this was just painful. It's a waste of time that kills Steinbeck for you. Steinbeck is a superb writer, but this is one of the worst books I've ever read! If you want short Steinbeck, go for the incredible \\"Of Mice and Men\\"!Some people say that it's a matter of the age in which people read \\"The Pearl\\". That's not true. I've tried to reread it, but, as I've already said, it's painfully boring. It's a WASTE OF TIME. Kino is a stupid man, Juana is a foolish woman, and Coyotito ends up dead because of his father's idiotic behavior. Kino doesn't actually care what happens to his family at some point and is just another greedy, paranoid man. It's not well written, it's not interesting, and it's very boring.For any Steinbeck, go for \\"East of Eden\\" (now, THERE'S a superb book!) or \\"Of Mice and Men\\" (if you're looking for something short). This will discourage you from reading his writing ever again because it is so awful. I urge you to push this out of your mind and find another book to read, because this is just a disgusting waste of time!"},{"Title":"The Pearl","review":"The Pearl was the worst book i have ever read in my life.

Coyotito is stung by a scorpion, but as Kino has no money to pay the doctor, the boy is refused treatment. He recovers, thanks to Juana's ministrations, but the next day Kino finds a huge pearl, which he calls \\"the pearl of the world.\\" By selling it, he can get the money to pay the doctor, but he also dreams of buying a rifle, marrying Juana, and getting Coyotito an education, things that he has never had money for thus far. However, his dreams blind him to the greed that the pearl arouses in him and his neighbors.Soon, the whole town knows of the pearl, and many people begin to desire it. That night Kino is attacked in his own home. The next day, he takes the pearl to the pearl buyers in the town, but they refuse to give him the money he wants so he decides to go to the capital for better price. Juana, seeing that the pearl is causing darkness and greed, sneaks out of the house later that night to throw the pearl back into the ocean, but Kino catches her. While he is returning to the house, Kino is attacked again by several unknown men and the pearl is lost in the struggle. Juana finds it and gives it back to Kino. When they arrive home they find that their canoe is damaged and their home is burning down, so they determine to walk to the capital but soon find that they are being tracked by men who are hired to hunt them. Will the family be able to escape? And what will happen to the pearl?This novella, which was first published as a short story \\"The Pearl of the World\\" in Woman's Home Companion in 1945, explores man's nature as well as greed and evil and supposedly illustrates our fall from innocence. It is said to be a retelling of an old Mexican folk tale. That the doctor has performed clumsy abortions and had a mistress is mentioned. There are references to drinking wine and smoking cigarettes as well as to both \\"God\\" and \\"the gods.\\" Kino and Juana are not married but, of course, are living together and have a son. The story exhibits Steinbeck's typical pessimistic cynicism leading to the conclusion that if something good ever happens, you had better watch out because it is just setting you up for something really bad. Someone has suggested that it bares \\"the fallacy of the American dream--that wealth erases all problems.\\" I don't agree that the American dream is that wealth erases all problems, although some might think that, but I do agree that we must learn that wealth is not the ultimate answer to man's greatest needs and presents some serious problems. All in all, it is not too bad of a book."},{"Title":"The Pearl","review":"This is a very short work, more accurately labeled a short story than a novella, easy readable in 1-2 hours. Its theme is as old as the hills, \\"be careful what you wish for, lest you receive it.\\"Kino and his wife Juana live a hardscrabble existence with their newborn son in a straw hut on the beach, where Kino scratches out a meager existence as a pearl diver. Kino's discovery of \\"the pearl of a lifetime\\" changes his life over night. Kino imagines all of the positive things the pearl will make possible, while his wife soon recognizes it as a source of evil which soon gives rise to a string of disasters which they struggle in vain to overcome.Again, there is nothing original in what is essentially a parable of untold age. It has been compared in style, setting and theme to Hemingway's Old Man and The Sea, but in my opinion, it suffers by comparison."},{"Title":"The Pearl","review":"The Pearl, by John Steinbeck is a parable novel that takes place in a Mexican coastal village called La Paz during the late nineteenth or early twentieth century. The story is about a poor man namesd Kino, his wife Juana, and their son Coyotito, who find a great Pearl in the sea, but are cursed with horrendous luck because of it. kino first thinks that the Pearl has given him great furtune but it has cursed him. All the poeple in his town are now watching his every move and they are planning how to steal it. He tries to sell it, bot nobody offers anyhwere close to a good enough deal so Kino rejects them and goes home. One night, a person attempts to steal the Pearl, but Kino follows him outside. But, unfortunately, he kills the man. Kino how realizes that he is not safe and he must leave. He then hides out with his brother for one night and he escapes the next. Little does he know, peole are searching for him and he has to stay ahead of them if he wants to live. After a long time hiking, Kino has had enough and he attacks the searchers at night and kills them. Unfortunately, he kills his son as well. Finally, he and his wife would return to La Paz and Kino would throw the Pearl deep into the Ocean. The main conflict is that Kino finds a pearl and wishes to sell it to gain wealth and to give his son an education, but he meets resistance of peoples' greed and he doesn't know what to do with the Pearl. He thinks he is cursed and this conflict is resolved by Kino resorting to violence and to throwing the Pearl into the Ocean. After reading this novel, I've learned that greed can lead to danger and violence and should be avoided at all costs.

This short, nasty and brutish little tale is completely predictable, and I expect that this was the case when Steinbeck first foisted this on his unsuspecting public. It is only 90 pages, which means that the misery does not go on for too long. Teachers like to assign it, which no doubt helps explain the popularity of television among the adult population. (If this is &quot;Literature,&quot; then give me a nice &quot;ring around the collar&quot; commercial, please.)

If your like myself and have little passion for fiction, but you crave it every once in a while, than this book is definately one that you should pick up. For myself, this book started off rather slow, but it definately picked up the pace as it progressed. It startes describing the setting and the main characters, a family of three who live in very poor conditions. The time setting seems to be of the past seeing as the description of their technology was of grass huts and wooden boats. The family found a pearl and it brought them more harm than good, it is said to bring evil (in which it does) and takes the three characters on a turbulant journey that enevidably leads to the pearl being disguarded. The hope that the family had in the beggining of what they would do with the pearl was mind boggling and only to find that it was so extravagant that it had no value. The thing that kept me turning the pages was the connection that I felt with the characters, I found myself wanting for things to be different and the situation to be changed.

It's based on a Mexican folk tale, so I can't fault Steinbeck for the lack of plot, but something just seems to be missing. I also didn't like the end, it was somewhat gory and made me think &quot;ewww&quot; just like the scenes in the &quot;Red Pony&quot; with the flies buzzing around the pony.

He leaves out the time and country that the story takes place in."},{"Title":"The Pearl","review":"I feel as though John Steinbeck did a wonderful job writing this book. This story gave real instances that happen everyday to different people all over the world. He did a good job at keeping the book interesting. I was never bored at all throughout the book, from cover to cover. The book was filled with excitement and action. He didn't start the book out with a bunch of boring, meaningless details that no one really cares about. In the end of the book John ends it very tragically with the killing of his son Coyotito. Kino goes through many difficult situations in the book, and selects many different ways of acting in them.

It was rather short but I found this to be a good thing. It doesn't drag on or draw anything out. It has a lot of deeper meanings and teaches a lot of things that most people learn through their own mistakes. It shows a lot about primitive society and how greed rules people. How in our lives we are consumed by our fast paced society or the things we think we need but really only want and sometimes forget about the things that are true. How things that can seem so pure and good can really be evil and bring destruction. This book shows how money does not equal happiness and trusting and listening to those who are closest to you is an essential. This is a definite must read."},{"Title":"The Pearl","review":"Overall I'd say that this book was a success. I liked in the beginning how John got strait to the point, and then gradually introduced the characters to you. This keep me from drifting off and not paying attention to what I was reading in the beginning. I liked the how the idea of the songs in Kino's mind was set, and how at the end the evil sonds were what drove him to save his family. At least that was how I perseived it. Another thing that I thought was great was how John had the doctor say that the baby actually did have poison left in him. What was great about it was the fact that you couldn't tell if the doctor was lying just to get money or not. The ending was terrific. I liked how Kino nailed all three trackers without them even having a chance. When I found out that the baby was dead, I actually was sad. I would have liked to have known sooner that the baby was dead instead of waiting to find out when Kino and Juanna had returned home.The only downfall I thought this book had was that some parts I felt took to long, and I drifted away.

Although Kino had good reason to keep the pearl, it still caused him heartache and pain. Steinbeck illustrates the characters in a form and in a situation that everyone can relate and identify with. I admire the way Kino was in the beginning; how content he was with just his wife, child, brushhouse, and not having much money."},{"Title":"The Pearl","review":"In this classic tale of greed, John Steinback illustrated to us what loving something to much, expecially money, can do to us. It will destroy us! There is NO exeption. In my opinion, our greatest weakness as human beings is the pursuite of personal pleasure at the expense of anyone and everyone that comes in our way.Mr. Steinbeck, gave us characters that we can relate to. We can imagine what we would do in we were put in a simular stuation. At the beginning of the story, Kino wanted nothing and was completly contempt with what he had. Then he found this great pearl and greed ingulfed him like a shark devours his prey. His whole life fell apart.

That is when he discovers the pearl of the world and therefor is shown a doorway into many of the aspects of a &quot;rich&quot; life, a life that is forsaken to him by birth.

This is a very intriguing book that all readers are easily to relate to. In this book the people who were very poor and didn't have much to choose, from so whatever they had they made good use of it. The wealthy tried to take over the poor by looking down on them,and at one special moment the poor had something great the wealthy wanted so they tried to trick the poor into giving them the great thing. The great thing in this story caused family to slighty fall apart in ways that result in death. Something so great can cause a father to be keep and then risk his child's life.

With the pearl, Kino hopes to buy peace and happiness for himself and his wife and give his son a better future. However the immediate greed and danger brought about by the the pearl ruins the only chance of peace and happiness this family would've have.Now instead of the song of family and love playing as the soundtrack to Kino's life the song of hate and fear has replaced it. The pearl has become nothing but a detriment to him.This story is timeless. Told in the simplest and most beautiful of words. It is truly heart wrenching and fills the soul with the beautiful analogies made.This is probably one of my most favorite books of all time and I can't ever get over how perfectly it is written.

I want my two daughters to enjoy these books as much as I have!!"},{"Title":"The Pearl","review":"\`The Pearl' is another book by Steinbeck of such searing beauty that it leaves you breathless and in awe. You know from the first few pages and the simple, yet captivating descriptions of a family's early morning habits, that this book will live up to the promise you feel from reading past Steinbeck works. Following a pearl fisherman who finds a life changing sized pearl and how it changes him, his family and more importantly the reactions of those around him. This starts with wonder and hope for the future and descends into blackness and misery because of the wealth the pearl represents and the jealousies it arouses. This easily matches the short, succinct beauty of Hemingways \`The Old Man and the Sea' and I'm surprised it isn't given more attention by school syllabus setters or lovers of fiction in general. This is a short, powerful novella and it is as terse and well written as all of Steinbecks masterly works. If you know his style you'll know what to expect and if you're new to Steinbeck, then you are in for a real treat. This also includes some wonderful line drawings to illustrate the story. Stunning, beautiful and highly recommended.Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page."},{"Title":"The Pearl","review":"The Pearl is essentially a morality tale about how the pursuit of wealth can lead to unhappiness.

It's good but there is nothing I can say about it that hasn't already been said by others in the reviews. I certainly do not consider this a 5 star though. A five star book should be one that you will find yourself reading again and again. The Pearl is the classic story of how immediate success can quickly become your biggest nightmare. People might want to read this before taking their trips to Vegas or going down to the local store and buying a lottery ticket. Even if the financial success doesn't change you it is bound to change everyone around."},{"Title":"The Pearl","review":"From a variety of different influences comes Steinbeck's 'The Pearl'. There is a Hispanic parable that this is largely based on and basically covers how sudden wealth does not necessarily change your life for the better but rather can bring a host of jealousy, distrust, and unhappiness with it, often to tragic ends.If you have to read this book for school, you aren't going to like it because you're forced to read it. You'll claim it's boring, you'll claim it's 'the worst book ever written', and you will resent the book and your teacher for assigning it. Sorry for your one-dimensional mind set on a chance to improve yourself. If you are reading this book for pleasure or because you feel the need to read the Steinbeck library, then you should be fairly pleased with the turns of events. It's a basic story with a tragic ending (like most Steinbeck works). It's 90 pages long, you'll read it in 1-3 hours and it is worth reading. It's a good piece of literature albeit very short."},{"Title":"The Pearl","review":"John Steinbeck is one of my favorite authors. His books always have meaning unlike many modern books.The Pearl is about a poor diver and his family. One day he emerges from the sea with a pearl as large as a sea-gull's egg. With the pearl comes hope that his family will no longer live in poverty. However human nature comes out of everyone in town and it exploits the depths of evil and the young family realizes that the pearl is not worth the greed it brings out.This book is very short, only about 90 pages. So if you are hesitant about reading classics or are just starting out, this book is a great one to start with."},{"Title":"The Pearl","review":"This a nice retelling of a parable about the dangers of greed. The family was better off before finding the pearl. Quickly-gotten gain is no substitute for honest steady plodding. I was written in an easy, comfortable style as are other Steinbeck books."},{"Title":"The Pearl","review":"The Pearl is about a poor pearl diver who is trying to sell one of the biggest pearls ever seen in his hometown in Mexico. I thought that this book was very good. It describes how greed can corrupt anyone and the evils that men are capable of. I would recommend this book to anyone because it is a great story that is full of suspense and action. It is an easy and fast read but is still a thought provoking book.The Pearl takes place in La Paz, Mexico and begins by describing the life of Kino, his wife Juana and son, Coyotito. At the beginning of the book, Kino watches as a scorpion crawls down the rope that holds the hanging box where Coyotito lies. Kino attempts to catch the scorpion, but Coyotito bumps the rope and the scorpion falls on him. Although Kino kills the scorpion, it still stings Coyotito. Juana and Kino go to see the local doctor, who refuses to treat Coyotito because Kino cannot pay. Kino and Juana leave the doctors and take Coyotito down to the sea, where Juana uses seaweed to help Coyotito's shoulder. Kino dives for oysters the next day and finds a very large oyster that contains a huge pearl. The pearl is \\"as large as a seagull's egg\\" and \\"as perfect as the moon\\". The news that Kino has found great pearl travels fast through La Paz. Kino's brother asks him what he will do with his money. Kino wishes to get married to Juana in a church and dress Coyotito in a sailor suit. He wants to send Coyotito to school and buy a rifle for himself. The doctor comes to check on Coyotito now that Kino has money and says that Coyotito needs to be treated for the scorpion bite. That night, someone attempts to steal the pearl but Kino protects it and fights the robbers off. Juana tells Kino that the pearl is evil, but Kino insists that the pearl is their one chance to succeed and that they will sell it tomorrow. Kino goes to sell his pearl the next day, but the pearl dealer only offers a thousand pesos when Kino believes that he deserves fifty thousand. Kino claims that he is being cheated so the pearl dealer calls the other dealers in to inspect the pearl. One dealer after another gave similar prices, but Kino refuses all of them and decides to go to the capital to sell it there. After the pearl is almost stolen again, Juana tells Kino that the pearl is evil one last time but he does not listen and says that they will leave for the capital tomorrow.The Pearl explores man's nature, how greed can motivate people to be evil, and how far one man will go to better the life of his family. Even though the pearl was beautiful, everything that it brought was not good for the family. In the story, Steinbeck shows how wealth does not necessarily bring you happiness and solve your problems. Reading this book helps us stop and appreciate the life we have instead of always wanting more. It shows through symbolism that the old saying \\"money does not buy happiness\\" is true. This review is posted on Amazon.com."},{"Title":"The Pearl","review":"This book is criminally unknown. In just under 100 pages, Steinbeck weaves the immortal truth that worldy wealth cannot guarantee happiness or joy into a classic tale of a South American native couple who discover the joys and woes of finding an incredible pearl. They first think that the pearl will change their lives (which is correct) by bringing them happiness and opening endless possabilities for themselves and their infant child. They soon discover, however, that the pearl awakens darkness both within themselves and especially those around them. The setting (a poor fishing community) adds greatly to the telling of the tale, as it somehow adds a tangible sense of the timelessness of the truth it is conveying. John Steinbeck is truly a master story-teller, one who earns my respect not only for the magnificent method of writing (which is very similar to Hemingway), but also because he dares to tread where very few authors do: into unhappy endings. The truth is, things don't always turn out for the best, and not every story has a happy ending. It is always refreshing to find someone who has does not fear to go against the popular obsession with happy endings, and who is actually able to use an unhappy ending to further enhance the impact of their message.Overall grade:A"},{"Title":"The Pearl","review":"I love this book but wish Penguin would put a bit more effort into a decent binding job. Charging $9.00 for a slim paperback that will often not survive a single reading in the hands of one of my students seems excessively high."},{"Title":"The Pearl","review":"I'm 13, and I read this for school. It's a wonderful parable.Kino is a poor Indian who lives with his wife, Juana, and his son, Coyotito. They are superstitious people that hears songs, when they experience feelings, like the \\"song of the family.\\"The first conflict arises when Coyotito is stung by a scorpion. (Where Kino hears the \\"Song of Evil) Juana quickly sucks out the poison, but they still take him to the city doctor. The doctor publicly refuses, so Kino goes out to sea to try to find a pearl to pay the doctor with. News soon spreads that he has found the pearl of the world,(Where Kino hears the \\"Song of the Pearl\\") but Kino fails top sell it because the pearl buyers have put a ridiculously low price on the pearl. The greedy doctor then visits Kino's hut, even though Coyotito is better. The doctor then tricks Kino and Juana by making the baby worse, then making him quiet.That night is the first night when people try to steal the pearl. It stirs greed in Kino, though Juana wants to take it back to the ocean. When she tries Kino beats her up, and kills a man that same night. Becuase of that, Kino and his family run away. After a while, three men, one of which who has a rifle, try to find them, and his pearl. At one point, Juana and Coyotit hide in the mountains, while Kino attempts to kill them by creeping up on them. However, he hears the sound of Coyotito crying, which the three men also hear. The man with a rifle assumes it is a baby coyote, and shoots in the direction. Kino, enraged, attacks them.In the final chapter, you learn that Coyotito's head had been blown apart. Kino and Juana return, but act almost dead.They then return the pearl, and the \\"Music of the Pearl\\" disappears.I think that it is a very interesting book,though it is short. I would recommend it to people of all ages."},{"Title":"The Pearl","review":"The world portrayed in THE PEARL is that of the helpless, exploited, and disinherited. It portrays the lives of people being forced to live closer to nature than most of us care to, of people who somehow don't fit into the social structure, of people who do not understand the boundaries and rules of governments and nations, and of people forced to be on the run.Steinbeck paints a beautiful family with hope and joy, but he promptly dashes all hope these people could have. It is a beautiful but dark tragedy written in poetic prose.The story is a parable with two-dimensional characters. Reading the story, I felt that these events were happening to me. There is a strong sense of universality. THE PEARL shows the best and the worst of humanity, and it displays much of Steinbeck's greatest ability to write."},{"Title":"The Pearl","review":"Kino, his wife Juana, and their baby son Coyotito, live a simple life in an ocean-side village in Mexico. Kino pearl-dives for a living. He and his family are native people of the original Aztec stock. Life for them is not perfect, indeed, the injustice of subjugation to the Spanish sometimes burns fierce in their hearts, but much of the time their existance in their small brush hut is sweet. Then one day Kino brings to the surface a huge pearl, a perfect pearl, \\"the Pearl of the World\\". This discovery promises many changes to the better, and it seems Kino's every dream will be fulfilled, but as news of the find spreads the forces of evil stir as greed and malice build.In this novella Steinbeck uses simple language to create some of the atmosphere of a folk-tale. He has, however, combined this atmosphere with the character development and dynamism of plot expected of a modern work. At its worst this book is predictable. Virtually from the start of the story I was able to predict generally how the plot would turn out. Steinbeck's own narration, indeed, more than hints at what the future holds. But the success of this novella is in the working out of the details of the plot. Steinbeck manages to surprise us again and again with dramatic plot twists and exciting developments. I certainly cannot say I was bored by this book. It entertained me, while at the same time making a 'moral' point."},{"Title":"The Pearl","review":"In 1978-79 while in High School in Jamaica, was the first time I read this book. It is an amazing story but not a story. Facts on how our lives can be changed because of need. Facts on how we can lose sight of what is most valuable to us because of \\"luck\\". I am impressed with the the author's presentation of details throughout the book...I felt like I was watching the entire story unfold before my eyes. I think it was well written. For that reason I had to purchase a copy for my step-daughter and of course another for myself in 2007. Awesome book!!"},{"Title":"The Pearl","review":"Even though John Steinbeck's The Pearl is less than one hundred pages, it is still a great piece of American literature. The Pearl is an extremely interesting and compelling parable about a family living in an impoverished Mexican Village called La Paz. The exact time period of the story is not specified. However, judging by the generation in which Steinbeck lived and the era of many of his other works, The Pearl probably takes place in the early 1900s. Originally, the work was planned to hit the theaters before becoming a piece of literature. The film version would have worked out nicely because throughout the tale, Steinbeck describes separate songs and tunes that are associated for different items, events, and character feelings. The major theme Steinbeck implements into the novel is that becoming wealthy can warp one's mind, causing he or she to perform tasks that would be out of the ordinary.The novella's main character, Kino, is a Mexican and Indian father living with his wife, Juana and newborn son, Coyotito in a small Mexican village. The family is extremely poor and does not have any luxuries in life. One day, Coyotito is stung by a scorpion and is in need of medical attention. When Kino and Juana take their son to a doctor, he turns them away because he is aware that the family has no way to pay him. Immediately, Kino and Juana begin to search for valuable pearls in the sea, hoping to find something to earn enough money for the doctor's attention. Sure enough, Kino finds the largest pearl anyone has ever seen. It is declared \\"The Pearl of the World.\\" Coyotito receives the doctor's help, but Kino and Juana are extremely suspicious of him. Later, Kino attempts to sell his pearl but he is offered much less than he expects and refuses the best offer. He plans to travel to the capital the next day to try and sell his pearl again. Juana warns Kino that the pearl is bad luck and she fails in attempting to throw the pearl back into the sea. When Kino is attacked by a group of people attempting to steal the pearl, he promptly kills them off. Realizing the grave danger he put his entire family in, Kino takes Juana, Coyotito, and the pearl and they escape to the mountains. In order to conceal the rest of the story, I will not tell any more plot information.Using a simple, straightforward storytelling method, Steinbeck effectively illustrates the events in his parable. He uses a tremendous amount of foreshadowing throughout the story. However, I will not give any examples as I promised not to reveal any more plot information. Steinbeck emphasizes the importance of certain events by having them recur at the beginning of the chapters. In the second, third, and fourth chapters, a description of the town is present. These few paragraphs remind the reader of the reality of the situation. He compares a town to \\"a colonial animal...a town has a whole emotion\\" (21). In the first and fifth chapters, Steinbeck describes Kino's awakening before and after he discovers the pearl. In the first chapter, Kino is at complete peace with the world, observing his surroundings and listening to the waves splashing on the beach. However, his attitude changes drastically in the fifth chapter. Discovering that Juana has left to throw the pearl back into the sea, \\"rage surged in Kino...quietly he tracked her, and his brain was red with anger\\" (58). Steinbeck emphasizes how the pearl and the thoughts of wealth and luxury have altered Kino's mind, causing him to act differently.Overall, John Steinbeck's The Pearl is a simple story with an important lesson to the reader. I believe that it is well worth a few hours of reading. Steinbeck uses a great writing style and emphasizes key events and ideas to get his purpose across to his readers. He intends for the reader to value his or her emotional and spiritual wealth rather than material wealth."},{"Title":"The Pearl","review":"I am not exactly sure as to the moral of this story.

Kino, his wife Juana, and infant son have known nothing but poverty. This discovery offers them a chance to elude their current existance with the potential of good meals, a bed, and the opportunity to send their kid to school so he may learn to read and write. I find nothing gluttonous with this family's simple objective. What alarms me are the swine that jump out of the darkness to strip them of their chance at a new life.Written in 1947, this novella is a not so unique illustration of society's willingness and cunning in stripping others' of what is rigtfully theirs.

That book was full of vivid imagery and detailed descriptions, but written in a very loose and informal style. It showed me a style of successful writing similar to my own.As part of my student teaching, I had considered teaching Steinbeck's THE PEARL as part of the curriculum for the semester. In preparation, I read the novella in one sitting. The book is quite short and though there are several Mexican names and references in the text, the book is also quite easy to read. The story tells the tale of a poor, Mexican diver named Kino and his family.Kino is married to a beautiful, hardworking woman named Juana. They have a small baby son named Coyotito. Kino is a devoted husband and father. He loves his family very much. They have very little, but what little they have they willingly share with those around them. During what begins as an idyllic day, baby Coyotito is stung on the shoulder by a scorpion. This event foreshadows everything else that is to come. The scorpion is almost immediately crushed and Juana successfully sucks the poison from the baby's tender flesh. Soon he is no longer crying and is happy and carefree once again. But, Juana is concerned and wished to take the baby to the doctor. Thus, Kino and his family and the Greek chorus of townspeople follows in pursuit as the family reaches the gilded gates of the doctor. The doctor is a dishonest, deceitful, and bloated creature whom lives off the misery, poverty, and affliction of those he is supposed to be serving. The doctor refuses to help and the family return home to the lament of the townspeople. Kino dives for oysters and Juana prays in the boat that Kino finds a pearl and Kino does. He finds \\"the greatest pearl in the world\\". It is the Pearl of the World. But, the Pearl of the World is not what it seems. Instead of bringing the family security and sincerity, it brings despair, destruction, and death.THE PEARL plays upon the Biblical parable that Jesus told of the pearl of great price. In that tale, the pearl represents the kingdom of God. In THE PEARL, the great pearl that Kino finds is not the kingdom of God. Instead, it is the Pearl of the World. It represents wealth and power, as well as greed and avarice. It is not an item to give up all that one has to own. It is the opposite, an object of evil to either throw away or destroy. The book illustrates how the best intentions can be corrupted and tainted by greed cloaked in innocence. It is a warning that we would all be wise to heed.This edition of THE PEARL includes an introduction by Linda Wagner-Martin. It is a very good introduction that gives a synopsis of Steinbeck's life, touches upon some of his successes, and provides the context of where THE PEARL fits in Steinbeck's cannon."},{"Title":"The Pearl","review":"What mainly happened in The Pearl is that the main character, Kino, found a pearl. Kino and his wife, Juana tried to help their baby, Coyotito, from the poison of a scorpion. The problem with the pearl is that it gave Kino and his family bad luck. Kino isn't a perfect person. He would beat up Juana. That makes him an unusual main character, but he was interesting. The story took place in Mexico. I would recommend this book to the world, not just boys or girls or a certain age group because it's a good book for anyone. It is a short book but good."},{"Title":"The Pearl","review":"John Steinbeck's The Pearl reveals the true nature of humans when it comes to greed, wealth, and money. The opening scene begins with the awakening of Kino, his wife Juana, and their baby Coyotito. This young family lives a simple, happy life in brush houses by the sea. Kino can hear his family's song of life: \\"The Song of the Family came now from behind Kino. And the rhythm of the family song was the grinding stone where Juana worked the corn for the morning cakes.\\" Frequently throughout the novel Steinbeck uses songs to foreshadow bad things to come, as he does before Coyotito gets stung by a scorpion: \\"In his mind a new song had come, the Song of Evil, the music of the enemy, of any foe of the family, a savage, secret, dangerous melody, and underneath, the Song of the Family cried plaintively.\\" This scorpion sting sets off a chain of events that ultimately leads to the family's demise.Juana wants to take Coyotito to the town doctor for treatment. However, this doctor is only interested in treating people if they have money to pay for it. Kino's offering of a small bag of pearls is not good enough for the doctor, so he turns them away. Ashamed, Juana and Kino head to the sea to try to find better pearls. Kino gets lucky and finds the \\"greatest pearl in the world.\\" Initially it seems that the pearl will bring great fortune to the family, but the pearl has already had a negative effect on the town: \\"The news stirred up something infinitely black and evil in the town;\\" Steinbeck continues with several similes to communicate exactly what kind of evil is now in the town: \\"...the black distillate was like the scorpion, or like hunger in the smell of food, or like loneliness when love is withheld.\\" The author also communicates a stunning truth about the human race: \\"For it is said that humans are never satisfied, that you give them one thing and they want something more. And this is said in disparagement, whereas it is one of the greatest talents the species has and one that has made it superior to animals that are satisfied with what they have.\\" Ironically, the very thing that makes people the most superior of all animals also makes them behave like animals. Soon after finding the pearl, Kino and Juana encounter a few conflicts and it becomes necessary for them to go to the capital to sell the pearl. On this journey Kino's primal nature is felt inside of him: \\"...some animal thing was moving in him so that he was cautious and wary and dangerous;\\" Kino never knew the destruction that such a small treasure could bring.I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys reading about human behavior. This novel is replete with descriptive phrases that make the reader feel as if they were with Kino, Juana, and Coyotito. I almost heard the song of evil and the song of family fighting each other. The stark contrast of light and dark sets the tone for whatever event is occurring at the time. This book has changed the way I think about human nature."},{"Title":"The Pearl","review":"Ever since I read \\"The Pearl,\\" I have been engrossed with John Steinbeck's novels. I thought the pearl was a wonderful story. The storyline was well illustrated and the characters draw you in.Kino,Juana,and their baby Coyotito live peavefully with friends and family in a small town.Poor,yet humble, Kino finds a pearl of incredible size and perhaps one of incredible value.Afterwards,he journeys to a vast land and encounters people that try to take away his pearl-which has now evolved into Kino's center of attention.Through this,Kino loses things most precious to him,and realized the greatest wealth he thought he had brought nothing he hoped for.I loved this book.I read it in 7th great for school, and we discussed it in great length in class.I recommend this book to first-time Steinbeck readers.\\"The Pearl\\" gives a taste of Steinbeck's talent and his mastered storytelling."},{"Title":"The Pearl","review":"The Pearl is a wonderful book which demonstrates the influence that family and greed have on a person. The story revolves around Kino, his wife Juana, and their infant son, Coyotito. Coyotito is bitten by a scorpion and needs medical attention. However, the town doctor refuses to see the child because of a lack of money on Kino's part. In order to change this, Kino goes out looking for pearls and finds a huge pearl. Kino is very pleased by this and thinks of all of the wonderful things he could buy Coyotito with the money from the pearl. In the meantime, Juana had done some home remedies for Coyotito's scorpion bite and the child was healing fine. When the doctor finds out about Kino's good fortune in finding the pearl he becomes eager to help the child because he wants part of the money from the pearl. This is where we begin to see greed play and important part in the novel. Kino buries the pearl in the corner of his hut in an attempt to hide it from anyone who would want to steal it from him. Kino also refuses to sell the pearl for the prices offered to him. Juana feels that the pearl is evil and will only bring evil to them and tells Kino to get rid of it, but he refuses. This is where all the tragedies begin and the true evil of the pearl is shown through to the end of the novel. The pearl symbolizes money, luxury, power, desire, and greed. These are the main aspects to the theme of this novel. The description Steinbeck uses to introduce characters is great. And the plot development is written just as well."},{"Title":"The Pearl","review":"Although this book may be slim and thin, it gives a powerful and straight forward teachings of the natures of men. Kino, the main character, goes through a tragic event of being unable to afford his son's visit to the doctor as the wound from the poisonous scorpion kept on getting worse. To save his beloved son, he dives into the waters and finds a pearl that seemed to posess the shape and the size of a full moon. When the words quickly spread about the mysterious pearl, he soon finds him self stranded between the greedy who devastatingly want to purchase his beautful item. Unluckly, as the story progresses towards the end, Kino faces many depressing results. However, to those who love short and heart thrilling novels, I highly recommend this book... READ IT TODAY!"},{"Title":"The Pearl","review":"The book, The Pearl by John Steinbeck, is an excellent story about how greed can corrupt an innocent man. In the story a Native American man, Kino, his wife, Juana, and their infant son, Coyotito live in an Indian village in Mexico. One morning, a scorpion stings Coyotito. Kino and Juana rush little Coyotito to the doctor in the nearby town, but are turned away because they are too poor to afford the doctor's services. Later that morning, Kino goes diving for pearls and he surfaces with the biggest pearl that his family had ever seen. The rest of the story regards Coyotito's intensifying illness and other people trying to get the pearl. The book has a rather depressing ending but the moral of the story about greed and human nature is extremely apparent by the end of the novel. I highly recommend this book to anyone with two to three hours of free time."},{"Title":"The Pearl","review":"Money Ruins Life'sMy name is Javier Rojas I'm 18 years old I'm a Hispanic guy living in Los Angeles California. I read this book when I was in Junior High and it is still in my memory. This is my favorite fictional story. This story is about a Mexican family who was very poor and lived on a small village close to a beach in Mexico. The father was Kino he was a diver and a fisherman his wife was Juana and they had a 7 month old baby boy that was named Coyotito. This family was very poor there house was a grass hut and they beryl had food to eat. The life in the village was very toughf because of the weather and the lack of money. The people in the village who had little money had different domestic animals like chickens, roosters, pigs, cows, horses, and donkeys that they use to sell or eat. One day Kino, his wife and baby went to the beach on their canoe to find oysters and may be find pearls that they would sell to get some money. Kino dive in without any oxygen tank or equipment with only a knife and he found a big oyster, when they open it they found a very big pearl that was the biggest pearl of the world. They went to sell it to a jewelry shop the next day and the guy there offered them very little money for it so Kino rejected the offer. The guy in the jewelry shop told allot of other people in the village that Kino had the biggest pearl of the world and after that day the people in the village started to not like kinos family. There hole life change because now that they had money they had allot of problems people wanted to trick them, robbed them, and even kill them for the pearl that they owned. To try to avoid all pf these problems they escape to the mountains where they found even more problems. I especially recommend this book to all those people who are familiar with farms and lived in a small town in Mexico."},{"Title":"The Pearl","review":"This is a depressing novel but it definitely shows the true consequences of greed and subjugation.

But it is a short little tale of the classic themes of Human existence. Through the experiences of one family, all of human nature is put on display."},{"Title":"The Pearl","review":"In this short, 87-page book, John Steinbeck captures - at least to my mind - what it must be like to win a multi-million dollar jackpot lottery. A deadly scorpion bites the baby son of Kino, a fisherman, but the local doctor won't treat him because the father has no money to pay for the doctor's services. So, instead of buying a lottery ticket, Kino goes deep-sea diving to find a pearl. And what a pearl he finds...gigantic, beautiful, perfect in every way. But, instead of helping him, this discovery - much like a lottery winning - yields nothing but trouble. Kino and his wife, Juana, are attacked from all sides by the unscrupulous doctor, thieving pearl buyers, charities, strangers, and friends. How can he best claim the value of the pearl and spend his winnings wisely so that it will change his life and that of his infant son? Of course I'm not going to tell you what happens, but just try and stop reading once you are caught up by this story. Just try. Another Steinbeck gem, a pearl, so to speak."},{"Title":"The Pearl","review":"First of all, I am not putting down Steibeck, he has a lot of great works, unfortunately this isn't one of them. It really drags along at a snails pace. I appreciate the moral and lesson but I dislike how Steibeck decided to portray it. If you would like to read a great Steinbeck novel, pick up 'Of Mice and Men' or 'The Moon is Down'."},{"Title":"The Pearl","review":"At first i got the assinment to read this book i wasn't very happy.

It is about an Indian named Kino who finds this pearl, so he can pay the doctor to treat his son's scorpion wound. He thinks this pearl will give him great fortune, but little does he know that it is evil. He struggles through many tasks until he realizes he should get rid of it."},{"Title":"The Pearl","review":"I just finished this novel. I loved the way Steinbeck uses the English language. Like an artist, he uses a wide variety of &quot;colors&quot; to paint a complex and detailed picture: &quot;The stars still shone and the day had drawn only a pale wash of light in the lower sky to the east.&quot;I particularly enjoyed the way the author made inanimate objects come alive. For example, in chapter 3, he describes the town as having &quot;a nervous system and a head and shoulders and feet.&quot; Like energy flowing through the body, the reader see how news travels through the town.I also liked how Steinbeck used the townspeople, acting much the way Greek chorus'do in ancient Greek plays, being the outside narrator/observer. All in all, an excellent book. Buy it and enjoy!"},{"Title":"The Pearl","review":"This book had a small plot,but still kept the reader interested.Some of the events were in the book were not told when they happened,but were revealed later in the book.In the book Kino(the main charater)learned not to abuse his wealth, but not to ignore it."},{"Title":"The Pearl","review":"I'm tired of having reviewers gripe about how teenagers obviously don't understand what theya re talking about and simpy can't fully appreciate a work of literature. I am in 8th grade and this book was required reading for me. At first I agreed and didn't really enjoy it. Fortunately I had an English teacher who was perceptive enough to be able to point out the subtle metaphors that Steinbach uses consistantly throughout the novel. Everything from the recurring ants to the subtle legerdemain of the pearl buyer. I for one am one satisfied reader who was forced to read this terrific novel."},{"Title":"The Pearl","review":"My eighth grade students are not easily captivated by the reading of novels. However, after reading and discussing the novel together in class, several of the students stated that they had never enjoyed discussing a novel as much as this one. They empathized with the main characters, and condemned the injustices of society. They connected in a way they did not think possible with this poor family. They were able to understand the rich symbolism of the novel and were touched by tragic, yet hopeful ending. As their teacher. I felt that they truly understood the rich meanings of the book and were able to experience the pain and injustices of these characters. It is a novel I will teach again because I saw and felt the strong impact it had on my students."},{"Title":"The Pearl","review":"I had to read The Pearl for school and until now all the books I read for school were horrible, but The Pearl stood out. I didn't want it to finish. The worst thing about the book was that it was so short. I feel Steinbeck did such a great job, if he was still alive I would shake his hand."},{"Title":"The Pearl","review":"I read the Pearl when I lived back home in Africa. Steinbeck does a great job at keeping his readers emotionally excited. The book takes a positive turn when Kinko, a poor fisherman finds a pearl that would radically transform his life. The stage is set for the transition, but trouble befalls Kinko's family and the story takes a sad turn! I recommend The Pearl for those interested in understanding the tale of life. The Pearl is a book worth reading over and over again!!!"},{"Title":"The Pearl","review":"It's not just a story about good and evil, it's a marvelous tale wich uncovers the virtues and miserys of the human condition, because Kino, the pearl fisher, is a sensitive man, one who is able to hear certain music associated to emotions and, despite of his illiteracy, that gift allows him to predict good or bad things, but when greed touches his heart he forgets everything he knows and the awesome pearl he finds, perhaps the solution of all of his problems, leads him to a path of tragedy and suffering. For kids it would be a great starting point to read good literature, to adults a story to remind us how all the treasures a man could long for are inside our hearts. And everyone will always remember Steinbeck's ability to write about the most sad and tragic things with a magnificent poetic language"},{"Title":"The Pearl","review":"the story was the worst book I have ever had the pleasure to read. The plot made me sick. It was so boring that I feel asleep reading it if I could I would go back and burn all the copies. It was the worst book ever writen. I do not know how they printed it."},{"Title":"The Pearl","review":"I think that the book had good descriptions of the characters and events that happened throughout the coarse of the story. I just didn't think that the book was very interesting, and the plot could have been better, but all and all it was a good book, if you like dramatic stories about a family that gets caught up in tramatic and strenous situations. I am more an action/fictoinal type of reader. Though I would read it on a rainy day."},{"Title":"The Pearl","review":"I liked it very much it was very interesting. He put a lot of detail in his writing of The Pearl. You never knew what was going to happen next. In my opinion it was easy reading."},{"Title":"The Pearl","review":"I think The Pearl is a really interesting and knowledgeable story. This story gives us the right thing of life. How we chose our friends? When Kino gets the pearl all his friends and relatives are envy for him. How Kino and Juana struggled in their life? How they get the pearl, how they lost the pearl,and how they lost their son Coyotito? These all things gives us some message.About the ending of this story it's very sad because they lost their Coyotio. In the end there was only bad and sad things. I felt very upset about the ending of the story. Finally, I suggest that all teenagers have to read this fine and an excellent book for once in your life time."},{"Title":"The Pearl","review":"The pearl is full of symbolism, metaphor and irony. It can be read again and again. Each time the reader can find more beautiful language. It is shocking on first reading; on the second and third, the reader can notice how Steinbeck uses his knowledge of the natural life of Baja California and the Gulf of California to illuminate the story. If you were forced to read The Pearl in 8th grade, try it again. It improves with age."},{"Title":"The Pearl","review":"To begin with, this parable has a stunnig array of realism, symbolism, and allegorical nature all pocessed together as one. If you enjoy thinking about the deep meanings in a book, this one is for you! It takes a great deal of analyzing to fully understand the depth of this work. Many people did not enjoy this book because they simple read over it without purusing what each act of nature, or the flatness of each character to the modern day people. The symbolism is prominent if one is looking for it. Steinbeck states at the beginning that &quot;If this story is a parable, perhaps everyone takes his own meaning from it and reads his own life into it.&quot; In other words, this story is to be INTERPRETED. It is not to be read as escape literature. In this case, the reader would find the simple plot structure listless and pedestrian. I recomend anyone who enjoys interpretive literature to look into this one, i found it very captivating. On the other hand, if escape literature is your cup of tea, this book may not hold your interest."},{"Title":"The Pearl","review":"This book would probably only be good for those who like short books and easy reads. My option is that it would be even easier to not read it at all since it has no real plot. How many times can you be stabbed or clubbed and still live?"},{"Title":"The Pearl","review":"A family in Mexico is very poor and their baby gets stung by a scorpion.

Kino is determined to use the pearl to make a better life for himself and his family.

I don't recomend his book as it just drags on to much, I mean come on how many times does Kino actually get hit, killed, or beaten senseless, it went way off its head."},{"Title":"The Pearl","review":"Good on many levels. 1. Interesting engaging story. 2. Deeper story and significance. 3. Culture, family and community. 4. Good Steinbeck intro. 5. For kids or adults. 6. Quick read. If you're looking for an action novel, or a superficial read, this isn't the book for you."},{"Title":"The Pearl","review":"Don't have much time to write, so I'll make it brief- Steinbeck forces you to read the details. If you just skim THE PEARL you'll be left cold and untaught. I recommend you read it very carefully-it's worth it."},{"Title":"The Pearl","review":"I read the pearl as required summer reading for the ninth grade and must say it was not at all an interesting novel, nor should it be considered a great work. I have always been known as a VERY fast reader, yet the 90 paged Pearl took me 2 weeks. I believe it is simply boring. I do not encourage young readers to read this book, nor old readers for that matter, unless they are trying to fall asleep."},{"Title":"The Pearl","review":"I think this book illistrates a signifigant amount of love and compasion for people. I think Kino's and Juana's conflict was probably the key point of the story. Hands down, this is the best book I have ever read."},{"Title":"The Pearl","review":"I thought the book was o.k. I think I would recomend it. I didn't enjoy it as much because I had to read it for school this summer. I didn't quite think it was as bad as Johnny Tremain, but the good part about it was that it was short. I didn't understand the spirit hooplah though. Overall I thought it was an o.k. book. I would like to recomend &quot;Gifted Hands.&quot;"},{"Title":"The Pearl","review":"Personally, I loved this book. It was very detailed about the characters and their emotion/actions. It gives a true to life portral of human emotions. There is a lot of action in the story and some plot twists at the end. This was the first John Steinbeck book I've read and I would definately read some more...I would recommend this book to anyone, regardless of age."},{"Title":"The Pearl","review":"This is a great book, complaints of teenage readers notwithstanding. But this is not a plot-driven work; it is a literary masterpiece to be savored and distilled; to be read and re-read until the reader has finally understood that it illustrates the abuses perpetrated upon those who, unfortunately, are born and reared in poverty. It is a book that portrays the hopes of a man who longs for wealth because he thinks that it will render him a respected citizen among those who despise his race. Alas, how sad is his surprise when he realizes that money serves to bring the worst out of people: envy, greed, treachery, hate.... Ultimately, though, this is a book that shows us a family destroyed by the riches they yearned for, yet never expected to attain."},{"Title":"The Pearl","review":"The Pearl is one of my all time favorite novels. Steinbeck effectively illustrates the moral strength of his characters through economic depression. It depresses me however, to see such filth written about his works (obviously by people with a grade school education equivalent). Thankyou for the memories John..."},{"Title":"The Pearl","review":"A short novel with a deeper meaning to it. About human nature, a poor man's hopes and dreams, and other's envy and greed. Read it and your life will be richer. The language is simple but I think that adds to the beauty of the novel.

A man finds a pearl, gets his family, and son into a lot of crud, and then throws the Pearl away. Why doesn't he just sell it for 1,000 Pecos. It is somewhat reasonable.

Steinbeck wrote this rubbish to be made into a hollywood movie, and the hacked cliche ending makes M. Night Shamalas look like a visionary genius who takes risks and doesn't make stupid last second endings that make absolutely no sense.Now Steinbeck is arguably the best storyteller in post1492 America history. Read Grapes of Wrath, Winter of Our Discontent, Cannery Row, the Red Pony, East of Eden, Travels with Charlie, Tortilla Flat, Of Mice and Men, even To A God Unknown, before you even pick up this book if you must. And all you lazy teachers assigning this to their students, for shame, for shame.

There were some typographical errors and a bit of redundancy, but it had a certain quality to it that was great"},{"Title":"The Pearl","review":"Not the worst book I have reaf, but not the worst either. Steinbeck goes a little overboard on the detail, so much that it really bores the more adventurous-type reader into stop reading midway threw. But if you are a big fan of excrutiatingly immense detail for just about every scene, this book is a perfect fit for you. All in all, a decent book."},{"Title":"The Pearl","review":"Caveat: I'll admit I've never liked Steinbeck, so perhaps, nay, for sure this review is spat bifurcated.Kino, Juana, and little Coyotito star in one of the worst books ever written. I won't spend too much time discussing plot, but briefly, it's about an indigent, indigenous family who thrives, er, exists on fishing and pearl-diving. Kino, the man of the house, finds a beautiful pearl one day. It is supposed to be the panacea that brings him and his family out of their impoverished strife. It could buy his wife new clothes and SHOES! and send his son to school.Instead Steinbeck lets the pearl represent all that is bad, corrupt, evil and avarice. He paints Kino a fiend for wanting a better station for his family. I will not say the end is a fag's end, but let me say, Of Mice and Men ended in a similarly dismal note.How would Steinbeck address today's problems of poverty? I don't know, but I have a feeling his welfare policies would be well written (as far as diction goes) but substantially desperate."},{"Title":"The Pearl","review":"The book was okay untill the ending, I don't think a more unlikley stiuation could have been created."},{"Title":"The Pearl","review":"This small tale is based on a Mexican folk tale. The significance of the pearl of greed and the mayhem it creates in the simple lives of the people it touches is a story for any man any place.

The waving branches of the algae called to it and beckoned to it.\\" The crab scampers over it and covers it with sand, \\"And the music of the pearl drifted to a whisper and disappeared.\\" After all the havoc it had reeked.

Kino Treis to sell the pealr but he is not convinced at the prices he is offered so he refuses. In the end Kino detroys the pearl to rid the badluck and evil it brought to Kino's family. The good points about this book are that it is well writen and keep you intrest up high . The Bad Points about this book are the ending is not a happy one and that the author descripes certain things in his own opion."},{"Title":"The Pearl","review":"John Steinbeck, is the author of an excellent book, The Pearl, a book that had many lessons. There was a pearl diver named Kino who was very poor. He had a fianc&eacute; named Juana. One day, Kino went to do his daily diving and when he did he found a huge pearl. However, he did not know that it would later kill his son and bring him a lot of bad luck. He went to the city to sell the pearl, but nobody would buy it for they thought no pearl could be that big. They all thought that the pearl was fake. Then they wanted to kill Kino and his wife Juana. Later they had a son named Coyotito, however when they were running away, he got shot in the head by a searcher when he randomly shot his rifle it shot the little baby's head. Then Kino went back to his village and threw away his pearl. Then the music of the pearl and bad luck died down and disappeared.I liked this book because you never know what is going to happen. Also this family has trust in each other including the baby and they sacrifice their lives for each other. The little baby got shot instead of Juana. \\"I am afraid that only my baby will cry. You must see that he must not cry. He will not cry, and she raised her face to the baby's face. He knows, Juana said.\\" Both of them even trust the little one year old.\\"And the pearl settled into the lovely green water and dropped to the bottom. A crab scampering over the bottom raised a little cloud of sand, and when it settled the pearl was gone. And the music of the pearl drifted to a whisper and disappeared.\\" After the pearl was tossed the bad luck disappeared and never came back to them. I think this book tells that looks can be deceiving. I really enjoyed reading this book.My favorite part of the book was when Kino dove and found the gigantic pearl and him and Juana were discussing how they would get married in a church and their new son would go to a great school and be smart. My least favorite part was when Coyotito, the little baby, got shot in the head and sort of saved his mom. This was a great book."},{"Title":"The Pearl","review":"The PearlBy: Will KernBoring! That's the one word that I can use to describe this true but uneventful book. I mean it still had events, but lets just say they did nothing to make this book a good read. The book was also too predictable. You knew exactly when something bad are good was going to happen in the book. If something bad were going to happen then a \\"song of evil\\" would begin to play. If something nice was going to happen there either wasn't a song or it was a calm song that he would hum.It is nice that he would write a story that had been passed down for generations in this small little village, but he picked the wrong one. He should have picked one with more action and adventure to it. It was also unfortunate that in the end Kino becomes the bad guy, but learns a lesson that money is not always everything.John Steinbeck makes a mistake in making the family to blind in what is going on around them. Like when the doctor says the effect of the scorpion sting will come later and may cause Coyotito to become blind. So the doctor gave the baby a white powder in a gelatin capsule. The baby takes the pill, and the doctor says this will stop the pain although the baby seems to have no more pain. He says he will come back in an hour. So he does and for some reason gives the baby water with ammonia. Kino is unable to pay him at the time, but once he sells the pearl he will repay him. He makes a big mistake at that time. The doctor says that he should keep with him, in his safe. At that time Kino looks down at the floor where he has buried the pearl. The doctor realizes it and has a plan. He comes the night to steal it, but wakes Kino and is nearly stabbed. Juana wakes up and tells Kino that they must get rid of it or there will be evil and they will be destroyed. The book could have saved us a lot of trouble and ended right there but Kino refuses to get rid of it.Later in the book Kino sees Juana walking out towards the beach, he feels a sense of rage, she is going to get rid of the pearl. He sprints after her, and punches her in the face, and then kicks her. He leaves her and walks back up the beach. A man then comes to him in search for the pearl. He starts to fight Kino and he drops the pearl, but it does not matter because he slits the guy's throat and regains the pearl. For some reason Juana forgets all about what Kino has done to her and says that t hey must leave for he has killed a man. It would have kept my interest had there been a little more turmoil between the two, but Juana just shrugs it off. Kino is once again reminded that he should have sold the pearl for it is bringing him much more then he had ever imagined.This book does show us a good moral though. There are a lot of greedy people in the world, and if you are one of them you should probably read this book. I would not recommend it to those who like an action packed adventurous book."},{"Title":"The Pearl","review":"&amp;#65279;I enjoyed this book a lot. It is basically just a folktale written in a novelists viewpoint. It was so short, though, it took me about 2 hours and I thought that it could be classified as a novella.That basic storyline is that a fisherman who dives for pearls finally finds a \`perfect pearl', but it may lead to disaster...It was a fun little tale in the beginning, but in the middle and towards the end, it got very depressing and I didn't like it as much as I might have it wasn't depressing. The Bottom line is that if you don't mind depressing stories, and like folktales, you'll like this. Enjoy the folktale!A.A."},{"Title":"The Pearl","review":"This fable/fairytale as interpreted by Steinbeck sticks to popular themes of good vs. evil - and the nature of man when presented with wealth.A very poor family in Mexico faced with constant need - they've always managed and made do with what has come to them and been content.

And they do not come out of the experience without being hurt and damaged badly by it.I was struck by a familiar feel to the LORD OF THE RINGS - with Frodo and the ring and the insane, suspicious jealousy that overtakes the holder of the ring.A nice easy read."},{"Title":"The Pearl","review":"John Steinbeck's The Pearl focuses on the theme of goodversus evil. The main character Kino, a poor fisherman, and hiswife Juana, hope to find a life of comfort and happiness throughthe great pearl that Kino finds at the bottom of the sea. Thisdream is shattered after the tragic death of his son. This bookfocuses on man's dreams and hopes that can be destroyed by thegreed and evil within the world. When the town discovers thatKino has found the greatest pearl in the world, the townspeopleyearn to posses it, regardless of the price they have to pay andthe destruction that they will cause along the way.This book brought out the conflicting feelings in me. Attimes, I felt anger, revenge and disgust, and other times, Iexperienced sorrow, pain and loss of words. The author revealsthe two opposing sides in man that can be aroused when greedtakes over. I admire Kino and his wife for standing up to theevil people, and for not giving up even after Kino is attacked,stabbed and later, faces the burning down of his home. I alsofelt that Juana's support and love for her husband is verypowerful. She respects and obeys him throughout the entire storyand vice versa. They love each other in spite of the tragicevents in their lives.The Pearl made me think of the real dangers in life and howcareful we have to be with people.Sometimes, people who appearclose to us, like the doctor does wit Kino, can be our greatestenemies. Fortunately, Kino gains the insight to outwit him andhis desires to rob him of the pearl. Also, the pearl buyers aresneaky thieves that want to cheat him. We meet similar people inour world today that try to take advantage of the poor anduneducated in order to make profit.Often, people are taken advantage of because they areilliterate like Kino and Juana who hope to give \\"their son aneducation and to buy a rifle and have a wedding inchurch.\\"(p.24) I can recall a poor Mexican family that oncestood in front of me at Publix. I felt bad for them because theycould not read or write English. I wondered if their childrenwere getting the health care that Kino's son needed, butcouldn't get because they were poor. They reminded me of Kino'sfamily hoping to find a better life.If you enjoy reading adventure stories filled with dramaand suspense, then, you will love The Pearl. Steinbeck's simplewriting style makes this book easy to read and understand forpeople of all ages. This book teaches the theme of good versusevil and the greed in man. There are many morals in this bookthat help us to understand our world today. One lesson that Ilearned was if we could truly help one another than people likeKino and Juana would no longer exist."},{"Title":"The Pearl","review":"The Pearl is a story set in Mexico many years ago. The main character is Kino, a poor Indian during the time. He lives with his wife, Juana, and baby son, Coyotito. Kino is a pearl diver, who one day finds a giant oyster, which he immediately brings to the surface and opens. In the oyster, he discovers a beautiful pearl, which must be worth a lot. He is very happy and decides that now he can send his son to school when he is older and can officially be married in the church. He does not desire wealth, but a better life for his family.This is the beginning of his struggles with the pearl. The pearl brings on many surprises and causes turmoil Kino's, and his family's, life. Kino goes to seek out someone who will pay him a large sum for the jewel. Thieves and robbers come in search of him, and the pearl. Kino, Juana, and their baby are chased up the mountains by murderers who wish to steal the pearl. In the end, Kino and Juana, walk back into town together, and throw the pearl back into the sea.The symbolism of the pearl is very important in this book. A pearl is created in a living thing, unlike precious metals such as gold or silver. A pearl is caused to form because of irritation. This shows that things are not always what they seem to be. Kino believes that the pearl will bring him wealth to provide for his family, but the pearl ends up disrupting their lives. When the pearl is returned to the sea, it turns from ugly, to beautiful since this is its rightful place. The pearl does not create havoc in the sea and provides nothing but pure beauty. This is a wonderful story that shows the danger of man's greed, and what really matters in life."},{"Title":"The Pearl","review":"In Baja California, Mexico, there was a village called La Paz, which means peace. Bus was there really peace around the village without even tiny conflicts? A poor family, Kino, Juana and Coyotito lived in a brush house. Coyotito got bitten by a scorpion. They had no money to see a doctor. At least they can find a pearl and sell it. Fortunately they found the most beautiful and biggest pearl in the world. Does this pearl bring them the dark side or brightness as it looks beautiful?I give the rate of 3 for this book. It's a good book for young children to read. It gives the lesson for the kids- &quot;Be satisfied with who you are and what you have.&quot; I can't recommend that all the people should read it. I only recommend to those who like adventure books."},{"Title":"The Pearl","review":"I'm finding it difficult to say much about \\"The Pearl.\\" The tale is so simple and short that a large exegesis seems unnecessary. While I read this novella, I had a dim recollection that I read this sometime in the distant past. When I looked at some of the reviews on Amazon, I understood why. Most of the reviews on the site are written by young students, so I must have read this back in my early school years.\\"The Pearl,\\" written by none other than John Steinbeck, tells the tale of Kino and Juana, a poor indigenous couple in Mexico. Kino is a pearl diver who finds, one day, the pearl of the world. This pearl is the size of an egg and must be priceless. As soon as news spreads of Kino's find, evil descends on his family. Everyone plots against Kino in order to gain possession of the pearl. Kino is violently attacked, a local doctor tries to swindle Kino, and the local pearl buyers conspire to lowball him when Kino shows up to sell the pearl. Kino is determined to get a good price for the pearl because he has dreams for his son, Coyotito, as well as for himself. Eventually, Kino commits murder to protect the pearl, and when all of his property is destroyed, he and his family flee with the pearl.Steinbeck uses this tale to show how greed corrupts everyone, even amongst the lowest of the low. But Steinbeck also seems to be saying that the simple life is the best life. Although Kino and Juana have next to nothing, they still have a happy family life. When the pearl arrives on the scene, all is lost. Not only does Kino have to worry about external danger, his own sense of self becomes enslaved to the pearl. He beats his wife when she tries to throw the pearl in the ocean, and he is reduced to murder to protect his find.This is a good novella, comparable, in my opinion, to \\"The Old Man and the Sea.\\" I kept thinking about lottery winners as I read this slim book. I'll bet some of those people could tell some stories along the lines of what Kino and Juana went through, although to my knowledge, none of them have given away or disposed of their winnings. This is the kind of tale that teaches basic values, and should probably be reread every few years."},{"Title":"The Pearl","review":"I think that Jon Seinbeck's novel, The Pearl, was interesting. I thought that the beggining led into the story very well and there was a good plot line. It flowed well until the ending. I didnt like how The Pearl ended with Coyotito dying, and Juana and Kino going back into town. I felt like the story was missing something. But i guess that is my own interpretation. Steinbeck was writting more then a story, he was trying to express his beliefs and personal feelings on the matter. I think that the economy at this time also played a big part. It was the end of WWII, and money was a bigger deal to people.I think that the pearl represented a lot money, and kino found the pearl and then became distracted by it and was greedy and didnt care as much about his family. I thnk that Steinbeck had great ideas and should be commended for his work."},{"Title":"The Pearl","review":"In the Pearl by john steinbeck we see the transformation of a fairly happy family compose of Kino, Juana, and Coyotito whom goes from an ordinarli life to a very complicated one.Kino, until his son ilness, live a quiet and humble life.

Something like as kino was a master of living a humble life.Were as by finding the big pearl and sunddenly be faced with promise of rishes and good forture, he is insited by greed, death and percecution like he don't know how to handle his new found rishes.

It really showed me how wuch little things could drastically change or end your life with out notice."},{"Title":"The Pearl","review":"Steinbeck is certainly a master of short fiction. To say that this is a morality story would be an injustice. This story is more than that. It is a mirror held up to humanity wherein we can see how material riches bring out the best and the worst in our nature. His use of language is stunningly beautiful. Steinbeck is a storyteller in the highest sense of the word. Through his stories, especially this one, he shows us what its like to be human."},{"Title":"The Pearl","review":"i bought this book to read so i could be able to help my 12 year old daughter with her school project.the pearl is a good little book, short, but had some great points for the kids."},{"Title":"The Pearl","review":"I liked this book because It took me to a different part of the world and saw what the third world is like for people to have money but have something very valuable. And it was an easy read type of book. I liked how the author made the characters real and I was able to relate to how the characters felt when they where rejected from the doctors because the other person had more money then they did and were not really sickness."},{"Title":"The Pearl","review":"The PearlBy John SteinbeckDon JuanSeptember 20, 2002The Pearl by John Steinbeck is a story about a poor family near the Gulf of Mexico. The main character is Kino, the entire book revolves around him. Kino is the father of the family, Juana is the mother and Coyotito is the sick baby. Kino is a swimmer and searches for things in the Gulf. Juana is a housewife and takes care of Coyotito. John Steinbeck is a very interesting writer. He skips small words and starts some sentences with words like \\"because\\" or \\"then\\". I think the authors purpose of writing this is because he wanted to show how people react when they win big in the lottery or any other kind of thing you could win. Kino turns into a greedy man when he finds the pearl. He starts to live his life protecting the pearl.My favorite part in the book is when Kino and his family are chased. This is my favorite part because this is when most of the action takes place. Juana takes Coyotito up to the caves and Kino hides behind a wall and waits to attack these stalkers. Coyotito lets out a cry and the stalkers think it's a coyote and fire shots. My favorite character in the book was the neighbor, Tomas. He was supportive of Kino, but reminded Kino to not let the fame and fortune that he now has, go to his head. Tomas is also a swimmer. The Pearl is a very interesting book. The end is a bit predictable, but still interesting.I enjoyed this novel very much. It is one of my favorite books. The type of reader for this book would have to enjoy a book that makes the reader think. I had to go back and read a few parts over and over again, because I didn't understand them. It's a very short book, but makes up with great writing. I would recommend this book to another reader. I think it's a book that anyone could read. This book is enjoyable to read because it can be closely related to winning the lottery. I would recommend this book to anyone, even if they don't like to read."},{"Title":"The Pearl","review":"\\"The Pearl\\" by John Steinbeck is a very interesting and even shocking story at some points, that links symbols from the book in with everyday life. The book shows that beauty is not everything and can really be quite deceiving. Just because something is appealing to the eyes does not mean that it is good appealing beneath the beauty. The book shows suffering and pain as well as misconceptions. It also shows strengths and weaknesses found in the characters effected by the pearl.When Kino, the main character of the book, finds the pearl while working, as a fishermen, he is amazed by it's beauty, because of it's perfect shape, size, shine, and texture. Kino loves the pearl and wants to keep it. This part of the book shows that people often look at image instead of looking deeper inside to what really counts. Even though a pearl is an object and doesn't have human qualities the outside image is still deceiving, while having a beautiful outside though really has evil inside. The pearl brings bad luck to the family with it's health among other things. Kino shows a lot of affection towards the pearl, more so to it then towards his own wife. Kino is so protective of the pearl he turns to physical abuse on his wife, the pearl brings out the evil in Kino. I think the pearl also brings out how strong Kino's wife is, for standing up against the keeping of the pearl and trying to get it away from the family even though she was beat while attempting to.\\"The Pearl\\" is a great book that brings out a lot in the people that are around the pearl. I would recommend this book to anybody because it really gives a good view of how beauty is portrayed and how deceiving it really is. It also shows how it brings out inner demons, like it did with Kino. Mr. Steinbeck did a wonderful job writing this book and I think it is a book that everybody can link in to today's world."},{"Title":"The Pearl","review":"I am going to right off say that i do not really enjoy reading that much. The only time I ever want to read is when I am assigned something to read. However, a few weeks ago our english teacher assigned us the book Of Mice and Men, by John Steinbeck. I was not to interested in this book when I first got it, however as soon as I started reading it, I could NOT put it down. We were then assigned to read a novel of our choice, so I chose to read The Pearl, which is another book by John Steinbeck. I had heard of this book before so I thought that it would be good to try out.Imagine that you lived in a world where every step you had to watch what you were doing, becuase who knows you could be stepping on a scorpion that could sting you and kill you. Imagine living in a world where your job was to get up every morning and hope that you can find good things so that you can put food on the table that night for your family. Imagine that you had to worry about that everyday of your life, not knowing if you were getting food that day, or even that week, or not knowing if you had enough money to pay for the doctor to come and take care of your sick child. But then one day what if that was all to change...what would you do? Would you be happy if you had enough money to buy whatever you want, eat whatever you want, and have the doctor come to your house everyday if you really had to. Would you really be as happy as you might think? Read The Pearl and experience the adventure that this family did. This is a really good book i think for young mothers and fathers"},{"Title":"The Pearl","review":"&quot;The Pearl&quot; is a book in which it basically tells what one pearl can do to one person and his family. I liked this book because the suspense of finding a pearl while there are about fifty other people around you also trying to find pearls; and you turn out to be the one finding it is very exciting. This book is also a very good book because it describes what a person would do after they find a pearl and how desperate they would be. A person would risk anything for a precious pearl; even kill an innocent person. One more reason I like this book is because Steinbeck described the book in a way that you can actually imagine the settings and you might even be able to imagine yourself finding a big, precious pearl.&quot;The Pearl&quot; may be a good book, but there are also some parts that I disliked. I did not like the part when people would actually be so cruel and burn down someone's home. I did not like the part where Juana was doing what is the best for the family and Kino comes along and beat her for it. That is one of the things a person would do just to keep a little pearl. &quot;The Pearl&quot; is not the best book in the world, but it would show you what is more important: a little pearl or someone you really cared about."},{"Title":"The Pearl","review":"My daughter needed this book for an advanced placement literature class, so I ordered it and read it, too.

This story gave real instances that happen everyday to different people all over the world. He did a good job at keeping the book interesting. I was never bored at all throughout the book, from cover to cover. The book was filled with excitement and action. He didn't start the book out with a bunch of boring, meaningless details that no one really cares about. In the end of the book John ends it very tragically with the killing of his son Coyotito. Kino goes through many difficult situations in the book, and selects many different ways of acting in them. All this just shows that money does not mean happiness, and John Steinbeck did a great job at getting that point across in this book."},{"Title":"The Pearl","review":"This story is about a family that lived in a town in the north of Mexico. There were three members Kino, Juana and Coyotito. They are very poor and in the story Coyotito got stung by scorpion.

Kino decided to look for a more beatiful. Then he found a big pearl. Since that day, his family changed. Kino doesn't stay conformed with the price offer of the dealers and decided to go to the city searching for a better price. That part in my opinion is the most important because Kino and his family fight for what they wanted in a big adventure.

The pearl that he found was bad luck from the begining, and the book only gets worse. Steinbeck descirbes in great detail, but it takes him two to three pages to describe the kitchen sink! Also, the story is very depressing, and if you need an uplifting book, this is NOT the one to read. I have found that almost all of his work is like that, and find it unappealing.

They are beautiful, and they should begin to acquaint young minds with the evocative and descriptive power that words can have. Again, it bothers me exceptionally that the most scathing reviews of this novel have been written by youths.

The novel is a parable on how the obsession with wealth when put to the detriment of humane values such as love compassion othercenteredness becomes not a dream but a nightmare.It has much the same message as Matthew 6:19-34 that a man cannot serve God and money. Themessage is more like a man cannot serve his family and money and that a mans love for his family is more important as an evaluation of that man instead of wealth.Aclassic only outdone in my view amongSteinbecks works byThe Grapes of Wrath Of Mice and Men and The Red Pony"},{"Title":"The Pearl","review":"The Pearl: Novel ReviewGrade: A-Kino is a poor diver in The Pearl, and when he finds a magnificent pearl, evil and corruption soon threaten to consume him, and everybody he loves. John Steinbeck, the author, plays with his own variation on the good versus evil theme, threatening to make Kino the bad guy in the end. The good vs. evil theme has been a mainstay in books for hundreds of years, but it's been quite a while since I've seen a variation this original. What I really liked though was the stark simplicity of the novel. Steinbeck lays down his characters, gets the plot rolling, and wraps everything neatly up in 90 pages, although The Pearl has the lasting impact of a full-blown 600 page novel.Now there wasn't much I didn't like about the book, except that it leaves some questions to be answered. For example: was the white powder the doctor gave the baby Coyotito really bad? There are a few more small questions like that scattered around the novel that remain unanswered, but I'd still gladly recommend The Pearl to anyone who wants a short but thoughtful read. And as for the rest of you, who are thinking that the book sounds boring, fear not--The Pearl moves along fairly fast, and its own share of action, leaving even the most closed-minded of readers satisfied."},{"Title":"The Pearl","review":"I remembered what an impression this book left on me when I read it in high school, so I bought a copy to own and to read to my kids, ages 4, 6, and 8. Don't be deceived by how slender this book is. The story is vibrantly told with the descriptive style uniquely \\"John Steinbeck.\\" The story is about the complexities of wealth vs. the simplicity and innocence of \\"living on love\\" and not much money. This little masterpiece of Steinbeck's is more than fascinating enough to keep the attention of an adult and so descriptively-written a young child will hang on every word while experiencing a classic author, padding their vocabulary, and having a true taste of real writing."},{"Title":"The Pearl","review":"I was warned about the horribly tragic theme of this novel, but I fell in love with \\"Of Mice and Men\\", so I decided to crack open the shell and grab The Pearl as well.Admittedly, the sadness and sense of hopelessness of human dreams, similar to that found in \\"Of Mice and Men\\" pervades this novel. If you want to read something fun and light, then this novel is not for you and John Steinbeck is not the author for you.The plot is simple, like other Steinbeck's novels, but the emotional journey the heart and mind takes with this novel has no equal. \\"The Pearl\\" is yet another Steinbeck masterpiece, worth exploring time and time again."},{"Title":"The Pearl","review":"The Pearl is a classic Steinbeck literature. The writing is beautiful and is very descriptive. And the best of all about the book is the simplicity of the story told, rather a sad one. That's typical of John Steinbeck's books. I like the characters and how well constructed they are. The poor Mexican town gives me a feeling that it looks like a great place to live, at least from the American point of view. During the reading of The Pearl, I looked up the internet about pearl hunting, and it is quite fascinating. Although mostly outdated, the practice still exists today, even in the rivers of Ohio and Tennessee. The Pearl is a simple novel, short and sweet with only 90 pages. And the Steinbeck feel of the book goes a long way too. I want to make a mention of two situations in the book. When the doctor came to treat the baby, I really think that he caused the baby to get sick on purpose just to profit for the hell of it. The ending doesn't make sense, at least on practical level, because the pearl means money which brings security and comfortable living. Anyway, I know John Steinbeck wanted to make his book to have layers of figurative meaning, and he wholly succeeds in this department."},{"Title":"The Pearl","review":"I've been on a roll of reading things I really like, and the trend continues . . .*The Pearl* eats at you on a lot of levels. I used the word \\"eats\\" specifically because it is a book that makes you terribly uncomfortable. There is no solace in its chapters - the beginning is happy; the ending bleak.Kino is happy with his life - he thinks about his \\"ordinary morning, perfect morning\\" as the novella opens. He has so little, yet his happiness is complete until his child is bitten by a scorpion. It is really Juana's insistence that they go to a doctor that dooms Kino. Though the doctor never SAYS to Kino \\"You are an animal\\", Kino knows why the doctor refuses to treat Coyotito, and his anger at his own impotence begins to eat him alive. On some level, he believes that money, education will make him \\"human\\" to the eyes of others.It is the ultimate irony that the pearl, which represents money (at least on one level), transforms him into what he was so unjustly called: an animal. Kino's desire to protect his \\"chance\\" causes him to behave in ways that he never would have dreamed. He beats his wife, acting on instinct at the exclusion of emotion, and is willing to sacrifice his family for what he sees within the pearl. He kills with pleasure, and while the killings are at least partially justified, he is unsettled by his own savagery. Kino is what he never before was - Steinbeck uses the word \\"animal\\" to describe his behavior on multiple occasions as he attempts to defend his pearl. It is the ultimate regression of his character from something that is human to something that almost isn't.So, why does this unhappy parable make us so uncomfortable? Because it goes so against what we as a society believe. Prevailing thought tells us that if only our masses could have the opportunity to pursue education and money, life would be Utopia. Steinbeck shows us that human nature is a little darker than that - that even when we are fulfilled, contented people, the danger of getting everything we ever wanted still lingers at our door."},{"Title":"The Pearl","review":"Every time I read a book like The Pearl or Of Mice and Men I wonder how one author can convey so much subtext, emotion and meaning using simple sentences and one and two syllable words in such a short book. The Pearl is one of those books that will keep you reading on the plane after it has landed and everyone else has disembarked. The Pearl plays on many levels at the same time. On one level it talks of how simple and good people can never beat the established power system (a consistent Steinbeck theme). On another level it speaks about how pride and desperation can lead one to do acts that would otherwise be repugnant (another Steinbeck theme). It makes us think about how much we will sacrifice of ourselves to gain financial wealth, whether for ourselves or for those we love (Steinbeck again). Finally, we are all made to realize that in the end, all of our hates, loves, plans and schemes are nothing but footprints on a beach at low tide.The story is simple. Kino, a pearl diver makes an extraordinary find, a pearl of untold size and beauty. Prior to this point, Kino lives a simple life, one that is filled with beauty but it is a poor life. He sees his luck as a way to provide a better life for his family and to save those around him. However, he also sees that many around him want to cheat him of what he feels is the true worth of the pearl and thereby cheating Kino of his pride. It is here that things spiral out of control from happiness to tragedy.What makes The Pearl special is that so many of Steinbeck's other books are reflected in The Pearl. The themes present in The Grapes of Wrath, The Winter of our Discontent and Of Mice and Men resonate loudly here. Combined with Steinbeck's wonderful prose, it is a book which will have you thinking until the end."},{"Title":"The Pearl","review":"When Kino, a poor Mexican villager, brings up the Pearl of the World after one of his dives, he feels very fortunate; he dares to dream a glorious future for his young family. But the luminous pearl exerts a strange, malignant magic over the village; dishonest hispanics, gringos, and even worse--his own people. Joy turns sour, then bitter, as this blessing from the Gulf transforms his entire life by capturing the greedy imagination of his neighbors. What was meant as a gift, perhaps from God or the gods, quickly deteriorates into a curse.Is it wrong to wish to improve one's lowly station in life?Are simple natives not permitted to better the life of the next generation? Caught between the tenets of Christianity and holdovers of a pagan religion, the young couple struggles to understand the power of this Pearl. There is no limit to the atrocities committed to illegally acquire the treasure which is Kino's by right, as the pearlfisher who selected it from the sandy bottom. This is an excellent example of a Steinbeck novella--with pessimistic threads underlying the honest efforts of a simple, loving couple. Since the author tends to spotlight the darker side of human nature, this little book is definitely for adults, from 16 up. I consider it more serious than either &quot;The Red Pony&quot; or &quot;Of Mice and Men.&quot; A painful read but well worth it."},{"Title":"The Pearl","review":"John Steinbeck is considered one of the greatest American writers of the 20th century, and in this short novella it is manifestly obvious why that would be the case. The story is allegedly based on some real events, although Steinbeck himself admits that many liberties were taken in retelling it, even before he turned it into a book. Steinbeck's literary style is fluid and elaborate without being overbearing. The characters are extremely believable with each one possessing a high level of individual identity. At some points this characterization is taken a step too far, and it becomes hard to distinguish between the individual character and the personality type that he or she is supposed to represent. These instances are, however, rather rare.The story is completely imbued with social criticism and observation about the social structures and relations. Steinbeck has a talent of describing and exploring those relations without ever sounding preachy or shrill. Even though it is evident that Steinbeck does not approve of many of these relations, he is not aiming to provide a recipe for their reform or overthrow. He is an observer, albeit not a detached one.One of the main strength of this novella is the plot development. Each event follows naturally and almost inevitably from the other, and yet all along the reader is left wondering about what will happen next. Only a true narrative artist can reconcile these dueling tensions - too much inevitability and the novel becomes predictable, too little and it becomes random and unsatisfactory. Steinbeck manages to resolve these tensions with the utmost grace, in a way that makes it seem too easy.This is one of the best works of fiction that I have read in a long while. It is also a classroom example of what a good, well written and well developed novel ought to look like.Why no voting buttons? We don't let customers vote on their own reviews, so the voting buttons appear only when you look at reviews submitted by others."},{"Title":"The Pearl","review":"John Steinbeck writes with heart and muscle. Whether penning a lumbering masterpiece such as \\"East of Eden,\\" or a short parable such as this, he imbues character and setting with thought and feeling.Kino, a young husband and father in the Gulf town of La Paz, goes out one morning to dive for pearls. He is happy. He hears the song of his family in the trees, yet also hears the song of evil murmuring in the tail of a scorpion. His senses are tuned to the world around him, to his village in particular, and so it is that his discovery of a magnificent pearl comes as a sudden surprise and responsibility. Soon he and his family are threatened by the greed of doctors and priests, businessmen and busybodies. Kino's wife wants the pearl tossed back into the sea, but Kino cannot block his ears to the pearl's song of fortune, and he presses ahead with his own plans.Based on a Mexican folk tale, this story sings its own somber tune through the words of Steinbeck. It's a morality tale, an ode to hardworking men and women, and a reminder of the things that are most important. Like Pearl Buck's \\"The Good Earth\\" and Armstrong Sperry's \\"Call it Courage,\\" this short but powerful tale highlights regular people facing the challenges of greed and cowardice. Ultimately, it's a song of the family--a song Steinbeck sings often through his books."},{"Title":"The Pearl","review":"I thought The Pearl was a fabulous story. Written in John Steinbeck's wonderful style, and keen sense of creativity, this short book is a fast-paced, page-turner that easily held my attention from the first chapter to the very last. I couldn't put it down. The story is about an indigent man, his wife and their infant baby who live by the seashore subsisting on the few fish they catch using their old canoe. Once in a while they even find a small white pearl hidden in the local oyster bed that they sell to the local pearl dealers, and use the money to buy clothes and other badly needed items. It's a simple life, barely a hand to mouth existence, but there is also a finely spun web of rich culture that defines their small world, and John Steinbeck is a master at writing about such things. I thought the story was totally fascinating.Then one bright sunny day, the main character, a man named Kino, finds a gigantic pearl. Huge. No one has ever even seen a pearl as big as that before. The villagers call it The Pear of the World, and it could literally make Kino and his wife Juana rich beyond their wildest expectations. They dream of being married in a big, fancy church, educating their baby in a real school, and living a new life far beyond that of a thatched hut on the sandy beach. So Kino bravely musters up all his acquired wisdom, and he and his wife take the pearl into the city to sell it to the money slick pearl dealers. Only Kino discovers it's not so easy to unload a pearl of that size. It seems that big money is hard to get, and comes with big problems. And it's at that point that the story suddenly turns direction and takes off like a ballistic missile.There is an introduction to The Pearl in which you can read all about the underlying philosophy and highbrow meaning behind the story. I won't go into that in this review. But I suggest you read it to get a better understanding of the message John Steinbeck was trying to get across when he wrote this short story. And the book is short, probably the shortest book I've ever read. But I loved it, and I give the book five stars."},{"Title":"The Pearl","review":"The novella, midway in length between the novel and the short story, was a popular literary form in 19th-century Germany, where the writer and critic Paul Heyse put forward what he called the \\"Falkentheorie\\", or \\"falcon theory\\". Heyse's idea was that each novella should be distinguishable from others through a specific image, a physical object that not only played an important role in the story but which also had a symbolic meaning. (The name is taken from a story by Boccaccio which features a falcon). Steinbeck's \\"The Pearl\\" is a good English-language example of a novella in Heyse's sense.The story is set in the Mexican city of La Paz in southern Baja California, once famous for pearl fishing. A poor fisherman, Kino, finds a huge and valuable pearl, and dreams that it will bring him a better life. The town's pearl buyers, however, are part of a corrupt cartel, and will only offer him a price much less than its true value. A gang attempts to rob Kino of the pearl, and he is forced to kill a man in self-defence. Kino and his wife Juana flee into the mountains, hoping to make their way to Mexico City, but they are followed by those who would steal the pearl from them, and their story ends in tragedy. It ends with a disillusioned Kino throwing the pearl back into the sea.The pearl is not only the object at the centre of the story, but is also a symbolic image. Its symbolism is twofold. On the one hand, it represents the aspirations of Kino and Juana towards a better life. Their hopes are comparatively modest- they do not dream of a life of luxury, but rather of new clothes, a hunting rifle, a church wedding (the local church denies the sacrament of marriage to those unable to pay for it) and, most importantly, an education for their young son Coyotito. Kino, significantly named after the great philosopher and theologian Thomas Aquinas, may be illiterate, but he has a great respect for learning.On the other hand, the pearl also represents evil in the world, symbolising the sins of envy and avarice. Kino hopes that the pearl will change his life for the better, but it changes it for the worse. Wealth is not an unqualified benefit; riches are likely to provoke greed and jealousy in others, and may also corrupt the character of those who possess them. The wealthy characters in the story are all shown in an unflattering light- the pearl buyers, the hypocritical and mercenary doctor, who refuses to treat Coyotito for a scorpion-sting while the family are poor but is happy to do so when he believes they have become rich, and the priest, who cares more for the financial welfare of the church than he does for the spiritual welfare of his parishioners. The men who pursue Kino and try to rob him are vague, shadowy figures, but Steinbeck leaves us in little doubt that they are in the pay of the rich of the city. It is not his poor neighbours who resent Kino's good fortune, but rather the rich, European-descended citizens. These men despise him for two reasons, because he is poor and because he is an Indian, and cannot bear the idea that a stroke of fortune might bring him wealth. Even Kino himself becomes stubborn, and insists on keeping the pearl when Juana wishes to get rid of it for fear that it will bring further misfortune.A frequent image in the book is that of music. Kino experiences the world in terms of songs- not those written by others, but what Steinbeck calls \\"personal songs\\" in his head. When he is content with his life with Juana and Coyotito, he hears what is referred to as \\"the song of the family\\". When, however, the family unit is threatened, by the scorpion or by the robbers, he hears another song, \\"the song of the enemy\\". There is a third melody running through the book, the \\"song of the pearl\\", which may harmonise with either the song of the family or with that of the enemy, depending upon whether the pearl is seen as a blessing or a curse.Contrary to what some have stated, the book is not set in Mexico's distant, colonial past, but in the twentieth century. (This is made clear by references to the four centuries since the Spanish conquest, which occurred in the 1520s). Whether or not it is actually based upon a folk-tale, it is certainly reminiscent of one in style- unsurprisingly, as Steinbeck was deliberately aiming for this effect. The story is told simply, in a limpid prose with relatively short sentences. Although it is a short book of less than a hundred pages, it is not simply a terse recounting of the story; Steinbeck still finds space for some fine, poetic passages of descriptive writing, capturing the vivid colours and hazy light of the coastal landscapes of the Gulf of California. \\"The Pearl\\" is both the particular, and deeply moving, story of two young people and a symbolic fable with a wider human significance. Writing about this book, the English writer Richard Church stated that Steinbeck showed \\"that simplicity of spirit which is the most distinguished feature of a true poet\\"."},{"Title":"The Pearl","review":"Excitement and danger are just some of the things included in The Pearl. It takes place in a tropical island and was written by John Steinbeck in the 1930's. It is about a poor fisherman named Kino who finds a wonderful pearl. This pearl brings hopes of a better life for Kino his wife Juana and his baby Coyotito. The Pearl also brings forth danger... Some reasons why you might like this book are... It's thrilling! The danger and conflicts on every page make you want to keep reading to find out how they are resolved. It's extremely emotional because of the grim and heartbreaking decisions that Kino has to make. It is also emotional because of the emotions Kino is feeling. These are some reasons why you might like this book. A reason why you might not like this book is how Kino expresses his feelings through songs in his head. (ex. The song of evil, the song of the family, the song of the pearl) But that's not a big enough reason not to read this book. The songs, though annoying, give Kino a unique personality. That's why you should read The Pearl."},{"Title":"The Pearl","review":"'The Pearl' touches the core of human existence. It has that universal touch of the discerning artist who through his little story dares to reach out and embrace the fundamentals of man's story. Kino and Juana are a poor but happy couple who dream of a happy future for their baby Coyotito. Till one day Kino finds a rare and precious pearl that attracts the jealousy of their neighbours, the greed of the rich and the influential and the commercialization of the pearl merchants. The hitherto joyous and simple existence of the couple is banished and haunted by the evils of man Kino and Juana flee from their home. Pursued by greed and violence and in search of a fair price of the pearl and intoxicated by the material prospects of it Kino and Juana hold on to the pearl till Coyotito is killed by the accidental bullet. And they return home. Steinbeck delicately spins the threads of evil and greed and materialism in man and his society and touches upon the jealousy and injustice inherent in co-existence. In a symbolic finale Juana gives up the pearl but only after paying the heavy price!"},{"Title":"The Pearl","review":"A folktale of lower California is the basis for this narrative about Kino, a simple pearl fisherman, who finds an enormous pearl that promises to provide for all his family's needs.

DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME!"},{"Title":"The Pearl","review":"Although this book is small, as many have observed, its conciseness makes its messages easy to understand. The book is an example of how people of certain groups attribute bad happenings to the attempt of changing their position in society.

When Kito (the fisherman) finds the Pearl of the World, he sees in it a life far better than the one which his family and his people miserably live. Similar in style to Lord of the Flies, in the sense that the general theme is things uncontrollably and inexorably falling apart. The life of Kito and his family becomes far worse than before they found it. Instead of being wealthy and elite, they end up right back where they started, but in worse shape. The parable that Steinbeck tells is a wonderful description of today's greedy corporate society.

How anyone can give this book more than one star is beyond me.Choosing between suicide and a second reading would certainly mean my unpreventable loss of life."},{"Title":"The Pearl","review":"This is one of the classics that should be read and reread every few years. In only a few pages Steinbeck captures the role of good and evil in the world, the cycle of grinding poverty, the consequences of colonial domination and how sudden riches can be more destructive than the poverty it may alleviate.Like his ancestors, Kino is a poor pearl fisherman; his boat is his prized possession and has been handed down from his father. With his wife Juana and son Coyotito, he lives in the poorest section of the village and they barely manage to eke out a living. All this changes when Kino finds a glorious pearl of great value. The evil forces conspire to give him a low price for the pearl, people try to steal it and in order to defend himself and his family, Kino is forced to kill several attackers. Unfortunately, this is after one of the thieves kills his son so in the end, Kino throws the pearl back into the ocean in the hope that the evil goes with it.Although everything is so intertwined that the story moves smoothly, there is a great deal about life embedded in this story. It is a literary classic that should be required reading in all high schools."},{"Title":"The Pearl","review":"In my opinion this book was one of Steinbeck's better pieces of work. The two main characters in the book are Kino, a Mexican pearl fisher, and his wife Juana the mother of their only child. Although these two characters are very closely related because they are husband and wife it is really much deeper than that. One would think that Kino would be a very strong individual because he is on a boat all day long battling the sea looking for the pearls. You would also think this because he talks about the song of the family and the evil music of the enemy. When in reality he is very strong but when it comes to being emotional and having to think quickly he is not really the man for the job. Then you look at his wife Juana and she is the typical mother. When the scorpion bit her son Coyotito she knew exactly how to act. You see Coyotito was lying in his cradle when Kino noticed a scorpion crawling down the rope that attached it to the ceiling. Kino knew that he had to do something so he started to slowly move towards the cradle. Then suddenly Coyotito rocked the cradle and the scorpion fell from the rope and landed right onto his shoulder. When Kino had seen the scorpion fall he dove to try and catch it but he was too late. Juana quickly grabbed the baby and started to suck the venom from Coyotito's shoulder. She knew that she had to get him to the doctor but the only one was in town and she knew that he would not see him because he never deals with the people that live on the other side of the brush fence. Despite all of this she had to try so she decided to go to the doctor herself. I really liked this book even though it was not really fast paced it was very catching and page turning. I would really recommend this book to anyone who likes John Steinbeck because it is one of his classics."},{"Title":"The Pearl","review":"I am Naomiki from Japan. Now, I am living in Pacific Grove, and I am studying English as an ESL student in the Monterey Institute of International Studies, California. I have studied English in California for the past three months. I read this book because I am studying English. Moreover, John Steinbeck is very popular in this area where I live now. I like this book very much because the story is very simple. In addition, there are many things to think about. The main characters in this story are a poor fisherman, Kino, and his wife, Juana. The story begins when his baby, Coyotito, is stung by a scorpion. After that, a story filled with sorrow is developed. It could be an emotionally exciting story for readers. I recommend The Pearl for everybody as well as ESL students. I think this is a very suggestive book about life.

Unfortunately, the pearl only creates havoc in the life of Kino's family. With his home burned, after nearly had the pearl stolen, and after being assaulted, the family to flees the vilage with the pearl. After the family could run no longer, the pearl became a potential source of wealth that never came to fruition.Perhaps the fact that the story is rather cliche that makes it so unpopular. In some ways, the story is hard to visualize.

The introduction of The Pearl begins with the quote, \\"If this story is a parable, perhaps everyone takes his own meaning from it and reads his own life into it.\\" This saying indicates that many lessons can be learned from The Pearl.Different people will take different messages about life from The Pearl. One critic suggested that when Kino found the pearl, this represented people seeking knowledge of humanity (Ross). However, this individual concluded that the pearl actually prohibited them from growing as humans. According to another person, the pearl symbolized evil to Kino and his family (Ross). Another individual believed that the pearl was a \\"questionable satisfaction (Ross).\\" Many say that John Steinbeck implies it is wrong to be above animals and closer to God (Ross). Thus, it is a sin to desire the knowledge and self-respect that will bring someone closer to God. The Pearl is a rich novel in which the individual is forced to draw a message about his or her own life. The many different messages people have inferred from The Pearl show that this novel has many diverse themes.As other individuals who have read this tragic novel, I too have perceived a theme that can be applied to my own life. I believe John Steinbeck is trying to demonstrate the power of greed. At first Kino was happy and content with his family and his prized canoe. When he first found the pearl, all he could think about was using it to heal his injured son. However, as time progressed, Kino wanted more and more. He dreamed of all the things he coveted and could now have because of the pearl. By the end of the novel, he had lost everything he had valued most, including his beloved son, as well as the pearl. To me, the theme of The Pearl is to take what God gives you, and to be content with that. This theme can be applied to my own life, as well as Kino's. I should try not to covet things I really don't need, and to be content under any circumstance. I should take what God gives me, and not long for more. That way, I will be happy under any circumstance. This theme is what The Pearl has reminded me about my own life.I have taken a different meaning than many others have while reading The Pearl. I believe John Steinbeck is telling us not to be greedy and long for worldly treasure, while others say Steinbeck is telling us not to try to increase our social class. We all take different meanings from a piece of literature. We identify most closely with the one that will affect us in our own life. People, in general, will take a message from a piece of literature and apply it to their own lives. In the case of The Pearl, people take many different meanings from the same pages. These themes have the power to affect and change the lives of those people that read them.BibliographyRoss, Jeremy. \\"ClassicNote on The Pearl,\\" ... ."},{"Title":"The Pearl","review":"This book shows the ravaging that avarice can cause a man and his family. Sounds exciting, doesn't it? Perhaps it would be, if it were handled by a better author. The story drags along and describes every last movement, with virtually no dialogue or action. The ending was the only good part, because it was hardly expected, but the rest of the book was a huge dissapointment. I hope nobody will read this book for pleasure, because the entire plot could be summarized in just one paragraph. The rest of the ninety pages is unneccessary description that just defers readers"},{"Title":"The Pearl","review":"i'M A GIRL OF 15 YEARS OLD THAT LIVE IN NEW YORK CITY, THE BOOK THAT I READ IS NAMED &quot;THE PEARL&quot; WRITTEN BY JOHN STEINBECK, TJIS STORY IS FICTION BUT IS VERY NICE STORY AND I SURE RECOMENDED, BECAUSE, THIS BOOK IS ABOUT A POR FAMILY THAT LIVED IN BAJA CALIFORNIA {MEXICO}.THE MAINS CHARACTERS ARE KINO,JUANA,AND THEIR BABY'S CHILD COYOTITO,THAT LIVED IN A BRUSH HOUSE AND KINO WORK AS A FISHER ALSO LOOKING FOR PEARLS THAT WILL HELP HIM AND HIS FAMILY TO LIVE BETTER, THEY MIGHT BE POOR BUT HAPPY,BECAUSE THE ONLY THING TO SURVIVE IS AN OLD CANOE THAT HAVE BEEN ONTHEIR FAMILY FOR CENTUARYS.BUT WHEN KINO FIND THE PEARL THEY WON'T BE HAPPY ANYMORE.BUT IF YOU REALLY WANT TO KNOW ABOUT THIS FAMILYAND WHY THEY ARE NOT HAPPY ANYMORE WITH THE GREATEST PEARL, YOU SHOULD READ IT,IS VERY NICE, INTERESTING AND ALSO THAT BY READING IT YOU WILL LEARN A LOT OF GOOD THINGS THAT WILL HELP YOUR WHOLE LIFE."},{"Title":"The Pearl","review":"I had to read this book for a summer reading for Honors English. Althought the book is very short, it felt like it took an eternity to get through the first chapter. It wasnt bad though. In the book, Kino, Juana and their son Coyotito are pretty poor, until one day Kino finds a pearl in the Gulf. And basically after that, Kino is driven crazy from the pearl; bad things such as people trying to rob him, their hut burning down, and the baby was killed, but Kino seems obsessed after a while. He refuses to give up the pearl, which the pearlers said was worthless because it was too big. I found the last chapter the most intriguing. One drawback I found was that Steinbeck describes EVERYTHING in such detail, which probably wasnt necessary. But overall.. I say its pretty good."},{"Title":"The Pearl","review":"This is a depressing story of the dark side of human nature.

This book was, how can I put it, it was not enjoyable for me to read, but it is enjoyable to think about. The premise, the plot, the characters and their actions are all really beautiful upon recollection. I just didn't enjoy reading it. it seems as if Steinbeck used this novelette as one long exercise in imagery. He describes everything to death and I had to force myself to focus. But it is a beautiful book. I would recommend it, though not to the backstreet-boy-listening-glitter-fingernail-polished-teen-magazine crowd."},{"Title":"The Pearl","review":"This audio recording, while on cassettes, is a huge boost for our students whose primary learning style is auditory."},{"Title":"The Pearl","review":"As a fan of Steinbeck, I had high hopes for The Pearl. Unfortunately, I found the moral of the story to be disappointing and disheartening: Poor people must remain poor. This message is etched in Of Mice and Men too, but at the very least, Lenny and George's dream was viable. In The Pearl, it is clear from the start that there is no hope for Kino and Juana, so I read a story with no twists and turns. Moreoever, there is an element of magic in The Pearl, and I don't mean this in a good way. I like fantasy and I like Steinbeck, but they really do not mix."},{"Title":"The Pearl","review":"John Steinbeck's version of The Pearl comes from a tale he was told while researching the Amazon with his good friend John Rickets. His surpreme telling of the story is like no other. My personal taste is not of stories of this nature but I was very enthralled and deeply pulled into the story. I've never read any of Steinbeck's other works which is a travesty in itself. This story is an easy quick read of good literature that anyone can really enjoy. If you're looking for something quick, well written and interesting this is the way to go."},{"Title":"The Pearl","review":"This book is perfect for teenagers. Very well narrated. Not too long.

The beginning was a little boring but after a little bit of reading it got very interesting because it takes a simple story and makes it complex. The story is about a man named Kino who lives a modest life with his wife and infant son Coyotito. Kino is a pearler and when he finds &#8220;The Pearl of the World,&#8221; his life changes for the better. It turns out that the pearl brings only bad luck. I think that this book is well suited for many different age groups, and has a little for everybody."},{"Title":"The Pearl","review":"The Pearl by John Steinbeck was a book about a man, Kino and his wife, Juana and their baby son Coyotito. His family was very poor in Mexico. The story began with the family waking up and finding a scorpion that had bitten the baby, Coyotito, Kino and Juana couldn't pay a doctor to cure their son, so Kino tried to get money. He did this by going under water and looking for a pearl to sell. He found one, a pearl like no other. The conflict is that the pearl buyers thought that the pearl was valueless but Kino disagreed. So he tries to find a people to buy the pearl for a reasonable price. The plot is getting money for Coyotito to live and be cured. The family went through many obstacles to sell the pearl. I would recommend this book to people who like easy, fast reading books."},{"Title":"The Pearl","review":"When I read the pearl I was very excited that this book was an adventure. When Kino ,and his family were introduced i knew from the begining that was when i knew the great adventurehas begun. This book shows me how money can change you whole life style and personality.Kino and his wife Juanna,and there son coyotito lived in Mexico. Kino was a pearl driver,and Juanna was the caretaker of the home and the family.One day in mexico while coyotio was sleeping a scorpion bit him on the arm. They thought the baby wasn't going to live so the next day the family went to the sea to see if Kino could find any pearls to help there baby. That was when Kino found the pearl of the world. He had great ideas on what he was going to spend with the pearl."},{"Title":"The Pearl","review":"The book \\"The Pearl\\" is a story told to teach a lesson or send out a message. Like in this book Kino was one of the main characters. He was not smart and very poor. Then one day he was out diving for pearls, like usual and found a huge pearl. Then all of a sudden everyone wanted to be his friend. I think this book shows how materialism destroys; also that love can give someone a lot of courage (He kept looking for pearls for his son and wife). It shows how people or animals usually go for things weaker than themselves, that knowledge is power which people take advantage of. \\" The Pearl\\" also shows how dreaming is good until it begins to mess up your life (Kino starts to get greedy and everything begins to go wrong). This book shows and teaches a lot of lessons that actually happen in real life and people learn the hard way just like Kino."},{"Title":"The Pearl","review":"The Steinbeck review is the book called the Pearl. The Pearl was the first book that I have read this year. When you judge the book by the cover you might get turned off by the book. Sorry to say I did. Well the first page was so exciting. When the narirrator is naming the places were the baby sleep and his wife beside him I get a pictured of this little house. I see a 1 bedroom house, but the ones back in the day. Sort of like a cabin. With the wood floor with no carpet down. This book really take you back. Also when I continued to read the book gave me a feel on how the people were. They don't really notice you until you get something that's worth something. I seen how one Pearl had changed kino and his whole family veiw about the world. They killed for this Pearl and was on the run for this pearl and kino could not let it go. No matter what troubles it brought and no matter how hard he had to fight. Kino couldn't let his wife and son down. He wanted his son to go to school and that ment keeping the pearl and everything that came with it. End the end they just found out that they went in circles. The one thing that they really vauled was gone. All the troubles that came with the pearl ment loosing his son. Loosing his son and all his own dreams for his son."},{"Title":"The Pearl","review":"I thought this book was pretty good. It supplied many twists and turns and it also kept me interested all through it. First, Coyotito was bitten by a scorpion. The doster would not help them because he didn't want to bother with that poor family. But when he heard that they had found &quot;The Great Pearl,&quot; he offered his advice to the two parents, Kino &amp; Juana, right away. They excepted the offer, but did not pay and ran away once they saw that their house had been burned to the ground. Three people had been following them so they tried to climb a mountain to escape, but no luck. So when the family was in a cave on the mountain and Kino was getting ready to attack, there had been a small cry from the cave above. One of the three men shot a bullet up to the cave. The family then worked their way back to the town. They put Coyotito in the ocean because he died when the bullet struck him in the head.

Our English teacher sure loved it, I don't know what was going through her head. Not only is it boring, the moral is so head-scratchingly complex that it is simple beyond words. This book digs into reality and comes up with dysfunctional characters in a completely pessimistic view of the world. What the author was trying to accomplish was realization of what can happen when you're not compassionate and greedy. Yet Juana, Coyotito and Kino demonstrated something more relating to hell. Certainly do not read this if you want a happy ending, for there is none. However, despite the mediocracy of this book, others by John Steinbeck aren't nearly as bad."},{"Title":"The Pearl","review":"I believe The Pearl is a book that could have had great potential, if it would not have been so depressing.

It is well-written, and Steinbeck effectively brings his point (what greed can do to you) across with this simple story.However, I have mixed feelings about it. It is written in the form of a parable, and this means that the story exists only for the sole purpose of bringing the point across. Like most parables/fables, the characters are 2 dimensional, and you can easily group most of them under the categories of &quot;Good&quot; and &quot;Bad&quot;. This may put off some readers, who might find it rather boring. So if you want a more &quot;filling&quot; read, skip this.Three stars to be fair.

I liked this book because the suspense of finding a pearl while there are about fifty other people around you also trying to find pearls; and you turn out to be the one finding it is very exciting. This book is also a very good book because it describes what a person would do after they find a pearl and how desperate they would be. A person would risk anything for a precious pearl; even kill an innocent person. One more reason I like this book is because Steinbeck described the book in a way that you can actually imagine the settings and you might even be able to imagine yourself finding a big, precious pearl.&quot;The Pearl&quot; may be a good book, but there are also some parts that I disliked. I did not like the part when people would actually be so cruel and burn down someone's home. I did not like the part where Juana was doing what is the best for the family and Kino comes along and beat her for it. That is one of the things a person would do just to keep a little pearl. &quot;The Pearl&quot; is not the best book in the world, but it would show you what is more important: a little pearl or someone you really cared about."},{"Title":"The Pearl","review":"I found this book an absolutely mavolus read.

It is only six chapters long. The plot is exciting but you can probably guess what will happen at the end.Steinbeck says that it is a Mexican folk tale. The story takes place in La Paz, Mexico in the early 1900s. The main character is Kino, a poor pearl diver. All of his family before him had been pearl divers, too. He tries to make a living for his wife Juana, and their baby Coyotito by selling the pearls he finds.Early in the book, Coyotito gets bitten by a scorpion. To keep the poison from spreading, Kino and Juana go to the doctor. He will not treat their baby. He calls Kino a 'Indian boy'. Kino returns home, rejected.Later that day, Kino goes out to sea to dive for pearls. After he returns to the surface, he has a huge clam. He sees something sparkling inside. He opens the clam and inside is a pearl 'as perfect as the moon and as round as a seagull's egg'.The pearl brings much luck. Both bad luck and good luck. The pearl brings fortune and misfortune. Many things happen to Kino, Juana and Coyotito when they have 'the pearl of the world'. I recommend this book to young readers, like myself. I thank my teacher Adam for making the class read this book and for making me write this review."},{"Title":"The Pearl","review":"I have ready a variety of books over the years, and I think I will always remember this one for its suspense. I didn't really enjoy the story itself, yet the anticipation Steinbeck creates in it is excellent, therefore making it a pretty good novel."},{"Title":"The Pearl","review":"John Steinbeck's short novel &quot;The Pearl&quot; (1947) is unusual in that the book appeared after Steinbeck wrote a screenplay for a film of the same name. The film was released to coincide with the publication of the book. The novel is short, deceptively simple, and deservedly famous. It is based upon a Mexican folk tale and tells the story of a poor family who become, potentially, wealthy by the discovery of a pearl of rare size and beauty. This sudden wealth does not result in happiness.Steinbeck sets the stage with a short, two-paragraph preface introducing the main characters: &quot;Kino, the fisherman, .. his wife, Juana, and ... the baby, Coyotito.&quot; Steinbeck describes the story as &quot;a parable&quot; in which, &quot;perhaps everyone takes his own meaning from it and reads his own life into it.&quot;Kino, Juana and Coyotito are poor and and live in a simple thatched house. The baby is bitten by a scorpion and Kino and Juana become concerned for his life but have no money to pay a doctor. Kino miraculously finds a pearl of great worth and the couple dream of a better life. But from the outset, the pearl provokes jealousy and violence and leads to great unhappiness for the little family.I was moved by the figures of song and music that appear throughout the story. We are told at the beginning that Kino's people &quot;had been great makers of songs so that everything they saw or thought or did or heard became a song.&quot; Kino hears in his heart various songs throughout his book, the most important of which is the &quot;Song of the Family&quot; or the &quot;Whole&quot; which celebrates his life with his wife and baby. Other songs that figure prominently include the &quot;Song of Evil&quot;, the &quot;Song of the Sea&quot; and the &quot;Song of the Pearl&quot;. It is interesting to follow the song imagery as the story progresses.The other part of this story that most struck me were the scenes of nature -- of the water and mountains. There is a theme of wandering that comes through poignantly in the last part of the book in which the family struggles through mountains and valleys in an attempt to evade stalkers who are pursing them for the pearl. This last portion of the book includes much moving writing.Many people read this book as part of an intoduction to American literature in high school or college. The book is accessible and short and is a highly appropriate way to get to know a major 20th Century American novelist. Still, I remember how easy it is to dislike a book forced upon a reader when young. In my own case, I did not read this book in school (I read other Steinbeck) and only came upon it recently too many years later. In any event, it is a short and beautiful story that glows with the many colors and ambiguities as did the pearl which Kino discovered and which inspired the book. This is a lovely work of American literature which the reader will enjoy getting to know."},{"Title":"The Pearl","review":"While I won't go so far as to say that this is Steinbeck's best book, I will say that it is one of his most compelling. I read almost the entire thing in one sitting. Although I realize that this isn't exactly an epic feat considering that book is only 118 pages long, it was the first Steinbeck book that I found myself literally unable to put down. I had to know what was going to happen to Kino and his family. The story always went in fresh directions and there was no telling how it was going to end.I see some similarities between this book and The Grapes of Wrath. Both stories involve simple innocent people being taken advantage of by ruthless merciless authorities who live charmed lives, who effortlessly outwit the protagonists, and from whom the innocent can find no refuge. The same sense of injustice, the same bitter rage, cries out from both books. The both place the same emphasis on the &quot;fambly&quot;. And both books involve the ultimate sacrifice being made by the most innocent of innocents. If I had to pick between the two I would say that Grapes in the better book. Being longer, it naturally explores its themes with more depth and complexity, although I hardly agree with the implication that communism was the answer for these migrant workers. In The Pearl, Kino's true enemies, who attack him in the night and try to steal his pearl, are left conspicuously faceless.The Pearl is like a beautiful rough sketch done in pencil. It's very abstract and deliberately fable-like. The writing and the style of the story also reminded me a lot of The Old Man &amp; the Sea in the way both books almost religiously embrace simplicity.I only read the story for the first time a few days ago. As a fable, I haven't really yet considered all the symbolic meanings and allegorical references in the story. I haven't yet considered, for example, the implications of the fact that all the &quot;competing&quot; pearl buyers actually all work for the same man and are in league with one another. An intriguing idea, but who are these people? I can't help thinking that Steinbeck is pointing a hidden finger at some real &quot;pearl buyers&quot; somewhere out there in the world. Isn't that what all fables and allegories do?? Anyway, as I was reading I didn't bother much with these sorts of questions. I leave those sorts of things to rumble around in my head till sometime later when I'm not busy."},{"Title":"The Pearl","review":"The Pearl, a very suspensful and breathtaking novela written by John Stienbeck, captures the attention of all readers. It takes place in Mexico around 1875. Kino, a poor fisherman, his wife, Juana, and their son, Coyotito, all fall in the hands of danger when Kino finds the &quot;Pearl of the World&quot;. Some great things can only do danger to a family, as in this great, inspired book. This book is a masterpiece to anyone who will be willing to read it; if you are contemplating reading this novela, I highly encourage you to do so! It opens your eyes to a whole different life and society, and yet we can understand their problems in terms of our life today. This book is definitely a book for almost any age, so get your hands on this magical book today!"},{"Title":"The Pearl","review":"The pearl is a book that helps identify human greediness and the selfishness of all people. This is a very intreging book that all readers are easily to relate to. In this book the people who were very poor and didn't have much to choose, from so whatever they had they made good use of it. The wealthy tried to take over the poor by looking down on them,and at one special moment the poor had something great the wealthy wanted so they tried to trick the poor into giving them the great thing.

After reading this story you will see that evryone is created equal,but some don't seem to think so at all."},{"Title":"Quantum: A Guide for the Perplexed","review":"I became interested in quantum theory after reading Brian Greene's \\"The Elegant Universe\\" about six months ago; since then I have gone to some lengths to find a book that would explain quantum theory in a way that was non-formal enough for me to understand but not excessively simplified. Until recently, I hadn't found any thing that fit this description -- until, that is, I ran into this book at my local book store. It is BY FAR the best explanation of quantum theory for someone who is relatively (or even completely) unfamiliar with it. The author explains the theory in a step by step fashion, not leaving anything implied or unsaid, but in no way is insulting to one's intelligence. As a philosophy grad student, I especially appreciated the chapter on the various interpretations of quantum theory, including the 'many-worlds' interpretation that reminded me very much of David Lewis's metaphysical system (in which all possible worlds actually exist somewhere). I bought this book at 10:30 p.m. and had read half of it by the time I went to bed, and finished the rest of it the next day. It is that good! Highly, highly recommended."},{"Title":"Quantum: A Guide for the Perplexed","review":"This book is beautiful in all aspects. It is very well written, interesting and has great illustrations. The author takes a very complex and many times seemingly illogical topic and makes it both understandable and interesting. We are also given alternative views and told when the state of the art falls short of understanding. I would like to see a second edition in 10 years covering new advances in the topic. One of the best books I have seen in science in the past few years."},{"Title":"Quantum: A Guide for the Perplexed","review":"This is a very good book for the math-impaired know-something-but-not-much crowd. I took a semester of physics (mechanics) in college, and have read \\"A Brief History of Time\\" and watched the PBS thing on string theory, and something about quantum physics on the Discovery Channel, and decided that I wanted to know more. Being over 50 with an aging brain, I needed something that wasn't too technical, that didn't go too fast, but wasn't a children's book, and this was it.The first half of the book covers some history and the discoveries that made the development of quantum physics necessary. Also covered is the \\"weirdness\\" that seems to occur in the microscopic (quantum) world. I'll have to admit that on first reading, I only 'got' about 75% of what the author was presenting. If I read it again, I'll probably get more. And this is why I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5.The second half of the book is not quite as brain intensive and covers speculation on the WHY of quantum physics. (Yeah, weird, huh? They know how it works, buy not why it works.) In addition, some particle physics is covered, an overview of quarks and stuff, the effort toward a unified field theory (including a bit on string theory), some really cool discoveries, some unexplainable discoveries (like negative energy), why transistors and MRI's work, and quantum computers.I would like to have this book on my shelf so I could offer it to my friends to read. I will probably re-read parts of this book in the future. I wish I read this book 35 years ago."},{"Title":"Quantum: A Guide for the Perplexed","review":"This book has one of the best presentations of Quantum Mechanics that I've read. It explains three to four questions deep on most all concepts. The author seems to anticpate your next question and then deals with it a few pages later. The historical background leading up to the current theories is excellent without getting bogged down. He cuts to the heart of the priciples and allows you to understand the difference between wave probability and actual quantum behavior at any given instant. He then goes on to practical applications that take advantage of this strange behavior. Now I won't have to go to my grave without a decent understanding of the current state of the theory of matter."},{"Title":"Quantum: A Guide for the Perplexed","review":"I love quantum mechanics. I just don't understand it. It is to me like embracing yes and no at the same time, like believing and not believing in the same instant, like being and not being as one. Yes, Virginia there is something beyond our understanding. And the wonderful thing about the postmodern world is that we know for a certainty (in as much as we can be certain about anything) that we really don't understand this world we have been thrown into. QM proves it. As Al-Khalili points out again and again, even the top physicists turn away when certain questions are asked and let them pass because they have no answer.But I don't think it really matters what we think. The plain truth of the matter is that from our perspective as macro-creatures in a macro-world, with macro-minds and macro-mind modules molded by the evolutionary mechanism for a macro-world, quantum physics just doesn't make sense--or I should say, it makes good sense if we ignore the fact that the sense it makes is totally different in some very fundamental ways from the world in which we live.Einstein understandably abhorred the spooky action at a distance--the strange entanglement of particles which has no basis in our conception and no basis in any science prior to QM--and worse yet, no explanation. (We prove things we don't understand.) As Al-Khalili makes clear no one knows how to account for the fact that no matter how far apart two entangled particles get, they seem to be in instantaneous \\"communication\\" with one another. Theoretically they could be on opposite sides of the universe. Well, the phrase \\"opposite sides of the universe\\" is meaningless, as is so much of our terminology when applied to the very, very large or the very, very small.And \\"communication\\" is the wrong word since instant communication would in effect be information moving in excess of the speed of light, which is still impossible. (I wouldn't bet the ranch on it staying that way, however.) Yet, what other word is there? No one knows! Measure the spin of one entangled particle and you can bet that ranch that the other particle will have the predicted spin. Hocus-pocus, abracadabra--or something like that.All of which tells me--all of what little I know about quantum mechanics--that the world is not as we think it is, and that down, down the dimensions to a very deep, deep \\"place,\\" way, way tinier than we can imagine, way, way tinier than the Planck limit, there is--well, by definition, zero, but by imagination possibly a wondrous world so far beyond our ken that it might as well be magic. Indeed, it is surely beyond our notions of magic whatever, however, wherever, whenever it is.Despite the wonderful color photos and drawings and fanciful artwork, and despite the detailed and even laborious explanations, I am afraid that Al-Khalili's book is not going to unperplex the perplexed. Frankly, QM cannot be understood; it can only be appreciated. And it can only be fully appreciated by those who understand the math. This book, in keeping with a long-standing book-biz tradition contains no math, or at least very little. Well, Schrodinger's equation appears on page 63, and is parsed, as it were, but not solved. It's really there more for decorative effect than anything else, as part of the artwork.But quantum mechanics can be used. The amazing thing is that applications based on our understanding of it are used everyday all over the world in lasers, computers, CDs, DVDs, rockets to the moon, etc. In other words, it's the same old story. We know enough to employ the ideas for our benefit, but not enough to come to a full understanding or a final theory. My guess is we never will. Scientific knowledge expands like a widening circle in a pond of water as we know more and more about the very large and the very small and the very distant in time and space; but the pond is unimaginably large, large beyond the limits of our senses and our instruments, possibly infinitely large. And so the circle expands and expands but never reaches the shore, possibly because there is no shore.Incidentally, of course neither the infinitely large nor the infinitely small are allowed in either cosmology or quantum mechanics. There is the Big Bang and no knowledge of what there was before the Big Bang, and of course there is nothing smaller than Planck and the \\"logic\\" of QM would allow.Or is there?The strength of this book is in the colorful and imaginative artwork and in the mini-essays from physicists such as Paul Davies, Chris Dewdney, Ron Johnson and others along with Al-Khalili's enthusiastic text. But if you think relativity was strange--well, comparing the strangeness of relativity to the strangeness of QM is like comparing the complexities of tick-tack-toe to those of three-dimensional chess.By the way, Al-Khalili assures us on the copyright page (alluding of course to the \\"diabolical\\" Erwin Schrodinger) that \\"No cats were harmed in the making of this book.\\""},{"Title":"Quantum: A Guide for the Perplexed","review":"I knew just about as much as the next person regarding quantum physics before reading this book, and after reading it I feel I know a lot more. It's this kind of book that tends to turn my world upside-down for a little while, but after that discomfort fades I'm glad to know a little more (and that I know less) about the universe and can apply that knowledge, or lack of, to my own perspecive on things.The book starts out with a quantum \\"magic trick\\" to hook the reader - and hook me it did - then proceeds to discuss the history, framework, and future of quantum physics. I found that the magic from the beginning tended to fade by the end of the book, but I still made it all the way through, which for me is saying a lot about whether a book is good or not. I'm not able to grasp mathematics very well - I'm more of a concept person - so the portions of the book that were mathematical were somewhat lost on me. However, the concepts got across to a certain extent. I will say that the Michio Kaku books I've read - Hyperspace and Visions - as well as Carl Sagan's books, did a lot more for me in terms of total amazement, but Quantum: A Guide for the Perplexed I feel was a very solid introduction to the quantum world for those like me who know a little and want to know more.I really enjoyed the graphic nature of the book; the illustrations are wonderful, and magical in themselves. The general feel of the book is nice, too. A lot of work was obviously done on the design in general, which I feel helped excite the material.One thing is for sure: Now that I've read this book the universe will never appear the same. There's no going back to thinking classically after learning the truths of what's really going on behind the curtain.I'm giving the book four stars, subtracting a star for the second half or so of the book that became a little more dry, cumbersome and forced than the first half.Very recommended."},{"Title":"Quantum: A Guide for the Perplexed","review":"I've read several books on Quantum Mechanics and Physics. This book is the best I've read to date. Very well written, great illustrations, entertaining, and thought provoking.

Great book!!"},{"Title":"Quantum: A Guide for the Perplexed","review":"Biologists have to a great degree ignored the strange world of quantum physics. As Chet Raymo (actually an Astronomer) observes it is difficult to see how quantum effects could really touch the scale at which we function. Raymo in fact believes that such effects may cancel each other out at our scale. I think, however, that this may be a narrow, if comfortable, view. Roger Penrose has proposed that consciousness itself may be a quantum effect and Johnjoe McFadden believes that quantum effects may very well have bearing on the evolution of life. As a biologist I am struck with the inability of scientists to actually define life, other than by the reductionist view that it is a series of chemical processes. There are in fact many chemical processes that are not life and so this does not quite satisfy.However, this is not to get into heavy metaphysics or to take on some mystical view of life. It is, however, to acknowledge the basic weirdness of life that fits, it seems to me, into the weirdness of the quantum universe. I suspect that future scientists will discover that life has more to it than fits the conventional view. But then our view of the universe, including life, has always changed with new insights and I doubt that we have (or will ever) reach full understanding of it all.Jim Al Khalili has caught the excitement of the old and new developments in quantum theory in &quot;Quantum: A Guide for the Perplexed.&quot; Once you get past the somewhat glitzy format, you find a solid and fascinating description of the extremely weird quantum world in which matter acts like waves and waves act like matter and in which mere observation can and does change results. The extreme weirdness of Bell's theorem and entrainment soon make the reader realize almost against their will that we live not in the neat ordered universe envisioned by Newton or even Einstein, but in the much stranger world of entrainment and &quot;chance&quot; events. To top it all off we discover that the brain may be a &quot;quantum computer&quot; that functions in ways quite different from the desk top computers that we use every day.If you thought the universe made perfect sense read this book and be disillusioned!"},{"Title":"Quantum: A Guide for the Perplexed","review":"This is a lovely book by any standard. I can only imagine how much care went into the graphics and artwork, and the quality of printing and media in this wonderful labor. The order of explanation and the measured pace of explanations on this very tangled topic for the interested amateur would be worth the price of the book if it were printed in black and white. The occasional insertion of personal anecdotes makes the book more readable. Even a subatomic particle physicist has an actual life. I use the word \\"amateur\\" in the classical Latin-derived \\"a lover of...\\". Truly, the lover-of the fascinating and complicated world of subatomics will find this one of the best books to pick up. Imagine buying the book in secret so your friends won't see that there are things you really, really want to understand about the subject, but don't know how to ask.I have a personal thanks to the author for saying bluntly that the widespread textbook explanation of the Uncertainty Principle is just plain wrong - lightwaves are longer than subatomic particles, so they bump the particles out of the way before we can see them.

Alas, I am a human being with all the attributes and limitations of our species and isn't that the rub in realizing QT? I cannot say that I have a better understanding of existence than an ant. That said I have gotten to my, understanding? No. What is the word? Experience, of QT from reading the history of QT and from reading books from a range of authors. With different perspectives of QT I have started to see the problems and the promise of our existence.

It is a must have for those who wish to inquire further on the 'secret' workings of the basic building blocks of matter."},{"Title":"Quantum: A Guide for the Perplexed","review":"This book focus on the basic concepts of Quantum Physics with a fresh and personal insight. It does not try to convince you that Quantum Physics make sense - on the contrary: it describes in detail how Quantum Theory is so far from common sense - and how it explains all observations made on the subatomic world. It also presents the different physical interpretations of Quantum calculus. With excellent diagrams and pictures, it is a light book on a very heavy subject.There are a few shortcomings on this book, though:- sometimes the pictures and boxes (with texts from other authors) break the sequence of the book; it would be better if at least the boxes were shown only in the end of the chapter, to minimize this (for the pictures this is harder to achieve)- you are left with the sensation that there was much more that the author could have said about some subjects; it could have had a few more 'advanced' or 'detailed' chaptersStill, overall, a very nice book for someone who wants to understand the basic concepts of Quantum Physics and its interpretations."},{"Title":"Quantum: A Guide for the Perplexed","review":"Love this book.

If you can ignore the pretentious british spelling centred around colours and flavours etc etc ad nauseam, however, what you will get is a remarkably up to date and extensive exploration of what the quantum is.

But after giving this book a concerted effort, I finally had to admit to myself that it was er...too much \\"effort\\"! There was just too much scientific jargon in the book, and the bulk of what was being said was simply not \\"computing\\" with me.

I did not find the concepts very well explained, and I found the placement of the sidebars distracting; sidebars usually interrupted the regular text, so that as a reader, I had to make a choice to interrupt a train of thought, or to finish the train of thought and backtrack. No big deal, sure, but given the perplexing (yes) nature of quantum reality, those interruptions did not help.Too much chattiness, not enough clarity.Overall, a fairly comprehensible introduction, but somehow unsatisfying.

Popular quantum renditions might be judged by three distinct criteria. First, is the material clearly presented and appropriate for a general audience? Second, is the discussion technically accurate as opposed to just a series of quantum cartoons with only minimal distinctions between fantasy and scientific reality? Third, does the presentation provide a good distinction between just what is understood and what remains controversial among professional physicists? I award A+ (five stars) in all three categories. The technical material is beautifully presented with clear language and excellent color pictures, difficult concepts are clearly discussed, and controversies concerning the \\"hard problem\\" (the measurement problem) are treated fairly and with clarity. The quantum conundrums force experts as well as quantum novices to think way outside the box so one should not expect his mental efforts to be free of discomfort. Nevertheless, Al-Khalili's book provides an ideal vehicle to guide those interested in facing substantial perplexity about the true nature of physical reality. Speculative connections between the quantum information field (wavefunction) and information associated with consciousness are treated by several books, including mine (2010)."},{"Title":"Quantum: A Guide for the Perplexed","review":"The book is well-written. It's best asset is probably it's excellent illustrations. My only problem with it is the author claims to not adhere to any interpretation of quantum mechanics yet teaches the reader the copenhagen interpretation as if it were fact and barely touches on any other interpretations.He teaches the reader that wave functions are basically mathematical tools and one should never view the wave as real (this is just an opinion by the author based on his belief of the copenhagen interpretation but he does not let the reader know this)There are numerous problems with the copenhagen interpretation, it's most troubling is the philosophical implications regarding the role of the observer.There are many instances where the author injects his strong personal opinion as scientific fact and this is troubling.

For clarity of explanation, and a scary ability to intuit what questions the reader has and answer them all, this book is unmatched. At times it was just uncanny how sometihng in the book would raise a question in my mind, and the writer would then answer it in the next paragraph. Once I was finished I only had a single question, which was \\"Can atoms or molecules be entangled also, since that is usually done with photons?\\" I'm sure I could google it and find out. Literally every other question I had at the time was answered by this book.The book covers Young's double slit experiment, spooky action at a distance, touches on retrocausality (giving the impression that most people in the field don't believe in it), explains various physical interpretations of quantum mechanics (\\"OK, we know the theory is accurate, now WHY might very small things behave so bizzarely?\\"), makes a great distinction between waves and the wave function, explains the history/evolution of how the field looks at the collapse of the wave function and that experiments are actually being done now that are starting to measure this...

For that, I suggest David Lindley's book \\"Uncertainty.\\" I guess some don't care for history.The book uses the two-slit experiment as an introduction to the weirdness (a word commonly used throughout the book, but for good reason) that is Quantum Physics.

That is unfortunately because quantum physics is at its heart the study of the nature of reality, in a way that far transcends the esoteric realm of philosophy... but in a way that is not quite classic \\"science\\" either.What I love in particular about this book, is its many color illustrations that help (at least slightly) to visualize what is being discussed. Much like the popular \\"For Dummies\\" series of books... but in a far more visually appealing way... this book seeks to show the non-scientist masses just how fascinating, weird, disturbing, and to use an overused business phrase \\"paradigm-shifting\\" the discoveries of quantum physics really are.Your cell phone, your computer, and the GPS in your car... none of them would work at all without the principles of quantum physics. Quantum is a study of the unimaginable small. And when we look closely at such things... atoms and parts of atoms... we discover that the world around us may just be an illusion of sorts. Looking \\"too closely\\" at the fabric of matter exposes us to a world where effect can precede cause, information can travel faster-than-light, objects can absolutely be in in more than one place at the same time, and matter and energy blur into the same thing. Even more spooky and disturbing, we discover than when human beings look at an atom, the act of looking at it - being aware of its position or its velocity in our minds - actually changes its nature into being different than it was before we looked at it... because looking at it imparts an energy unto it.Remember back in high school when they taught us that electrons go around the nucleus of an atom like the moon goes around the earth? Wrong. And they knew it was wrong when they taught us that, decades ago... it's just that you cannot explain to most high school teenagers what electrons REALLY do, so they dumb it down to an analogy of one object circling another. What's really happening within every atom in the universe? Those electrons don't orbit the nucleus... they occupy quantum areas of probability of location around the nucleus... \\"superpositions\\"... in more than one place at the same time. At least until we look at them using an electron microscope. Then, they suddenly \\"collapse\\" into being in one place, as if we caught them with their hands in the cookie jar.The implications of this are shocking. Forget about such trivial mind games as \\"If a tree falls in the forest and nobody is there, does it make a sound?\\" The real question is \\"If nobody is in the forest... is the forest still there... or does the forest only collapse from a potential state into a real state upon someone being there to experience it?\\" To take this mind-twister out of the realm of science and drag it kicking and screaming into the realm of theology... \\"We don't leave lights on in rooms we are not using... so why do we assume that God wastes vast amounts of energy maintaining physical reality in areas where and when nobody is looking?\\"Sure, it's easy to dismiss all this as \\"silly talk\\"... until you take a moment to actually LOOK at what quantum physic experiments have been proving beyond any doubt in recent decades. Then, it's not so easy to dismiss the facts.If you've ever seen the movie, The Matrix... there is a scene where Morpheus asks Neo if he wants to take the red pill and be made aware of the true nature of reality... or if he wants to take the blue pill, and wake up in his bed at home, and continue in blissful ignorance. I encourage you to \\"take the red pill\\" and read this book."},{"Title":"Quantum: A Guide for the Perplexed","review":"Is this book for you? Quantum Mechanics, like Relativity, is not so much a difficult subject to understand (if explained well) as much as it is just plain weird. So weird in fact that I would say one may not even want to consider dabbling in the subject unless a reasonable amount of time has been spent with general physics and its history. Learning about the works and history of such illuminaries as Copernicus, Galileo, Newton, Lorentz, Maxwell, Einstein and others can go far in creating a nurturing environment to support the \\"leap\\" into the world of Quantum Mechanics. Without this foundation I think this book (or any book on QM) would be pretty difficult to appreciate.With that in mind I think this was one of the most well written, smoothly presented, and comprehensible (and comprehensive) books on Quantum Mechanics I have ever read. The author could be a novelist and applies this talent to presenting this very strange subject in a complete and enjoyable way. After reading this the first time (I plan on reading it again) I walked away feeling like I finally \\"got\\" it. Something clicked, finally, and the feeling of satisfaction was enormous. Similar to how I felt when I first felt I finally \\"got\\" Special Relativity.I was particularly impressed that the author stepped out on a limb to express his opinion about what a particular quantum outcome might mean with regard to reality and \\"the meaning of it all\\". In addition, his dissection of alternate opinions and theories truly added to the enjoyment and comprehension of the subject matter.One very serious omission in my opinion and the reason I feel this book must be released as a second edition is the fact that almost nothing about the quantum nature of polarizing filters was presented. The bizaarness of polarizers came to a head with the amazing experiments of Paul G. Kwiat and associates demonstrating interaction free measurements. A truly stimulating aspect of QM (For those interested, see [...]). In addition Quantum Entanglement experiments rely on polarization measurements so no book on QM is truly complete in my opinion without a discussion of polarizers.For those with a general aptitude for armchair physics, this book truly can't be beat and it is definitely a \\"keeper\\" on my all time favorite science books."},{"Title":"God's reactions to man's defections","review":"Published by Witness and Testimony Publishers in 1956 from material given at a conference in August 1955.

La novela tiene dos hilos argumentales: uno liderado por el Pintor, que se dedica a observar a los nuevos vecinos que se mudan a la casa que est&aacute; la lado de la suya, y otra liderada por el N&aacute;ufrago, un balsero cubano recogido por un buque, en el que los personajes van contando historias. Los dos hilos no llegan a unirse, pero si se van relacionando hacia el final de la obra.Al contrario que en otras novelas anteriores del autor, aqu&iacute; hay un sentido del humor m&aacute;s marcado, especialmente al comienzo de la obra, lo que hace m&aacute;s amena su lectura.

Eric Brown neatly documents the strengths and usefulness of new features while explicitly identifying limitations and weaker components.Excellent and thorough summary of the Business Intelligence component including Microsoft's interest in the future of this speciality. By far, my favorite section was \\"Random Thoughts on Deployment.\\"While the information does not drill down to the granular how-to-code level, sufficient information is contained to direct an interested developer down the path to more specific examples."},{"Title":"SQL Server 2005 Distilled","review":"If you are an IT manager looking for an \\"Executive Summary\\" of the new features of SQL Server 2005, you will love this book! It gives you a nice overview of the new features, what they do, and suggestions for how you might apply them.If your a programmer or a DBA looking for details and examples of how to do things in SQL Server 2005, you need to look elsewhere. My recommendation would be \\"Pro SQL Server 2005\\"."},{"Title":"SQL Server 2005 Distilled","review":"This book is perfect for the person who is not well versed in all the new features in SQL Server 2005 and wants to make an educated decision on which features to use for a given situation. I read the whole thing straight through to get my head around all the new stuff but I also noticed that it would be good for someone to just skim through to see if there is anything that would help with an immediate need. It's a lot easier to read this than some 1,000-page tome to decide which features will work for a project; then you can get the 1,000-page tome that focuses on the feature you really need."},{"Title":"SQL Server 2005 Distilled","review":"Microsoft continually improves its SQL Server, and Brown shows how far it has come in the 2005 version. There has been a big push to make SQL Server 2005 industrial strength. So now it can do 1 million transactions per minute, up from 20 000 per minute in 2000. A remarkable gain that suggests Microsoft is making a strong drive into the bread and butter of DB2 and Oracle's customer bases. And, yes, the book comes out in 2006, while the Server is labelled 2005. But it's a very complex product [as the book makes clear], so some slippage was inevitable.Other features covered by Brown include the High Availability, for businesses that need 365/24/7 coverage, or at least as close to this as possible.A very interesting discussion takes place early in the text, where Brown suggests that more business logic needs to be embedded into the database layer, through such means as stored procedures, perhaps. In contradiction to the heavily promoted 3 tier arrangement, of database layer, application layer and presentation layer. Where the application layer holds the business logic. The idea is to separate the latter from depending on a particular choice of database. Brown disagrees. Saying that the performance gains often necessitate pushing the business logic into the database.Maybe. Keep in mind however that every database vendor is likely to say this. Since a major [intended] effect is to lock the customer into that database. With this caveat, Brown might ultimately be correct. For the greatest performance, you may well have to do as the text suggests. Though whether you choose SQL Server or an alternative database is another matter."},{"Title":"SQL Server 2005 Distilled","review":"This book is well written. I feel that it covers material that all managers need to know about SQL Server 2005. Programmers will be unhappy with it due to the lack of \\"how to\\" details, but that's not the purpose of this book. The size of the book is ideal for an airplane read."},{"Title":"SQL Server 2005 Distilled","review":"Everybody loves the trees, but some of us need to look at the forest.

Highly recommended for decision makers. Not recommended for programmers or hands-on DBAs."},{"Title":"SQL Server 2005 Distilled","review":"Too short to be really useful for anything more than a quick review."},{"Title":"Alphabet: The Story of One of Civilization's Greatest Inventions","review":"This is an interesting book with its insights into the shape of letters and how they have evolved. And yet so much of it is reporting other sources. I wonder if there is any original material at all - perhaps this is just a compendium of ideas. If this is so, I find it disappointing. Using earlier sources as a basis for current study is obviously important, but I think it is beneficial that the current product offers something new - an addition to existing knowledge. Perhaps I am wrong about this, but it is definitely the feeling I got.And then there were the missing things - areas where I re-read because my interest was triggered but Mr Firmage apparently didn't have the same thoughts, or chose to ignore them. For example, when we got to the letter G, or g, and looked at its typography and the way it represents different sounds (hard g in which it is unique, but also soft g which it shares with j) it occured to me that there is another pronunciation of G that Mr Firmage doesn't touch on, and yet is very interesting (at least it is to me - perhaps to others as well). What about silent G as in gnome. How did this come about? If people just stopped sounding the g in g-nome, why did they not similarly drop the G in spelling? It's not as if there is any confusion with other words - we have no 'nome' with which ambiguity might arise.In summary, this is was an interesting book for more but it seriously lacked completeness."},{"Title":"The Civil War Book Of Lists: Over 300 Lists From The Sublime To The Ridiculous","review":"The Civil War Book of Lists declares on its cover that it contains over 300 lists from the sublime to the ridiculous, and that is certainly true. It could also be said that it goes from the objective to the incredibly subjective. Some of the lists contain matter of fact information such as States and Territories Ranked by Black Troops Recruited for Union Service. As factual but slightly less dry is Hair Color of Union Soldiers. Some lists are heart breaking, such as Eleven Confederate Regiments with the Greatest Number Killed at Gettysburg. Personally I found the book more enjoyable as it began to move into the subjective and I could start arguing with the lists, such as The Five Most Oddly Named Civil War Battles. What's so odd about Island Number Ten? That's where it was fought. The death of General Albert Sidney Johnston at Shiloh was the Eleventh Top Turning Points of the War? That could be debated. Second Best Union General was Benjamin Grierson? Fans of fourth-ranked Sherman might disagree, especially with George Thomas ranked third. And then there's the list of the Ten Ugliest Generals, where Sherman was ranked uglier than Benjamin Butler. And certainly not least is Karl Marx and Frederick Engels' \\"The Civil War in the United States\\" being ranked as the Second Funniest Work Ever Written About the Civil War. This is an informative (Ten Actions by Black Troops Before the Celebrated Attack of the 54th Massachusetts on Fort Wagner on 18 July 1863) as well as a fun book."},{"Title":"Clancy's Cabin","review":"I first read this book when I was 8 or nine years old and it stuck in my mind until I tried to search for it recently. Being a New Zealand author, I thought it would be easy. I soon discovered that the book was only available in the U.S! This is a great book to read for children who are interested in reading chapter books. The chapters aren't too long and the language used is very easily understood - perhaps a little dated though. Nonetheless, Clancy's cabin is a great story of hunting for lost treasure!"},{"Title":"Hydrogen and Fuel Cells: Emerging Technologies and Applications (Sustainable World)","review":"This book is very impressive in it's content.

It spends much time moving from complex formula to complex formula leaving my head spinning.Hat's off to the author for assembling such a wealth of knowledge under one cover. Blessings to the person who can understand it all. I do not fit in these ranks. This book is certainly not written for the back yard tinkerer."},{"Title":"Slavonic-Russia, Ukraine, Byelarus Bible-FL-Old Church Slavonic (Slovene Edition)","review":"This Bible appears to be a photographic reproduction of the Sacred Scriptures in Staroslav (Church Slavonic), authorised by the Holy Synod of Russia prior to the Revolution. Therefore, classical Staroslav Cyrillic is used for the text of the Bible -- as well as the old Russian numbering system (no Arabic numerals here, folks). If you aren't familiar with the old Cyrillic alphabet (or the traditional numeric system), it might be a bit difficult for you to use. However, I feel that it's a wonderful item to have, especially if you happen to be of Eastern European persuasion.The only problem I can find with the volume is that the printing could have been darker."},{"Title":"Whoever You Are","review":"I actually like this.

After a recent trip overseas, it helped explain why things were different there. They were a little overwhelmed when other children didn't respond to their English and when they didn't understand what was being said to them. This book helped us explain how people are the different in some ways, but the same in many other (important) ways."},{"Title":"Whoever You Are","review":"Mem Fox is the author of many popular children's books, including Wombat Divine, Time For Bed, Feathers and Fools and Koala Lou.Not enough children's books celebrate the similarities of people all over the world. But Mem Fox, author of Whoever You Are, has added a special book to the celebration list.Every day children from all over the world are doing the same things. They are crying, laughing, playing, learning, eating, growing, loving and sleeping. They are all different in appearance; they speak different languages and live different lives. But inside their beings, they are just alike. Their joys, love, pain, smiles and hearts are just the same, no matter where they are or whoever they are. What a joyful thought.Armchair Interviews says: Whoever You Are is a wonderful addition to a child's library. It is a celebration of the important ways we are all the same."},{"Title":"Whoever You Are","review":"I always use this book to launch my third grade study of communities around the world. It is beautifully illustrated and teaches students that although we may live \\"differently\\" from one another, we are all very much alike.

They married within their groups and had children, who also married within the same group. When you identified yourself as a member of a certain group, it is a given that you do a set of things just like the other members of the group.Slowly, people started travelling out of their groups for various reasons like education, job, adventure, love, wealth, good fortune etc and found themselves amongst new culture, new traditions and people with completely different values. A plant or an animal would have perished, but man is known for his resilience. He managed to survive. But what were the adjustments he had to make in order to survive? Did he keep his home culture intact? Did he surrender completely to the host culture? Did he end up forming his own third culture, which was neither the home culture nor the host culture?As an immigrant who is bringing up my children in USA, these questions are important to me. Do I embrace the \`American culture'? If so, considering that America is a land of immigrants, what exactly is American culture? If I wanted to contribute to the host culture without completely being assimilated am I asking for too much?Imagining that I am carrot, do I want to be cut in to pieces, saut&eacute;ed along with a host of other vegetables and spices, blended, passed through a fine sieve and become homogenous soup, in the process of loosing my identity? Or do I want to be diced and be a part of a delicious salad? After much thinking I have decided I like my salad better than soup :)Because when you keep preaching equality, it gets confusing. People are not made from the same dough using the same cookie cutter. However effectivley one blends in, there are differences and one just cannot turn a blind eye to those differences. Its like saying, if we take away 1 from 3, then it will be the same as 2. Now 3 and 2 are equal.The best way to make people feel validated is by telling that we are all different in different ways. We eat different food. We wear different clothes. We celebrate different things. We celebrate in diferent ways. We have different beliefs. But underneath all those differences the one single common bond that unites us is our humanity. If you can extend a loving hand, share a hug, feel another person's pain, fully aware of the mutual differences, then true tolerance is achieved.This is the message of the book Whoever You Are. Mem Fox takes children on a magic ride through out the world pointing that no two skin colos are the same, no two landscapes are the same, no two lifestyles are the same, but past all these differences, if you look deep inside, we all have a heart, we all laugh and we all are capable of hurting and healing.You know what I kept thinking of? My second standard lessons that talked about \`unity in diversity'!"},{"Title":"Whoever You Are","review":"I think this book has good points.

Books like these can help teach the next generation.The message is more complicated than perhaps what my 2.5 yr old daughter can understand so the book would be appropriate for older (school age) children, but she still loves it all the same.

I love the fact that it teaches diversity & acceptance @ such an early age. We have many books, but this was the first book my child wanted me to read over and over and over again! He loves the artwork too, and the paternal figure that floats along all the pages.Before this book, my child would barely get through a whole book. But he'll sit quietly & pay attention w/ this one over and over again! He kisses their boo-boos when we get to the page about pain, and points to his heart when the book says that hearts are the same. We LOVE this book! Thank you Mem Fox!"},{"Title":"Whoever You Are","review":"Dirty SallyWhoever you are is great look at introducing youngsters to cultural diversity. \\"Culture\\" basically refers to commonalities that run through a group of people with a shared heritage. Sometimes children probably believe that her culture - way of doing things - is the \\"right\\" one and that others are a bit \\"funny.\\" As you read Whoever You Are, you can begin to look at other cultures with your child, aim for an appreciation of differences. Eventually, this will lead to an increased appreciation of the incredible variety of human attributes, flexible thinking, and less prejudice and stereotyping. This type of conversation has to take place. That is why I wrote a children's' book entitled, Dirty Sally..The untold stories of mixed race kids who find a new identity, love, faith and forgiveness through GOD.There is an interesting story behind the title. I was often taunted or teased about being biracial. Some of my family members and friends called me Dirty Sally. Dirty Sally is an old slavery term used to identify the descendants or offspring of Sally Hemings, a former slave and the late President Thomas Jefferson. Sally Hemings was biracial her mother was white and black and her father white. This book focuses on the misconceptions surrounding racial identity and the importance of choosing one's racial identity. Dirty Sally is a must read not only for inter-racial families, but for all parents hoping to instill in their children a sense of understanding and compassion. I believe that change requires resistance and within that process we can help heal some of the wounds that continue to inflict on racially mixed children.

I can't wait to share this with my class."},{"Title":"Whoever You Are","review":"This is a beautiful book on diverse cultures. It is my 4 year old daughters favorite book at the moment. The message it gets across is simple and effective. Although we may of different color, culture, county, or race: bottom line is WE are all the same. The illustration of the book is very pretty, nice bright colors and glossy pages. Reading I would say 4 and up. Would definitely recommend."},{"Title":"Whoever You Are","review":"This is a beautifully illustrated and moving book. I confess I have teared up reading this to my children on occassion. In very simple and wonderful words, it teaches a message for love of all humankind."},{"Title":"Whoever You Are","review":"The graphics are gorgeous.

Mem Fox is one of our favorite authors."},{"Title":"Whoever You Are","review":"I am a social ministries director for a Catholic parish, and I use this book as a preface for Catholic Social Teaching. Everytime I read it to a group, whether adults or children, everyone always seems to applaud at the end. It's that kind of book. It's interesting to see the reaction of high school students when they hear it because it can really hit home. It's by far my favorite book."},{"Title":"Whoever You Are","review":"Good book for teaching kids about how everyone may look or talk differently but they r still the same on the inside and they have the same feelings as everbody else.

This book is a great book for teaching students on acceptance of each other regardless of where you are from or who you are."},{"Title":"Whoever You Are","review":"There is nothing better in the world than to read such a meaningful and delightful story to a group of pre-K and Kindergartners. It's one of a series of books I'm using to teach compassion and tolerance to my class. I could not be more happy that this is a part of my new extensive library. And it was something I had to get as one of my newer students had a serious nationality complex that drove me crazy in the classroom. If there was one thing that this book did very well, it was to break down that inane cockiness that this kid had. Mem Fox writes in a way where the reader can feel the gentleness and compassion of her words and message. This is a message that should resonate with every living being on this Earth: that we are all the same regardless of where we are from, how we grew up, and how we look like. This is a book certainly worth getting and using in all classrooms."},{"Title":"Whoever You Are","review":"This is my boys favorite book, he will choose it over other books and even over toys!

Thanks Ms. Fox for the enjoyable read."},{"Title":"Whoever You Are","review":"Just what the title of my review says. My little one and I love reading this book. It also allows us to look at the differences and similarities between cultures in a non-judgemental way.

It teaches children that there are other children just like them all over the world. That they may look and live different, but are all the same inside. Another great book by Mem Fox"},{"Title":"Whoever You Are","review":"I am a Lutheran church librarian and I am glad I bought this very satisfactory book for our church library. Its text stresses that children are the same the world over. They have the same feelings and needs, and have the same hopes and dreams. The illustrations are a nice change from the usual. Each page is surrounded by a gold picture frame in which faux jewels are embedded. The illustrations appear to be tempera or opaque watercolor, drawn in Persian style. The colors are very saturated. The book's cover gives you an idea of what they look like. The message of this book is one of diversity--that even though children live in different parts of the world and may have different nationalities, races, ethnicities, languages or faiths, they still have the same hopes, dreams and daily needs. This is a very important message for children to hear in today's world where there is so much suspicion of those we \\"perceive\\" to be different. The more children realize that kids are the same everywhere, the more tolerant they will be. Children pick up prejudice by the time they are three years of age, say researchers, so you have to nip it in the bud very early, and this book does that in a wonderful way."},{"Title":"Whoever You Are","review":"As the home educator of children from toddler to pre-school, representing a wide range of cultures, this wonderful inclusive book is soothing and almost prayerful. I discovered it on a list of books recommended by Heifer.org, a non-profit organization bringing respectful solutions to many nations affected by poverty. The drawings by Leslie Staub, gently framed with \\"jewelled\\" borders, are universal. The text, by Mem Fox, reaches deep inside of us. Indeed, every child, every adult, has hearts that are \\"just the same\\" regardless of all the differences that separate us. It is hard to imagine anyone who can think war is the answer to anything, after reading this book. I heartily recommend it."},{"Title":"Whoever You Are","review":"\\" Little one, whoever you are, wherever you are, there are little ones just like you all over the world.\\" This very simple opening starts a paean to the universality of the human experience. As humans we experience sadness and joy, tears and laughter, and it is these common experiences that unite all people for \\"their words may be very different from yours. But inside, their hearts are just like yours.\\"Staub's illustrations seem to underscore this message. Diverse people, lands, and languages are presented in a folk art style with surrealistic touches. Our guide through these pages is a man in a \\"cloud\\" suit who carries four children of different races as they view people all over the world. But what unifies the poem, beside the guide, is that each of the pictures is placed in a hand-carved frame with encased gems. It feels like we are looking at pictures of someone's family. That the human race is a family is also underscored with these framed pictures. This would be an excellent book for teaching tolerance and understanding of others."},{"Title":"Whoever You Are","review":"This book is a big hit with my PRE-K class! I was pleasantly surprised at how responsive and attentive they were while I was reading this. They have memorized most of the book. They all loved it! An excellent resource for teaching about diversity and various cultures! I'd definitely recommend reading this book to/with ages four through maybe second grade."},{"Title":"Whoever You Are","review":"After falling in love with TIME FOR BED, I thought for sure I'd enjoy WHOEVER YOU ARE, especially given the rave reviews here. Unfortunately, I had a very different reaction to the book than evidently everyone else who wrote a review here.The central theme is great (and I hope I can find more books espousing the same idea that are more fun to read), and the illustrations are very attractive, but the writing is less than stellar. First of all, it's extremely repetitive. You've got the same sentence on several pages in the beginning with only one word being different. Some repetition, like in TIME FOR BED, is good, but to repeat entire sentences and only change one word is boring. Second of all, the writing is unimaginative (which is a similar complaint to \\"repetitive\\" but reflects a deeper problem with the book overall). \\"Joys are the same, and love is the same. Pain is the same, and blood is the same.\\" Blah blah blah blah blah. Speaking of \\"blood,\\" what is the deal with \\"...blood is the same\\"? Seems like an odd thing to say. Why not say something like \\"sorrows are the same\\"?I apologize in advance to all of the die-hard fans of this book who read my review and feel annoyed by it. I just felt like I should add my comments since I spend a lot of time looking at and buying books for my 14-month old son, I worked for several years as an editor, and I think my reaction may be shared by others who simply haven't added a review to the site. My suggestion to anyone considering this book for a baby/young toddler is to look at it in person before buying it."},{"Title":"Whoever You Are","review":"The only detraction from the reviews listed is the sour tone from Horn Book.

Though recommended for ages 4 - 8, it is my 17 month old's favorite book. The illustrations are colorful and enchanting, the text rhythmic and clear. The story is simple, yet profound:&quot;love is the same, pain is the same, joy is the same, blood is the same...&quot; &quot;Whoever you are, whoever they are, all over the world.&quot;"},{"Title":"Whoever You Are","review":"I loved this book and plan to give it to everybody I know when they have a new baby. It is, as the other reviews say, a book about how all children in the world, regardless of where they live and their culture, are fundamentally the same -- they smile the same, cry the same, laugh the same, hurt the same. And it is a book that anyone can give their child regardless of their race, gender, nationality, etc., because it is so beautifully inclusive of many cultures. And I like it that the angelic figure who guides us through the book is a beautifully illustrated African man in a suit and hat. I think it's a wonderful book to welcome a child into the world. Definitely a keeper that the child will pass on to his or her children. I just bought 3 more copies today for two new babies and one to keep on hand for the next one who comes along! My other favorite new baby book is On The Day You Were Born, also wonderful for children of any race, gender, nationality, etc. because of it's inclusive language and artwork."},{"Title":"Whoever You Are","review":"In my constant quest for books that not only entertain my young son but also have something meaningful to say, this one is currently at the top of the list.

Take a minute to read this book!&quot; Co-workers dropped by my desk in a steady stream to thank me for sharing this sweet book. The artwork is striking and rich - amazing from cover to cover. PLEASE SHARE THIS BOOK!

Fox's words and the amazing illustrations are helping my two year old understand that children everywhere have boo-boo's, love their Mommies and do many of the same things she does. It is now her favorite book, probably because of the gorgeous (I cannot stress that enough) colors in the illustrations. I am buying this for every child I know for Christmas."},{"Title":"Faery Wicca Tarot (Mini Kit)","review":"This deck is so beautiful... It differs from traditional tarot decks because it includes the Tree of Life card and four Gift of Faery cards.

I have used this deck for over 5 years (it is wearing out), and I find the insights combined with the mythology to be both insightful and of a revelationary nature. My daughter calls this the 'cadillac' of tarot decks. Occasionally, when I have done readings for others, they have been awed by the spot-on accuracy and revelation nature of the readings. Beautiful artwork, meaningful mythological analogies, and profound writing. Excellent."},{"Title":"Faery Wicca Tarot (Mini Kit)","review":"What originally drew me to this deck was the Empress card, known as The Mother Goddess card. The artwork is beautiful, and I found all the cards in the major arcana to be very attractive. The court cards are exceptional too.I did have some difficulty with the minor arcana, but I am not an experienced tarot reader and there were not enough symbols to attempt any sort of meaning. I found myself constantly referring to the book. A more experienced tarot reader (or someone who has the meanings of all the cards memorized) would enjoy this deck, but I found it rather difficult to read with. What I did find interesting about the minor arcana was that if you laid the cards out in order they are actually taking you down a very obvious visual pathway.The book itself is fun, and she has some interesting tarot layouts to try.This is not a light and fluffy deck, and it gives readings that are no nonsense and forthright. And where I don't believe it's an easy deck for the beginning tarot reader I wouldn't let that deter anyone from trying it.... there's always the book to turn to.Overall I have found this deck to give powerful readings, and have enjoyed working with it."},{"Title":"Faery Wicca Tarot (Mini Kit)","review":"I love this deck!

Ms. Stepanich does quite a nice job tying the tarot into the druidic/bardic mysteries, to which my family lineage is connected.

That's impossible in this edition.I'm holding on to my dtb until a table of contents is added."},{"Title":"The fairy mythology: Illustrative of the romance and superstition of various countries","review":"It's a credit to Thomas Keightley's \\"World Guide to Gnomes, Fairies, Elves & Other Little People\\" that it's still a relevant mythologic source today, over a hundred years after it was first published. The stories, explanations and legends are still as informative as they were in 1880, although they are rather restricted.Okay, \\"World Guide to Gnomes, Fairies, Elves and Other Little People\\" sounds like a cutesy title for a Brian Froud-illustrated book. And it's a rather lightweight title for a book with genuine merit -- especially the \\"little people\\" part of it, since the elves, fey and gnomes in here are anything but dainty Victorian fairies.Instead, Keightley focuses on traditional goblins, dwarves and elves -- Scandinavian trolls and beautiful alfar, Germanic Zwerge and kobolds, British fairies, Celtic spirits and seal-men, and the epic sagas that greatly influenced early fantasy authors like J.R.R. Tolkien and George MacDonald. Take a look at the chapter on the \\"Eddas and Sagas,\\" and it's hard not to think of Middle Earth.Its one flaw is that it's restricted mostly to Europe -- there's a brief chapter on African superstitions, and one for Judaistic ones, and for Persian ones, et cetera. Other than that, nothing that originates outside Europe. While it's understandable, considering the time that Keightley lived in, it's hard not to wonder if he couldn't have found out at least a few other cultural legends.However, this is a rich source for European myths and legends, especially since Keightley obviously did his research. He includes snippets of untranslated poetry, ballads, and footnotes detailing migratory myths and differing versions. He also summarizes some of the denser material like the two Eddas, which are extremely long and sometimes difficult.Though Thomas Keightley wrote this a hundred and twenty-five years ago, \\"The World Guide to Gnomes, Fairies, Elves and Other Little People\\" is still a valuable and informative resource for anyone interested in European myths and legends. So ignore the title."},{"Title":"Toaster's Handbook","review":"I got the sample to try first and within the first page, there was a so called joke calling African Americans monkeys and referring to slavery.

While Swick's book might cover slightly more grammatic technicalities, this one does much the same, but in a less exhausting manner.There are 87 units/chapters with each being about 1-2 pages long and containing 3 sets of quiz questions, ranging between 5-10 questions per set.I have looked at many of the 'Teach Yourself' books before but have always found them to be second tier material in the way they constantly base their chapters upon dialogs at a library or bank or an airport. I never liked the way the grammar rules seemed to be addressed in such a willy-nilly manner. That's where this book differs. There are no dialogs and it simply addresses grammar topics in a straightforward approach, building up gradually from the most basic.It's got a very good ratio of lessons/rules to questions/exercises.While this probably wouldn't be considered anything near an exhaustive reference of grammar, I think its a book you might actually finish studying."},{"Title":"Teach Yourself Quick Fix German Grammar","review":"I got my copy of this book at a used book shop, and it was so worth it. I have several other German grammar guides, but this is the one I always end up coming back to. I'm in my second year of college level German, and this book is still hella useful. Whenever I'm writing an essay I use this book to look up little grammar tips. It may not be a great way for you to actually learn German, however. Leave that to an actual text book.Everything is laid out well; it's easy to find things and the grammar is straightforward and easy to understand. The best part is how easy it is to find what your looking for. What is the genetive ending for this again? How should I end this adverb? This book really delivers.It's a little silly to be so gung-go about a grammar book, but I've tried allot of them and this is the only one that works well for me."},{"Title":"Introduction to Sociology","review":"Henry Tischler does a marvelous job writing this book. It is both up-to-date and accurate, blending a myriad of graphs and pictures with easy to read text.

But it also, naturally, covers other areas as well....social and military history for instance.The only drawback to buying this book is the price. Seventy dollars for a paperback is pretty steep but if you are really into church history then it is well worth the price."},{"Title":"The Bowflex Body Plan","review":"First the good: If you're an exercise novice who recently acquired a Bowflex and got brain-lock while looking at the huge list of potential exercises that came with it, this book -- which is officially sanctioned by Bowflex's manufacturer -- is a Godsend. Darden picks only the most relevant exercises, describes them in great detail with good photos showing correct form, and organizes them into a series of plans (for novices, for intermediates, for advanced bodybuilder types, for people looking to build or slim specific areas of the body) that couldn't be easier to follow -- and that work.For that alone, the book is worthwhile. Armed with these plans, the new Bowflex owner is much more likely to actually use his or her machine on an ongoing basis, and that's very good. The plans make it very easy to get going, and tangible gains start to come within the first few sessions. Good stuff.But there's some not-so-good, too. Throughout the book (and indeed, throughout the officially-sanctioned Bowflex literature) there is case study after case study showing folks who made incredible gains -- losing 30 lb in a month, that sort of thing -- following \\"The Bowflex Plan\\". What becomes clear after reading is that those gains have less to do with the Bowflex than they do with the rather extreme (1500 cal/day) diet that's part of the \\"Plan\\". And, of course, the official Bowflex literature doesn't address the mounds of research showing that weight lost via extreme calorie restriction doesn't tend to stay off long-term. Take these case studies with the appropriate grains of salt.There's another not-so-good factor in this book, at least from my perspective. Darden is a bodybuilder. His assumptions and recommendations -- ranging from exercise frequency to diet to supplements to appropriate levels of bodyfat -- come from the world of competitive bodybuilding. They aren't geared toward, and aren't always appropriate for, more mainstream athletes interested in improving sports performance or endurance. The Bowflex itself (and to a large extent, Darden's Bowflex workout plans) is certainly very useful for such people, but Darden's beyond-the-Bowflex recommendations may not be. Caveat."},{"Title":"The Bowflex Body Plan","review":"I like Ellington Darden alot. He DOES know his stuff. So Anyway I own the Ultimate Bowflex. I used to own the regular Bowflex with no attachments and I really never used it. It just sat for a very long time. Alot of it was I just wasn't sure how to do the exercises. So I went on a low carb diet, started walking and lost weight. Then I hit a HUGE stall. I always new I needed to strength train but never did. I hated going to the gym and wasted my money on a year membership. So this past winter I got an offer to send back the regular bowflex, trade it in, get 1000 toward an ultimate with EVERYTHING. So I did it. Get a brand new machine with all the bells and whistles. Again I still wasnt sure what to do. THe video that comes with the ultimate is great, gives a good description of what to do. So I was looking around one day and saw this book and brought it. Well I love it. It is great. Gives GREAT detail instructions and tips for the best exercises on the bowflex. It also has several plans, for gaining muscle, losing fat, for your hips, for your arms, for your chest and for your abs. I still need to lose fat before I can try other routines. But I went on his meal plan which is real simple and good for you. I am eating stuff that was restricted on a low carb diet. And I lost weight. I used to not be able to go down past 168 no matter what I did. Now I am 5'11&quot; and 162 lbs (which is actually just right I just need to lose fat and gain muscle). Also if I cheat I don't balloon up. I highly recommend this book if you have the bowflex. His workout routines and eating plans are also worth it. There is also background information on the bowflex and he also explains healthy information (such as increasing water intake and the like). Ellington Darden knows his stuff and I want to read his other books. Take care."},{"Title":"The Bowflex Body Plan","review":"I ordered this book because the manual that came with my Bowflex didn't have instructions for a few exercises and attachments (like the belt and instructions for the leg extensions)and I was hoping the book would have them. It did.The book came and my first reaction was... this guy is nuts. I read most of the book thinking it would just get placed on the book shelf with all the other diet books I've collected over the years.My second reaction was... this is different than all those other books (including the manual) and all those other books aren't working so what do I have to lose but some flab? I'm on my second week following the plan in this book and I've lost around 8 pounds and I can see my arms are toning up. The ice water is good, the diet is do-able and I like doing my light cardio workout after dinner.I learned a lot of little secrets and I'm really convinced that I can last the initial six week plan and continue on after that with my Bowflex.If you are doing multiple sets of 12 or more reps with light weights with little results... you'd benefit by getting this book and changing the way you're doing things."},{"Title":"The Bowflex Body Plan","review":"I don't know strength training, at all. Unlike other reviewers I have no idea who the author is or even his credentials (having read they book they seem to be pretty good).I do have a Bowflex. And while the routines presented in the Bowflex Users Manual that shipped with the machine are good, I found them lacking because I also needed to lose weight, not just build strength. This book is right up my alley. It presents an integrated program for beginners (my wife and I are in our 30s and 40s but neither of us have ever worked out) that blends a steadily advancing work out routine with a reduced calorie diet. And if we persist and stay on program, this book should last us for a few years (if not longer) with the advanced programs for targeting specific muscle development as well as additional, more advanced strength training techniques.The menu plans are specific, but we'll be modifying it slightly simply because a few of the meals (Lunch particularly) aren't all that appealing. But because the meals are based on calories consumed - substitutions are no problem. For those that don't want to worry about meal planning, you've come to the right place. And for those that are more finicky eaters, you'll come away with the base knowlege to build your own meal plan and still achieve your goals.Overall I think this book is well thought-out, with specific workouts and meals. The photos are clear and the explanations on how to do the recommended workouts are slightly better than the manual. More useful is the fact the author selected what he thinks are the best of the exercises (in total, only about 30% of the total possible workouts are presented). You'll be happier if you have the Leg Attachment, although you can just substitute other leg exercises that are also in the book. But eventually you'll probably find the variety lacking."},{"Title":"The Bowflex Body Plan","review":"This is an excellent book. Anyone that owns a Bowflex, or even any quality home gym could benefit from it. Darden follows up on his other works and presents a program that promises results. The book could be viewed by some as a commercial for the Bowflex, but so what? Darden does not put down any other products or methods, he just states simply and directly that if you follow his exercise and nutrition plan, you will lose fat and gain muscle. There was some interesting historical background on the Bowflex as well as Darden's views and how they have developed over the years. It was interesting to see the models, who have appeared for several years in the Bowflex infomercials. Also, Ellington Darden dispels some of the common perceptions of hard core athletes that the Bowflex will not work for them, that it will not develop large muscles, etc. It is becoming quite evident to most of us that are at middle age that strength training is necessary, and yet we don't all have 5-6 hrs per week to train. With Darden's plan, you maximize the time that you do have, so that it delivers the most efficient results. He also candidly covers the problem of many us...after losing fat and getting fit, we backslide. His book includes specific advice for those who have had that problem. It also includes some area specific plans, eg the person who is already fit but needs to address a weak area.Overall, I found the book to be excellent. It is laid out in a logical, concise format, clearly illustrated with ample photographs. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"The Bowflex Body Plan","review":"This is not a bowflex manual. This is a manual on how to change your body. All of the pictures and illustrations are with the Bowflex. But, the exercise plan can be performed on any home gym - the only requirement is that you can quickly switch between exercises.The book gives you a progressive exercise plan, a balanced diet based on total calories consumed, tips on superhydration, and the science behind each principle. If you're like me, it's not enough to be told to do A, B, and C. I have to know why I'm doing A, B, and C - and Dr Darden gives you the why.I know someone else said that there are surprisingly few exercises listed in the book and while I don't agree with that statement, I will state that a surprisingly small portion of thebook is dedicated to the actual exercises. I would guess 1/3 of the book is dedicated to the exercise. The other 2/3 are diet, bowflex history, the science behind muscle and fat, importance of strength training, importance of water consumption, rest, etc. Like I said, it's a body shaping manual not an exercise manual.Someone else said that you won't find anything in here that you can't find anywhere else such as magazines, etc. To an extent, that is true. You can certainly find the exercises in magazines and you can find diets listed in other magazines, and so on. What you won't find, though, is all of the information in the same place - and you certainly won't find it backed up with the scientific facts explaining why the methods work.I've been using his plan for 2 weeks now (and I don't own a bowflex) and I have lost 7 lbs and have seen strength gains on every exercise."},{"Title":"The Bowflex Body Plan","review":"As a woman who owns a Bowflex Machine, I was pleased to see this book on how to use Bowflex effeciently and productively. And I wasn't disappointed.Chapter 22, &quot;Hips and Thighs:Tackling the Tough Spots&quot;, is exactly what I've been looking for to address my problem areas. Chapter 11 on &quot;Muscle&quot;, and Chapter 12 on &quot;Fat&quot;, are clearly written and helped me understand the science behind my own body's composition. Chapter 26, &quot;Those Last 5 Pounds: 30 Tips on How to Lose Them&quot; effectively summarizes Elllington Darden's philosophy. I appreciate the balanced presentation for women and men,in both text and pictures.I recommend this book for any woman who has a Bowflex Machine, or any woman who ever considered using Bowflex.The numerous before-and-after photographs will help you to realistically &quot;picture the possibilities&quot; of what you can expect from Bowflex training and proper eating."},{"Title":"The Bowflex Body Plan","review":"I bought a used Bowflex and the seller didn't have the manual. I wanted to use the machine properly and ordered a manual from the company, but it was back-ordered so I bought this book.

Darden distills it down to 23 \\"best\\" exercises, which helped a lot.He also goes into the best number of reps and sets to do, and the why's to back it up. The best number of exercises to do on any given day, sample plans by week, etc. Really helped me figure out how to get started.There's a lot of information about nutrition, calorie intake, etc. too."},{"Title":"The Bowflex Body Plan","review":"This book is very informative regarding exercise physiology, etc. I like that it provides several different workouts, depending upon the reader's needs.

It is not the same as the DVD that came with the Bowflex, but is less likely to be lost."},{"Title":"The Bowflex Body Plan","review":"This book has a lot of helpful information. The diet and exercise tips are great. I only gave it four stars because the photo of the machine pictured in the book are not helpful since the machine is not like the bowflex PR 1000 machine we purchased.

This book has way more exercises that can be done with a Bowflex than come with it. I have been using the author's exercise plan as well and I love it. It takes less time to do and works better.

I would highly recommend it for anyonewith a Bowflex!"},{"Title":"The Bowflex Body Plan","review":"I love this book.I know that some people have stated that this book is just like the manual that comes with the Bowflex. That is only true if you just skim this book.This book gives better pictures of the 23 exercises that he recommends. The exercises are for the Bowflex Ultimate. However, you can use these on the Power Pro with the right attachments.He provides multiple routines plus an awesome chapter on breakdowns, double pre-exhaustion, and negatives. When you really look at this chapter you realize that there are more than 23 exercises because of the way you perform these routines.The only negative about this book is the extra fluff. I believe it is there in order to convert you to the HIT philosophy. Since HIT goes against the grain of what most people have been told about weight lifting I get the feeling DR. Darden feels that he needs to convince you with all the extra pages that it works.Once you are sold on HIT those extra pages just get in the way of the meat of this book.If you follow the leanness program in the Bowflex manual to the letter and you have no intentions to work on sculpting your body then this book is probably not for you.However, if you want to sculpt your body, work on strength training, and target your problem areas (arms,chest,abs) then this book is a must."},{"Title":"The Bowflex Body Plan","review":"This book is alright.

The book is easy to read, the workout plans are simple to understand and follow. The meals are so simple that the only cooking skill you need is to be able to boil water. The book gives plans for people that need to lose considerable weight (body leaness challenge)to a plan that tailors to athletes (hard body challenge).I just completed the body leaness program and followed it without cheating or skipping an excercise. The body leaness program is a 6-wk program that allows you to lose pounds of fat to slender down. The plan breaks down to 3 two-weeks intervals where every progressing two weeks he increases the amount of excercise while decreasing the amount of calorie intake.Dr. Darden has pictures and of previous participants in his program along with their results.So let me provide you with my stats:Start of ProgramAge: 32 MaleHeight: 5'10\\"Weight: 205 lbsBody Fat: 24.9%Results after 6-wk programWeight: -22.2 lbsBody Fat: -4.5%Waist: -3 1/4\\"Hips: -2 3/4\\"I got good results, right; so why a 3-star raiting?Well out of those 22.2 lbs that were lost about 7.5 lbs were of lean body mass. In any weight loss program you want to maximize your loss in fat pounds and NOT in lean body mass.As I went through the program I kept reading and educating myself from other sources in respects to proper nutrition. Personally I didn't know any better until after I finished the program, but you live and you learn.Here's the thing, the calorie intake for men in the leaness program starts you of at 1500 calories and takes you to 1300 at the end of the program.The problem with this is that when dealing with low-calorie diets most sources I have found indicate that you should create a deficit of 500 cals per day with some indicating a calorie deficit of 1000 caloires max. If you read most nutrional guides they indicate that a total loss in weight of 1 lb to max 2 lb loss of weight per week. A calorie intake of 1500-1300 will put most individuals at a calorie deficit much greater than 1000 calories/day.A pound is 3500 calories. If you have a caloric deficit of 500 calories/day x7 days equals to a pound loss per week. Therefore, 1000 calorie deficit equals 2 pound loss per week.The calorie intake amounts given in the book are given irregardless of caloric daily needs of an individual which of course can lead to unhealthy and improper weight loss which includes loss of lean body mass.Furthermore, when reducing the caloric intake needs you need to allow for a higher protein intake to sustain the lean body mass while losing the fat. Dr. Darden recommends high-protein supplements for his Hard Body Challenge for the more athletic individuals but not for the body leaness program. Different sources show different levels of needed protein some say 1g per lb of total body fat and others say 1-1.5g of protein per lean body weight.This is just what I have been reading from various sources I am not a nutrionist or a professional.The other criticism of the book is the excercises are based on an older Bowflex model so you may have to tweak the program to fit the excercises available to your machine. I have had to tweak a few of the excercises on my Bowflex Blaze and it wasn't too much of a big deal.There are other parts of the book that deal with emphasiz on a body part (i.e chest, arms, abs, etc.) that I have read but have not tried to implement. HOWEVER, before I try to implement any parts of those plans I will definately double check the recommended nutrition/supplementation recommedations made in the book.Currently I have decided to do another 6-week cycle but at the appropriate calorie deficits with an addition of 100% Gold Standard Whey protein and Opti-men multi-vitamin. Furthermore, I will vary and change some of the excercise to prevent the body from plateuing due to the monotony. Once I reach my desired body fat percentage I will begin cylcing for Creatin use in my workouts.Overall, a decent book but specific with the Bowflex machine but take the nutrition portion with a grain of salt."},{"Title":"The Bowflex Body Plan","review":"Only a small fraction of this book is about exercising with the Bowflex at all and all of those exercises are for the Bowflex Classic. So if you buy any of the other models, such as their top selling Extreme 2E, you can't use the exercises. The book is more about lifestyles and healthy eating, getting enough sleep and overall doing the right things for yourself. In that regard it's OK but there are better books out there.It wasn't a waste of money but I would have bought something else if I knew that it wasn't useful as a Bowflex exercise guide for my model."},{"Title":"The Bowflex Body Plan","review":"I bought this along with my Bowflex Blaze and and very happy I did so. In addition to great suggested workout plans from beginner to advanced, it had much better explanations of the various exercises than the very basic user's guide that came with the unit."},{"Title":"The Bowflex Body Plan","review":"This pretty much has what is in the user manual you get with the machine. There are a few other exercises in it and more backgroung info. It's good to get if you've lost your manual or if you want a sturdier, hardback copy."},{"Title":"The Bowflex Body Plan","review":"I purchased this book in hopes of getting the most out of my Bowflex Extreme 2. Other reviewers seemed to really like this book, so maybe I'm way off in my expectations. I've been working out for quite a while and recently purchased a Bowflex in hopes of saving time & money by working out at home instead of the gym. I'm not so sure about that decision now...The author uses this book to tell long background stories about back when he worked here or there. It seems to be long winded information that could be summed up without all the page fill & fluff. The diet plan is a no-brainer - it is such a calorie restricted diet anyone will lose weight on it, with or without the Bowflex. 1200 - 1000 calories a day for women will work no matter what. The before and after photos depict weight loss, but I didn't notice anyone making any kind of muscle gains. He makes the Bowflex sound like a magic wand and it's not. To gain muscle you have to work, and his proposed workouts are laughable. I get more exercise grocery shopping than his \\"workouts\\".The exercises demonstrated are fine if you have that particular model of Bowflex, but the book is outdated and not helpful if you own an Extreme or Ultimate.I say save your money unless you've never exercised before in your life and have absolutely no idea how exercise & your body work."},{"Title":"The Bowflex Body Plan","review":"I purchased this book to accompany the Bowflex chart of exercises that came with the XLTU model machine. I was hoping for a more detailed instruction of the exercises that this machine could perform as well as specific pointers for form and function. The machine used in the book was not similar to mine and the information in the book was really a rehash of information that is available in other fitness books. I did pay less than the list price however it took Amazon more than two weeks to deliver the book( 2nd time I have had delivery problems with Amazon requiring emails and aggravation).This book may be helpful to first time fitness folks but the author's contention that a single set of exercises at a weight to cause muscle failure in 10 repitions is counter to all that I have been taught. I am not an expert in the field and I am going to follow the BodyPLan concept to see what happens but I have my doubts.I love the bowflex and use it to supplement my workouts perhaps I should have purchased one of the more specific products that Bowflex sells."},{"Title":"The Bowflex Body Plan","review":"The book arrived days before I expected it and it was in mint condition, just as described."},{"Title":"The Bowflex Body Plan","review":"it was very informal. gives directions on how to have a good program. note must have a bowflex & be committed."},{"Title":"The Bowflex Body Plan","review":"The book was a bit out of date with regards to technology in body building and diet.

The Bible plainly states that...The only problem I would say with how we view homosexuality is that we rank it higher than other sins... which is wrong as well.Homosexuality is a sin, but so is lying, stealing, and murdering. We have no right to rank them in categories of severity.Sinners are welcome to church, but you need to be able to realize that homosexuality is a sin.Have a blessed day everyone!"},{"Title":"The Student Bible Dictionary","review":"This Bible Dictionary is a wonderful, quick resource while learning about the Bible and trying to figure all the main characters and the locations. It is a fast reference and doesn't slow you down trying to move forward in the stories and lessons. I bought it for my children so they could sort out the different kingdoms,tribes, groups, cities, alliances, etc. The dictionary explains the term or location, and then refers the reader to the proper section in the Bible. The maps and illustrations are accurate and well done, the printing and the paper are of high quality, and the book will take a beating while the youngsters are sharing and it passing back and forth. Well worth the price. Good job by the authors."},{"Title":"The Student Bible Dictionary","review":"I am thoroughly pleased with The Student Bible Dictionary.

Some people may not agree with the opinions. Some entries also have added questions or comments for the development of a Christian life. Not all people want a dictionary with Christian opinions. Some people would find this very helpful.However, this dictionary clearly explains its outlook in the introduction: unapolegically conservative. It also uses the King James Version as its base. However, there are references to the use of words in other common Bible translations which is very useful.The pronunciation guide doesn't apply to all words, but is sufficient. It is a very easy to understand pronunciation guide, which is VERY helpful.The timelines and information on the names of God are excellent.As long as you know what your are purchasing, this is a very useful tool."},{"Title":"The Student Bible Dictionary","review":"If you belong to an even moderately liberal church, do NOT use this student Bible dictionary.

I absolutely do not agree with this, nor does my church, which welcomes everyone, nor my denomination (United Church of Christ).

There was a lot of repetition for the activities, however, with similar sections for participants and facilitators in each. So, instead of having 250+ pages of novel material there is maybe 50 pages.There were four or five self-reflection questions in many of the activities that seemed fairly commonsense. I guess I was hoping for more thought and emotion-provoking material. For the price I expected more.

You need: Adjustable dumbbells, adjustable bench. That's it. It shows you what to do, including proper form of all exercises, how to schedule your workouts etc.If someone criticises the pics are too small, or that it does not include shiny ripped models, or that the bro talk and illusion of complexity are missing...well, there are other books for that type of audience.I read many books on training: Beyond Brawn, The new HIT, Body by Science, Slow Burn, Congruent Exercise, 4 Hour Body, HIT the Mike Mentzer Way, Practical Approach to Strength Training...I could continue, but you get the point.This one is the best for someone who wants to train at home, using as simple manual as possible, but not simpler. When I browse through those books, they contain more info, but the truly important things are all there.I personally don't use finishers, but other than that, every piece of info was very valuable for me.Google \\"Evidence Based Resistance Training Recommendations\\" and read this new analysis. As you'll see, the recommendations of the scientific paper are absolutely in line with this book.I think authors could have easily written a detailed textbook, but that would just get in the way of doing what needs to be done.You need to exercise for the rest of your life.

The introductory material is full of interesting and useful information about dumbbells, safety in the gym, and putting together an effective training program using this equipment.

This is a simple, but fairly comprehensive reference for anyone interested in training with dumbbells."},{"Title":"Dumbbell Training for Strength And Fitness","review":"This is a fantastic book. It has a load of exercises, and more importantly, lots of workouts that you can try out. My only comment would be that some of the exercises are a bit unclear. I'm somewhat afraid to do a few of them without additional resources, for fear I'll hurt myself. The pictures are grainy as well, but they get the point across. It shouldn't be a problem for anybody.I wholly recommend this book.

This book was a godsend. There are enough exercises in enough areas to construct an effective anaerobic supplement to the aerobics diabetics must do every day. All the various ways to work out in the back are fine and focused on the intermediate to advanced trainee, but the tips could help just about anyone. The slender size means that it gets read. I like that the book incorporates many suggestions from a variety of training professionals. Using a very modest subset of the exercises in this book, results were evident to me in just a few weeks, in improved definition, faster weight loss, and better overall stamina."},{"Title":"Dumbbell Training for Strength And Fitness","review":"I think others have mentioned the pictures are very small. I agree they should be larger. They should have also included some images and descriptions showing the exact muscles that are being used.

There is a larger book with thousands of dumbell variations (the \\"Great Big Book of\\") but nothing is left out of this little book. The other one in the must read list is New Rules of Lifting.The photos are small but quite clear. The instructions are quite specific about how things are held and how to stand so the photo isn't always needed. A big photo taking up half a page at a time in a big book is hardly an advantage.I think the secret is that the real facts of lifting don't really take up that much space. It has lifts arranged by muscle groups, not alphabetically, like the \\"Great Big Book of\\". It even a good size to take along with the workout gear.This book answered my questions on how to get by with squats using dumbells (one leg at a time, that's how). The book also does not focus entirely on isolation of single muscles which is a good thing. For the price I don't see what the problem is. It's great to have another view of what your doing to help keep it fresh. This and New Rules are my current reading.E"},{"Title":"Dumbbell Training for Strength And Fitness","review":"I haven't really lifted weights since the early 90's. I had taken up running and left the gym behind. Oh, I did pushups and situps and a little yoga but no strength training.Recently, I hurt my knee running sprints and I was sidelined from running for three months. I started researching high intensity training and came across Matt Brzycki's name and bought a couple of books. It has changed my life.The dumbbell workouts in this book and the principal's of the 2/4 count have transformed my body. With ridiculously low weights and time spent in the gym I have made huge gains in muscle and in my max rep in the bench and deadlift.I hate to admit this but I was starting to feel old until I starting implementing HIT and the 2/4 count. I am loving lifting weights again. I admit that I have started incorporating some barbells but that is all part of growing bigger and stronger.I recommend this book to any and all. The only problem I have experienced is weight game. I have allowed myself to pack on some fat along with my new muscles. I got to cut back on the eating.Let me say this twice.

While Dumbbell Training was mostly a dud, MH Big Book of Exercises was mostly a hit.I'm going to keep this short - as most people tend to love this title. Frankly, I found very little in the thin volume to redeem it's value. The photos are poor and the book covers basic exercises... but little else.

For a $10-$15 book that includes all this info, plus all the contributions from professional fitness coaches makes this paperback book worth its weight in gold. If you want to gaze at pictures or need to be hand-held with step-by-step photos to comprehend basic movements, then there are an endless number of training books and muscle mags out there to look at.

It provides the reader with a brief overview of HIT and then describes how to use this excellent training method with dumbbells. Is it supposed to be an encyclopedia of dumbbell exercises? Absolutely not! Is it designed to be an extensive work on the biomechanics of exercise? Not even close! It's designed to provide the reader with a simple plan for getting the most out of training with dumbbells, nothing less and nothing more. If readers are looking for exercise encyclopedias or works on biomechanics I would suggest looking elsewhere. However, if you want to get the most out of your dumbbell training, $10 is a small investment to pay for such knowledge and worth every penny."},{"Title":"Dumbbell Training for Strength And Fitness","review":"The author is a Marine and earned his degree from Penn State.

I was not looking to study the subject - simply wanted pre-developed workout routines (with pictures) from professionals - that involved all areas of my body.I had great immediate results, and within 30 days experienced improvements in size of arms, chest size, and a more pronounced shoulder structure.This book and a few dumbbells - give you the ability to work out during idle times such as watching TV."},{"Title":"Dumbbell Training for Strength And Fitness","review":"'Dumbbell Training-Strength- Fitness' is a book for everyone interested in strength training on any level.It is very easy to understand, not only how to execute the particular exercise but more importantly 'why' it is beneficial. It is a good learning tool as well as a continued reference tool. We all need tweaking at any stage of working out and this is a book I often refer back to. I am a personal trainer and have told all my clients to read it. It is easy reading. There are (no joke) a million fitness books out there and my clients could be reading till the cows come home but this book is worthwhile and a must for your library. Enjoy it!!!"},{"Title":"Dumbbell Training for Strength And Fitness","review":"If you're tired of the same old routine, check out the work outs in this book. Not only is it great for dumbbell exercises, but there are some important work out guidelines included."},{"Title":"Dumbbell Training for Strength And Fitness","review":"Some time ago I met a fellow who was into competitive body building. During our conversation he mentioned that he had developed his considerably fit and muscular physique using dumbbells, only. I was intrigued. I assumed weight training required huge heavy weights and lots of space. When I saw this book, I bought it to answer questions and satisfy my curiosity. I found the book to be detailed enough to let a novice understand the routines. There is enough technical jargon to convince me the author knows his stuff. Yet the book is very easy to understand. I thought it was nicely done. Recommended."},{"Title":"Dumbbell Training for Strength And Fitness","review":"This book was a quick read but contained good information about dumbbell training. A little history of dumbbells as well."},{"Title":"Dumbbell Training for Strength And Fitness","review":"An excellent book with enough back ground information to enhance the learning experience with photos and descriptions of the exercises. The book makes it easy to have multiple routines at your finger tips. One could use training routines provided or make up their own."},{"Title":"Dumbbell Training for Strength And Fitness","review":"I keep this book by my dumbbell set and use it for every workout. It's a great book with a wide variety of exercises."},{"Title":"Dumbbell Training for Strength And Fitness","review":"Good explanations, with some fine photos to guide your exercise/workout.

This book is great for the beginner but the advanced person may find it lacks information."},{"Title":"Dumbbell Training for Strength And Fitness","review":"If you are in a hurry than dumbbells are an excellent way to work the upper body and this book is very easy to understand. It's not a big book but is is plenty big enough with good illustrations."},{"Title":"Dumbbell Training for Strength And Fitness","review":"This is a well thought out book. The author talks about the advantages disadvantages of using dumbbells for strength training. So many people go right for the \\"big weights\\" and don't take the time to understand the science and art of creating a better body. He takes the time to go over each body part and its significance. He keeps it simple and straight to the point. A great book to ad to your collection."},{"Title":"Dumbbell Training for Strength And Fitness","review":"Lots of programs to choose from and very informative. Can seem a little overwhelming at first. I suggest picking one program, sticking with it for a while and then moving on to the next."},{"Title":"Dumbbell Training for Strength And Fitness","review":"I was disappointed with this book. The author is not specific with the muscles worked. He says an exercise works the triceps instead of which of the 3 heads it focuses on or the exercise works the abs and not if it is upper, mid or lower abs. Same thing with shoulders. The author doesn't state if the exercise works the middle delt or the rear or front delt. The descriptions of the exercises are also re-hashed. Every explanation of particular muscle groups exercises are basically the same with a few words changed out. It just seems like the author wanted to churn out this book wihout being fresh or specific."},{"Title":"Dumbbell Training for Strength And Fitness","review":"A visually unattractive guidebook that shows only well known workout routines. There simply are better alternatives to this guide. At least it is cheap though and it does seem to have the correct descriptions."},{"Title":"Dumbbell Training for Strength And Fitness","review":"I look at other books for dumbbells on Amazon, but by far this seems the most simple and easy written book. I even got a few new exercises I never new.

Got just what I needed."},{"Title":"Dumbbell Training for Strength And Fitness","review":"The expertise of Brzycki and Fornicola culminates into one great little book. Serious iron athletes who wish to add spice to their workouts, or those who are at-home trainers with limited equipment, will find a routine (of many) they can benefit from.And the price is unbeatable."},{"Title":"Dumbbell Training for Strength And Fitness","review":"In addition to listing an effective series of dumbbell exercises that work every muscle group, the authors provide important exercise guidelines. They discuss training frequency, how to perform a repetition properly, rest between sets, duration of training sessions and proper order of exercises. This not a generic, bland book- the authors are willing to give their viewpoints on controversies in exercise.The book includes exercise routines from strength coaches such as Dr. Ken Leistner, Jeff Friday (strength coach for the Baltimore Ravens) and several strength coaches for NCAA division 1 schools.The book is totally essential for anyone training at home, but will be of a great help to those training in gyms. In fact, some who train at gyms will be tempted to purchase a set of Power block dummbbells (dumbbells that go from 10-130 lbs and take up about 4 square feet) and skip their gym fees. After reading this book, you will gain a greater appreciation of the usefulness and versatility of training with dumbbells.Get this book! You will not be disappointed."},{"Title":"Dumbbell Training for Strength And Fitness","review":"If your workout employs dumbbells (Powerblocks in my case), this book is a great resource.Though Brzycki doesn't go into the depth of why HIT works as much as his other books (Maximize Your Training; A Practical Approach To Strength Training), the book does provide a reasonable background on training philosophy as well as rep, set and tempo recommendations.The gem that sets this book aside from others are the thirty plus workouts from outstanding trainers at the high school, collegiate and professional level from all around the United States. Excellent stuff that will keep any training enthusiast happy for a long time to come.Bottom line? Buy this book. It's well worth the investment in time, money and your health."},{"Title":"Dumbbell Training for Strength And Fitness","review":"There are a couple of \\"cons\\" to this book: I agree with previous comments that the photos are too small and not always at the best angle for showing the proper positions. Also, some of the models are wearing oversized T-shirts and sweatshirts that make it hard to see how they are holding their arms, positioning the back, etc. I also agree with the previous reviewer who said the squat in this book is a Bulgarian Squat, not what people would normally do for a regular squat. And the lunge does look like a split squat, not a regular lunge. When a routine in the book calls for a squat, I do a regular squat, not the Bulgarian Squat from the book.But overall this is a great book, with many great upper body routines, split routines, and specialization routines to choose from. Each routine was sumbitted by a different professional, and I'm enjoying sampling all the different training styles! The routines are short too, which makes it easy to stick with and find time to fit in a workout."},{"Title":"Dumbbell Training for Strength And Fitness","review":"This book is valuable to anyone who wants to get the best results from his/her strength routine, whether training at home or training in a gym. Not only does this book describe how to train correctly (good form, proper intensity, recommended volume, etc.), it also provides many sample strength training routines that cover the whole body. This book can also teach one how to train with barbells and machines. It is not just limited to dumbells.I keep a copy of this book on the shelf above my desk and use it as a quick reference when training my clients and/or athletes. I highly recommend this book to any trainee or strength coach/fitness trainer.Jeff Holt, M.Ed.Professional Sports and Fitness Trainer"},{"Title":"Dumbbell Training for Strength And Fitness","review":"Dumbbell Training for Strength And Fitness is a well-written and illustrated guide to safe and effective dumbbell training. If, like me, you've been training with dumbbells for years and prefer it to other training methods, this book will expand your knowledge base on dumbbell training and provide a ton of tips on technique you would typically get only from a very knowledgeable personal trainer. If you are just getting started, most importantly, this book will walk you through the proper technique for dumbbell training. I cannot stress enough, especially with dumbbells, the need for \\"safe\\" training for longevity and \\"effective\\" training to achieve the results that motivate you to keep training.

It's 10 bucks! Makes one wonder what axe they have to grind. Not surprisingly, the reviewer promotes a competing book.I find that many of the reviews are misleading. For one thing, this isn't a beginner's book. It describes 50 different exercises in good depth, with instructions and photos, and it contains around 30 different workouts.The photos are not too small or too blurry to see. My eyesight isn't great but I had no trouble at all. By keeping them on the small side, the book could be much more compact, which is helpful during my workouts.The background information runs from basic to advanced. I am no novice, yet I picked up quite a few new things I hadn't known previously.For $10, it's hard to go wrong with this book. I researched quite a few and this is the one I like best."},{"Title":"Dumbbell Training for Strength And Fitness","review":"After reading some favorable comments on this book. I ordered it. IT WAS A MAJOR DISAPPOINTMENT!!! The other negative review stated that he found \\"small, low resolution blurry black and white photas\\" to learn how to do the exercises. The book describes how to do a particular exercise, and reinforces on how to do it by showing you either one or two photos - except the author uses a photo the actual size of a postage stamp!!It is literally impossible to learn the finer points of a particular exercise by looking at the photo. The resolution is poor and cloudy, and it is the size of an actual postage stamp. This book could have been an ideal instruction book, but the author deleted and curtailed the ability to teach the reader by only showing only a mini size photo on how to do the various exercises, It is almost impossible to see how an exercise is perform if you are looking at a cloudy black and white photo the size of a postage stamp.Abdominals are important. This author uses a mere six (6) small pages to explain the instructions on how to do three (3) exercises. He does this by showing you a mere seven photos the size of a postage stamp, and they are cloudy at that. Further on, he uses a mere four (4) pages to teach you how to overhaul your upper back, and again shows just three exercises on how to do it.The book was of little or no use to this particular reader."},{"Title":"Dumbbell Training for Strength And Fitness","review":"This book was a great way for me, as a complete beginner, to learn my way around all the basic exercises for all the major muscle groups.It is great for a beginner because:1) It requires no previous knowledge.2) It requires no fancy equipment (a basic dumbbell bench would be nice, but isn't necessary).3) It emphasizes safety and proper technique.4) Between this book and some cheap hex dumbbells dumbbells I spent about $50.I got appreciable results in just a few weeks by working out in my living room (I'm not going to be a model anytime soon, but I'm stronger and more fit than I was before).If you already use dumbbells in your routine, then you probably don't need this book. I'm sure after I get some experience under my belt, a dumbbell bench, and a wider array of dumbbells, I'll want a more comprehensive book, but for the price, this was a great investment."},{"Title":"Dumbbell Training for Strength And Fitness","review":"A good basic book on common sense strength training. There were a couple of minor editing erros, but otherwise well done.

Great history, great tips and instructions, and WJ's original recipes. I remember eating in his restaurants back in the 1960's, and these taste the same as I remember. This book was a major point of contention in my first divorce (she got the book and I got an incomplete photocopy) so I was very happy to find it on Amazon after all these years. One real shocker was the original cover price of $1.00! It's well worth 20 times that if you want to turn out some great food.

My synopsis: Money is subject to anything. Some people care about it and others don't. Certain \\"blue stag\\" films were made to blackmail the future president of US. Hired professional killers test their experience to get those films any way possible in this exciting and thrilling story. Betrayal, hatred and sexual appeal are all mixed up in this intriguing and suspenseful fiction."},{"Title":"The Whiff of Money","review":"James Hadley Chase (Ren&eacute; Brabazon Raymond), an Englishman who never visited America, wrote some of the toughest, most compelling hard-boiled crime fiction of the mid-twentieth century (his best-known work was No Orchids for Miss Blandish), all or most of it set in America and comparing favorably, in my opinion, with the better-known James Cain and Jim Thompson. He studied the writings of other hard-boiled mystery writers to master the American idiom, and studied maps to describe American locations plausibly- his books read like books written by an American, not like books written by an Englishman trying to ape American styles. Like many writers of suspense thrillers, however, Chase switched to writing espionage novels in the 1960's to fill the demand for more books that resembled the James Bond movies and the Man From U.N.C.L.E. TV show (but not, sadly, Ian Fleming's James Bond novels). Most of these espionage thrillers do not show the authors at their best, and that's certainly the case with Chase's efforts in the genre. Even worse, he had entirely lost his ear for the modern idiom, even when the idiom was common to both England and America. He insists, for example, that hipsters are a type of trousers rather than a type of bohemian (I think he confused them with hiphuggers), and his hero does not \\"dig\\" the things he likes- he \\"digs for\\" them. The result is embarrassingly awful, like some elderly person's unsuccessful attempts to speak the language of hip-hop. Collectors of Chase, of which there are deservedly many, are advised to stick this book on the shelf unread. The only things that it has going for it are that Chase still retained the knack for coming up with a snappy title (some of his other titles include Kiss My Fist, Well Now My Pretty, The Dead Stay Dumb, and There's Always a Price Tag) and that it isn't camp."},{"Title":"The Whiff of Money","review":"A pornography which portrays in picture, an embarrassingly, feature of the daughter of the future president of the United States comes alive when a secret Agent such as Mark Kirkland receive an instruction on an assignment to locate and retrieve the three copies of the pornographic films. His mission must remain a top secret, His quest leads him to the depths of Bavaria where he finds Soviet agent, Malik, and however, sidekick Lu Silk is also more anxious and rather interested in the whereabouts of the films. Who will find them first? And once found, who's to say they won't immediately disappear again? The book is a brain storming season for crime lovers, it portray a special suspense for book lovers, the scene has a beginning but by the time you must have closed the last pages, you will be grumbling for the end of the drama but you might by sad to find none, because the drama continues even as the pages ends."},{"Title":"The Human Condition","review":"For a secular philosopher, Hannah Arendt certainly presents a challenge to Christian thought. However, much of her writing stimulates lines of thought that would not otherwise have been pursued. She cites Jesus as the \\"discoverer\\" of personal forgiveness who presents it as an alternative to the moral system of sacrifices in a temple in his day, thus removing the authority from a priesthood to control the populace. A Christian might rather say of Jesus that he is the creator of forgiveness, not the discoverer, but her observation remains about the dynamics of who controls the moral system in place."},{"Title":"The Human Condition","review":"This book is a groundbreaking book; however, I did not enjoy it as much as other books by Arendt. I believe that some of its arguments are flawed. However, I do not doubt Arendt's talent or sincerity in the presentation of her ideas."},{"Title":"The Human Condition","review":"............ever came close to explaining the workings of man as a political and social animal nearly as well as HA.

I recommend reading this piece before Arendt's books: Between Past and Future, and Crises of the Republic."},{"Title":"The Human Condition","review":"~~~Arendt's Critique...Dr. Arendt was schooled inKant's hometown of K&ouml;nigsberg, and later studied withHeideggerandJaspers.After 1933 she fled to Paris and befriendedWalterBenjamin--till the latter's heroic suicide upon being balked in his escape to USA (rather than allow himself to be taken alive by the Germans); contemporaneously, Arendt was able to escape to USA where she later taught at UC Berkley, Princeton, Yale, and the U of Chicago.Arendt exercised her incisive critique of political theory in major essays such asThe Origins of Totalitarianism,On Violence,The Life of the Mind, and in her fundamental statement of The Human Condition.But of what does Arendt's Human Condition (1958) consist?What is it?Well, it's a multifaceted work addressing a critique of cultural Modernism with a prescient view towards an incipient Postmodernism.It's a work of intellectual history (history of ideas) which narrates courses of change (whether evolutionary or devolutionary) in Western thought, technes, and information management--(and as such it makes a nice bookend toBarzun's magnum opus).It's a work of social and political economy which understands Marx as well as crony capitalism.Arendt's Human Condition--written in a sparkling English prose and (thankfully) annotated in CMS--encompasses all of these facets--(and withal, it is a diamond-like work in the tradition ofSchiller's Letters on the Aesthetic Education of Man).Along the way, Arendt modestly shows her brilliant scholarship in her effortless manipulation of original-language primary sources (in Greek, Latin, French, and German), while vivifying her marvellous mastery of the expanse of history's colourful and complexly-wrought tapestry.Arendt's calm sound reason is extremely appealing.For the student/scholar who concerns him/herself with the implications of human cultural movement from Antiquity to Medievalism to Modernism to Postmodernism--(unto our current state of Neoprimitivism, c. 2013), Arendt's Condition is a sine qua non.~~~"},{"Title":"The Human Condition","review":"Arendt has a unique way of explaining her ideas. It's everything but traditional. This really challenges the reader. It's not easy reading this book- but I love it. In my opinion, if you're looking for a rather historical approach to our human condition, you can find that in this book."},{"Title":"The Human Condition","review":"I feel that this book should be essential reading for any literature or philosophy major/student. While is seems to meander at times and often lacks focus, every page is thick with inspiration and unique insight."},{"Title":"The Human Condition","review":"Excellent book! It is provocative and filled with very insightful ideas. The entire question of durability that she raises, opens up an fascinating way to interpret suburban culture and the form of disposal capitalism associated with Walmart and the like."},{"Title":"The Human Condition","review":"Most of the most contentious contemporary issues, like abortion, euthanasia and healthcare, welfare, tobacco, and suchlike, concern the problem of life. The argument can be made, and Arendt makes it, that the modern state, in its care for life, has moved from the power over death (capital punishment) to the power over life. It is Arendt's purpose to show that modern politics, in its absorption the public by the private, turns politics into economics (the household), where formerly the care of &quot;life&quot; was located. In a world in which there is neither the immortality of the state nor the individual, bare life becomes the highest value. (Strauss makes the argument that a politics that begins in the state of nature leads directly to &quot;humanitarianism,&quot; to a politics devoted to eliminating suffering, and the argument is the same.) A politics devoted to life leaves no &quot;space&quot; (a decidedly unGreek word, used again and again by Arendt and every hip business exec today) for politics, for the play of concealment and disclosure, darkness and light, bright shining words and the privacy and darkness of pain, defecation, eating, love, etc. It is Heidegger put to good use, and Arendt reminds us that the elimination of the politics, or its suppression, is inseparable from a Seinsvergessenheit, but the real life-and-death issue is better grasped by Schmitt and Strauss, who do not fall into the trap of aestheticizing politics."},{"Title":"The Human Condition","review":"I bought this as a gift for a friend and started readin it myself to preview it. It was great. A definite good buy."},{"Title":"The Human Condition","review":"The last chapter of the first ed of \\"The Human Condition\\" is a thinly-veiled Heideggerian attack on science including capitalized \\"Being\\" and one falsehood or false dichotomy or simple fallacy after another. Some of the nonsense is hard to track since the Rockefeller Fnd. did not require the publication to have a bibliography or an adequate index. In the 1st Ed there is no footnote to Heidegger - but his views on \\"handling\\" and \\"instruments\\" and \\"disclosure\\" and \\"world\\" are everywhere.The worst is her grasp of science: she appears not to have read some of the books she quotes (her letters to Heidegger reveal that she only read Merleau-Ponty in 1972; Jaspers reveals in more than one place that he was in the habit of speed reading.)In 1957 for view of \\"geophysics\\" is seriously out of date.In 1957 she still fails to grasp that neither the STR nor the GTR entail moral relativism ( the the theories might have been called the theories of Invariance ).She fails to distinguish evolution of the earth from evolution of nature (?) from evolution of man and lumps all 3 in the same sentence into the same glib pronouncement. This book remains popular with closet-Christian philosophers and closet-Heideggerians as well as openly Christian and Heideggerian philosophers.See Hilary Putnam debunking Gruenbaum; see John Earman on determinismNote the \\"index\\" has no entry for \\"cause\\", \\"causal\\" or \\"causality\\" but discusses ends, entelechy and related.Note the index has no entry for ideas or Eidos or related all they are there.Is the index adequate in the 2nd Ed? Does the 2nd Ed. have a biography? Why buy such a book new?Saddest his her ignorance of the work of Emmy Noether on groups and symmetries - and almost as sad her ignorance of the work of female mathematicians such as Kovalevsky.Arendt appears not to have understood that two bodies are said to rotate about their common center of mass; Arendt appears not to have understood the difference between velocity and acceleration even prior to Einstein; she shows a failure to understand the difference between Mach and three other viewpoints: non-geocentric, Archimedean and \\"fixed point\\". At various points it is clear that she means fixed point and at others Mach's no-privileged point.Her view of Descartes is grossly biased (it is the Heideggerian view).Her view of experimental physics is a mix of operationalism and instrumentalism.She fails repeatedly to distinguish mathematical physics from experimental physics; there is no mention of Gamow and Hoyle or Hubble: she stops at Eddington.She wisely ignores the issue of the orbit of Mercury.She focuses on the telescope but then shows that she is utterly ignorant of the issues faced by the \\"makers\\" of telescopes about whom she glibly babbles.She repeats Heidegger's view that no one now understands electromagnetic radiation without commenting on what Maxwell achieved in elegance and simplification ( see Heidegger's television broadcast.)She fails to understand what Einstein received his Nobel proze for in here silly remarks about matter and energy.Her remarks about radiation make it claear that she was unaware of what Madame Curie had done - the actions - in a book about makers, doers and vita activa (see Peirre and Marie work with Pitchblende).She appears not to realize that uranium occurs naturally.She confuses in vitro fertilization with eugenics.She shows no understanding of what differential geometry had achieved.She is wrong about Galileo's own views (she repeats views of Heidegger and Husserl.)Is the 2nd Edition in improved in anyway?As someone devoted to phenomenology, poetry and astronomy I can only say that her book is appalling as scholarship. Much of her assertions are mere journalism expressing \\"fears\\" and \\"worries\\" about the \\"modern\\".I have some work on phenomenology and astronomy started at [...] and on annotating Heidegger texts at [...]Some annotated texts are now appearing at [...]Odd note: the 1st Ed had no credit for the cover image"},{"Title":"The Human Condition","review":"This is a brilliant work by a foremost intellectual of our times, Hannah Arendt. Though labelled under &quot;political theory&quot;, this book is actually a existential (Heideggerian) analysis of the &quot;Human Condition&quot;, emphasizing especially its social and political elements, as befits a work written in the second half of the 20th century.I will not attempt to summarize it; suffice to say it is one of the finest works of 20th century philosophy. Highly recommended to anyone interested in political philosophy of a different sort.Oran Magal, graduate student of philosophy, Tel Aviv University"},{"Title":"The Human Condition","review":"I should forewarn those who are about to the buy this book that you ought to first be well read in ancient Greek Culture: philosophy, political city-state as well as Greek mythology. Arendt uses a lot of Greek terminology which can make it incredibly difficult for the average Liberal Arts student or international student, for that matter, who are unfamiliar with these these terms.No doubt the concepts she spoke of in the mid-50s are more than applicable to todays society. She was clearly a woman ahead of her time, but much too brainy for her own good. Chapter 2 on the \\"Public and Private Realm\\" is a 50+ page drag, emphasis on the word DRAG. I'm barely scraping through this chapter.Had Arendt chosen to write in a taut, less opulent but fluid fashion, she could have easily connected to average readers and would have been an instant bestseller. If she did in fact become one...then more power to her.Two cents worth from a frustrated liberal arts student."},{"Title":"The Human Condition","review":"This book nicely discloses the ghost of Heidegger in much of Arendt's writing. In short: forget your 'banal' bourgeois 'jobholder' worries about material things! leave issues of redistribution or poverty to the animals! instead, stick your toga on, leave the slaves and wives indoors and ... let's do manly politics! Arendt should have ditched this hyper-masculinist, romantic Grecophilia after it got us to Auschwitz. Go read Hobbes or Montaigne if you seek a far more humane perspective on life after human carnage (in their 'bourgeois' determination to keep romantic-mystical yearnings out of the public sphere). Physically, this book just about slips inside Arendt's larger monograph on the origins of totalitarianism. I fear it is ultimately where it belongs."},{"Title":"The Human Condition","review":"I had to read this book for class but it was so wordy and awkward that i couldn't get through it.

Do not make the mistake of buying (or buying into) this piece of junk. Reading it actually makes me ill."},{"Title":"The Human Condition","review":"In \\"The human condition\\", Arendt distinguishes three kinds of activities the human being is capable of: labor, action and work. I will attempt to explain the first two, and I will leave the third to you so as to motivate you to read the book :)Labor is, according to Arendt, those human activities whose main aim is to allow men to survive, for example eating, drinking and sleeping. These activities belong to the private sphere, and while the human being strives painstakingly to perform them, he is not free.On the other hand, Action is the moment when the human being develops the capacity that distinguishes him, the ability of being free. This is the public sphere, where men, after having provided for themselves and their families what was needed to \\"continue in existence\\", can at last be free.Arendt shows us the historical evolution of these concepts, and how that evolution is connected to the evolution of the concept of work. At the end of this book, you will have analyzed with her the human condition, from the point of view of the activities that the human being is capable of. What is more, you will be able to have a valid view regarding the past, and an interesting perspective on what is happening now, and on what the future may bring to us. Yes, it is true that this book was released a long time ago, but I believe that it is still as important now as it was then.Arendt (1906-1975) was a respected professor and thinker, who wrote books that greatly influenced quite a few of her contemporaries. Even though her more significant book was \\"Origins of Totalitarianism\\" (1951), \\"The human condition\\" is also essential in order to understand her ideas. Not only that, it will probably help you to understand our society, or at least to contemplate it through the eyes of a remarkably good political scientist.I must warn you that \\"The human condition\\" isn't overly easy to read, and that you might find yourself re-reading a paragraph a few times before understanding what it means. However, at the end of the book you will realize that the effort is worthwhile, because then all you have read makes sense and leaves you with the sensation of having understood some concepts that you will find useful.On the whole, recommended. You aren't likely to \\"have fun\\" reading this book, but it will be useful to you, and if you manage to finish it, you will realize that you benefited from it. So, PERSEVERANCE ):Belen Alcat"},{"Title":"The Human Condition","review":"This book is extraordinarily accessible and thought-provoking for undergraduate students. I have used it in my course on twentieth-century women philosophers. Arendt, without citing Husserl or Heidegger, enacts what I would call a phenomenology of action. That is, she examines the experience of the vita activa (or life of action) by describing it on its own terms. For Arendt, Marx and Smith were wrong to say that human life is fundamentally about labor or about skilled work. Human life is not mostly for or about the consumption of commodities and entrenching one's family ties. Rather, human life is about establishing a public, political realm that emulates (but does not simply attempt to reproduce) the Greek polis. Humanity is about opening up a space for meaning and for evanescent but important co-creation of what counts as a good life.For Arendt, action is fragile, frail, unpredictable, and irreversible. Action appreciates the differences between humans within the outlines of a nation, for example, and action does not simply attempt to compel others to yield to a single, sovereign will. Action calls those who participate in true politics to realize the sense of 'e pluribus unum' and to make sure that the plurality or 'pluribus' is not simply a fading memory in the face of the One.To make her point, Arendt delves into Judeo-Christian scriptures, as well as the history of philosophy (Plato, Aristotle, Augustine, Aquinas, Marx, and Nietzsche), attempting to reconcile a desire for shared power with a need for mutual forgiveness. Students respond well to the nexus of issues that Arendt raises, especially to the idea that 'radical evil' cannot be (but that most ordinary transgressions must be) forgiven.Arendt helps students prepare for more texts in 20th Century philosophy, especially those by Edith Stein (On the Problem of Empathy), Simone de Beauvoir (Ethics of Ambiguity), and Maurice Merleau-Ponty (Phenomenology of Perception). Her discussion of action and intersubjectivity is essentially a dialogue with Husserl and Heidgger, and to me this should show her as not only discussing but also enacting respect and forgiveness (respectively)."},{"Title":"The Human Condition","review":"It's hard to give a summary of this book, which touches on so many issues. In her introduction, Margaret Canovan notes that many academic critics, at the time of the book's first publication in 1958, found Arendt's argument &quot;beneath refutation.&quot; The book is indeed something of a long essay in form and is not immediately &quot;falsifiable&quot; or arguable in the sense that most narrow academic texts are. Canovan also notes that many readers were thrown by Arendt's ongoing gesture (my words) of explaining contemporary social life in the vocubulary of Ancient Greek thought. In intellectual-history terms, this move of Arendt's is no surprise. She was a student of Heidegger's; many Continental thinkers fell under his spell. (Potential readers of &quot;The Human Condition&quot; might want to contrast it with &quot;The Embers and the Stars&quot; by Erazim Kohak, who also constructs a philosophy out of the etymologies of Greek words, but not of social life, but of the environment and nature.)In short, Arendt's book is interesting reading for anyone involved in the world of work. Her categories of &quot;labor,&quot; &quot;work,&quot; and &quot;action&quot; provide an interesting way of thinking about society. A back-cover blurb from poet W. H. Auden talks about &quot;The Human Condition&quot; as &quot;one of those books that seem to have been written especially for me.&quot; I would go further and recommend Arendt to any artist or budding artist or anyone who has ever seen themselves as being of an artistic temperament. Arendt provides a philosophical view of the artist in society, as opposed to a lyrical view, which is what one might find in, say, Joyce's &quot;Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man.&quot; Arendt's vision is more realistic. A wonderful book!"},{"Title":"The Human Condition","review":"Hannah Arendt makes the case that what distinguishes human beings is that they are constantly making new beginnings. This leads her to theories of social action that have implications for our self esteem, our &quot;making of ourselves&quot; and how we influence and participate in social action.She reveals the implications of this inherent tendency to &quot;make new beginnings&quot; in the uncertainty of outcomes of our action. What we start we cannot know the outcome of beforehand. That is, in significant part, because those who come along after we start something will add or change with their own capacity for making new beginnings.This says we need social attributes of foregiveness. She also develops the importance of promising in a culture so that we can create some certainty by this social action.She is writing about social action and involvement in the broad social life. But she could as easily be writing about entrepreneurship and corporate life or any any other social activity.A stimulating book indeed!"},{"Title":"The Human Condition","review":"Arendt's book is really more a disquisition on political theory than an explanation of the human condition in all its endlessly tragic vicissitudes.It was interesting, and I learned more about ancient Greek and Roman political theory than I really wanted to know; with the most interesting facet being the defining of the terms \\"labor\\", \\"work\\", and \\"action\\" as they pertain to the the means by which the human animal has his being in the world. But by and large, it really didn't touch on the human condition in a way that enlarged my understanding of the essence of its gestalt.The most interesting chapter is the one on action as the public realm in which some men choose to live and act, and how that affects both the present and the future. While action is essentially ephemeral in nature, its impact on the human condition is one that can and often does have unintended consequences reaching far into the future like ripples on a pond spreading outward from a central occurence. It is that very unpredictability that is its foremost feature.Labor too is ephemeral in nature, in its attendance on the basic needs of mankind, food and shelter. Only work, in Arendt's estimation is durable and in this category she places all forms of art.It is not an easy book to read but, given a little effort, accessible to even a novice at political theory."},{"Title":"The Human Condition","review":"this book starts off with a breathtaking reflections on the launch of the sputnik. arendt seemingly places us before the launch as witness, evoking the kind of awe, wonderment, fear and anxiety that must arise from such a sight. the prologue is amazing.i could easily come up with at least a dozen potential research projects from this book that arendt just touches on the surface. (as is the case with arendt's philosophy, it is, at its best, always very suggestive but, at its worst, she never follows through on the initial offering.)and arendt considered this book as her response to the influence of heidegger; i think that this is a most correct assessment. in fact, this is the great heidegger-book that heidegger himself never could have written. in my view, the latter heidegger pales in comparison (on subjects such as technology, poetry, speech, and history, arendt tops her former mentor). heidgger was truely out-foxed by this book.i suspect that even the amateur (defined here as the lover of an entity-x) will find much in this book to make this a life-changing experience. in philosophy we often talk of such 'life-changing' books but they are really few in number. this is one such book.be on the look out for the moment where the discussion of nietzsche's conception of the promise effortlessly morphs into the birth of christ as a miracle. (note: for arendt, the miracle isn't christ but the birth itself, for that matter any birth).full of grace, this book will be devastating and ultimately redeeming."},{"Title":"The Human Condition","review":"Arendt's book is a masterpiece of modern philosophy. Like any masterpiece, especially of philosophy, and even more especially of modern philosophy, this mistakes it very difficult to summarize. In this book, she draws on the history of Western thought from the ancient Jews, Greeks, and Romans through to Marx and Nietzsche to diagnose, as the title puts it, \\"the human condition.\\" Nearly every page is filled with insight into what it means to be human. She moves swiftly through the ages, introducing us to the ideas that have shaped our modern way of life and our way of viewing ourselves. And she finally ends with where we are at and why a reevaluation of our own humanity is now more pressing than ever (and now even more pressing than when Arendt wrote the book): our worst fears have been realized. Man has been simultaneously reduced to the state of an animal - a biological machine of no lasting worth - and elevated to the position of a god - capable of destroying worlds. What are we to do now? I recommend that everyone read this book - and ponder ever word deeply."},{"Title":"The Human Condition","review":"Arendt begins her opus magnum with a proposal: she states that the launch of Sputnik in 1957 (similar to Vaclav Havel's proposal of the moon landing) has hearkened in a new age of humanity. Following this proposal is one of the most mysterious but rewarding books of the 20th century, in my humble opinion.I first encountered \\"The Human Condition\\" in an undergraduate class regarding the post-modern community. To this day, I still have not completely digested this work. Her objective, in her own words, is to determine \\"... what it is that we are doing\\", and her choice of a goal is challenging considering what is to follow. Situating herself between a Greek model of society and a Marxist interpretation of labor, Arendt calls into question our ideas of progress, technology, and even forgiveness, and aims a withering critique at the subjective personality of the post-modern world.I won't go into a broad summary of her points to convince you to read it, but instead implore the reader of this review to see for themselves what Arendt is doing. Some will give up on this book after a few pages, calling it semantical nonsense. Yet for those who forge a path through Arendt's intelligent interpretation of history will come out on the other side with a new appreciation for the way in which they live their lives, participate in this thing we call \\"work\\", and interact with the human community. I can't stress enough how much this book means to me."},{"Title":"The Human Condition","review":"Hannah Arendt is one of the foremost political thinkers of the twentieth century. But more than this she is a thinker who attempts to understand the human situation in all its fundamental aspects. Her analysis of the Human Condition is at once a historical and a philosophical work which aims to speak to and describe the contemporary condition of mankind. One important element in the work is her etymological readings of fundamental philosophical concepts. Her tracing of their development and explanations of reality in terms of them is one of the great strengths of the book. Arendt in analyzing these concepts and in describing the human condition shows herself to have both a powerful skill in argument and in narrative.The basic three- part division between the life of labor, of production, and of action informs her analysis throughout. She attempts to understand the transformations in the condition of mankind through these categories. And one of her great themes is her sense of the decline of the public realm, the realm where action takes place. Her analysis of the problem is by the way far more convincing than her brief suggestion of a possible answer at the end of the book.I have really said almost nothing in this review about this tremendously insightful and rich work. The reader who wishes to stay with it will learn a whole new vocabulary for understanding the world. Whether the reader agrees with each and every point of Arendt's analysis is not the major question. When you are in her presence you are in the presence of a mind that uplifts and exalts, that makes you sense the world of the mind is a higher realm.I believe for the ' person for whom ' thought ' is important this can be a very valuable work."},{"Title":"The Human Condition","review":"~~~Arendt's Critique...Dr. Arendt was schooled inKant's hometown of K&ouml;nigsberg, and later studied withHeideggerandJaspers.After 1933 she fled to Paris and befriendedWalterBenjamin--till the latter's heroic suicide upon being balked in his escape to USA (rather than allow himself to be taken alive by the Germans); contemporaneously, Arendt was able to escape to USA where she later taught at UC Berkley, Princeton, Yale, and the U of Chicago.Arendt exercised her incisive critique of political theory in major essays such asThe Origins of Totalitarianism,On Violence,The Life of the Mind, and in her fundamental statement of The Human Condition.But of what does Arendt's Human Condition (1958) consist? What is it?Well, it's a multifaceted work addressing a critique of cultural Modernism with a prescient view towards an incipient Postmodernism.It's a work of intellectual history (history of ideas) which narrates courses of change (whether evolutionary or devolutionary) in Western thought, technes, and information management--(and as such it makes a nice bookend toBarzun's magnum opus).It's a work of social and political economy which understands Marx as well as crony capitalism.Arendt's Human Condition--written in a sparkling English prose and (thankfully) annotated in CMS--encompasses all of these facets--(and withal, it is a diamond-like work in the tradition ofSchiller's Letters on the Aesthetic Education of Man).Along the way, Arendt modestly shows her brilliant scholarship in her effortless manipulation of original-language primary sources (in Greek, Latin, French, and German), while vivifying her marvellous mastery of the expanse of history's colourful and complexly-wrought tapestry.Her calm sound reasoning is admirable.For the student/scholar who concerns him/herself with the implications of human cultural movement from Antiquity to Medievalism to Enlightenment to Modernism to Postmodernism--(unto our current state of Neoprimitivism, c. 2013), Arendt's Condition is a sine qua non.~~~"},{"Title":"Management Decisions And Financial Accounting Reports","review":"I very much liked the relative brevity of this text compared with other Intermediate Accounting texts.I do have one issue with the authors however. In reviewing their material on the differences between debt and equity on pp. 64-65 I felt that they needed to expand their coverage to note that debt on the balance sheet requires a formal contract with a fixed maturity date, periodic interest payments, security in case of default, and a clear statement about the role of the debtholder in management and the recording of debt interest as an expense. Equity on the balance sheet may require the creation of a bill of sale for shares of stock in the case of a start-up. Also, some consideration of the nature of the risks and rewards of both forms of capital contribution."},{"Title":"A Zooful of Animals","review":"Ms. Munsinger's pictures make this book come alive.

Someone posted in here that Bruce &quot;Stole&quot; his art from Savate. This simply is not true. Nor is it true that Savate makes up any part of Shaolin Arts. Bruce liked what he saw in Savate and incorporated this in Jeet Kune Do, but by no means is Savate synonomous with Jeet Kune Do, but rather just one piece of the many pieces that Bruce used in his own personal expression of the Martial Arts.I have been trying to retrace the footsteps of Bruce Lee from a very young age, and Savate is definitely one of the mechanisms for that. Bruce was well grounded in Wing Chun, but added the kicks from Savate.

He's the greatest travel writer who ever lived. He had a staggering command of the English language and he spoke several other languages as well; he easily picked up Arabic, Hindu, etc. wherever he traveled. He was fearless in inserting himself into situations that would terrorize most other travelers. If he needed to sleep, he lay down under a palm tree by the Bay of Bengal; what's the problem? He's so far above criticism that any comment is pathetically inadequate. What can you say about a guy who wrote, of his fellow vagabonds living out their lives in a charity home in Madras, India: \\"Sad fate, indeed, for those who, in the years of their strength and inspiration, had made the world their playground, to be sentenced thus to end their days in the meager bit of space to which sightless eyes or paralyzed limbs confined them, while they wandered on in spirit over boundless seas and trackless sand.\\""},{"Title":"A VAGABOND JOURNEY AROUND THE WORLD","review":"Great Travel Books, A Vagabond Journey Around the WorldAmtrak train from Penn Station NYC to Rochester, NYAugust 19, 2007Homepage: http://canciondelvagabundo.googlepages.comGreat Travel Books page: http://canciondelvagabundo.googlepages.com/greattravelbooksA Vagabond Journey Around the World- This is the classic, seminal work of Harry A. Franck, who was life long traveller and writer. Of his twenty or so books that describe his travels through nearly the entire planet, this is his first and, and in my opinion, best. The travels that make up A Vagabond Journey were undertaken when the author was young, adventurous, and not yet a professional writer. In this book, Franck describes rather than explains; show rather than tells. Simply put, he wrote this book from the hip, with the seeming intention of documenting his experiences and impressions of the world as he found it- and nothing more. His focus seems to have been more on travelling the world than writing a book, which I feel is a necessary recipe for compiling a good travel book. Travel first, write second. This book is about adventure- pure and simple. It is about the simple human urge to GO , to walk over the farthest hill. . . just to find that the only thing there is the journey over the next hill. In fact the journey that made up the book was started as a be. From the Forward of Explanation of A Vagabond Journey Around the World:Some years ago, while still an undergraduate, I chanced to be present at an informal gathering in which the conversation turned to confessions of respective ambitions.\\"If I had a few thousands,\\" sighed a senior, \\"I'd make a trip around the world.\\"\\"Modest ambition \\" retorted a junior, \\"But you'd better file it away for future reference, till you have made the money.\\"\\"With all due respect to bank accounts,\\" I observed, \\"I believe a man with a bit of energy and good health could start without money and make a journey around the globe.\\"Laughter assailed the suggestion; yet as time rolled on I found myself often musing over that hastily conceived notion. Travel for pleasure has ever been considered a special privilege of the wealthy. That a man without ample funds should turn tourist seems to his fellow-beings an action little less reprehensible than an attempt to finance a corporation on worthless paper.A rebellion against this traditional notion suggested a problem worthy of investigation. What would befall the man who set out to girdle the globe as the farmer's boy sets out to seek his fortune in a neighboring city; on alert for every opportunity, yet scornful of the fact that every foot of the way has not been paved for him?Were I permitted an avocation it would be the study of social conditions; what surer way fo gaining vital knowledge of modern society than to live and work among the world's workmen in every clime? In the final reckoning, too, an inherent Wanderlust, to which, as an American, I lay no claim as a unique characteristic, was certainly not without its influence.In this way, A Vagabond Journey Around the World was born.What I find to be most impressive about this work is that Franck did not bother trying to educate his audience or finding obscure little historic anecdotes to ensure that his book would be regarded as a work of literature. No, he simply wrote through the lens of his own experience and nothing more. All assumptions about the lands and people that he travelled amongst must be made through this record of experience- through the man himself. Franck was a man who wrote; the author cannot be removed from his words. A Vagabond Journey is a pure testament to the Wanderlust in all regards; I bow down and defer to it as a classic. This book is a joyous celebration of the Road. This is the tale of a true Vagabond Journey Around the World.It sets my feet a walking. . . with a smile on my face.I wish for all travellers to read it."},{"Title":"A VAGABOND JOURNEY AROUND THE WORLD","review":"This is a fantastic book.

Alphabetically arranged","review":"First published in London in 1803 by Mary Hays, famous for her relationship with Mary Wollestonecraft , this collection of female biographies is now considered as the very first major reference of women, for women, and written by a woman. The work includes approximately 290 women from the classical period up to the 17th century. In the work, Hays offers an introduction of her own appraisal of the lives and works of feminists before Wollstonecraft. She includes Joan d'Arc,Mary Astell, Aphara (sic) Behn, Anne Boleyn, Antoinette Bourignon, Anne Bradstreet, Susanna Centlivre, Mary Chapone, Sarah Fielding, Katherine Phillips, and many more.Mary Hays (1760-1843) was a feminist and radical born in London. Hays met Mary Wollstonecraft in 1792 and William Godwin provided counseling as she worked on her Memoirs of Emma Courtney (1796). Her views and her depiction of her own unrequited love made her a favorite target for savage reactionary abuse She defended Godwin in The Monthly Magazine 1796-7 and her Appeal to the Men of Great Britain in Behalf of the Women, 1798 deplores perpetual babyism and urges vocational training and financial independence [Her] Female Biography treats heroines before Wollstonecraft, whom Hays tended on her death-bed and praised in obituaries[Blain p. 504].Her work, Memoirs of Emma Courtney (1796) is probably her best-known work. The novel draws on the experience of her affair with William Frend, and may also have elements of her relationship with Godwin. The heroine falls in love with a penniless man Augustus Harley, and offers to live with him as his wife, without getting married. She is rejected and then turns to Mr Francis, a character based on Godwin. They exchange philosophical letters, but in the end he advises her against becoming too emotional. The critical response to the novel was divided along political lines. Free love is seen to be aligned with social and domestic repression is shown as upholding the political order."},{"Title":"Africa Works: Disorder as Political Instrument (African Issues)","review":"The authors of &quot;Africa Works&quot; pose a series of challenges to the existing Western orthodoxy about African politics and government. What if Africa is headed neither toward anarchy nor Western-style modernity, but toward its own unique brand of the future? What if politics is envisioned in a fundamentally different manner in Africa than in the West? What if African political elites were not being manipulated by international institutions, but were in fact doing the manipulating themselves?In asking these questions, Chabal and Daloz force the reader to reexamine his or her view of Africa and its place in history. They require that Africans no longer be looked at as perpetual victims in the patterns of world events, but as agents in their own destinies. They suggest that African elites have actually engineered the present state of disorder on the continent and do everything in their power to preserve it, and they explain why it is in these elites' interest to do so.I find their arguments intriguing to say the least, and a refreshing change from the stale, politically correct views that always cast Africa as a helpless pawn of outside powers. &quot;Africa Works&quot; resonates very strongly with my own experience living and working in Africa.Having said that, though, I am not entirely convinced that the authors are 100 percent on target. They tend to paint developments across the continent with very broad strokes, and offer little in the way of evidence that isn't anecdotal. Furthermore, perhaps their break from the orthodoxy on African politics isn't as significant as they make it out to be. Jean-Francois Bayart, one author whom they repeatedly go out of their way to beat up on, has written articles sounding similar themes.&quot;Africa Works&quot; is nonetheless an important book and I hope that it touches off a new debate on the character of governance in Africa. The old ideas have clearly done nobody any good."},{"Title":"Africa Works: Disorder as Political Instrument (African Issues)","review":"I was born in and grew up in central Africa and have recently returned to work there - Malawi. Africa is the most extraordinary place - very easy to fall in love with. But, there are some huge buts... In Africa, you will learn the true meaning of the word 'frustration'. It is a place of astounding unrealised potential. Why?This book is the first cogent explanation of why Africa is like it is, and will form the basis of my own analysis - the one you have to do to remain sane. It is right on the button with explanations for the corruption and disorder that is Africa. And yet it is not a critical book; nor is it patronising and it does not suggest that the answer to African problems is to be more like the West. It simply gives you clues as to why it is like it is.This book has given me the ammunition I need to convince myself that there is a great deal of sense in what is happening in central Africa. It sounds silly to suggest that a sociological/development studies book could give an otherwise normal person a real insight into his situation, but it does! I really take my hat off to these guys!"},{"Title":"Africa Works: Disorder as Political Instrument (African Issues)","review":"After working in Africa off and on for twenty years in development, relief and human rights, I would recommend that every expat who is planning to work there read this book. I would make it compulsory reading for all WB, Dfid, USAID, UN, etc employees... even Peace Corps, WUSC, VSO, etc people! The alternative is personal frustration arising from becoming aware of the structures identified here, without understanding their origin and functionality. Instead of seeing perverse events as idiosyncratic, you will begin to understand that they are part of a larger whole, rooted in the political economy and history of the continent. Excellent book!"},{"Title":"Africa Works: Disorder as Political Instrument (African Issues)","review":"i have lived and worked in africa for a long time and am emotionally attached to east africa, but this does not cloud my perception of the deep troubles that this continent is in and expect what is realistic instead of what is desirable.this analysis is done in a unbiased tone, although any proud african will disagree on this. but then proud africans are very touchy when it comes to explaining the miserable reality of most african countries.the authors put forward that development the western style cannot work in africa, as the basis of a civil society like we know it is simply not there. most frustrating is the fact that there seems to be no proof of an african way to create sustained and stable wealth. if you expect the worst and are happy if it turns out to be just a little better you might have the right attitude to work there."},{"Title":"Africa Works: Disorder as Political Instrument (African Issues)","review":"Overall good communication, good value, good customer service!

To say that the disorder in Africa benefits someone--e.g., via corruption--has been around for some time and is nothing new. To say that this disorder somehow makes the societies \\"work\\" is new but illogical. For something to \\"work\\" for the continent as a whole it must have positive net benefit. Right now, the disorder in Africa is such that the benefit to those who gain is far less than the loss to those who lose. This is a well-known research result. Africa doesn't work; the disorder results in a net loss to Africa. Why Africans do not do enough to change the institutional and organizational order is an interesting reasearch topic. How one can help Africans do something about this predicament is also an interesting research topic. But to say that the disorder works is illogical."},{"Title":"Guilty Without Trial: Women in the Sex Trade in Calcutta","review":"THIS IS ONE OF THE MOST PRECIOUS BOOK, I HAVE EVER READ.THE PROBLEMS HAVE BEEN HIGHLIGHTED AND SHOULD BE SOLVED TO HAVE A BETTER SOCIETY LEADING THE WORLD TOWARDS PERFECTION."},{"Title":"Decision-Making at the Chessboard","review":"I believe the Gambit middlegame series may have begun with Secrets of Modern Chess Stategy. Although Watson's magnum opus has been justly lauded, I have found many of the subsequent books by overseas authors to be equally stimulating. In this book V Eingorn - an experienced and respected grandmaster from Ukraine - has written what amounts to a wide-ranging middlegame manual. It is based on his games and experience at or near the top of world chess over a couple of decades.The book is based around annotated games. I have found the way to get the most out of these middlegame books is to find the bare score of the game on my computer database, and play through the moves while reading the text. Afterwards I look up other games from the same opening on the database. My experience with this study method is that it has broadened my opening repertoire - I easily become intrigued by variations I scarcely knew existed previously.For an example, I starting following Eingorn-Onishchuk, Cuxhaven 1994. This was a semi-slav where Black varied from normal lines on move 11 (with 11...Rg8). As Eingorn comments, \\"when black gets fed up with the complex theoretical debate about this line, he has several ways to deviate.\\" Now I have seen a number of semi-slavs when the routine 11...Bb7 was played, so this game was a useful reminder of different possibilities. Later I found other games with ...Rg8 on the database, including Shirov and Kramnik playing with the black pieces.Naturally consulting a database only works if the game is there. The material in Eingorn's book is all original, so some of the games don't seem to have appeared in the public domain before. In order to play through Eingorn-Vakhidov, Tashkent 1983, I had to revert to the old-fashioned board and set. Not such a big deal, truth be told, as I do enjoy working on a normal board. The reward for this \\"effort\\" was that Eingorn explained a novel system he had used (against the King's Indian Defense)where a simple plan by white snuffed out all black counterplay. Despite having castled queenside, at one moment white plays the move 18 a4, which is a move I would never have considered. Eingorn's explanation of this key move was truly enlightening, and sure enough, in subsequent play the blocked queenside left black helpless.Books like Decision Making on the Chessboad make you realize we are in a golden ago for chess publishing."},{"Title":"Decision-Making at the Chessboard","review":"About the author: GM Eingorn has competed at the upper echelons of chess for the last 25 years. He's regularly played in the Soviet Championship and brings his talent and insight gained over the years into writing this book.The book itself is clearly targeted for advanced club players that don't need simple to moderate tactics and strategy explained or in some cases even mentioned. I personally found myself working out some tactical variations in the games for a candidate move that simply wasn't considered. This is often the case when dealing with a book targeted for players with a great deal of experience in calculation and strategic thinking. With this said, I believe that many of the finer points made by the author will be lost on the aspiring club player who hasn't passed the 'B' level of play.The author provides a collection of games, primarily his own, to illustrate certain challenges to the over-the-board tournament player. For example, one chapter is called \\"Mindswap\\" and attempts to discuss how to use established games as models for treatment of certain positions. Because the author truly is an original thinker, quite often he will point out moves that are not commonly considered that are viable. This is persistent throughout the book no matter what the topic is. This skill is important for the player who is trying to avoid getting caught in book variations leading to the 21st move. And based on Eingorn's presentation, as a reader, I definitely found his examples quite convincing. This really is important because many moves in collections of annotated games are dismissed with blurbs like \\"provides no promise for an advantage\\". Well, what those authors don't tell you is that many openings don't provide much of an advantage anyway! The true master knows how to first see the potential of a position and then provides a working plan to get the most out of what is there WHILE minimizing the same goal of his/her opponent. This is really what this book is about.Why only 4 stars? There really are three problems with this book, each on their own not enough to downgrade it a full star but together to have it marked down by one star. First, the assessments of positions is very uneven in quality and depth. The author too much provides \\"assertions without proof\\" or assessments without a strong explanation. This is key because the author guides the reader into many unconventional positions that are very unbalanced dynamically. I can accept an dynamically complicated position as unclear, but if one side really has an advantage, it's incredibly important to provide some basis for the claim. The second problem is really the editor's fault in that in many spots the translation into English is very rough with the result that the main point is not really as clear as it could be. Third, the author sometimes provided a limited number of examples weakening the overall effectiveness of his point. I fully understand that an entire book could be written on just one of the chapters such as the one on having a mindset for \\"active defense\\". But additional examples would have strengthened the author's argument and given a better basis for developing the right intuition in the reader to find the right balance between true defense and defense with the eye for counterattack.All in all, I found the book to be both enjoyable and instructive. I also expect to extract more from the book on a second reading that I'll undertake in a few years. I would recommend this book but with some definite cautions."},{"Title":"Hikes Around Philadelphia","review":"This is a great book for those interested in afternoon or day hikes in the Greater Philadelphia area.The book contains 40 hikes - all within a couple of hours of Philadelphia and most within sixty minutes. Each hike is organized with an easy to read map, distance, elevation changes, time estimates and other capsule information. A one to three page narrative describes the hike in detail, discusses options and points out areas of scenic and historic interest or particular difficulty.Of particular use are descriptions of disability access and suggestions for hikes with young children. All in all, this is one of the best organized and informative guides I've seen."},{"Title":"Hikes Around Philadelphia","review":"What originally started as a great guide to local hikes, quickly turned into a major letdown. Though I enjoy a nice challenge at times...not just once or twice, but for three of the listed hikes we got lost and/or (as also previously mentioned) stuck in a shrub of a not-so-well-marked path. This book is definitely outdated. And not only that, the directions are not entirely clear (e.g. for the Blue Mountain and Phillips Canyon hike, it is vague that you need to return up the path you came from to continue along the Appalachian trail). So three times a charm; thanks to this book, I will now be investing in a portable GPS for my hikes."},{"Title":"Hikes Around Philadelphia","review":"Hikes Around Philadelphia is a great title for novice hikers (like myself). It provides good maps, directions, time/distance estimates, and descriptive narrative about each hike.I've used it on three hikes and my only complaint is that it needs a new, updated edition. It was published in 1997 and some areas have changed in the last decade. I learned this the hard way half-way through my latest hike on \\"The Springfield Trail\\". The author might have been the last person who hiked the full trail. I was nearly trapped in vines and brambles situated between the Springfield Mall and a housing development (that was obviously built after the book was published).I still recommend the book, but you should double-check the validity of each hike using Google Maps or another source."},{"Title":"Crossed Fingers","review":"Based on facts gleaned from her mother's experiences as a teacher in the 1920's, Gutteridge has written a story describing the period in all of its glory; bitter mid-west winters, small town charm, pre-electric farm life, and party line telephones.Crossed Fingers, the most recent installment in the Anna Swenson chronicles, delves into a mystery that keeps everyone guessing.

The book is clearly written and manages a good balance between the formal (probability calculus, techniques, proofs of major theorems) and the more philosophical discussions of underlying concepts and well-known paradoxes. Each of the six, 20-40 pages long chapters is divided into sections no longer than 3,4 pages, and each section closes with exercises (solutions not provided). Given about two sessions per chapter, the book is well suited as course material for undergraduate courses in philosophy, economics or statistics. This is also how I learned to know it.Returning to the book in preparation for an exam, I could not help to notice a few flaws. First, the book is now quite old (1987). It lacks a detailed discussion of preference relations and choice functions (e.g. Sen's conditions alpha, beta, gamma, the limit assumption), and there is also no part on backward induction in games that has become so fashionable. There are some excentricities, like that the \\"battle of the sexes\\" problem is rephrased in more \\"appropriate\\" terms, and it would be nice to have more historical background for the paradoxes (but you can easily look those up with a search engine). In the later chapters, specially the final one on social choice, the author goes through heaps of heavily formal constructions, and while earlier such constructions were carefully explained using graphics and everyday life examples, the reader is now asked in the exercises to invent his own graphs, prove important theorems etc. Condorcet's paradox on majority decisions could have used a more thorough discussion, both philosophically and theoretically (failure of transitivity, failure of Sen's condition beta). This does not make it less useful as a textbook, it only means that some chapters require more extra preparation and explanation on the part of the teacher than others.All in all, this is a readable, reliable and concise textbook. It is written well enough that students might actually read parts of it. However, after 20 years it would be nice to have a revised, more up-to-date version."},{"Title":"Choices: An Introduction to Decision Theory","review":"I have to admit, this wasn't a book I thought I'd read, but I came across it in a college library, glanced through it and ultimately later decided to buy and read it. I was surprised at the odd ways that decisions are made by everyday people, and the misconceptions upon which those decisions are made. Once explained, the reality of some premises was quite clear, and I could even see where I myself had been led astray in my own decision making on more than one occasion.

I bought this book hoping to find 100 secrets of the Park: the best sunrise view, the best hike for small kids, the best fishing stream, etc. The book does have a few secrets of the Park, but mostly it's about the tourist traps: the Exotic Petting Zoo, the best steakhouse, the backdoor entrance to Dollywood.

Interesting history of some of my favorite places too. Great book for anyone who loves the Smokies."},{"Title":"100 Secrets of the Smokies: A Savvy Traveler's Guide (The Savvy Traveler's Guide)","review":"I wish I'd been able to preview this before buying it. I was expecting something along the lines of the online sites that give you 10 places you must visit when you're in a particular place. Only in this case, ten times the amount. Something along the lines of a Lonely Planet or Moon guide, only with interesting places those books may have missed.For starters, the information is dated. Secondly, it's a mish-mash of information that jumps around from category to category, mostly telling anecdotal stories about places, many of which visitors to the area won't be interested in, and others so popular (Dollywood being a good example) that they hardly qualify as secrets.It's all in here, restaurants, lodging, zoos, scenic drives and more. And if anything, there's too much information, It sometimes takes some sifting to actually find out what the attraction is - and sometimes where it is is similarly obscured. The black-and-white photographs are average and don't make the reader eager to visit any of the \\"attractions.\\"Also, there's no cohesion. It doesn't help in planning a trip, because you're never really sure how close together many of these so-called attractions are; grouping them either by proximity or by type would certainly help.Also, this book badly needed editing. There are howler typos that any editor worth their salt would have sifted out immediately, some even make it into headlines.Admittedly, there are a few places in here that are probably worth visiting, but these days better and more immediate information can easily be found online, and it's more concise, more recent and better laid out. That the website at the back of the book, and the second edition do not exist is probably telling. Of the 100 places in here, some were obvious, and I found one additional place I'd like to visit while in the Smokies, however I'd already found it in a restaurant search, and the information in the book was incorrect, likely because of its age.Had this been called 100 interseting stories of the Smoky Mountain Region, it would have been more accurate, and it would be perfectly fine (other than those embarrassing typos), although I'd not have bought it. Thankfully, used copies on Amazon are very cheap, so I don't feel as though I've wasted much, although I'll likely never open it again.

Also, he does nothing but badmouth and degrade Navy SEALs. In nearly every section where he is talking about the SEALs, he finds a way to make them seem amateurs in comparison to Delta, which isn't true. He does give a nod to the accomplishments of MAKO 26, but other than that he slags them for reasons I don't understand.It takes a long time for the action to kick in, but once it starts it is very interesting and provides another example of how idiots often find themselves in top tier leadership roles within our military/Government."},{"Title":"A Cold Peace: America, Japan, Germany, and the Struggle for Supremacy","review":"Jeffrey E. Garten has written an excellent book that presents Americans with many challenges in regards to foreign and domestic policy. The main thesis of this book is that the U.S. no longer &quot;enjoys&quot; the position of being the sole world power. Today the U.S. must learn to share this role with Japan and Germany. Both countries have emerged from WWII as powerful economic nations who have started to increase in political and social influence in their respective backyards. Garten believes that we must first attend many of our domestic social problems if we want to continue as a super power. Our way of thinking has to change for it is a reality that power must be shared with these two nations. Instead of blaiming the economic policies of these nations (e.g. tariffs, etc.) for our own economic problems, we must find ways to work with them and even borrow ideas and business practices from these other capitalistic nations. Garten makes his book very readable and enjoyable. I strongly recommend this book to anyone with an open mind who desires to better understand what the tomorrow's world will be like."},{"Title":"In the Gathering Woods (Pitt Drue Heinz Lit Prize)","review":"In this skillfully-written and heartfelt collection of short stories, Adria Bernardi allows us to follow members of an Italian (and Italian-American) family through several generations. The connections between the characters of these stories are not always direct, and, in some cases, are more implied than stated. The stories could be read individually, or as a whole, as presented in this volume.Spanning time from roughly post-middle ages to the present, the pieces in this collection allow us not only to observe, but, in some cases, inhabit these characters. One of the most compelling aspects of Bernardi's prose is her obvious love of and fascination with the mechanics of language itself. At times, the characters are depicted ruminating over words and their relationships to one another -- and rather than smothering the story itself in dry semantics, Bernardi accomplishes this with a gentle touch, leaving the reader with a very natural feeling of following these thought processes so that we might know these people better.In the second story of the collection, 'Waiting for Giotto', a simple shepherd's son dreams of becoming a great artist, of being an apprentice to the great Giotto, for whom he patiently waits to return to his mountain village, as if by some miracle the great artist would recognize the man's talent and take him away to the city with him. The man knows in his heart that this will not happen, but he follows his muse ever forward, refusing to give up his calling. He sees and hears his world going by and going on around him -- people in his small mountain village live their lives as they have for centuries. Some take it upon themselves to leave and seek their fortunes -- to him, it is a duty and an honor to wait for his calling.One of the most breathtaking passages in this book is contained in this story, when the would-be artist hears a traveller describing the horrors of the wars that are fought on the other side of the mountains: 'They say that Peace, herself, is revolted, and that she holds her stomach and retches; she has hidden her face under a hood and has started to walk away from the battlefields, following along in the ruts made by the wheels of carts, dragging herself along a muddy road that is lined with corpses, not even bothering to lift the hem of her cloak.'The mountain-dwelling artist goes on collecting tiny bits of colored glass to be used in his masterpiece, a mosaic that may never be completed -- or seen by anyone.The mosaic itself is another apt metaphor for the thread that connects these tales. Up close, it's hard to see -- upon reading the stories in this volume, and viewing them from a distance as a whole, the pattern is clearer.The stories that touched me most deeply are the ones set further away in time and place -- perhaps as the characters in the indivdual stories became more 'Americanized' they appealed less to me. The pieces follow a roughly chronological order, the last being tied in nicely with the early ones -- in a way that you'll have to read the book to discover for yourself.Bernardi is a very skillful writer -- she has managed to lay bare the soul and psyche of the Italian-American immigrants portrayed here, as well as that of ancestors who never left their village. Without reciting daily routines in a boring, travelogue-like manner, she has allowed us an intimate glimpse of her characters' daily lives -- and has allowed us to watch them become more acquainted with themselves in the process.I look forward to reading her novel, THE DAY LAID ON THE ALTAR."},{"Title":"Building & Tuning High-Performance Electronic Fuel Injection","review":"what i like the most about the book is how easy it is to understand what they are talking about,some of the other books i have read use too many words in which i have to pull out the dictionary to understand,this book is simple and straight forward.i would recomend it to any body that is new at the new efi world that is coming from the old school of carburated v8's.enjoy and learn."},{"Title":"Building & Tuning High-Performance Electronic Fuel Injection","review":"This book explains how EFI systems work, the inputs and outputs of ECU, and talks about diferent aftermarket ECUs, their principals.It's a good book to start understanding EFI.In my case, I already knew the EFI systems, except for the way the aftermarket ECUs work, I mean their software, so I will look for something more specific on car electronics, but still a good buy."},{"Title":"Building & Tuning High-Performance Electronic Fuel Injection","review":"Great book.

It's a shame they don't have a \\"0 star\\" ratings."},{"Title":"Building & Tuning High-Performance Electronic Fuel Injection","review":"Amongst automotive do-it-yourselfers, a pressing need exists for basic information on electronic fuel injection (EFI). In addition, the proliferation of aftermarket EFI systems intended for DIY installation has created a need for a \\"buyer's guide\\" covering the many, different EFI packages available to enthusiasts.Building & Tuning High-Performance Electronic Fuel Injection was intended meet both those needs but, unfortunately, in meeting one of them, it falls woefully short of the mark. This book is divided into two sections. The first half is devoted to EFI basics. Clearly, the Author's intent was a discussion of elementary electronic fuel injection topics but the result contains numerous errors in the technical discussions which make up the six chapters, over the 56 pages, which are the first part.Knowledge of electrical theory would seem a manifest requirement for anyone writing a book on EFI, but Mr. Strader errors in discussions of both Ohm's Law and \\"short\\" circuits. We asked Mr. Strader how this occurred and his response was a seeming attempt to rationalize the mistakes, \\"Admittedly,\\" Strader told this reviewer, \\"I am not an electrical engineer, and my expertise lies in the more 'hands-on' aspect of tuning engines.\\" It's very difficult to see that response and anything more than lame. If Mr. Strader was not sufficiently knowledgeable in electrical issues to write a book on EFI, then either he should have gotten educated prior to authoring the title or the book's publisher, CarTech, Incorporated, should have corrected his errors during the editing process.Mr. Strader's statement about his expertise lying, \\"...more with the hand-on aspect of tuning engines.\\" is, also, suspect. There are mistakes in the chapter of the book on manifold absolute pressure and MAP sensors. Errors are in discussions of how engine controllers set spark advance. A discussion about the causes of lean misfire is wholly inaccurate. An explanation of gasoline octane ratings is faulty. Statements about how chassis dynamometers work are incorrect. Those are just some examples of the slip-ups in this book. They are goofs which should not have been made by an author who has expertise in tuning engines.The book's first section contains enough incorrect information that its credibility should be at least questioned if not discounted, however, there is valuable material in Part Two, the buyer's guide section. Eleven different, aftermarket electronic fuel injection systems are discussed. Of course, 75 pages limits the coverage of each to only basic information, but there is more than enough content there to help persons shopping for an EFI system make a decision.If you are looking for a book which accurately explains electronic fuel injection; look elsewhere. This title does not fill that need. On the other hand, if you already understand EFI basics but need information to help you make a purchase decision, considering the cost of aftermarket EFI systems, nineteen bucks for this book will be money well-spent and that's in-spite of the first half's inaccuracies."},{"Title":"Building & Tuning High-Performance Electronic Fuel Injection","review":"I bougth this book, because I wanted to modify my std Nissan CA18DET ECU (I have equipment and software to do it) for bigger injectors, MAF and more boost and I hoped the book will give me some guide lines how to calculate new base fuel and ignition maps and how to tune it later on dyno or road. The book only covers this subject only ligthly by giving one formula how ECU calculate air mass based on MAP sensor and no examples how to use it to calculate base values for fuel map. No information at all how to calculate ignition base map. In second part of book he just suggest to get base maps from EFI manufacter or some other source.This books is useful if don't know how the EFI works, as author explains it pretty well. Also it maybe useful if you need aftermarket EFI and don't know which one to choose as author cover 11 twelve EFIs in second part of the book. If you want actually tune your engine using aftermarkte EFI you better read your EFI manual or search the web in the subject."},{"Title":"Building & Tuning High-Performance Electronic Fuel Injection","review":"I was extremely disappointment when I received this book.

Don't expect to read it and go out and become a professional tuner, but if you don't know much about efi, its a great place to start. Ben covers the basics of tuning: air/fuel ratio and timing as well as basic how to's on most current systems. I have read it twice and would definately recommend it to others."},{"Title":"Building & Tuning High-Performance Electronic Fuel Injection","review":"I decided to return this book after only the first 30 minutes of thumbing through it. The book is well laid out and out of most of the books I've read concerning this subject, the author is very easy to understand and follow which makes it all the worse that the book didn't have more content dealing specifically with tuning (working with timing and fuel) of turbocharged applications and other aspects of such modifications. I agree with another review post stating the run-down of products offered out there currently in regards to engine management options and their pros and cons was excellent.

Every question I had was answered but it was all the other items I had not even thought about that really gave me what I needed.

It'll get you familiar with the nuts and bolts of EFI by naming and describing various sensors, inputs and outputs that a modern ECU offers. However, for someone thinking of learning how to actually tune a car on the street or the dyno, the information is lacking. More information about dynos, how to monitor sensors, what changes to make in maps, etc would've been appreciated."},{"Title":"Building & Tuning High-Performance Electronic Fuel Injection","review":"I bought this book because I am working on a carburetor to fuel injection conversion for my classic car. I was hoping this book would give me some insight into the actual tuning process of an EFI system once the conversion had been made. Instead, this book spends a great deal of time covering \\"Basic Electronics\\" (ie. Volts, Amps, Ohms), the \\"Tools and Equipment\\" (ie Multimeter,fuel pressure gauge) all of the components of an EFI system (ie. coolant temp sensor, o2 sensor, TPS) and describes them in great detail. Then there are a few short pages in the middle of the book in a section called \\"Tuning Maps and Basic Engine Calibration\\". This is where I was hoping to gain a little insight but the book stays so close to the side of the theoretical, it really doesn't give any more clues on how this would actually be done. I understand that each car, engine and ECU combination is unique and no book could ever cover every combination, but I was hoping to have a better footing when I delve into the tuning of my EFI system. Finally, when that short section is over, with half the book to go, the rest of the pages are devoted to advertising (pgs 57-126)! This may be where this book is best suited or certainly where the most effort was devoted. If you can't decided whether to buy the Accel, Autotronic, Edelbrock or Holley ECU, then this book will help you with the different offerings from each of a bout 11 different companies. Once you've made your choice however, good luck with the setup. You're on your own from there. Just like guess and check with needles and jets on the carb I just got rid of!"},{"Title":"Drifting Too Far from Shore","review":"What a narcissistic, poison pen account of a misspent life biting the very hands which fed him. He attacks his father for every misfortune in his life. Yet by the author's own admission he acknowledges his father supported him for most of his adult life. One questions the veracity of the \\"facts\\" of Mr.Spalding's supposed experiences as the author did not seek, nor did he receive any releases from the people he mentions by their actual names. The author blames his parents and ADD for a wasted life. By the time one is in their fifties it is a bit late to blame one's parents for their own shortcomings and problems. As an adult one is responsible for the life they lead and the choices they make. Not once does the author own his actions. He is drifting alright---like a jellyfish stinging all those who cared for him to the best of their abilities, and then blaming them for his shortcomings. Sadly it appears this man is trying to simultaneously ride the coat tails of his brilliant and widely respected father whilst blaming him for his ADD. The sad fact is this man obviously lacks a conscience and has written a book which attests to this fact. Just a typical vanity press publication---totally self serving and an injustice to those who truly suffer and endure ADD every day without the advantages Mr. Spalding has had at his disposal for most of his life. Don't waste your money."},{"Title":"The Iron Ring","review":"This is certainly not one of Keeler's better novels; it's one of those written to wrap around one of his wife's short stories (found in this edition on pp. 151-161). It's even more episodic than the usual Keeler work. Newspaper editor Unwin Wynhart dominates the first half of the novel, then completely disappears as struggling young lawyer Croxson Kalver takes over. Wynhart and Kalver are trying to save the life of convicted murderess Margaret Annister, who is only scant hours away from dying in the Nevada City gas chamber. [Keeler withholds an account of the circumstances of the murder until halfway through the novel.]The main puzzle Keeler concentrates on here is how the actual murderer (whose identity is known to the reader as soon as the circumstances of the crime are described) has managed to have an unbreakable alibi... four solid citizens of a distant city have testified that they recognized, met and spoke to him at the time of the killing. But the actual (and of course preposterous) explanation of how the killer established his alibi is resolved in a fairly anticlimactic way. The unexpected revelation Keeler reserves for the final paragraph of the novel, unusually, does not involve the murder. Instead it involves the identity of the woman who provides the brains for the Gorilla Svenson mob, which runs almost all crime in Nevada City. Throughout the entire novel, Keeler drags various red herrings around to lead the reader on a totally false trail to this mystery woman... just so he can have a surprise on the last page.By the way, the iron rings of the title play almost no role whatsoever in the mystery. One does serve to damage the killer's alibi, but in a very minor way.The short story by his wife Hazel that Keeler inserts into the novel is not nearly as bad as her short stories normally are, so it doesn't kill Keeler's narrative momentum completely dead, as they usually do when included.This is a very minor work in Keeler's ouvre, but if you're a Keeler fan, you'll enjoy most of it."},{"Title":"Christmas at the Bears Paw Ranch","review":"Eleanor Burns is one of my favorite quilt authors.

What I liked so much about this book is that while all these women have one thing in common -- adventure -- they all have their very own and very different approaches to it. From a single mom who takes her daughter through a foreign country, to women kayakers, to mountain climbers. All these women have found the one or two things they really loved (one lady loved India and also loved riding her bike so she rode her bike through India) and pursued it.Basically this book teaches you to find your thing, be proud of what it is you like to do as an individual - and go for it."},{"Title":"Living with Cannibals and Other Women's Adventures (Adventure Press)","review":"I enjoy non-fiction that promotes further subject matter investigation.

Even if the book doesn't inspire you to go that far, the short stories will certainly entertain anyone looking for a quick, easy read.

Like a prior reviewer, once I started the book I was hooked."},{"Title":"Living with Cannibals and Other Women's Adventures (Adventure Press)","review":"I love travel books: narratives of other people's travels, personal memoirs, biographies of travelers. I especially love travel memoirs by women and stories about world travelers and adventurers who lived prior to the twentieth century. I just knew I would love this book. I was wrong. It turned out to be one of very few books in my life that I started and then didn't finish. I almost made it to the end thanks to my sheer stubborness, but then the dullness of the superficial biographies finally did me in.As another reviewer mentioned, the biographies are paired - one historical woman traveler/adventurer \\"matched\\" with a supposedly similar, modern day woman adventurer. Thus, pioneering aviator Amalia Earhart is paired with astronaut Shannon Lucid. World traveler and explorer Florence Baker (19th Century) is paired with modern adventurer and trailblazer Arlene Burns. I'm not sure why the author chose to organize the work this way, because it really doesn't enhance the stories any. The author pairs the women up, but she doesn't really relate them to each other. In many cases, the connection between the two selected women, other than the fact that they were bold and adventurous, eluded me.But my main complaint is the way the author tells the stories. The book is obviously intended to be a brief overview of some remarkable women, but it still takes a real talent to be able to turn the lives and stories of Ida Pfeiffer, who traveled the world alone in the early 19th century, or Fanny Workman, Victorian mountain climber and mapper of the Himalayas, into boring, lifeless narratives. Slung manages to do that to the stories of every one of the women in this book. *Note to Slung - You can't liven up a dead story by ending dry sentences with exclamation marks!! We are not fooled by such obvious tactics!! These stories have all the excitement and drama of a Bio sketch from the Encyclopedia Britannica and (mis)using exclamation marks isn't going to change that!!I kept thinking while I was reading this that I had inadvertently purchased a book intended for Young Readers. You know the type - bland, fact-riddled books that junior high students turn to when they have to write a a little essay paper about some famous person, and need to get enough facts from one place so they don't have to waste time doing actual research. It 'reads' like that kind of book - just the facts ma'am - lots of them, and don't over-excite the young people. Here's a typical excerpt - this one about rock climber Catherine Destivelle.**\\"I forgot I was walking on a glacier\\", she says, amused now at the rather basic nature of her oversight, although the resulting fall into a crevasse wasn't funny at all: She'd broken her back.Struggling out of the 115 foot-deep fissure with the help of a companion, she immediately returned to the climb, unaware, she states, of the severity of her injury. Soon however, expert medical diagnosis told a different story. Yet barely two months later, she was already up and moving again, as the mountains once again cast their spell over her.**And there you have it - a life-threatening, 100 foot plus fall into a hole in a glacier, a dramatic struggle back up to the top, a rock climb with a broken back and what must have been a painful recovery, all watered down into 'and then this happened and then this'.The good thing is the book does provide the names of what just have to be some very fascinating women, which should allow you to seek out more interesting material about their lives and adventures."},{"Title":"Living with Cannibals and Other Women's Adventures (Adventure Press)","review":"\\"Living with Cannibals\\" is such a promising title I had hoped for so much more than this book had. This book is comprised of multiple women's adventures. They are paired old and more recent for each type of adventure (artic, Africa, Etc).

Earth Spell is the 4th of the series. I have been reading them in order and I like Earth Spell the least of the four I've read so far. It's hard to say whether this has more to do with the channeler's biases, or if it's something to do with me--perhaps I'm too guilt-ridden, \\"gapped,\\" and altogether flawed to understand and move my triggered emotions.I think Earth Spell could have benefited from some serious editing--both making it much more concise and also clearing up who is being addressed in any given paragraph. It keeps talking about all the things \\"you\\" did and are doing and how deluded you are if you think your new age claptrap is going to save you, etc....and I'm not sure if he's talking about me personally, or the Angels, Lucifer...? I guess you aren't supposed to edit God...but I think this book could have perhaps reached a larger audience with some cleanup and organization of the text, which is rambling, extremely repetitive, and with a slightly nasty tone throughout.The first book, Right Use of Will, was much more helpful in terms of practical suggestions for self-change. These balanced out the fear-triggers, of which there were many. Earth Spell, on the other hand, is really low on the practical suggestions and high on the fear-triggers. The book makes it seem nearly impossible to succeed in changing oneself enough to not get swept up in what sounds like death or loveless Hell for most people on the planet. And it makes it sound like it's your own fault you're so flawed because no matter what you chose, you chose wrong...I'm not really sure regarding what. It's particularly frustrating being told these things because definitions are so unclear, so it's hard to understand exactly what the book is talking about.I'm going to read the next three just because I have them, but I feel less enthused about the series as I continue to read it.Update: I began by giving the book 2 stars, but I've upgraded it to 3 stars because as the information has percolated, I feel I've gotten more from it--maybe the repetition of its essential message--that what you dislike in others, you dislike in yourself--is necessary to really hammer it in, and the endless presentation of all the things God and others did to create lost will is useful as a series of archetypes one can use to recognize similar situations in one's own life."},{"Title":"Walking on Walnuts","review":"Yummy and lucious!

If you are among this group, you will rejoice at Nancy Ring's evocative memoir, \\"Walking on Walnuts.\\" This lovely book braids delectable recipes (Burnt Orange Ice Cream, Peach and Honey Upside-Down Cake, among many others) together with tales of the author's family and the story of her own path towards professional and personal fulfillment.Nancy Ring held a number of positions as pastry chef in some of New York City's finest restaurants, all without benefit of culinary school training. She learned to bake from her grandmothers, and she learned to create recipes from her own imagination. Her progress from utter novice to confident chef is fascinating, especially because she never seeks to pull the wool over her readers' eyes. She knows she's inexperienced, and she's not above navet&eacute; and wonder as she traverses the Manhattan restaurant world--a world which shows its magic to the public and saves its horrors for those who create the magic. This only adds to the absorbing narrative tension of the story.To protect the innocent and not-so-innocent, Ring has altered the names of the restaurants which employed her, as well as the names of most of her co-workers. My favorite section takes place in the first restaurant to take a chance on Ring's as-yet-unproved baking talents; she works under a sassy woman named Arana who takes relish in appearing at the restaurant's staff holiday party dressed as a formally set dinner table:\\"She walked straight up to the chef and placed herself directly in front of him. Arana was very tall, and in those heels she towered over the chef, who stood barely over five feet. Her breasts were nearly exactly level with his eyes. When I tell you the crowd was disintegrated in laughter, I mean it. 'Arana,' the chef said in a tone somewhere between shock and appreciation . . . 'This is a party, not a watermelon sale.' Knock-down, all-out, knee-slapping laughter. Somebody yelled, 'Touch&eacute;!' 'Hmmpf,' said Arana, real Mae West style, 'don't you know what I am?' . . . 'No, I don't,' he laughed. Arana stood with her hands on her hips, glaring at the crowd until they quieted a little. Then, when she was sure they would all hear her, she turned back to the chef, enjoying her captive and her audience. 'Would you like a bite?' she smirked. 'I'm the tart of the day.' \\"This is the type of book you immediately want to go out and buy for friends. Ring's own illustrations punctuate each chapter; in addition to being a pastry chef and writer, she is a talented artist. I can hardly imagine a more enjoyable read for anyone who enjoys cooking as much as they enjoy a fast-moving, well-plotted story."},{"Title":"Walking on Walnuts","review":"This is an autobiography of a young woman's efforts to earn a living as a pastry in New York City. The author includes her family history and wonderful recipes that have been handed down for generations.AMAZON has a good selection at excellent prices.This book is high on my list for gift-giving"},{"Title":"Walking on Walnuts","review":"I loved the way Nancy Ring wrote this book. As educators, we struggle to teach students to use similies and metaphors in their writing. Why teach them these things if not to use them in real life?Nancy Ring found a delightful way to weave metaphors and similies throughout her book while at the same time shares her family history, her love of baking and art, and her struggles to make it in the world. I saw her use of the similies and metaphors as a tongue-in-cheek approach of relating life in general to her world of baking. I think she knew exactly what she was doing here and wondering if the reader was paying enough attention to catch it. Publishing the wonderful recipes passed down to her were an added bonus.I thought it very clever to start each chapter with a quote about something to do with nuts. I also enjoyed how she interspersed trivia about nuts into the story. You learn something new every day, don't you? Why not learn it while reading a good book?I enjoyed getting to know Nancy's family and friends as seen through her eyes. What a wonderful tribute and lasting legacy she has created!Nancy Ring, I would recommend your book to any English teacher struggling to show students some fine examples of similies and metaphors."},{"Title":"Walking on Walnuts","review":"This is a wonderful unfolding of Nancy Ring's struggles which inspire and help put perspective into the heartaches and soul-searches we all face in finding our professional and personal vocations. Nancy's voice is like that of a close friend, with a peaceful cadence which belies the stressful events she encounters in her search for career nirvana. She very cleverly focuses her chapters around a work struggle, a recipe and family history, which she then knits into a very engaging short story within the string of episodes which tell her tale. She also very generously shares her treasured family recipes! Walking on Walnuts is one to read because of it's refreshing and captivating consideration of the many facets involved in finding personal and professional happiness."},{"Title":"Walking on Walnuts","review":"My mom insisted that I read this book because my career paths and quandries are remarkably similar to Ms. Ring's. I'm about 3/4 through it and I have to confess that the writing has so befuddled me that I've started skimming over the family history parts to get to the narrative of her restaurant stories, in fact I'm longing for even just ten uninterrupted pages of ANY straight narrative, preferably without walnut analogies or metaphors.If you're trying to decide whether you should read this book, let me give you a food analogy to help you out. This book is like a fruitcake. Densely packed with tasty tidbits and each and every tidbit is in every single bite. There's no escaping the pineapple if you don't like pineapple, no escaping the nuts either.The restaurant stories are entertaining, especially for anybody who's been in the industry; the family stories are compelling (and really deserve their own straight narrative, not this chopping up to accentuate Ms. Ring's life), the recipes look great and make me wish it were late summer so I could make that peach cake. The walnut facts and analogies are so tedious they make me want to cry.Basically I'm going to skip to the end of the book to figure out what she does (goes to work for a caterer? Opens her own pastry shop? Does she every marry Eric? Under a walnut tree in Central Park?) and I'm sorry, all you great grandmas and uncles.....I'd love to spend some time with you to get to know you, but you're too confusing a gaggle.Ms. Ring. In your next book, how about just a straight story, set in the not too distant past....some historical fiction based on your relatives and ancestors? That farm in Argentina--that's a great story-- imagine being that woman holding the farm together, trying to keep a kosher kitchen when all there is to burn is dried cow patties. You've got the material, now all you need is the time, right? Yeah, ha ha."},{"Title":"The Pirate Prince (Leisure Historical Romance)","review":"Our tale begins in Istanbul, Turkey, 1562. Prince Dariq flees the palace when his half-brother, Ibrahim, goes on a rampage and murders all his recently deceased father's male heirs. Warned in advance by his English mother, Dariq escapes the massacre and vows revenge on Ibrahim.The year of 1564 finds Prince Dariq on the Mediterranean Sea. Dariq and his loyal men raid the sea as pirates, with Turkish ships being their main target. Upon one such ship Dariq comes across Lady Willow Foxburn. She has been sold to Ibrahim for his harem and had been en route to Istanbul against her will. Willow wants only to be returned to her father in England. However, Ibrahim has long wanted such a golden beauty as Willow and had already paid much gold for her. Dariq decides to offer Ibrahim a trade; his mother for the sultan's new concubine.In the decadent setting of Dariq's harem, Willow finds both love and betrayal. When times comes for the trade with Ibrahim, will Dariq be able to part with the Englishwoman who has captured his pirate heart?***** W-O-W-! Once again Connie Mason has created an exotic setting for two lovers to find each other. And what setting could be more suited to erotic seductions than a Prince's harem? Answer is a tropical paradise and hide-away, for a handsome pirate captain! Author Connie Mason has outdone herself by combining BOTH of these in one lush novel that is guaranteed to please. The action begins on the very first page and will sweep readers' imaginations away to bold lands and heroic people. I am delighted to be able to say that \\"The Pirate Prince\\" gets my highest recommendation! THIS IS NOT ONE TO MISS! *****Reviewed by Detra Fitch of Huntress Reviews."},{"Title":"The Pirate Prince (Leisure Historical Romance)","review":"Connie Mason did another great job at another great book. She filled it with passion, love, and strong-willed characters. Dariq had to fight his emotions for Willow in order to ransom her to get her mother back from his evil brother who is a sultan. You could see that they both loved each other and would be willing to risk anything to be with the other. I would recommend this to others, however if you like the theme of pirates/sultans than this is a great one. If you don't, then you may not like it as much. I'm anxiously waiting for Mason's next book to arrive!"},{"Title":"The Pirate Prince (Leisure Historical Romance)","review":"I have read many of Connie Mason's books, and the trend that I found was that every other book was a good one. Thankfully, The Pirate Prince was one of the better stories Ms. Mason has written. It was a quick and fun read. There is no need to give a synopsis of the story, as you can find that in the book's description online. However, the characters were likable, and the plotline was interesting and easily kept the reader's attention. I would recommend this title to anyone that is a fan of Ms. Mason's work or to those who are looking for something light and entertaining."},{"Title":"The Pirate Prince (Leisure Historical Romance)","review":"I got about halfway through this book last night and am already finding the plot to be weak, almost as if it was an afterthought to writing this title. I feel as though Ms. Mason submitted a rough outline to her publishers, who took it and ran to print without letting her finish writing!The character development is poor, and the Pirate Prince might as well have bedded Lady Willow the moment he laid eyes on her (chapter one or two?), Ms. Mason was so quick to get them between the sheets.There are some minor discrepencies here and there that are a bit irksome. Early in the book, there is mention of Willow's maid who traveled with her, named Kitty. Several chapters later, there is another reference to her maid, only this time the girl's name is Polly. I did a double-take and flipped back to make sure I wasn't the one with my wires crossed. As I said before, I guess Ms. Mason was plowing forward to get the Dariq and Willow in the sack too fast to take notice of such a mistake. Again, proof that the plot outline and character development was an afterthought.It's a fun and fast read as far as good sex with cookie-cutter characters in an exotic setting. If you're looking for a more deep and detailed historical romance, however, don't look here."},{"Title":"The Pirate Prince (Leisure Historical Romance)","review":"If you're looking for superior prose, believable premise or subtle sensuality you might want to consider purchasing a different book. Now if you want simple characters acting against the concept of the plot then this book is for you! I chose to purchase and read \\"The Pirate Prince\\" for two reasons, one I was on vacation and I craved light-hearted literary fun, and two I couldn't believe that one book included slave traders, pirates, sultans and the English countryside. It is the definition of cheesy romance spiced up with a few exotic locations.My main problem with the book was it betrayed itself. For instance (please note this is not a spoiler) if you were an outlaw pirate planning to send a woman to your enemies bed would you actually tell her where your secret stronghold was located? I wouldn't but then again I'm not an outlaw or a pirate. Also the author reuses phrases very often leaving the reader wishing for more from the text.However I will admit to getting what I wanted from the book and that was a silly plot filled with steamy scenes. Sure some of the same words were used over and over again in these passages but nonetheless it was still enough to keep me reading. One entire chapter is just an elongated erotic scenario.I say buy this book if you're looking for a romp through the heart of romance cheddar land. If not then maybe you need to take the short walk to the fiction section and browse for something with romance added in."},{"Title":"The Pirate Prince (Leisure Historical Romance)","review":"This was the first Connie Mason book I've read. I found it predictable, cheesy and silly. I think I might have dozed off a couple of times on the ol' couch while reading it too. I wouldn't recommend buying it new, but maybe you can find it for a cent in the used section. Cause that's about all it's worth to me. Now if you want to read something good...then check out Lisa Kleypas or Kresley Cole. For Lisa, I recommend the Wallflower series. As for Cole, The Immortals After Dark Series. Now those are good books, with great plots, and hot sex!"},{"Title":"The Pirate Prince (Leisure Historical Romance)","review":"I really loved this book. The hero is so intense and the heroine so spirited. The chemistry is awesome and the love scenes are super hot. I totally disagree that this book is predictable and boring.

Only because his English mother warned him is Prince Dariq able to escape the fratricide; Ibrahim killed ever other contender in the onslaught.Two years later, Dariq and his pirates use the island of Lisp as a base as they sail the Mediterranean on the Revenge raiding Turkish ships. This time they stop the Ottoman, which is carrying a special treasure for Ibrahim. Lady Willow Foxburn has been sold to Ibrahim for a princely sum of gold. While all she wants is to go home to her father in England, Dariq sees her as a pawn to barter with his enemy, Willow for his mother. However, as the trade is set and the time to exchange draws close, Dariq and Willow are in love, leaving him to choose between the two women he cherishes above his own life.This pirate romance uses Turkey, the Dardanelles, and the Eastern Mediterranean as a backdrop to provide a fresh tale that has an exotic and erotic taste to it. The story line hooks readers the moment Willow throws a missile at the head of her captor and never lets up until the exhilarating conclusion. Willow is a terrific heroine, but the heroic Dariq makes the tale as he struggles between two loves, not wanting to let either come to harm.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"The Pirate Prince (Leisure Historical Romance)","review":"This is my first experience into the world of Connie Mason and shortly into the story I knew Ms. Mason worshiped at the Bertrice Small altar. Sex is the main focus, sex is the secondary focus, and sex is . . . well you get the picture.Traveling from Marseilles to the shores of England, Barbary pirates abducted and sold the exquisite Lady Willow Foxburn to an Algerian slave master. Her final destination: the harem of Ibrahim, a ruler in the Ottoman Empire. Willow Foxburn will be the source of the sultan's endless pleasure. However, Ibrahim's younger brother, Prince Dariq, has other plans for this rare beauty. He steals her and plans to barter Willow in exchange for his mother's freedom. But, first he must show this little virginal vixen what secret delights her body can give. And that, my friends, is THE PIRATE PRINCE.It is an easy book to read and I did turn the pages, but it is not a solid book. Regrettably I found the storyline preoccupied and flimsy, the dialogue weak and contemporaneous, and the credibility a pivotal issue.Credibility? Well, if I have my calculations correct, it seemed Willow learned the Turkish language in less than three weeks; remarkably, she was articulate enough to ask and answer probing questions.And then this little blunder found on page 321 . . . \\"but once his past became known, he would not be accepted by the 'TON' \\". . . and again on page 349 . . . \\"Robbed of speech, Willow merely stared at Dariq. Stylishly dressed, his hair trimmed, he could easily pass as a member of the 'TON'\\" . . .The term 'TON' meaning \\"upper class\\" or \\"the fashionable set\\" first appeared in England around 1770, Mason's book takes place in 1564. Ouch!THE PIRATE PRINCE may be easy to get through, but it is weak. Would I recommend it? Not unless you are a Connie Mason fan. If you are curious, first check out the library or the used book stores.

I see her name, I buy. In my opinion, this book was ok. I did like it, it was a page turner and had me speed reading through it waiting for what was happening next. Then, when I was done, it was kinda like, thats it? I was not really surprised by anything that happened. I was able to predict most of the book. That bothered me. Normally I am in for a wild ride with Masons books and am looking one way, when it sould be another. Not this time. So, I am disapointed, I expected more. But I am not discouraged. I will get more of Connies books, I just hope they are bette then this one."},{"Title":"The Pirate Prince (Leisure Historical Romance)","review":"Admitedly, I picked this one up because it sounded so cheesy. I like reading period romance novels, but this one was ridiculous even by those standards.The brother of a turkish sultan who has taken to piracy to avoid his brother's fratricidal ways, itercepts his brother's ship that carries a virginal English lady bound for the sultan's harem, finds said lady irresistable, takes her virginity, falls in love, attempts a daring rescue.... And in the end both decide they can't be without the other, only societal pressures state they can't be with each other either... until a rather convenient solution presents itself via the pirate's English mother.It seems that every other page in this book is a sex scene - written in a style that incites nausea rather than arousal. The rest of the text is also poorly written, the writer using the same descriptive words in scene after scene. So much so that I was very much tempted to research the author so that I might find a mailing address and ship her a thesaurus.When I read this book, I wanted cheese -- but I got much more of it than I bargained for."},{"Title":"The Pirate Prince (Leisure Historical Romance)","review":"I picked this book up while on the road travelling,couldn't pick it done even after I reached my destination."},{"Title":"Divergence thrust loss calculations for convergent-divergent nozzles extensions to the classical case (SuDoc NAS 1.15:105176)","review":"Great reading material.........if you want to go to sleep.

I found the book to be a very good way to learn the basics of calculus-based physics, even without much outside instruction. It is clear and self-contained, with enough examples and problems to work on. It covers a broad range of topic in limited depth, making it great for an independent enthusiast or a student, including not only simple mechanics and electormagnetism, but also introductions to thermodynamics, waves and optics, and moden physics and relativity. Also, there are plenty of examples of real-world applications, showing industrial and everyday uses of the content covered and effectivly relating abstract material to real life.

Much more readable than texts of my generation. The physics is well explained and the the diagrams are well done. I've even had some \\"Aha!\\" moments when I realized that I hadn't quite grasped a concept correctly when I first studied physics. I have two minor complaints. Some of the exercises are poorly thought out which leave room for multiple answers (e.g, example 2.8 - the answer depends on when the first picture is taken), and some of the example solutions are wrong. Oh, well. I bought the used 3rd edition for a latte price and am happy. I'd recommend this book for an intro college physics class or independent study.

I have only the second volume on E&amp;M and modern physics.

I believe that this gives the student a preview of things to come in later classes. Perhaps there are not as many examples as in Halliday &amp; Resnick, but there are plenty of applications to the real world. It gives just a taste of quantum mechanics but that may be enough for freshmen. The color layout is an optical feast. I like the &quot;Got it&quot; sections which periodically test the reader's physical knowledge at the completion of each concept. I do think that the questions should have an answer key though.
