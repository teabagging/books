The spore-like Thread rains upon the planet from a nearby star, devouring all life in it's path.DragonSong is the story of a teenage girl named Menolly whose amazing musical talent is unaccepted by her community and least of all by her rigid parents who are the leaders of the small seaport of Half-Circle Sea Hold. Their continual surpression of her music, which is so important to her, leads her to run a away from home to face survival alone during the onslaught of the deadly threadfall. Seeking safety in a cave by the sea, she rediscovers the mythical fire lizards, the ancestors of the great dragons that daily scorch thread from the skies, and who lead her to her destiny at Pern's Harper Hall.This story and the rest of the Harper Hall trilogy is among Anne McCaffrey's best as well as being a wonderful introduction to her entire Pern series. Menolly's struggles to find a place in her world are that of any adolescent but the imaginative setting of the planet Pern with it's intricate social structure and it's fantasical dragons are equally intriging. All in all it is a wonderful tale to enchant young science fiction and fantasy readers"},{"Title":"Dragonsong","review":"I was twelve years old and very sick with pneumonia when my mother gave me this series to read. I'd been raised on the classics: Tennyson, Scott, Kipling, Doyle and Burnett were my favorites. I think my parents thought that anything else would rot my young mind. And, in fact, when my mother handed me this book with the fascinating little dragons on the cover, she warned me that I was to read it in small doses, regulated my her. I fell instantly in love. In one fell swoop I discovered Science Fiction, escapist literature, and Anne McCaffrey. It did indeed rot my brain: Menolly and her harp and her dragons moved in and took over. I hid the book under my bed so I could read it twice in a row without being discovered. And the memory of the wonder I felt, as I entered this other world, is still as fresh as if it had happened yesterday. I know now that the book is no great work of literary genius, it is merely decent sci-fi. But it will remain forever on my &quot;favorites&quot; shelf, in a place of honor, as my first science fiction novel"},{"Title":"Dragonsong","review":"I love this book! It is one of my favorites. I started reading it just to find something to read. Then I feel in love with it and the series. It is the story of a girl named Menolly who lives in a sea hold on the planet Pern. She studies with an old harper, Petrion, and learns music. She writes some songs and he sends them to Harper Hall, the main place where all music comes from. Then the harper passes away and her parents forbid her from ever playing an instrument or singing. So a new harper comes and he tries to find the person who wrote the songs. They thought it was a boy and never suspected Menolly. Then one day she had an accident and cut her wrist. Her wrist and hand were crippled from then on so she could not play and instrument. Then one day she runs away, but gets caught in a deadly Threadfall. So she takes shelter and finds nine firelizard eggs (firelizards are a small version of dragons.) there, and when they hatch she impresses them. Then one day Thread falls again and she is stuck. She tries to run but is not fast enough. Then a miracle happens and her life changes forever. Anne McCaffrey is brilliant and can not do any better on this book. The characters are well defined and you fell like you are there. The title fits the story perfect. If you want to experience excitement with myth you should defiantly read this book."},{"Title":"Dragonsong","review":"This is an excellent book. I thoughly enjoyed it, and read it in one day. And I will admit, Menolly is now my favorite character of all of Anne McCaffery's series. I didn't like her very much in The White Dragon, because I felt like she monitered jaxom too much.In this book, you will read about a young 15 year old girl, blessed with the gifts of music and singing. But she lives in a sea hold, with her extremely strict father, Yanus, and equally strict mother, Mavi. They despise the fact that a girl of all thing wants to make music, and makes up her own tunes. They forbid it. But when Menolly goes against them, she gets beaten. Bad goes to worse, until Menolly finally runs away from Half-Circle Sea Hold. She runs into the legendary fire-lizards, and.... well, if I tell you anymore I will ruin this small novel for you.Pick it up! Read it!

In a cave, she helps a fire lizard hatch her babies. Menolly is imprinted on the nine babies and teaches them to sing.

If you got hooked by Harry Potter, Dragonsong is right up your alley!"},{"Title":"Dragonsong","review":"Dragonsong was very interesting. Dragonsong was interesting when it said that only one mane could be a Harper in each city. It was also interesting when Menolly saved the eggs. Another instance was when the fire lizards eggs were hatching. And last was when Menolly was taking care of the lizards. Dragonsong was very detailed. Dragonsong was detailed when it described how badly Menoll's hand was cut. Then it was detailed when it described how she disinfected it. It was also detailed when it described how Menolly was taking care of the lizards. And finally was when it described the fire lizards eggs hatching. I liked Dragonsong. I like reading it because it had a good story. I also liked reading it because it was about lizards. Thesis: The story Dragonsong by Anne McCaffrey was both interesting and detailed. Reaction: My reaction to Dragonsong was that it is a good book. Though it was a little confusing, it was both entertaining and unique. Recommendation: I recommend that all high school students should read it."},{"Title":"Dragonsong","review":"Homework is a bad institution which defeats the purpose of school work. For example, reading chapters in the book Dragonsong for homework was dumb because we should have been doing this assignment in class. We could have spent this homework time reading or doing other useful work. Besides, the book Dragonsong was detialed and unresolved. The story Dragonsong was unique in its attention to detail. On several occasions the author explains the story with great depth. For instance the sentences, &quot; His voice made her briefly homesick for seawinds and the taste for salty air; briefly too she longed for the solitude of her cave.&quot; The author seems to give some insight on how Menolly thinks and feels with colorful descriptive words. Using this kind of dialogue works very well with this kind or story. The reader is able to understand characteristics of the people and things in Dragonsong. The story was unresolved because it never says how Menolly's story turned out. The author seems to leave it the reader to figure out the end. The way the story is played out your kind or given the impression that Menolly's desires to do her music will come true. The end of the book makes you wonder of this conclusion though because it mentions several times how badly Menolly's hand is hurt. I think the fact that Dragonsong was detailed and unresolved made it a better book. It appealed to me because of its turnout. I would recommend this book to teenagers facing conflicy with their parents and mature readers who enjoy thrilling and a bit cofusing novels."},{"Title":"Dragonsong","review":"A good friend of mine gave me this book nearly 8 years ago. She said it was her favorite book and I would definitely love it. I fell in love with the cover. Menolly looks so majestic and her fire lizards are enchanting. However, ever time I tried to start it I could get past the first chapter before I gave up. I must have tried 15 to 20 times before I allowed the book to gather dust on my shelf.But last week I got the book on CD out of the library, forcing me to listen and not allowing me to simply put the book down. I was hoping that once I got past the first chapter, plot would unfold and I would find the book as entrancing as my friend did 8 years ago. But the plot didnt pick up. Menolly didnt develop, and nothing of great note happened in the book.I was not impressed with McCaffrey's writing style, which didnt seem to paint any pictures or develop any of her characters. I know that people will give my review bad votes because I am insulting such a well loved book. But I just dont understand the hype.I suppose if you are an Anne McCaffrey fan, try it. If not, steer clear."},{"Title":"Dragonsong","review":"I think teachers should not give us homework. Homework is O.K. sometimes. When our teacher assigned us to read Dragonsong it was O.K. to me, but it led to my decision that: Dragonsong by Anne McCaffrey was curious and unexplained. Dragonsong was a curious story. The reason this story was curious was because Menolly herself was curious. Some incidents were she gets curious is when she gets tired of working and she wants to explore and see what else is around her. She takes a long walk and sees all the green plants and shrubs. Later on, she is curious enough to go further on and see some fire lizards. She gets curious with her music and starts making her own tunes against her fathers will. Dragonsong was a unexplained story. The reason it was unexplained was that the story just started in the middle. The introduction of the story talks about thread fall and it doesn't even explain what thread fall is. When it talks about animals and it says there names, it doesn't describe it or even say what they look like. How would you know what a harper is. It doesn't explain what it is. Later on in the story you will find out. My reaction to Dragonsong was not a surprising one. Personally I thought some of it was interesting but most of it confusing and boring. I don't really recommend this book to anyone unless you like detailed stories or confusion."},{"Title":"Dragonsong","review":"I don't enjoy reading fiction books because there is no base of reality and its all imaginative, like the story of Dragonsong written by Anne McCaffrey. It is an imaginative but yet complex book about dragons and fire lizards. The thought of dragons killing thread and protecting the world from harm. People had to impress the dragons and fire lizards by feeding them and talking to them. After that the person would be connected to that certain animal for life. The dragon or lizard impressed could actually read the mind of their owner and would follow them everywhere the person went. When dragons go &quot;between&quot; it gives a totally new view on our lives, it gives you a lot to think about and really starts your imagination. I personally didn't enjoy reading Dragonsong. To me it was very confusing, and boring. But for the people who like fanatasies, this would be an excellent book to read."},{"Title":"Dragonsong","review":"The characters in Dragonsong all have very different personalities from one another, which makes them interesting in my opinion. Menolly's character at first is mostly annoying but later really develops. She acts as any human, would making her character believable. For example, she runs away from Half Circle Sea Hold when she is unhappy. Also the setting is believable because when Ann McCaffery describes it, she gives Pern characteristics that are recognizable to Earth.The book is hard to connect to and does not involve the reader, though the details are consistent and descriptive. The author makes the firlizards seem natural. She does this by having them act like a dog or another animal that people react to. The plot is hardly interesting or entertaining even with good characters and details. However, the story is not slow moving or hard to understand. Overall I would not recommend the book unless the reader is very much interested in fantasy."},{"Title":"Dragonsong","review":"I first read the Dragon books many years ago. I have since introduced them to my children. The stories are rich, the world of Pern Anne McCaffery created is detailed, magical and delightful. Her female heroines are strong and capable.

These are fantasy classics."},{"Title":"Dragonsong","review":"It's a story that incorporates humor and drama into a situation we can relate to - great for all ages, too, from tweens on up.

Dragonsong written by Anne McCaffrey was an adventurous book, with mishaps and adventures that kept my attention the whole time. One event that particularly got to me was when Menolly was running on a beach away from thread. At first she didn't even notice it, she was to busy collecting food for her cave, but suddenly she looked up and noticed a gray cloud in the sky. At first, the thread looked distant and unthreatening, but as she started to back away from it, she found it coming towards her faster and faster. She turned around and started out in a full out sprint, not bothering to save any breath. The dragons whizzed about her head; wishing to warn her of the danger looming behind her. She finally fell to the ground, giving into defeat. Expecting to feel the burn of thread she instead felt... Well, I don't want to give away the plot! You'll just have to read it for yourself.

I feel it's the best introduction to Pern, and the one that will make them addicts just like me.I have read Dragonsong, and all of the pern novels, at least 3 times, and intend to reread them all again. I do allow for some time to pass between the rounds of reading, but I have yet to tire of any of the books. There are already more than enough reviews that include a good summary of the content, so I don't need to rehash all of that. What I'd like to reinforce is what so many others are praising these novels about: the style of writing, the smooth transitions and the deep, rivoting character developments of her style. Even her 'bad guys' are people you care about - you want to find out what's happened to them - have they gotten their 'comeuppance' yet? I just wish - really WISH this trilogy was on kindle. However, even if you have to actually hold and read a real book, rather than your kindle, this book (along with the other two of the trilogy) are a MUST READ. You'll change your mind about what dragons are (or should be) and if you're like me, you'll have a lifelong desire to have a dragon of your own."},{"Title":"Dragonsong","review":"Since I already own the other books in the dragonriders series, I thought to buy Draonsong for reading on the Kindle. I was very disappointed to find it's only available in Kindle edition if purchased as part of the complete series publication. This would mean paying an additional two dollars for books I already own. I'm not willing to do that.For those who haven't read the series, the kindle edition is a great price for the best of Anne McCaffrey."},{"Title":"Dragonsong","review":"Warning - this review contains spoilers!I first came onto Dragonsong after I had read The Dragonriders of Pern trilogy (which sets up the entire series of Pern books). I read the trilogy in a gulp, as the world of Pern and the life of the Weyr totally fascinated to me. I immediately went looking for anything more about Pern and I encountered Dragonsong.Menolly was a minor supporting character in the third volume of the trilogy, The White Dragon and I was surprised to find a complete novel built around the character, but I jumped in with no preconceptions.Menolly is the youngest daughter of Yanus, Holder of Half-Circle Sea Hold on the wild Eastern part of the northern continent and she is 15 years old at the beginning of the novel. Petiron, the Hold Harper, had found her to have an exceptional musical talent when she was very young. Even though girls were not allowed to be Harpers, he taught her how to play all of the instruments, to sing the traditional songs and eventually to write music. He even sent some of her music to Robinton, the Masterharper of Pern, for evaluation.The novel begins with Petiron's death and the subsequent abuse of Menolly by her family. There are no female harpers and they believe that a musical daughter is disgraceful. Her father forbids her to write music and even beats her when she disobeys. When the replacement Harper arrives, Menolly is hidden from him, even though he is seeking the composer of the wonderful music sent to the Masterharper. After she badly cuts her hand, her mother intentionally mistreats the wound so that Menolly will never play again. Menolly falls into a deep depression.Caught out during threadfall and stuck in a cave, Menolly is privy to the hatching of wild fire-lizards (miniature dragons). To prevent them from dying, she feeds the small creatures and impresses nine of them, who will then be her friends for life, linked telepathically. Deciding that she will not return to the hold, Menolly makes a life for herself on the coast, living in the fire-lizard cave, spending most of her time just finding food for the ravenous creatures. She makes herself a set of pipes and the fire-lizards learn to sing with her. During a later threadfall, she is caught away from the cave and must run for cover in her worn boots, tearing her feet to ribbons in the process. Fortunately, she is rescued by a dragonrider, who brings her to Benden Weyr.For the first time in her life, Menolly begins to understand what it is like to be treated with respect and affection. Her nurse is Mirrim, one of the most enigmatic characters throughout the saga. They are about the same age and quickly become friends. Afraid that she will be sent home, Menolly hides her fire-lizards until she is found out by Weyrwoman Lessa. Breaking down, she begs not to be returned home and is asked to stay in the weyr. Once accepted, she becomes overwhelmed by all of the attention.It is at this point that events from the novel Dragonquest become interwoven into Dragonsong, most notably, Brekke's recovery from the death of her dragon and Jaxom's impression of the little white dragon, Ruth.The book ends with Masterharper Robinton's discovery of Menolly as the composer of the songs that Petiron had sent him. Overjoyed, he asks her join the Harper Hall. At last, she will be able to pursue her love of music and to begin her new life as a musician.McCaffrey tells the story of a hero overcoming adversity extremely well. It is completely believable that Menolly suffers unbearably in order to pursue her dream. This is even more poignant in that it is at the hands of her own family, those who should love and support her. McCaffrey takes the time to detail these familial characters, so that they do not feel two-dimensional and so that their mistreatment of Menolly is understandable, if not agreeable.Menolly's love of music is treated in such a way that the reader develops an amazing sympathy for her plight. Everyone should have such a love of something that it would be the whole purpose of his or her life. This is a terrific foundation for the rest of the novel and also for the sequel, Dragonsinger.When she realizes that she has left her hold for good, there is a miraculous sense of freedom, which is punctuated by the miracle of the fire-lizard hatching. Menolly literally saves their lives, as she has saved her own, and both she and her fire lizards may live free. This freedom is referenced again several times in Dragonsinger when, under the pressures of life in the Harper Hall, she remembers the complete freedom of living in the cave.After her rescue, Menolly can scarcely believe her luck - she almost always worries that what she is doing is wrong or that someone will come down on her for her actions. This is the result of her mistreatment at the hands of her family. She has been conditioned into believing that she is always in the wrong. Part of the poignancy of the story is that the weyrfolk and harpers have to convince her of her own worth. And when she realizes that she can both play and write music to her heart's content and to the joy of others, she feels an amazement and gratitude that the reader can share in completely. It is cathartic.Dragonsong is the first novel in the Harper Hall trilogy and I make it a point to re-read the trilogy once every few years, as a way to get back in touch with my untapped emotional side. I have wept openly while reading this book - and I am not particularly susceptible to sentimentality. Maybe it just reaches the child in me. Or perhaps it is just that McCaffrey's writing gets under your skin, whether you want it to or not. Either way, for me this is a perfect little novel."},{"Title":"Dragonsong","review":"\\"Dragonsong\\" is the first book in Anne McCaffery's \\"Harper Hall Trilogy\\" and is set on the world of Pern. Unfortunately, it's prone to attack from Thread - spores that grow on a neighbouring planet and, at times, can bridge the gap between the two worlds. Thread is deadly to all life : it can only be killed by fire and it's progress is halted by fire and stone. Fortunately, Pern's inhabitants have a useful ally in the battle against thread : dragons. Not only capable of flying and breathing fire, Pern's dragons can also teleport. They also form a telepathic bond with their riders.\\"Dragonsong\\" doesn't tell the story of the great dragonriders, though : it tells the story of Menolly, a teenage girl living at Half Circle Sea Hold. Her father, Yanus, holds the position of Sea Holder, and is essentially the community's leader. Although life there revolves around fishing, Menolly is a talented musician and singer - talents that had been nurtured by Petiron, the Hold's Harper. However, Petiron has recently died and, though the Hold is waiting for his replacement, Menolly feels his loss more keenly than most. Menolly herself would dearly love to follow in her mentor's footsteps - however, it seems that only men can become a Harper. As a result, Menolly's father strongly disapproves of her love for music, and eventually forbids her to sing or play. This leads to Menolly running away from home and discovering a colony of fire lizards - more or less miniature dragons - which had, until then, been considered the stuff of legend.Although not the first book set on Pern, \\"Dragonsong\\" is a useful starting point. It is the first book of the Harper Hall Trilogy, and starts with a brief introduction that covers the history of Pern and its Dragonriders. Menolly proves herself to be a likeable, resourceful character, though a little lacking in self-confidence. Overall, an enjoyable and easily read book."},{"Title":"Dragonsong","review":"Dragonsong is the first volume in a trilogy that both I and my young teenager have enjoyed tremendously. The author has created and given life to a mythical world and culture with believable details and a sense of ongoing danger that comes from the regular appearance of \\"Threadfall,\\" an air-borne attack of deadly micro-organisms from a nearby star. This story begins with the heroine, Menolly, being only reluctantly allowed by her parents to use her extraordinary musical talent even though in her isolated home culture of sea-faring fishermen, girls are not allowed to be recognized as having those skills. After her elderly mentor dies and his replacement arrives, however, Menolly's old-fashioned and narrow-minded parents forbid her to have anything to do with music. Faced with a life of drudgery with no music in it, Menolly runs away and lives on her own in a cave, which puts her in the right place at the right time to help a clutch of \\"fire lizard\\" eggs hatch, and the hatchlings become her inspearable companions. We are given hints that in the broader plot, we will see that fire lizards are very important to this planet, and that Menolly has a hand in something much bigger than herself. Finally, Menolly is rescued from her self-imposed exile, when a flying dragon and its rider rescue her while she is trying to out-run Threadfall (having strayed too far from the cave and gotten caught out in it). But happily, she is whisked away via dragon flight to her bright future in Harper Hall, where music is everything and \\"even a girl\\" can partake fully in it. This is a delightful coming-of-age story, with a likeable and independent girl as the main character, and a wonderful fantasy setting. I highly recommend it (as well as the other two books in the trilogy, Dragon Singer and Dragon Drummer)."},{"Title":"Dragonsong","review":"Tall, gangly Menolly of Half Circle Sea Hold had helped the old Harper, Petiron teach the younger children and had even composed some music that Petiron had forwarded to the Masterharper for evaluation. When the Harper had died Menolly took over his teaching duties until a new Harper could be summoned. Under the usual course of events the next step would be for this talented youngster to be sent to the Harper Hall for further training but this was a most unusual case. Traditionally boys left as apprentices, girls stayed home and Menolly was nont only a girl but the daughter of Sea Holder Yanus, the very conservative Lord of the most traditional Hold in all of Pern.Under her parents direction, Menolly did not call attention to herself when the new Harper arrived and the entire Hold conspired to keep the shameful secret that a mere girl had been instructing the children. Banished to the kitchens Menolly suffered an accident there that seemed to put an end to her ever making music again. In dispair she ran away from her home in search of anything but the misery she found there. While on her own Menolly found that she had many more talents and opportunities than she had ever imagined.This 1976 coming-of-age novel is part of the long running Pern series and takes place at same time as THE WHITE DRAGON. The focus this time is not on dragons and their riders but instead on life for those who are not in the aristocracy of the weyrs. This book could be enjoyed in itself but would make much more sense to someone who was at least familiar with the Pern series."},{"Title":"Dragonsong","review":"This is another of McCaffrey's stories set on the Planet of Pern, featuring one of my favorite Pern characters, Menolly.

After all, who ever heard of a girl harper? She is even beaten for making music! Unable to live in misery any longer, she runs away and begins an adventure that will take her from a coastal fire lizard cave, to Benden Weyr, and finally to the place she has always longed for--Harper Hall!

And you have to love all those fire lizards!"},{"Title":"Dragonsong","review":"Drangonsong is the first in the Harper Hall Trilogy. These books are, in turn, a part of a series about Pern, a planet far, far away. The first time I found out about this story, I read an excerpt from it in a Heath reading book in fifth grade. I didn't realize that it was and excerpt from another book, and not just a short story, until I happened across the actual book in my school library. I really liked the book, but I couldn't figure out why McCaffrey kept including scientific explanations for various mystical occurences, until I figured out that this is actually a kind of sci-fi-fantasy hybrid. You see, the people of Pern are actually descended from travellers from Earth. Earth faced some kind of catastrophe and all of the Earthlings had to get into space ships and travel until they got to Pern, which is in a binary solar system. Over time, the Earthlings multiply and totally forget about Earth, and technology, and go back to the feudal system, with only traces of their old culture left. I only fully realized this when I read the Dragonriders of Pern series, and I also realized that they are on the same timeline as the Harper Hall Trilogy. To tell you the truth, I liked the young adult series with Menolly better than the adult series, although I would recommend reading both, because the land that McCaffrey creates is quite impressive. I think that she has a gift for young adult fiction that she doesn't use nearly enough. She's got way too many crummy adult books and hardly any stuff for teenagers. I think that the former genre doesn't need her as much as the latter."},{"Title":"Dragonsong","review":"All who love Pern cannot help loving Menolly with her unique gifts, courage and sweet nature! A book I'd recommend to everyone, just remember to also read the other parts of the Harper Hall trilogy, Dragonsinger and Dragondrums!"},{"Title":"Dragonsong","review":"Dragonsong is a very creative story. An example of this is the Dragons,fire lizards, and Thread. In this story, the dragons are Impressed by people who become their riders and fight the deadly Thread that falls every so often from the sky above Pern. They spray fire at the Thread, charring it before it can come to the ground. Another imaginative part of the story is that the Dragons can suddenly disappear and go &quot;between&quot;. In &quot;between&quot;, there is complete darkness and bone-chilling coldness. The dragons can also read peoples minds and so can communicate with them quite easily. Their relatives, the fire lizards share many of their same traits but on a much more miniscule scale. The fire lizards can also be Impressed as their larger relatives and will follow and and be loyal to their &quot;Impressor&quot;. The fire lizards take on a more pet bird or dog character. Like when they sit on their masters shoulders or nuzzle with them. With Thread always threatening to fall, the people of Pern live in protected communities called Holds. They have a Master Holder who acts as the authoritive figure in the Hold, as well as a Harper who specializes in music. He teaches the young ones all the traditional songs and ballads as well as providing entertainment for feasts or other major events. Overall, I felt that this was a very creative and imaginative story thathas a main character that goes through the same trials teenagers do today. So I think that even people that don't like fantasies or fiction stories could still relate to and enjoy the problems that they do too. But, I think that someone that doesn't like fantasy or fiction stories would probably not care to read Dragonsong, but it never hurts to give it a try!"},{"Title":"Dragonsong","review":"I often enjoy reading a good, non complicated book. That is probally why I didn't care much for the story of Dragonsong because it was a very complex book. The main reason why it was so complex and confusing was the fact that there were so many different characters, not only that but the author jumped around alot. One minute you would be in this great adventure and the next minute you're in a peaceful room without knowing what happened to end the adventure. For instance there was a part in the book where a harper was climbing to find someone, and the author just left it at that. She never really said what happened. It jumped from the cliff to a room full of people talking. How can you get involved in a story when they just leave you hanging, and never really answer your questions,personally I didn't care much for the book. To me it was confusing, and very unrealistic. As for recommending it, I don't think I would, unless you enjoy books full of fantasy, too many names, and unfinished business."},{"Title":"Dragonsong","review":"Usually reading assignments that I get in English class that involve reading an entire book upset and overwhelm me. Dragonsong by Anne McCaffrey was different though; it is an intriguing story of relationships, challenges, imagination, and determination. Dragonsong is really quite intriguing. It is written about things that aren't always thought of in our time. It's abnormal and yet very creative because of the imaginary Thread organisms. In this book there are many different challenges to overcome and all sorts of creatures and people that add intrigue. There is always a new charcter jumping into the story. Menolly is the main character of Dragonsong and throughout the story her adventurous spirit is throwing her into all sorts of situations. Such as falling over the side of a cliff as she spies on Fire lizards and not being able to return until she rescued their eggs. She tends to get through them all with her experience and determination. She also seems to love the challenges of life out of her normal home in the Hold. There are many events in this story and those are just a few. Dragonsong is full of mystery, puzzle, creativity, excitement, and intrigue. It is a book that I don't regret reading. And instead of being overwhelmed by the length and falling behind, I actually jumped ahead and finsihed far before my due date. It is well thought out and well written!"},{"Title":"Dragonsong","review":"I love reading fantasy books. A good book to read if you love fantasy is Dragonsong by Anne McCaffrey. Dragonsong is an adventurous book that keeps your attention. It is at times a little hard to understand but worth reading if you love dragons and mystical places. Dragonsong was an adventurous book because of the things the characters get themselevs into. One of the more exciting events in Dragonsong would be the dangerous threadfall. Threadfall makes an exciting twist to the plot providing adventurous situations for the characters. Anne McCaffrey did a wonderful job of making Dragonsong an exciting and mystical book filled with adventure."},{"Title":"Dragonsong","review":"I read this book after I read the second of the series dragonsinger hoping for it to answer my questions alas a flaw but still as I am with all of her books from this to crystal singer to the ship who sang I was entranced 5 stars to the memory of Anne McCaffrey."},{"Title":"Dragonsong","review":"I think that the plot behind &quot;Dragonsong&quot; is fascinating. It combines mythical creatures in a myhical yet believable setting and plot. With time travel, it also adds a little kick for future. It was a great book!"},{"Title":"Dragonsong","review":"I've been reading this book again and again since 10 yrs ago, and will flip it periodically. Most unique is the prologue of each chapter. I still wonder if the lyrics do have a chord (hoping to hear them if yes). The harper girl ran again &amp; again (did run on her own feet) into, mischief &amp; new friends &amp; life. Most touched by her encounter with the 9 fire lizards. At times when you're lonely, you may want to become like her."},{"Title":"Dragonsong","review":"The story line had promise, one of the best I had ever read. But, the story had very annoying flaws. One was the fact that the book was too short and went too few places. Second was the fact that the Fire Lizards did nothing. Other then these, the book was an excellent fantasy piece."},{"Title":"Dragonsong","review":"This book follows young Menolly as she tries to overcome her parents, who don't understand her love for music, an injury which keeps her from her music, and her first unprotected fall, which leads her to her dreams. I loved it!!"},{"Title":"Dragonsong","review":"This book is about a girl who loves music but is not allowed to play because she is a girl. It is an absolutely wonderful book! I could not but it down. Dragonsinger and Dragondrums come after this. They are all a must read!"},{"Title":"Dragonsong","review":"What would youdo if your parents would not let you do what you are best at? Run and hide? That's what Menolly did in Dragonsong.Dragonsong is one of the best books I ever read. for one, it was set on a planet called Pern, where there are dragons, and that is what makes it interesting.the characters, Menolly brave enough to try and out run a danger called thread. Her parents were mean because they would not let her do what she was best at because they thought her music would bring shame to their hold. It is so cool that Anne McCaffery came up with the idea for a place like Pernand all the people on it. This book is amazing and very interesting."},{"Title":"Dragonsong","review":"A very good book. Anne McCaffrey has outdone her other works with this one! This book exhibits the usual rebellious elements, without using the sexual experiences of the others."},{"Title":"Dragonsong","review":"For the first time reading an Anne McCaffrey book, I didn\`t think it was too bad. It was hard to understand at first, but then it would get easer and more exciting."},{"Title":"Dragonsong","review":"I thought this book was a little strange at first because I didn't understand the language, but after a while, I got really interested in it, and I have read many other Pern books. So far, all of them have been rated 5 stars by me!!! Way to go Anne!!!!!"},{"Title":"Dragonsong","review":"Reading is one of my most favorite hobbies. I think we can learn a lot from reading books. Because a good book may give us useful knowledge, or touch our hearts, or sometimes, change the way we think. For me, an exciting book makes me feel relaxed and catches all my attention. So as we read our assignment, I found Dragonsong by Anne McCaffrey enjoyable and curious. Dragonsong was an enjoyable story to me. First of all, it was a story of a teenage girl about my age, so it made me be willing to share her feelings. Another example, it was enjoyable when Menolly tried to live her life alone in the cave with her special friends, the fire lizards. Besides, after all the pain she had suffered, Menolly had a better life at Benden Weyr. There she could do all her favorite work without any limitation or prevention. She could do her most desirous hobbies, playing and singing, with the fire lizards humming along excitedly. Finally, Dragonsong seemed to have a happy ending when Menolly's dream of being a Harper was fulfilled. Dragonsong was a very curious story. It was curious because the readers may want to know what life was actually like on an imaginary planet. For instance, how the people lived, what they ate, what they did for a living, etc. Furthermore, the story was portrayed with the presence of mythical creatures like dragons, and fire lizards. So the readers may be much attracted by the way those people trained dragons to protect their planet. As we read the story, we really wanted to know what would happen to the characters, to their creatures, and how this interesting story would end. Those reasons made the story curious. Even though at first, I felt a little confused about it, Dragonsong is a good book to read. Especially with those who have imaginative minds, the book may take them to where their imaginations lead them. This is the book that makes you feel excited and restful if you need some time to be away from your busy work. So I recommend that everyone try to read this book, because once they read it, they will like it."},{"Title":"Dragonsong","review":"Reading is how I put my thoughts in a new place. Stories make me feel I am the character and everything is happening to me. They give me a whole new life to live. Dragonsong, by Anne McCaffrey, is an imaginative and adventurous book. The Dragonsong is an extremely imaginative story. When the Thread fall comes the dragons are able to kill it, but if the thread make it to land they can eat anything. Also when Menolly finds the fire lizards they can read her thoughts and they follower her everywhere after that moment. The idea of going &quot;between&quot; is very different and would be created only by imagination. During the Hatching the people impressed dragons by feeding them and talking to them. Then the dragon is with that person for life, unlike any animals on earth. This whole story only becomes real when you use your imagination. Dragonsong is very adventurous. The main character, Menolly, is a strong and brave girl and she goes on many adventures. Like when she left the hold right before thread fall, that was a tense part in the story. Then she started to live alone and had to provide everything for herself. It was frightening when Menolly was caught in thread fall with her feet torn up. Another adventurous part was going &quot;between&quot; on the dragon. That would have been a very exciting but terrifying experience. This story has many adventurous parts. I enjoyed parts of the book, but I really wished Menolly had fallen in love. I was hoping for some romance during the story. I would recommend people to read this, but only if they are older and enjoy fiction. Not everyone would enjoy the whole book, but I hope people can find some good part."},{"Title":"Dragonsong","review":"Sometimes reading bores me. It really depends on the story and if I feel like reading or not. To tell you the truth, I wasn't looking forward to reading Dragonsong by Anne McCaffery. By the end of the book I found it a confusing, yet unique story. I thought that Dragonsong was a confusing story. It was confusing because of the setting and the vocabulary. For example, when I first started to read the book, I didn't know if the setting was supposed to be sonme time in the past or future. But, I concluded that it was supposed to be in the past. Another example of how the story confused me was the vocabulary. The author gave the characters some strange new words. I had to read a few sentences over two or three times before I got the gist of the meaing of the words. Although it did confuse me, by the end of the book, I thought it was a unique story. The book, Dragonsong, was unique. this story was unique because it had a setting, plot, and overall suspense t it that no other story has. The imagination the author put into this stoy makes it unique. For example, the characters and where and how they live. They jlive in holds with their family and other families. The children don't call their parents &quot;mom&quot; and &quot;dad&quot; but by their first names. The feelings and actions of the main character, Menolly also make the book unique. This story shows that the author has a Unique imagination. I found that reading Dragonsong was not as fulfilling as I like my books to be. The book didn't get me interested and it bored me. So I don't recommend this book to those people that are hard to entertained. However I do recommend this book to people that enjoy a book with a lot of imagination and fiction."},{"Title":"Dragonsong","review":"I personally don't like reading, so when we were assigned Dragonsong I was sad. But I came to find Dragonsong, by Anne McCaffrey, was both unique and imaginative. Dragonsong is a very unique story. The reason why it was so unique was because not too many books have had this kind of imagination before. Also because of all of the things that happened to Mennoly that made her seem real. Anne McCaffrey captured the realness of all the characters and even the dragons. I like the fire lizards because how the book described them as they flew, and how they kept Mennoly warm when they were sleeping. It's real because how the guys won't let Mennoly be a Harper just because she's a girl and how we still sometimes act like that. Dragonsong was also a very imaginative book. It's imaginative because of the dragons and how they fly around. Also because how they came up with the idea of Thread and how the dragons must eat most of the Thread before it hits the ground. Another reason would be how the characters would all fight with one another about being a Harper. And another thing is how the fire lizards would fly through the sky. It took good imagination to see the dragons in the book, but the authors' details made it easier to see them. I liked Dragonsong and thought it was interesting. The first beginning was hard to understand, but it gets easier to understand later on. I would recommend this book for High School students because I think they will all like it once they get into it."},{"Title":"Dragonsong","review":"Homework can be hard and tiresome, but I was surprised when we were assigned a book as good as Dragon Song. Normally were given long boring books that you fall asleep on the first chapter. I was expecting this book to be boring also, despite the fact that it had things like dragons in it. I was happy to read a book as good as Dragon Song by Anne McCaffrey. Dragon Song was very enjoyable and was easy to relate to in some way. It was inspirational to see a person so looked down on able to get what she wanted just by sticking to what she loved. It had problems that were very close to real life it just depends on how you look at it. The way things are resolved in the book give the impression that everyone can do what they love no matter who they are. It gives a sense of victory when Menolly gets to go to Harper Hall and that's what makes it really enjoyable. Dragon Song was very exciting and kept you hanging on every word. Putting the book down is hard because the whole time you're wondering what's going to happen to Menolly. When reading the book theirs a feeling of excitement about how she deals with the Thread Storms and her Fire Lizards. It makes the reader want to go on and on until finishing the book. The book really excites you in all the events that happen. Dragon Song is good for everyone to read. It relates to a lot of problems faced in life and helps you feel a little more relieved that someone else has those problems even if they are fictional. I really liked this book because it was different and it entertained me unlike many other books I've read."},{"Title":"Dragonsong","review":"I have read most of the series,as you will find if you read other Pern reviews, and was no less amazed by McCaffrey's skill in this book! READ IT OR BEAT IT!! ITS WORTH IT, TRUST ME!!!!!!!"},{"Title":"Dragonsong","review":"Rating: 4 out of 5 starsReview: I enjoyed this story. The main character was interesting, as was the world that the book was set in. The whole story was well written and well told.There were two problems that I had with the book. The first was that it was too simplistic. There wasn't much character development, and things sometimes seemed to happen just because. However, this book was shelved in the young adult section of the library, so I don't really care that it was a simplistic book.The 2nd was that the setting and some of the back stories were a bit confusing. There was a foreword in the copy to give the reader some background on Pern. However, it wasn't really enough, especially once the main character winds up at the place with all the dragons (I don't have the book on me anymore and I forgot what it was called!). There was a bit too much backstory missing for everything to make sense. I realize now that there's another trilogy that I should have read before this one, as the first book happens before \\"Dragonsong\\". However, given that this book is a young adult book and that the trilogy that comes before it is an adult book, the fact that this book is a bit on the confusing side when read alone is a problem. Not all kids who are in the yound adult section are up to reading adult books yet.Aside from those two problems I greatly enjoyed this book and would recommend it to anyone."},{"Title":"Dragonsong","review":"I fell in love with Anne McCaffrey's world of Pern and her peoples the first time I read this book in the late 70's. I have been following her writing most of my life. McCaffrey's character development and visualization of the world around these intriguing peoples was breathtaking, heart felt, warm and real. Most notable, once I started reading this book I could not set it down. I had to see what happened next. I have laughed and cried along with Menolly, and other Peoples of Pern. This book has been reread many times over the last 3 decades. My old copy of this book was beginning to fall apart and I wanted to share This Book: Dragonsong with my niece who is 11. My old copy would not do, I needed the best I could find, and Amazon.com is where I found it. Thank you for providing 3 different quality's of binding to choose from. I am hoping she will enjoy this book as much as I have. Thank You Anne McCaffrey and Amazon."},{"Title":"Dragonsong","review":"So many reviews for this book already, just want to add my rating to the overall score.First read this in intermediate school and totally identified with Menolly's feelings of alienation and injustice (eh, teenagers.) Possibly not something I love as much now as I did then but it was the start of my Fantasy genre obsession and a classic."},{"Title":"Dragonsong","review":"Anne McCaffrey is the quintessential writer of fantasy books pertaining to dragons. These books are always wonderful, well written, and perfectly characterized. All of her series are great but the ones that take place on Pern are the best of all."},{"Title":"Dragonsong","review":"this is a great book about a girl with passion for music. the story takes place in a fictional land called pern. mccaffrey has fully developed this world in a whole series of books, this is only one series of many that take place in this land, but a lot of them are adult novels as opposed to this one which is meant for kids. the book focuses on this girl named menolly who lives in a very conservative fishing village in a time before modern technology and in a world where dragons exist. menolly loves music, but it is frowned upon for women to participate in music in any significant way, aka singing in a chorus is ok, but it is unheard of for a woman to be a 'harper' which is a person treated almost like a scholar or a preist. men with talent go off to study in a harper school and to be a harper is a very prestigious position. every little town is sent their own harper to teach the children songs and to preside over the music at ceremonies and events.so this girl menolly is very talented and loves music, but because of the society she lives in, she can't enjoy her gift. the old harper recognized her talent and fostered her gift, and because she was a child her parents allowed this, but as the story opens we find that this old harper is dead and the town (of which her father is the chief) has requested for a new harper. before the old harper died, he had sent off some songs menolly had written to the master harper and he really liked these and told the new harper to find this (thought to be male) prodigy. and this is sort of where we walk into the story.menolly then goes through some trials, one of which is cutting her hand while gutting fish. this is particularly tragic because she is told that she can no longer play music. she already feels useless because she's taller and stronger than 'a girl should be' and she's has no interest in what she should be doing. her parents, especially her father are really against her playing music. her father even beats her when he finds her absent-mindedly strumming a guitar after he forbid her to make any music as he doesn't want her to shame their village when the new harper comes. because of this she makes herself scarce and eventually runs away to live on a cliff with these little dragons called fire lizards.this is the first in a trilogy and is a great story for both budding fantasy lovers as well as for vetrans. it's a quick read but has memorable characters and a fast-paced plot. fun for all ages."},{"Title":"Dragonsong","review":"I have been reading Anne McCaffrey's novels for years. I have a copy of every one of them and I would recommend her works to anyone of all ages. She has created a fantasy world that you can fall into and lose yourself in. Her characters are the examples of the best and the worst of humanity. The novels are good reads with very little \\"lag\\" time throughout. Captivating story lines coupled with the characters she has created make this, and every other one of her books, a must-read."},{"Title":"Dragonsong","review":"This story is my favorite of Anne McCaffrey's works. It is also the first one I read. I read it long ago, and I re-read it the other day. It's nostalgic.

I actually bought this for my niece who is a young teen. I've read the whole Pern series to date and the Harper Hall Trilogy were the first books I read. This book and the trilogy are captivating reading for teens and adults alike."},{"Title":"Dragonsong","review":"This is the first book in the young adult Harper Hall trilogy. I thought it was a pretty good read. I'm still not sure if I will finish the trilogy though. I thought the book had a pretty solid ending and I wasn't left wanting more. I would recommend this to fans of fantasy and young adult books."},{"Title":"Dragonsong","review":"I've recently rediscovered the books on Pern. This is the first book in the second Trilogy and well worth the read. The characters are easily understandable, and the story is fast paced. I was drawn in to Menolly's plight, and felt her pains and joys as the story progressed. a well-balanced story that seamlessly integrates into the storyline, giving them more life."},{"Title":"Dragonsong","review":"I am definitely a Pern fan and I very much enjoyed this book. As I read through the reviews I was stunned to see this book assigned for reading without prerequisite reading of other Pern books. Background is needed to understand many of the references made in this book that can only be understood by reading other books. This is part of a series and cannot adequately stand alone. By the time we get to Dragonsong, we should be comfortable and familiar with many of the characters and characteristics of the people mentioned and Pern itself. While Menolly is the main character, she interacts with characters that have been fleshed out and have become old friends by the time they met once again in this story. There is no need to explain in detail about the whys of thread and dragons and weyrs. There is no need to explain the in depth and subtle reasons there is tension felt across the land and why.So, I recommend this book, but only after you have read the others that have come before..."},{"Title":"Dragonsong","review":"This latest edition, with its additions and especially the wonderful cover art, is worth adding to the collection of McCaffrey fans or to introduce a new generation to the majesty of Pern and its dragons.As for content - I always found the Harper Hall books (Dragonsong, Dragonsinger, Dragon Drums) a bit juvenile in comparison to the rest of the series. Perhaps this is due to the youth of the characters. They'd be an excellent way to introduce your kids to Anne's books, but are a bit childish for an adult or older teen. Still, since Menolly becomes a major character later, (along with Piemur, Audiva, Sebell, who are fixtures in the sequel to \\"Dragonsong\\") they're a must read."},{"Title":"Dragonsong","review":"I first read these books as a young girl, about ten years old. I found them in an old box of books belonging to my mother, and I was immediately lost in Menolly's world. This a book for those who have felt like they don't fit and that no one understands, and for those who believe that dreams really can come true. A certain fascination for dragons comes in handy as well.Menolly is a 15 year old girl on the planet of Pern, a planet where song is the key form of communication. She lives in an isolated Sea Hold and when her mentor and only friend dies, she is forced to give up her love of writing music. Mistreated and ignored by her family and neighbors, Menolly finally leaves home, only to find herself in the midst of an adventure she could have never imagine.If you like fantasy, you'll love this book. Be sure to read the other two in the trilogy as well."},{"Title":"Dragonsong","review":"Sally Darling reads this delightful book very well with attention to all details of the text.

The main character is Menolly, a very talented and determined young woman whose dream is to become a Harper. Her old-fashioned father finds the idea of a female Harper disgraceful and does everything he can to hold her back. Finally, no longer able to stand her unfair treatment, Menolly runs away and lives with a group of fire lizards (small flying lizards that closely resemble dragons). Here she can use her gift of music and is quite contented with her life.The ending of the book is satisfying, although I would recommend reading the other two books that come after it in the series.The characters in this book are very believable, the setting is realistic, and the plot is interesting, exciting, and suspenseful.I highly recommend this book for ages 8-10 and up. I think that many adults would enjoy it, as well as children."},{"Title":"Dragonsong","review":"As stated above I read this in the wrong order, to be specific I read it as part 4 in the series. It fills in some empty spots(of which Anne McCaffrey has left very little), and if you read this in order, introduces new characters that play a vital role.Menolly, a young girl who is chastized for her gift of music by her family;yet conditions force her to play/teach the young at Half-Circle Sea Hold the ballads. After a while other conditions prevent her from playing and she runs off, unable to withstand the &quot;torment&quot; of the new harper's playing music mixed with the constant chastizing of her family... girls are not supposed to be harpers you know... as she runs off, she comes across a clutch of firelizard eggs in danger. As she saves it, she finds herself in danger of thread, and holds up with the clutch which happens to hatch at that time;after a number of the young impress, the adventures for Menolly continue to grow...Oh yeah, I don't want to give too much more away, but circumstances make Menolly well sought after by the Masterharper... only neither one know that it's her!"},{"Title":"Dragonsong","review":"I admit, when I pick up a fantasy book, I'm usually craving some sort of crazy plot with action and close-calls...all spiraling down to one final battle scene. This book was nothing like that. It's about a quiet girl who lives her every day life until events take her to another more exciting (but still pretty tame in terms of fantasy) setting. Although this book didn't grip me with a sense of anguish, glory, and exhilaration like some more exhuberant fantasy series, it was still very original and entertaining. It's good for a quick, light read. McCaffrey was able to build great characters within a small amount of time (the book is only a little over 100 pages long), which is rare in most fantasy books today. It has hooked me enough that I will probably continue the next few books in the series when I need a break from some of the more action-packed fare that I'm used to reading."},{"Title":"Dragonsong","review":"I think Dragonsong is a really interesting book, the author writing a mythology about the Dragon and I think this book interesting. Because the Dragon is look like a big lizard and the lizard can fly. When they are little they were so lovable. And they listen to their master's command. This book story is writing about Menolly and her life. Menolly was a good girl, she has a relly good job. Because her job in her life she was meet a lot of nover, danger things. And she has a little fire lizard queen and I think between the human and the animal has the feelings is very interesting."},{"Title":"Dragonsong","review":"Whenever I get reading assignments from my english class, I always wait until the last minute to do it. It's because I think reading assignments are really boring. Like I said, this book, Dragonsong by Anne Mccaffrey was a boring story. Dragonsong was a boring story. Throughout the whole book, there weren't that much of changes nor big events. It was pretty much smooth and expoectable from beginning till the end. Like when she got her hand cut, my personal thought about the event was that soon or later, her hand will be healed and that she will be able to play her music again. Also the story was pointless and so unreal. Why would youo even try to make a story about a dragon and a troubled girl's life? Eventhough this book Dragonsong was a boring book, there is a lesson that you can actually learn from. 'The lesson is that Don't be discouraged and be strong' I recommend this book to teenagers but not to anyone younger than 13.

She lives in the Half Circle Village.There she usually plays a harp but when she cuts and paralyzes her right hand,she is unable to play. Then she goes out, finds and lives with 9 fire lizards and their eggs.I thought the main character Menolly in the book was very detailed, but everyone else seemed blurry.The author only included details about Menolly and not the other people or the setting of the book. The author does not include detailson the place or the events. She really leaves you hanging. There are many things that are unclear in the book, such as, What is thread? What is menollys home like? Almost no where in the book does it mention a different planet or pern.This book would be much better if it had more details and was well explained. I would not recremend this book."},{"Title":"Dragonsong","review":"Dragonsong was a very exciting book. This was because of all the different adventures that Menolly was placed into. A few Examplesare the following. When she was caught in the Thread. And she managed to cut her hand while gutting fish, while she was still in the Sea Hold. And the time when she first meet the dragons was a real cliff-hanger. When i first started reading this book I thought that it just wouldn't start but she put in a lot of exciting thing."},{"Title":"Dragonsong","review":"Whenever I get reading assignments from my english class, I always wait until the last minute to do it.

She just lets everyone beat her up and didn't do anything. When she finally runs away, it is by accident! And she had no personality! Uggh! Don't read this book!

It isn't hard, difficult, or boring, but instead is rather easy to read, and enjoyable. You will find yourself wanting to read the others if you read this.

From then on, I was hooked on Anne McCaffrey. Every time I picked it up, it gave me a sence of happiness. Like when you go into a room that is well decorated and planned out. Each charracter was well thought up and easy to comprehend. Menolly is now on my list as &quot;bravest of all woman&quot;. I really enjoyed this book!!!"},{"Title":"Dragonsong","review":"Ann McGaffery's Pern and her Dragons are among my favorite books, not only because of the depth and breath of the land that she has created, but because of the personal interaction and dialog that build the complex social structure that define it. While she tends to repeat her story lines, mostly it's from the point of view of other characters, and their reactions to what's going on. Ann has definitely pushed the limit in this area, but at the same time it's like coming home to a warm comfortable chair where one can just snuggle in and enjoy the well-crafted workmanship. I particularly like catching hints to her plot twists and future character developments in the stories written years before the ones that really explore them. I sometimes wonder how she did it.It's interesting to read the comments posted here. Most of the negative ones don't seem to understand that Dragonsong is part of 9 or so books in Ann's Pern universe, and I think the 3rd one that she wrote. The other interesting (and probably universal) theme is that these opinions seem to be mostly written by students who had to do a book report, while the positive one are from those who picked this book up on their own and have read other books in the series. Lets just say that I don't think that the teachers are presenting this book in the best possible light. My suggestion is that you find a chair you love, turn on a good light and read the entire series in the order that Ann wrote them. You may end up moving them to your list of favorites also."},{"Title":"Dragonsong","review":"Dragonsong is written by Anne McCaffrey its a good book Dragonsong is a book that captivates the interest of all who read it. It opens up a world of imagination that will thrill and entertain you. Dragonsong is written by Anne McCaffrey, were she combines adventure and suspense into one terrific book that is great to read. Suspense is often seen in the book. Menolly was one day out away from her cave in the cliff side, when Thread started falling down. Ashe sees the silver rain of Thread, she desperately tries to outrun it to her cave. Trough the boulders of the rocky beaches and the grasses of the plains she desperately needs to get to the safty of the cave. While she runs trough the N'rat plain she stays close to the water in case the Thread did start to fall down on her she could dive in. While she is running a dragonier spots her and picks her up in his beautiful bronze dragon. This book is full of such stories of suspense and adventure. It is the book that anyone will want to read. It is a book that will take your breath away and it will be so exciting that you will not be able to let it go out of your hands."},{"Title":"Dragonsong","review":"I like reading. When I was told to read the book Dragonsong, written by Anne McCaffrey, I thought it would be fun. It was an adventurous book because of the fantasy in it. The book, Dragonsong was an adventurous story. When Mennolly was down by the shore getting food, the Thread started to fall. Mennolly began running with her fire lizards flying above her. She was running as fast as she could to escape the Threadfall. It burned the people who were hit by the Threads. Right when the reader thinks she's not going to make it back to the cave, a dragonrider swoops down and grabs her and takes her back to Benden. This event of adventure is one of the happenings in the story. The book Dragonsong had a good story moral. I think if you are told to read a book for a class, then you should read this book. I don't think anybody could sit down and for fun just read the book. In my opinion it was a hard book to read, but it was a fun book for me personally to read."},{"Title":"Dragonsong","review":"I first read Dragonsong when I was 8. That was back when I was into Nancy Drew and Sweet Valley High, so it was something very different. I must admit that the only reason I read it was because my dad's friend gave it to me and it had a girl with red hair on the cover. I have red hair, Nancy Drew has slightly red hair, so I was a little obsessed with red hair. And I must admit that I hadn't bothered to read the introduction, so I thought the whole thing was taking place on Earth, and I was rather confused. But still, I found the characters to be endearing, I LOVED Menolly and her fire-lizards, so I read Dragonsinger (also given to me by this friend). I loved Dragonsinger, and I cried myself to sleep the night I finished it because now Menolly was gone--sure, I could re-read the books, and I did, but I couldn't find anything else by McCaffrey in the bookstore or library (it never occurred to me to check out the adult section--that was where the ROMANCES were kept...ugh!). Two years later, I tracked down Dragondrums, and after that Dragonflight...and the entire series. Dragonsong is a great coming-of-age story, any kid, teenager or adult, for that matter, could empathize with Menolly's feelings of being an outcast from her society, and share in her triumphs. What more can I say? Read this book. It's one of McCaffrey's best"},{"Title":"Dragonsong","review":"This book was wonderful. A musical girl, Menolly, was forbidden to make music by her family when the harper of Half-Circle Sea Hold died. Menolly found herself helping mythical fire lizards. Her life at home becomes unbearable when she cripples her hand and thinks she can never play again. Finnally she ran away and found a clutch of fire lizards. Then she had nine fire lizards of her own. Escaping Threadfall she found herself at Benden Weyr and met the MasterHarper.This book was a great book for young adults and actually for all ages. Anne McCaffrey is great in portraying how Menolly feels. And I love that the main character is a female because in most books the main characters are guys with large egos and the girls are weak and can't take care of themselves. This book focuses on a strong female who can pretty much take care of herself."},{"Title":"Dragonsong","review":"&quot;Dragonsong&quot; is the first of Anne McCaffrey's Harper Hall of Pern trilogy which focuses on my favorite Pern character, Menolly. In this first story, Menolly is the youngest child and daughter of Yanus, Sea Holder at Half-Cirlce Sea Hold in Benden Hold. Although she displays astounding musical talents, Menolly's father will have none of it. After the death of Petiron, the old Harper, Menolly is allowed to sign only to give the children their teaching songs. But when Elgion, the new Harper, arrives at Half-Circle Sea Hold, Menolly is forbidden to play ever again. Literally adding injury to insult, Menolly sustains a grevious wound to her hand while cleaning fish. But just as it looks at if life could not get any worse for Menolly, a wonderful thing happens. She impresses a clutch of nine fire lizards. In her miniature queen Beauty and the rest of the clutch, Menolly has a chorus of fire lizards who harmonize with her in a most amazing way. Meanwhile, Harper Elgion is having a problem, because he has been ordered by Master Harper Robinton to discover the prodigal talent Petrion has discovered. In his last message the Old Harper had sent two of the loveliest melodies Robinton had ever heard. But clearly none of the young lads at Half-Circle Sea Hold has a whit of musical talent and Yanus makes up some story about a foundling sent back to his own hold. Eventually Robinton himself comes to solve the mystery of the missing musical talent.No hyperbole here, but not since Anne of Green Gables have I come across as enchanting a young girl as Menolly (her name is just perfect too). The similarity is certainly palatable, what with a young woman who is told to deny her talents because she is but a girl. But Menolly has a gift and it is impossible for her not to use it, even if it must be in secret, and what makes her so endearing is that she really has no idea how talented she is, a trait that becomes even more precocious in &quot;Dragonsinger&quot; and &quot;Dragondrums.&quot; My only real complaint with Anne McCaffrey's recent novels is that Menolly has been reduced to only a minor supporting character."},{"Title":"Dragonsong","review":"I am 12 and I bought this book for 75 cents at a library used book sale. I bought it because it looked cool and I'm into fantasy; I'd never read a book by Anne McCaffrey before. I started reading it and I couldn't put it down, so I sat there reading it all day until I finished it and loved it so much that I got Dad to take me to buy Dragonsinger straight away because I was so into it that I didn't want to stop. I've finished the trilogy and loved every bit of it. The amazing thing is, I don't really like reading and don't usually unless I have to, but I can't put down one of Anne McCaffrey's books. She's my absolute favorite author!"},{"Title":"Dragonsong","review":"For the child that loves dragons and stories about dragons, only one book series comes to mind that has successfully created an entire complex world of dragons and the people who love them. Anne McCaffrey's dragonriders of Pern series has existed since the 1970s and it is still as popular as ever. Author McCaffrey has written intricate imaginings about Pern and its inhabitants. At once sci-fi and fantasy, she is an adept writer that fully deserves the popularity she has received. For the child that wants an easy introduction into this world, there are two options. They could begin at the very beginning of the series and slowly work their way through all the Pern books. Or, second option, they could start with a book that is both kid-friendly and a wonderful Intro to McCaffrey 101. \\"Dragonsong\\" was a book that I personally picked up in sixth grade and loved. It is the perfect way to learn more about the dragons of Pern, their riders, and the people of the planet.McCaffrey is smart. She knows that this book series is so complex that it there is no way in which to begin any plot without a recap of past events. She includes in this tale a map of Pern, a useful character list, and a Forward that deftly explains the history of the planet and its dragons. Then we meet Menolly. Born in a small fishing village, the girl is the most talented musician in the village, but she yearns to become a professional Harper and create music as well as sing/play it. Unfortunately, no woman has ever been a Harper before and her conservatively minded family is determined to squash this dream of Menolly's before she shames them in some way. When life for Menolly becomes too harsh, she escapes into the wide world and takes shelter in a cave. There, she discovers a cache of fire lizards, small cousins of the dragons that protect Pern. By witnessing the birth of nine of these pet sized dragons and tending to them, Menolly acquires nine faithful affectionate companions that will help her as she determines how best to live and survive.I don't think I've adequately conveyed the plot as well as I would have liked. Needless to say, long before Tamora Pierce made her name as the primo Heroines-In-Fantasy genre writer, McCaffrey was writing fantastic stories such as this. Boys reading this book will undoubtedly enjoy it, but I feel that like myself when young, girls will really gravitate towards the reading. Menolly is incredibly talented, but smothered and unappreciated by her family members. The fact that she possesses a brilliance with music and nine tiny dragons makes her special and different and you really want people to turn around and cheer her. When such a thing finally happens in the book, the reader is awash in joy for the character. McCaffrey is so adept that reading this book is just a delight. The only real problem with it comes with an odd backstory about the dragonrider Brekke. Up until that point, the book has mostly been easy to follow and read. Suddenly Menolly is talking with Brekke's step-daughter and the reader, if they haven't read the previous books in the series, is momentarily confused and bewildered by this plot that's flown in from left field. Otherwise, the text is perfectly good.If you've a kid who likes fantasy (or heck, an adult for that matter) then you cannot do better than Menolly's series of Pern books, referred to as the Harper's Hall Trilogy by some. I recommend you start them with either this book or the equally amusing (and well-written) \\"The White Dragon\\", another good Intro. to Pern book for the kiddies. Personally, my heart belongs to \\"Dragonsong\\" and I cannot recommend it enough to those who've a love of people, dragons, and a rollicking good yarn."},{"Title":"Dragonsong","review":"Dragonsong is the first novel in the Harper Hall trilogy and the fourth in the Pern series. Harpers are assigned to Holds and Guild Halls to educate the children and to pass on interesting events to the adults. Harpers are much in demand since the return of Thread and Lessa's heroic trip through time to bring forward another five full Weyrs from the past.In this novel, seven turns have passed since Lessa's trip through time. Half-Circle Sea Hold has lost their aged Harper and no one other than Menolly, the Sea Holder's youngest child, can properly sing the deathsong to honor old Petiron as he is put to rest. Yanus is upset that a mere girl should be given this honor, yet he has no choice but to allow it. Moreover, Menolly is the only one available to instruct the children in the Teaching songs. However, Yanus and his wife, Mavi, try to stop Menolly from \\"tuning\\", writing new songs. After repeated warnings, Yanus beats her with his belt when she dreamily strums a new tune in front of the children and Mavi piles works on her.When the new harper arrives, Yanus and Mavi try to keep Menolly from his attention, even though the new Harper has asked about the person who wrote the new songs that Petiron had sent to Harper Hall. When Menolly slashs her hand open while gutting packtails and gets slime into the cut, her mother cleans, stitches and bandages the wound and tells Menolly that she will no longer be able to use that hand to play music.The wound becomes poisoned by the slime as well as infected and Menolly spends a few days in pain and delirium. After she recovers, she spends most of her time out of the Hold gathering greens and fruit. One day Menolly is out gathering spiderclaws when she discovers a golden fire lizard trying to move her clutch of eggs away from a unusually high tide, but she keeps dropping them. At first, the little queen tries to drive Menolly away, but Menolly eventually persuades the queen to let her help.By the time the remaining eggs are safe, Threadfall drives Menolly into the small cave with the queen and her eggs and then the eggs begin to hatch. The young fire lizards are hungry and try to scramble out of the cave to catch food, but the falling Thread will kill them, so Menolly desperately feeds them the spiderclaws. By the time that the Threadfall is over, Menolly has impressed nine young fire lizards.This novel is my favorite in the Pern series, although others are almost as enjoyable. There is something fresh and open about the tale, and the songs, that especially appeals to me. Menolly is a talented young woman who belongs with the Harpers, despite her parents thoughts on the matter. Thus, the story is a classic generation gap plot with a final satisfactory resolution.This novel may appeal more to young women than to males, but I passed this novel on to my daughters because I liked it. You don't have to be female to enjoy this story. Menolly is an very likeable young woman who compells your attention.Highly recommended for McCaffrey fans and anyone else who enjoys SF tales of talented young persons struggling to gain recognition for their abilities. If you have not yet read any of this series, start withDragonflight.-Arthur W. Jordin"},{"Title":"Dragonsong","review":"Anne McCaffrey was first introduced to me in this book and I LOVED IT! Menolly seems like a real person and I can connect with her. I also enjoyed the way the characters from the Harper Hall of Pern series were in the Dragon Riders series (and vice versa). It totally blew me away that the characters that I enjoyed in one book were written about from another characters point of view. Also, it's hard to understand exactly what's going on if you don't read both series (I didn't even know this until I had. I thought I understood perfectly), so it's sort of like an adventure inside of an adventure (if you know what I mean). Anyway, I would suggest this book to anyone who has any interest what-so-ever in dragons, music, or Anne McCafferey. This is a must read!"},{"Title":"Dragonsong","review":"This is the first book of the Harper Trilogy. Menolly is the main character, an extremely talented young woman forced to hide her musical abilities from the new harper. She is beaten for strumming a guitar harmlessly, her hand is purposefully left to scar after an acciedent with a knife while gutting packtail (which leaves her basically unable to play any instrument), and she is discouraged from singing in front of any that may discover her.Unable to bear a life in which music is forbidden to her, Menolly runs from her sea-hold. She is forced into a cave she earlier had placed a clutch of fire-lizard eggs in, where the eggs are hatching. In her haste to save the hatchlings from Threadfall, she somehow manages to Impress quite a few of the little creatures. Hence the image on the front cover.This is the story of how Menolly became one of the first woman trained at the Harper Craft Hall and of the start of pet fire-lizards. This is an excellent book. At some points you will feel so frustrated for the positions Menolly is forced into, wishing she would blow up, at least. But she always keeps her temper, finder her way bravely out of it with her own solutions. I cheered her on through this book, waiting and hoping for everything to work out nicely in the end, like most people seem to hope. And when it does end, it ends in a surprising way, leaving the reader anticipating the second book excitedly. Menolly is a strong, realistic character that makes her mark in the history of Pern in her own special way. I rated this book five stars because that is what it truly deserves."},{"Title":"Dragonsong","review":"Another reviewer said some completely wrong things about this book and I had to correct it. The person says, &quot;Menolly, a young farm girl sets out to both fit in and find individualism amongst her new found friends, the sailors.&quot; CORRECTION: Menolly lives in a sea Hold (not a farm!) which means her whole family and everyone she knows is a sailor, as it has been her whole life. Her &quot;new friends&quot; in the book are the fire lizards, and of course, some people later on -- but not sailors, for goodness sakes!The reviewer adds, &quot;she sets out on an adventure whereby she is kidnapped and subsequently escapes.&quot; CORRECTION: Menolly NEVER is kidnapped! She runs away (I'm not giving this away, it happens early on).All this aside, I must add that this a great book, probably my favorite in the whole Pern series. Menolly is so 3D, her feelings are so human, and her experiences, though not at all what real life is like here on Earth, yet somehow relate to what we all experience growing up. She strikes out on her own, taking a chance because she has to.And if you have to read it for school, may I give you some advice? Don't just hate it because it's been forced on you. This is a very enjoyable, sweet book about dragons and music and coming into your own as a person. It's a treat, like Star Wars or something, not a pain, like Moby Dick (sorry, but I hate that book ~_^). It should be something you love, not something you despise. Give it a chance! This is pleasure reading all the way and you're lucky to be reading it! I mean, if a teacher made you listen to your favorite band for school, would you hate it too?"},{"Title":"Dragonsong","review":"A rare, rare treat - I was unexpectedly floored by this book. It is wonderful read, and highly recommended for any 10 to 13 year old.I won't replicate the plot here, since it has been sufficiently summarised numerous times on Amazon's review thread for this book. A part of the book that is so enriching is the utterly believable manner in which, the lead character, Menolly, comes to feel like an outcast in her village. And this, for something she truly loves, and is innately talented.The suppression of her gifts leads her to run away from the village, and events transpire to this shy and modest girl, although remaining shy and modest, others outside her village come to see her as remarkably talented. The warmth of the story creeps up on you as you read the book -- there is no one event that astounds you, or one act by Menolly that makes the reader think her the most special 'anything' -- the character of her character slowly unfolds from good solid writing.I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Dragonsong","review":"Awesome! This book was a very good addition to the Dragonriders of Pern series! First of all, the plot was excellent. Menolly, a young teenager, is very good at playing and singing music. However, her skills are out of place and unwanted in the Half-Circle Sea Hold where she lives. After her old mentor, a Harper named Petiron, dies, and a new Harper comes to replace him, Menolly's skills become evn less wanted. She runs away from the safety of her Sea Hold, and soon makes a discovery: The fire lizard, a creature of legend, actually exists! She ends up helping a fire lizard queen to save her clutch of eggs, and impresses nine of the many that hatch. However, danger still lurks. While out foraging one day, Menolly is caught in the Fall of Thread, a silver organism that devours alive anything it touches. She outruns the Thread for a while, but as it is closing in, she is rescued by a dragonrider, who takes her to Benden. There, she meets Lessa and F'lar, Dragonwoman and Dragonman of Pern, and makes a friend in Mirrim, a girl who has three fire lizards. Meanwhile, Elgion, the new Harper at Menolly's Sea Hold, finds out that MENOLLY was the prized apprentice Petiron wrote of. He sets out to find her, along with Robinton, Masterharper of Pern. Will they find her? Read the book to find out. This was a great book, one I would recommend to anyone who's dreamed of getting the best that they deserve."},{"Title":"Dragonsong","review":"First book in the Harper Hall trilogy, one of the many books about the dragons of Pern, this book, along with the second in the trilogy, Dragonsinger, is my favorite book in the entire series.There is nothing spectacular about it. No thrilling action, no mysteries or horror. It's just that I love the main character, Menolly.The book starts with Menolly singing farewall to Petiron, the Harper, who was her most cherished friend and mentor. At 14, youngest child of Seaholder Yanus, in the isolated Half-Circle Seahold, prospects for her future are not promising. Still, she could well endure it if not for one thing: the one thing she loves most in life, music, is soon to be denied her.From here to the end of Dragonsinger, Menolly is essentially leaving her childhood behind and becoming a young adult, within little more than a single year.After Petiron's death, Menolly is put in charge of learning the young children into the teaching ballads, as she is the only one with the proper skill in all Seahold, and a new Harper will take a while to arrive. Seaholder Yanus is not happy about it, though, because Harpering is a man's job and Menolly is just a girl. Worse still, she also has the nerve of composing songs of her own, something he quickly forbids her, rather than risk the children learn them and shame the hold in front of the new Harper.It is not easy for Menolly to hold back that which comes naturally to her, and which she loves so deeply. She breaks the rules laid down to her unintentionally, in moment of distraction, and gets caught at it. And that spells utter doom to her, as Yanus becomes determined not to let the new Harper ever learn about her.Her bad fortune is composed by an accident while cutting fish, which leaves her left hand crippled. Denied her joy in music, ignored by all, she ends leaving the Seahold one early morning only to get trapped during the deadly threadfall too far away from home... and get herself most unexpected new friends.And so does Menolly leaves her hold of birth, in a path that will lead her to new friends, to people who care for her, and, in the end, to a meeting with the very MasterHarper of Pern.The only thing I really dislike in this book is that, at less than 200 pages, it is much too short!"},{"Title":"Dragonsong","review":"The first time I read this book I was in middle school, because truthfully it is geared more towards young adults than anyone else. It was the first of her books I'd ever read and I fell in love. I had our school library order every single book in the series we were missing and to this day this book has left a lasting impression on me. It was a story of a girl whose family while they loved her in their own way didn't appreciate what a unique gift she had. The only one who did was an elderly Harper and upon his death the death of her talents in music came to be simply because of a strick unyeilding father. She has an accident that takes away her ability to create music because her very own mother allows it to heal wrong. So she runs and finds a world she never expected. When this book ends you're going to want to have the next one handy. It's a great book for those still young at heart or those who are young. It's not serious and it's not paranormal romance like some of the others in the series. It a story of a young girl's trials and how she survives. Nothing more nothing less."},{"Title":"Dragonsong","review":"Like other reviewers, this book was my introduction to Anne McCaffrey, I found it in my school library, no one had checked it out in years and the librarian was going to remove it from the collection. She recommended it to me because I loved \\"Little Women\\" \\"Anne of Green Gables\\" and \\"Maizon on Blue Hill\\".Like those iconic novels, this book continues a tradition of smart, funny, talented girls who have to find or make a place for themselves outside of traditional gender roles. I have also listened to the book on tape, a fabulous experience. I am 25 now and I am still a fan and owner of all of the PERN series of Anne McCaffrey's books and many of her other books.She is and was a marvelous story teller with a great sense of adventure and human nature but with the overtone of hope and hard-work trumping all. Anyone and Everyone should read this book, and this series."},{"Title":"Dragonsong","review":"A trilogy concerning a young woman's achievement over adversity. Ms. McCaffery is a wonderful story teller."},{"Title":"Dragonsong","review":"This first book about Menolly opens with her grieving at the death of the Hold Harper, an old man who encouraged her in studying and composing music. Her father and mother now crack down on her, not wanting her to \\"put herself forward\\". She injures her hand and is forbidden to play.Because she can't live without music, she slips out of the community early one morning and hides in a cave where a golden fire lizard queen has laid her eggs. This is a glorious story where ingenuity, self-sufficiency and love of music overcome the odds. The fact that Menolly makes an independent life for herself makes her a very appealing heroine. One can not imagine a better fantasy, until one reads the sequel to this book: Dragonsinger. Both are highly recommended."},{"Title":"Dragonsong","review":"Read all 3 books when published separately. Enjoyable reading for fals of the Pern stories."},{"Title":"Dragonsong","review":"I reread the Dragons of Pern series a few months ago, but didn't pick this one up until yesterday. Once I started reading, I could not put it down. It is easy to feel sorry for Mellony and her life. Having read the Dragons of Pern books, I knew how it turns out, but it still leaves you wondering HOW she will become a Harper.Many people have said they found this book confusing and that it leaves you hanging. It leaves you hanging because it is the first book in a trilogy. As for confusing, if you haven't read the main Dragons of Pern books, yes, it will be confusing. This book is not a stand-alone, but is intended to go along with what you already know. (Several main characters from the other books make appearances and one major event is relived from a different point of view.)If you haven't read most of the other Pern books, read them first. Then get this one. You won't be sorry."},{"Title":"Dragonsong","review":"This book could very well be the first SF/fantasy I ever read. It was my introduction to Pern and sent me hunting for the other books. I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Dragonsong","review":"This book was bought for my husband because it is a book series that he really enjoys. He had lost his copy so I bought him a new book. He read it right away. Finished it in 2 days."},{"Title":"Dragonsong","review":"Definitely one of the best in the Dragonriders of Pern series. I think I felt just as frustrated as Menolly when her father wouldn't let her enjoy music! Reminded me of many a narrow minded bigot I have known! I was somewhat dissappointed, however with the lack of development in Menolly's character. Her personality seemed unfocused. Perhaps the author meant to show Menolly's growth, etc... but it wound up feeling a bit confused. All in all, one of the best, though."},{"Title":"Dragonsong","review":"I like this first novel about Menolly a lot...However, much of Dragonsinger won't make sense if the reader hasn't read Dragonsong first. The novel gets somewhat bogged down in the daily life of Menolly at half circle where she's very much unappreciated and at times punished for being a musical prodigy. The pace picks up when Menolly gets caught out of the hold at threadfall, and well, I guess I shouldn't comment further to avoid spoiling the plot.This is another novel which could be fairly nice to finally see in movie form although this novel and Dragonsinger would probably need to be combined to make a feature length film."},{"Title":"Dragonsong","review":"I heard a lot of good reviews of this book and in fact it was recommended to me. I'm a fan of fantasy but this book simply doesn't appeal to me. While Menolly is supposed to be an atypical-yet-admirable heroine, I just don't think her character is strong enough. The plotline is also pretty predictable. Since the beginning it is very obvious she and the new harper would be romantically involved.I personally think this book is boring because nothing really happens in this book. Nothing exciting I'd expect from a fantasy book anyway. I'll still give the second book a shot though. Hopefully that one will be better cause I'm assuming the first volume is a sort of introduction and that's why it's going slow."},{"Title":"Dragonsong","review":"Reading Dragonsong was kind of boring, but also interesting at the same time. The chapters were too long and the homework we had was too much for the story, but I enjoyed the story. Even though homework is good for us, there is a point in which it gets to be too much. Lucily for us this book, Dragonsong, written by Anne McCaffrey was both unique and interesting. Dragonsong was a unique story with its characters and the things that happened to them. The story line was quite interesting, because Menolly lived in a cave with the dragon lizards for a while, and she spent all her time with them. It was surprising when she fell off the cliff near the middle of the story, and sad when her father beat her. When the story first began, it was quite difficult to read since we didn't know what the Threads were, but after time, it all became clear. The fact that it was a mystical story make it more interesting toread since there are not really very mouch of those types of books for selection of reading. although Dragonsong was a little unresolved, it was an extremely unique and exceptional book to read. Dragonsong was quite enjoyable because there was always a lot going on. There were few parts where it wasn't interesting, although it did have its moments. One of the parts that would keep a person's attention, would be when Menolly cuts her hand, and it gets infected from the slime of the fish. Another incident that is really interesting is when Old Uncle makes a fuss at the dinner table when the Elgion arrives. Dragonsong was quite enjoyable to read, and it would be a good book to cure anyone's boredom. In reaction to this book, Dragonsong by Anne McCaffrey, I could say that I did enjoy it. The content and excitement really catches your attention well, and I would recommend this to anyone with a desire of difference in their style or reading."},{"Title":"Dragonsong","review":"I never really liked fantasy books but I decided to try this one. It's pretty boring, I must say! Its about a girl named Menolly who likes to sing. Thats it! Its boring! I definately don't recommend it to anyone under 12."},{"Title":"Dragonsong","review":"It was exciting sometimes With the dragonriders Plus the dragon eggs hatching And the finding of the dragon eggs It was also confusing It started out in the middle of the story Also Had to many names Plus it didn't explan enough in the begging And terms it didn't explain I didn't really like it because it was to confusing but made up some of it by the exciting parts. Recomendation I don't think you should read it because it was to confusing"},{"Title":"Dragonsong","review":"I got this book assigned as a term paper for my english class and i was lookin for critisms of this book because uh, that was part of the assignment. i read a lot of the reviews of the book, and i found that even if the person gave the book a 1 or 2 star, they still said stuff like &quot;it is a exciting, imaginative book&quot; or something along those lines. it's not really exciting, but it is imaginative, i'll give it that much. I'm not a big fan of fantasy, so it's quite understandable that i didn't really like this book. It got boring pretty fast. i was interested (well kinda), but there are so many wierd names and stuff that it all gets confusing. it has some makings of a good plot, you could sorta get into the plot (well sorta)(girl has musical gifts, but higher authority doesn't permit her to play music, girl runs away, finds and befriends or &quot;impresses&quot; 9 fire lizards, almost gets killed in Thread fall but saved by dragon rider guy, goes to another place and becomes accepted as a musical genious, or something like that) but i never got into it. its probably because i kept skipping over words because it got boring. I recommend this book ONLY to those people that are interested in fantasy and escaping reality. if you are a english teacher DO NOT assign this book. It turns out that im not the only one who had to do this book for some kind of english assignment. I read a whole bunch of reviews from kids in Sacremento, in the same class i presume, and most of them didn't understand this book fully. not that i did either... but anyway i still gotta do this term paper..."},{"Title":"Dragonsong","review":"I personally did not like Dragonsong. I found the book to be farfetched and it took too much time to get to the point. I would not recommend this book to anyone unless they liked to read un realistic and uninteresting books. The only recommendation for this book is not to read it. I thought the book was drawn-out and boring. Dragonsong is an adventurous tale of a young girl living out her dream. Menolly was being adventurous by leaving her home at Half Circle Sea Hold. Another good example is when Menolly was able to care for herself adn nine other firelizards. She was kept alive by killing a wherry and was able to keep her firlizards amused by teaching them to hum along with her singing. She finally found a place to accept her for who she was and was able to live out her dream. Dragonsong is extremely imaginative. In one instance these sporelife otherwise known as &quot;Thread&quot; are able to fall thruogh space to this land called Pern and eat everything up. Another instance would be these fluing lizard like creatures called dragons whicha are able to be tamed, ridden, and trained to kill the Thread. For another example of being imaginative the riders of these dragons also known as &quot;dragonriders&quot; are able to time travel to different points in time. The only recomendation I have for this book is not to read it! It was lame!!"},{"Title":"Dragonsong","review":"In conclusion I found that Dragonsong is a well written fantasy that stretches reality and pulls you into the life of a girl on a far off place faced with all sorts of problems. I would recommend this book to anyone from fantasy lovers to people who just want a break from reality."},{"Title":"Dragonsong","review":"I think Dragonsong is a really interesting book, the author writing a mythology about the Dragon and I think this book interesting. Because the Dragon is look like a big lizard and the lizard can fly. When they are little they were so lovable. And they listen to their master's command. This book story is writing about Menolly and her life. Menolly was a good girl, she has a relly good job. Because her job in her life she was meet a lot of nover, danger things. And she has a little fire lizard queen and I think between the human and the animal has the feelings is very interesting."},{"Title":"Dragonsong","review":"In conclusion I found that Dragonsong is a well written fantasy that stretches reality and pulls you into the life of a girl on a far off place faced with all sorts of problems. I would recommend this book to anyone from fantasy lovers to people who just want a break from reality."},{"Title":"Dragonsong","review":"Whenever I get reading assignments from my English class, I always wait until the last minute to do it. It's because I think reading assignments are really boring. Like I said, this book, Dragonsong by Anne Mccaffrey was a boring story. Dragonsong was a boring story. Throughout the whole book, there weren't that much of changes nor big events. It was pretty much smooth and expoectable from beginning till the end. Like when she got her hand cut, my personal thought about the event was that soon or later, her hand will be healed and that she will be able to play her music again. Also the story was pointless and so unreal. Why would you even try to make a story about a dragon and a troubled girl's life? Even though this book Dragonsong was a boring book, there is a lesson that you can actually learn from. 'The lesson is that Don't be discouraged and be strong' I recommend this book to teenagers but not to anyone younger than 13. Because they would be confused, and will be boring for them."},{"Title":"Dragonsong","review":"Another great book from Anne Mccaffery.I loved her imagination in this book (and others) and learning about the creatures of Pern. I think that the discription of Menolly's hold was very much like a day in the life of people on earth. So if you enjoy a book that is very descriptive and heart warming I deffinitely recommend this book."},{"Title":"Dragonsong","review":"I feel that this story about Menolly and her fire lizards is fantastic! I especially liked the ending when she finally acheived her dream of being a Harper and became the first female Harper of Pern. If you love fantasy then you will like this book. If you have read this book then you must read DRAGONSINGER and DRAGONDRUMS which continue the story of Menolly and her fire lizards."},{"Title":"Dragonsong","review":"I had never enjoyed Science Fiction, until now! Anne's world of Pern is told very well in this rich and exciting story. I think the reader can relate to Menolly's craving for something more than her ordinary, boring life. I would recommend this book to anyone who is just starting to find Anne, or even the world of Science Fiction. I like to read the book, not analize it, like some other critcs of the book do. Let your self become part of Pern, and I am certian you will enjoy this amazing book."},{"Title":"Dragonsong","review":"I did homework, I think some English homework is very hard for me. some dragons can walk, some dragon cdan fly, some can run, some can swim. smoe dragon can use nose spurt fire, some can use nose spurt water. some dragons wing is big, some are small, some dragons live in land, some live in ocean. some dragon are big, some are small. some dragons eat bugs, some eat animals. The dragons has egg, they has dragon children. I think DragonSong is very long story, I want cry because I can not understand so. I think DragonSong not interesting."},{"Title":"Dragonsong","review":"Dragonsong by Anne McCaffrey was an interesting and unresolved book.I feel this book was interesting because I have never read a book with this type of plot. Another thing that helped with the plot is its setting, which I have also never read about. The idea of dragons and Threadfall really compels the reader to keep reading further. A very strong area of the book was that support from the characters helped a lot to set the tone, atmosphere and life in the book In addition, the notion of Impressing a dragon really grabs your attention and imagination. The world that is set before us is very detailed, which helps give it a more realistic feel. Another issue that grabbed my attention was that everybody in Dragonsong all knew their place in society and what was expected of them. This has to be the most interesting book that I have read in a long time; I enjoyed the book tremendously. For example, there was no real closure to the story, which was its weakest area. And to make it worse, you started out with not enough background to the story. In the story itself, we never learn if the main character, Menoily, ever becomes a Master Harper And we also don't learn of Yanus's reaction to Menolly playing at the end of the story. Another important issue in another area is that we never learn what happens to the fire-Lizards after the story. And another example would be is we aren't told how the Sea-Hold will react to the existence of fire-Lizards. These are the main reasons that make me believe that this is an unresolved book. I feel this book was a excellent book. Even though it was confusing at times, in the end it was quite clear. I'd really recommend this book to everybody, most people if feel will enjoy this book. It is well worth your time, energy and money."},{"Title":"Dragonsong","review":"David I do not like homework. At home, I have better things to do, so I do all my homework in Study Hall or Algebra class first period. However, unlike usual homework assignments, I enjoyed the Dragonsong story, making the homework not as tedious a job as it normally would have been. I actually was persuaded to and did some of the work at home. However, Dragonsong by Anne McCaffrey was both entertaining and confusing. Dragonsong is a very confusing book with the use of a new, created language. The language is laced with English, making comprehension of the book difficult at times. Two examples of many are cities and towns, which are called Holds in the book. When beginning to read Dragonsong, this confuses the reader and makes it difficult to understand. However, once adjusted to the use of different words to represent common items and places, the story progresses at a rapid and more enjoyable pace. This enthralls the reader, making them crave for more of the enchanting story. Confusion overcome, the entertainment level created by reading Dragonsong surpasses the majority of the novel on the market today. With Dragonsong, the reader is able to imagine the occurrences in the book, rather than watch it on a television screen, as seen by someone else. The reader is able to create a vivid picture in their mind. Also, with the help of some pictures depicting the characters in the book, the reader's imagination can imagine their pictures more clearly. This ability to picture the story in the reader's head as it is expanded upon allows for the complete experience a novel should offer. Dragonsong was fun to read due to its attention to detail of the characters and their actions. Although quite confusing at times, the storyline and characters, whom the reader will undoubtedly grow fond of, makes up for this slight drawback. All aspects considered, Dragonsong by Anne McCaffrey is a captivating book I feel all adventurous people will enjoy."},{"Title":"Dragonsong","review":"Dragonsong, by Anne McCaffrey is unique. The uniqueness of Dragonsong came from the fact that the events of Pern were fresh and imaginative. The book went aside from a normal fantasy novel and took a different turn. The dialouge and ideas were all very unique from the Threadfall, to the terms they used like 'turn' and 'hold.' The harper system was a new idea and how sacred the music was to the people. Dragonsong was not your run-on-the-mill sci-fi book, but turned aside and made definite gold in a unique sort of way. Dragonsong was also a very interesting story. It makes you want to keep reading and find out what happens to Menolly and the other characters. I never wanted to put the book down, and was actually disappointed when the lunch bell rang and I had to leave the book in my locker instead of finish it right there. Not many books contain the imaginative aspect of Dragonsong. I respect this book for that. Sometimes reading is very interesting, other times it is boring, but if you can find a good topic, chances are you'll enjoy reading a book. I had no idea what Dragonsong was, but figured I'd like it becuase I like big lizards. I was pleasantly suprised with Dragonsong as it captured my attention. To conclude, Dragonsong by Anne McCaffrey is unique and interesting. I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys sci-fi adventure. Some people might find it boring, but I found it somewhat interesting. I hope more people can enjoy the works of Anne McCaffrey, as it pleased me."},{"Title":"Dragonsong","review":"I enjoyed the book Dragonsong by Anne McCaffry. It was a very interesting story. I would definitely recommend this book to kids in high school. They would probably enjoy it. Dragonsong is very exciting. It has many different events that catch the reader's attention. It has a lot of action. For instance, when Menolly runs from Thread. Another example is when the fire lizards finally get tame, and Menolly is able to hold them. It is cool when the fire lizards think that the people are hurting Menolly, and they try protect her from them. Another example that I thought was pretty cool was when the Dragonrider picked Menolly up and saved her from Thread. Another thing that I enjoyed about Dragonsong is that it was extremely detailed. I especially like the part where the book tells you about the new born fire lizards. It describes how the lizards neatly pecked the spiderclaws behind the eyes, killing them instantly. Dragonsong was very good at detail. It halps describe all of the scenes. I like how it describes Thread as kind of silvery and shiny, and how it kind of resembles spider web floating in the air, eating up anything in its path. Another incident that I liked and thought was detailed was when the fire lizards fought Thread. There were flashes of fire in the air, singeing Thread as it flew across the sky. I believe that the homework that was given on the book Dragonsong was fairly decent and easy, because all that we did was read. Although sometimes it was boring, it sped back up before you could put the book away. Even though homework can be boring at times, it gives you a great advantage in the long run. It also exercises your brain, to help you remember your school work. I believe that homework is very time consuming, but it is extremely mandatory. Dragonsong, written by Anne McCafferey was both interesting and very exciting."},{"Title":"Dragonsong","review":"Dragonsong is a confusing story telling of many people. It was confusing when Menolly named all her fire lizards, because trying to remember which one was which was hard. Also the book was confusing when they told the story of Brekke and what happened to her. Another example was trying to understand how important impressing a fire lizard was for Brekke. It was confusing at first but then it became a little more clear near the end.I think the book Dragonsong teaches about life. How unfair it can be, yet how enjoyable it can be. I think I look at life a little different now since reading the book. But I would only recommend it if you have lots of patience to try and understand it. Also if you really enjoy fiction."},{"Title":"Dragonsong","review":"I enjoy reading good books, so when I read Anne McCaffrey's Dragonsong, I thought it was a confusing book, which brought new ideas to our mind. Dragonsong can be a confusing book. Things such as Thread falls can become confusing. Something never heard of before. Falling organisms that destroy everything that they come into contact with, except for bodies of water. Paying attention to all of the new names can become quite difficult also. These names such as Menolly, Mavi, and Yanis are all complictated. This happens with all of the new, fictional concepts that people have never thought about before. I think that this book was very magical. You are forced to use your imaginatio, picturing the dragons. I would recommend this book to to a person who enjoys reading fanticies. It is a well written book and interesting book."},{"Title":"Dragonsong","review":"First off, fire lizards are cool. Smart, flying lizards are cool in general. They would also help with feral cat problems, I reckon.This is the story of an outcast young musician girl, who loses her sponsor, ends up wandering, meets some fire lizards, does some good work and ends up living at a much groovier weyr."},{"Title":"Dragonsong","review":"The picaresque novel is usually satirical with humor and realistic details. It follows the adventures of a roguish hero of low social class who lives (by his or her wits) in a corrupt society.Dragonsong is a fantasy (as opposed to realistic) picaresque novel, with little in the way of satire or humor. Menolly is socially outcast, a tomboy of her culture, and she does have adventures rebelling against the expectations set for her in life. If you can't identify with Menolly, you can't get into the story.Menolly found a place in my heart, near Aerin from Robin McKinley's \\"The Hero and The Crown.\\" She is a creatively repressed teenager in a society based around dragonweyrs. Menolly is also the sole developed character in the entire work, and she experiences peaks of sadness and joy, freedom and heartache. No great crisis grips McCaffery's Pern, instead we get to watch Menolly grow up and change her life, not always voluntarily. Dragonsong has firelizards and a bit of dragons, but the story isn't about them.Read the first twenty pages. If you don't like Menolly, find another book to read."},{"Title":"Dragonsong","review":"Dragon Song was a great book. I first read it in the 9th grade in englsih class.

Since then I have read widely of devotional writers and devotional classics, including Henri Nouwen, Richard Foster, Thomas Merton, Emilie Griffin, Annie Dillard, Kathleen Norris and more. I always come back to the Bensons' book like an old faithful friend. Many of the devotional writers I have come to love I first read their quotes in Disciplines. This guide to prayer has broadened and deepened my devotional and spiritual life over a decade and a half. I had the great privilege of hearing Bob Benson preach in his later years, and being personal friends of Mike Benson, I can say that the authors are men of depth and integrity. I cannot recommend this book too heartily. It belongs in every devotional collection."},{"Title":"Disciplines for the inner life","review":"Lots of books have been written on the &quot;spiritual disciplines.&quot; But very few, if any, have been written with the breadth, depth, and intellectual stimulation as well as personal/spiritual edification that &quot;Disciplines for the Inner Life&quot; contains. The late Dr Bob Benson Sr, along with his son, Michael W. Benson, offer english-speaking Christians a volume which is bound to become a classic.All the bases are covered in this volume: Section One deals with Disciplines for the Inner Journey, covering such topics as &quot;Addressing God,&quot; &quot;Solitude&quot; &quot;Making Moments&quot; &quot;Silence&quot; &quot;Petition&quot; &quot;Journaling&quot; and thirteen other disciplines in this section alone.Section Two, &quot;Obstacles to the Inner Life&quot; speaks poignantly and clearly to the &quot;every day-ness&quot; of our existence. We encounter such issues as &quot;Guidance&quot; &quot;Time Management&quot; &quot;Distractions&quot; &quot;Doubts&quot;, &quot;Place&quot; and &quot;God's Absence&quot;, plus several others.Section Three clearly guides us through &quot;Patterns for Living Inwardly.&quot; The authors help us discover the riches of &quot;The Lord's Prayer&quot; &quot;The Lord's Supper&quot; &quot;The Beatitudes&quot; &quot;The Parables&quot; &quot;The Jesus Prayer.&quot; The richness of this section is well worth the price of the book all by itself.SEction four, &quot;Inward Graces of the Centered Life&quot; calls us to a place of discovering just how we can &quot;center&quot; our lives on the things that really have eternal importance. Eight inward graces are addressed in this chapter, and when you buy the book, you will find out what they are!Section Five provides the perfect climax to a volume of this magnitude. The Christian's &quot;Outward Fruit of the Inner Life&quot; is covered and explained in a beautiful, yet gripping manner. We understand more clearly the meaning of &quot;Service&quot; &quot;Growth&quot; &quot;Liberty&quot; &quot;Priority&quot; &quot;Awareness&quot; and &quot;Celebration&quot; plus three other graces.If you are looking for a volume that offers a simple, this is &quot;how-to-do&quot; for the Spiritual life, then this volume is not for you. If you sincerely want to discover the Spiritual Disciplines from their aesthetic, historical, and reflective angles, this get this book, by all means.Every Christian should have a copy of this book!"},{"Title":"Disciplines for the inner life","review":"This book has been a continual inspiration and source of God's voice to me.

Disciplines uses a weekly format, including a 2-part reading schedule (1 part for use, and 1 for reading through the Bible in a year), and writings from classic Christian writers through the centuries. Like others, I have started reading many authors after reading their words in Disciplines. The heart is grabbed, the brain is engaged, and God speaks to you every day. My only negative is that there is no sequel, although it is similar to a Guide to Prayer for Ministers and Other Servants, an excellent book from the Upper Room."},{"Title":"Disciplines for the inner life","review":"Disciplines for the Inner Life is a great tool for understanding scripture. I have used mine so much that it is worn thin. The book gives scripture, prayers, and insight into understanding God's word. It is full of insight and writings that couple with scripture to get the reader to think. It ministers to your heart, head, and soul. It challenges you to dig deeper into God's word. Excellent book. It could well be the best gift you could ever give. If you cannot find copies I have a box of brand new ones that I will sell at a very reasonable price. I had ordered some 50 copies to hand out during my ministry travels. I have several left if anyone is interested.Melinda Clements"},{"Title":"Disciplines for the inner life","review":"I love this book. I've come back to it over and over as a tool for my devotions.

It encourages a deep study of the Word, then provides companion material written by respected Christian theologians and many others.

It has been life-changing for me, challenging me to a more intimate walk with the Father."},{"Title":"Disciplines for the inner life","review":"Disciplines for the Inner Life's usefulness has outlived its publication. The only place to get new copies is Michael Benson, one of the authors and the chaplain at Olivet University in IL.But the book, modeled after Job's \\"A Gudie For Prayer\\" books from the Upper Room, is excellent. 52 weekly chapters, each with scriptures, prayers, a hymn and writings around a common theme are wonderful. The writings are best. They highlight the theme each week, and are taken from 2000 years fo Christian writers- people you know and people you don't- in fact, I have met over 20 authors here and gone on to read their source or other works after reading them.The book takes you through the disciplines, distractions, fruits and models of a Christian life and makes the year much more God-filled than many other resources.

I especially don't like when they have dates at the top of the page to tell you exactly what pace you are to go. The thing I like the most about this one is that it is mostly scripture. My girfriends and I are using it in our small group Bible study. When we discuss each chapter, we usually don't ever get past the scripture... which is great. Some of the readings with each chapter are weighty, requiring a second reading and making you think past the surface. Since this book is out of print... we all ordered used from Amazon. Love it!"},{"Title":"Disciplines for the inner life","review":"I have spent a small fortune on devotion guides in my 50+ years and this is absolutely the BEST guide I have ever found.

First, \\"Heavy Metal Guitar Tricks\\" is divided in five parts: The left hand, Sound Effects, Two handed Techniques, The Whammy Bar and the last one is called Picking techniques and other tricks.The great thing is at the end of each chapter, there's one solo which uses the techniques you just learn in that section. So that way you can apply your kwowledge in a stand alone solo.The authors say this is a book for players of all levels, but I guess is more apropiated for guitarist who have a previous experience with the instrument. So, there are techniques like Hammer-on or Pull-off that I'm sure you play them fairly well, but is great to take some time to play perfect, so it's not a waste of time.The two sections that surprised me were \\"Two Handed techniques\\" and \\"The Whammy bar\\". If you want to know how Randy Rhoads played the \\"Crazy train\\" and \\"Over the mountain\\" solos, you really have to check the \\"Reverse right hand Bending\\" it's amazing! Also, if you want to know how Satriani, EVH and Vai do those great sounds with the bar, you have to read this chapter. All you need is a guitar equiped with a locking tremolo system (F.Rose, Ibanez, Khaler, etc)One of the things I really liked is that you have to use the CD included because you need to hear the examples before and then play them on the guitar. That's a great way of ear training.I know this book will take your playing to other level, and there are some techniques that I haven't seen in other book or magazine. So I can tell you this is a great book !!!"},{"Title":"Heavy Metal Guitar Tricks","review":"This book is more a survey of guitar tricks than anything. You'll receive a very basic overview of several different tricks like raking, harmonics and whammy bar use, but you won't find a lot of details or depth to the material presented.The teaching material is very brief, generally only few sentences for each trick. Having worked through Stetina's \\"Speed Mechanics for Lead Guitar,\\" I was also accustomed to having lots of examples to practice along with to really drive home the new material. Unfortunately, you'll only find an example or two for each new idea presented.Overall, this will wet your pallete to dig a little deeper into the tricks presented here, but it will by no means give you more than a \\"101\\" level understanding."},{"Title":"Heavy Metal Guitar Tricks","review":"The title of this book is perfect. It is about squeals, whammy bar moves, two-handed tapping, and more. Starting out basic, it covers metal techniques from hammer-ons and pull-offs all the way to tremolo flutters and more. The example solos do not have a backing band, so they are a bit empty; I think that a little more time could have been put into showing useful examples of the tricks, but it's good enough (especially for the price!)"},{"Title":"Heavy Metal Guitar Tricks","review":"I bought this book thinking that Im going to learn the tricks of the trade about making unique sounds, As i was led to believe that this book has it all, As it was marketed for beginners aswell as advance players. Now Ive been playing guitar for over 15 years. Upon receiving this book and taking a brief glance at it. I realised that i must be a better player than Steve Vai, as I already knew every thing that this book had to offer.In Brief:If your starting to play guitar or just learning lead guitar, this book is great.. But if youve been playing for a while or you are in a band, dont waste your time with this book."},{"Title":"Animal Counting Book (A Little Golden Book)","review":"This book and Dr. Seuss's The Cat in the Hat are my two-year-old son's favorite books. They are almost always the two selections for bedtime. He usually requires that I sing The Animal Counting Book using Barney's melody (one episode of Barney has an \\"Over in the Meadow\\" song). My son assists by saying aloud the number and type of animals(e.g., one beaver, two fishes, etc.). I'm sorry to see that the book is no longer very accessible. My copy is from my own childhood."},{"Title":"Mel Bay You Can Teach Yourself Dulcimer","review":"Last week, I bought a fretted dulcimer in Meadows of Dan, Virginia because it had a wormy chestnut top tooled from a local barn. It has a sweet voice and I was anxious to begin playing immediately. However, I didn't want to get started with any bad habits--so I looked over about 20 books on dulcimer playing and chose this for several reasons. 1. The author starts with simple songs and builds technique with them. For instance, there are four versions of Bile Them Cabbage Down at the beginning. The first explores single string melody, the second, single string harmony, the third and fourth have chordal fingerings. Most of the tunes in this book are in the public domain, but the arrangements are thoughtful and sound nice as well as build technique. 2. There are several tunes with tab and music for dulcimer duets. This is something I wanted to explore and glad I did. 3. The directions are very clear, plus there are insightful notes for fingering some of the measures. 4. A comapnion CD is available, which is great to listen to or play along with. 5. There are instructions for strumming and fingerpicking. It's been one week and I am already playing melody, harmony, and chords to three songs. By the time I've worked through this book, I expect to have solid technique for fingering and be able to play duets with another dulcimer player. I definitely would seek out a workshop with the author of this book! Thanks for such a great book Madeline! :) Mary Z.

This books' lessons, excercises and songs gradually add to the student's skills. The book's discussions of (a) fingering techniques is satisfying, and (b) chords and fingerpicking are strong introductions. In an absolute rating, I'd give this book 4 stars, but others have given the other two books 5 stars, and this deserves and equal or higher rating."},{"Title":"Mel Bay You Can Teach Yourself Dulcimer","review":"This is the best of three books that I purchased to learn the Dulcimer. It is well written and organized. I'm in the middle of learning, but this book appears to take you from the beginning to an intermediate stage.

I went to private lessons, but wasn't happy with what I was learning. I got this book along with the companion DVD (you need the DVD if you really want to learn properly) and I couldn't have been happier. The DVD showed me how to hold and strum the dulcimer properly, and how to arrange my fingers on the frets. Once begun with this set, I have never looked back. Madeline is very clear and has the songs arranged in perfect learning order. Even though I've been playing for two years now, I still play tunes from this book.

I am now ready for more, based on the grounding I recieved from this book."},{"Title":"Mel Bay You Can Teach Yourself Dulcimer","review":"The book is good. When you tune the dulcimer you might want to get some long tones on a tape and tune it, from a piano or I used a trumpet transposed to the key of C.

He sees his mother as a tool to use in furthering the empire's goal of eliminating the Skolian Empire enemy, the Aristos. Desperate, she in a bid for freedom from her overbearing, manipulative son, Roca flees into space, but ends up stranded on the backwater planet, Skyfall.Local ruling bard Eldrison captures Roca He takes his sky fallen prisoner to an isolated sanctuary. However, he soon finds himself enthralled with his prisoner. She quickly becomes his advisor and ultimately his spouse. As he teaches her to trust, she shows him what a woman can be when love allows her to soar.SKYFALL is a stand alone entertaining since fiction romance that focuses on a clash of cultures between a highly advanced race and a more primitive people. Fans of Catherine Asaro must realize that this tale may be set in the same galaxy as her classic tales, but is quite different when compared with her previous Saga of the Skolian Empire works as this tale is a bit thin in terms of the physics that turn her thrillers into action packed cerebral gems. Still this warm tale of love between diverse cultures is another winner from one of the best writers the genre offers.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Skyfall (Saga of the Skolian Empire)","review":"Basically the story of Roca and Eldrin, fleshing in the story of the older generation of Clan Skolia.Almost superficial at times, you really never feel engaged with the protagonists.Worth the read for die hard Skolian fans, but definitely not Asaro's best effort."},{"Title":"Skyfall (Saga of the Skolian Empire)","review":"this book was written in 2003 but back in 1999 my guitar player and i wrote several songs for a future album called \\"events of the ninth skyfall sequence\\" and was to be another prequel to our current 2 albums. the band broke up before we could finish writing or begin recording this album in 1999. really weird to me...lol the book is the ninth in the sequence and is a prequel to all the others, thats heavy!"},{"Title":"Skyfall (Saga of the Skolian Empire)","review":"As a fan of the series, this installment was rather light and not as complex or full of the confusing science fiction jargon that most readers have a hard time understanding. This would be a great book to start with for those who have never read Catherine Asaro. In the prequel, Asaro gives us more background information or fleshes out the characters that helped establish The Ruby Dynasty, a family of psions who have the one advantage over their Eubian adversaries and that is acess to the web. It is this one advantage that keeps them from being completely destroyed. Roca and Eldri's romance is more in the forefront and the politics that so dominates the series as with the previous books plays a minor role here. We do learn more about Kurj and his relationship to his mother and the demons that continue to plague him along with his strenous relationship with his step-father, Edldri. I did like this book overall but wanted more depth, more complexity to the story that was presented here. For those readers who have never read Asaro, this would be the book to start with and for those who are already familar with the history of the Ruby Dynasty will learn nothing new in this book. I do look forward to TRIAD and hope it is a book with more depth and intrigue and suspense, all that was missing in this installment. My grade, C+."},{"Title":"Skyfall (Saga of the Skolian Empire)","review":"Not up to her usual standards. Barely got through it. Usually buy without seeing reviews. Love her other works a lot. Seems like a first novel, a poor first novel. Don't waste your money or if you must buy it used."},{"Title":"Skyfall (Saga of the Skolian Empire)","review":"Skyfall (2003) is the ninth novel in the Skolian Imperialate series, but is the first in internal sequence. Around 4000 BC, a group of humans were transported from Earth by aliens to the planet Raylicon and, over the next twelve centuries, built an interstellar empire. This empire was ruled by the Ruby Dynasty, a line of empaths and telepaths. They achieved a level of technology that was capable of rearranging solar systems and of modifying the genetic structure of their colonists. The collapse of the Ruby Empire left the colonies isolated from Raylicon.After more than four millennia, the Raylicons began to regain their lost technology and reattained interstellar flight in 1843 AD. Shortly thereafter, genetic experiments by Doctor Hezahr Rhon created a new breed of psions, the Aristos, who could receive but not transmit. Moreover, these Aristos experienced pleasure when receiving the pain of others. The Aristos separated themselves into a new polity, the Eubian Concord, and started conquering Raylicon planets and enslaving the populations.In 1904 AD, Lahaylia Selei founded the Imperialate in opposition to the Eubian Aristos and activated an ancient Lock to restore the Kyle interstellar web, thereby giving the Skolians the huge advantage of instantaneous communications. After two centuries of reigning as the Pharoah and sole Ruby psion of the Imperialate, Lahaylia found and married another Ruby psion, Jarac, who activated a second Lock to increase the power and scope of the Kyle web. Jarac became the Imperator, the commander of all Imperialate armed forces. Their marriage produced two daughters, Dyhianna and Roca.In this novel, in 2203 AD, three centuries after the founding of the Imperialate, Roca is trying to evade the agents of her son Kurj in order to return to Parthonia for the debate and vote on invading the Platinum Sectors. The Eubians have brashly taken over the entire region against the prior claims of the Imperialate and the metals in those sectors are urgently needed to maintain Imperialate technology. Roca is against the invasion plans. However, Kurj has her proxy and is determined to keep her from attending the session so that he can use her votes to support the proponents of the invasion. Kurj has been so warped by his mistreatment by his abusive stepfather and by later experiences with the sadistic Eubians that he is totally opposed to any accommodation with the Eubians. Moreover, he will do anything to protect his mother, even if she doesn't want him to do so.In her flight, Roca is stranded on Capsize, an antiquated spaceport that doesn't even have foul weather guidance systems. Her only transportation is a rusty bucket of bolts that looks like it can't get off the ground unassisted. However, it holds together long enough to take her to Skyfall, where she should be able to transfer to another ship going in the right direction.Her first glimpse of Skyfall is captivating; it has blue clouds in a lavender sky. The grasses propagate by releasing bubbles that float away on the breeze. The local inhabitants reside in a storybook castle.Unfortunately, the reality is somewhat less picturesque: the water contains harmful chemicals and the castle is necessary for protection from raiding neighbors; however, the grass is benign. The Allied administrator, who is the entire staff of the spaceport, is friendly and makes her comfortable. She learns that Skyfall is a low tech world with a feudal-like society. Although the Allied Worlds of Earth have claimed the world, it is obviously an ancient colony of the Ruby Empire. As they are talking, a crowd of locals ride up on their animals and surround the port house. In the ensuing conversation, the locals get excited, their leader Eldri lifts her up onto his lyrine, and the whole party gallops away.Eldri is a strong psion, probably with Ruby Dynasty genes. Her first glimpse of him floods her mind with his feelings and thoughts. Although he doesn't know what is happening, he too receives her feelings and an inkling of her thoughts. They are immediately infatuated with each other, but Roca forces him to behave and almost talks him into returning her to the port. However, his charming personality and the Ruby pheromones overcome her resistance to the point that she agrees to ride with him to his home and return the following day. Unfortunately, his castle is located in the nearby mountains and the weather turns to snow. Lots of snow. So much snow that she misses the supply ship for which she is waiting. Now she is stranded on Skyfall for at least a year.Meanwhile, back on the Orbiter, the mobile command post of the Imperialate armed forces, Kurj is quietly going crazy over his mother's disappearance. He knows that she has fled because of his actions and he is desperately hoping that she has not come to any harm. He has all available intelligence resources searching for her and he himself spends hours at a time in the web checking obscure databases for references to her. Unfortunately, his mother was a famous dancer even before she became a high level politician and the sheer number of references is overwhelming.In this story, Roca and Eldri fall in love and, despite her nanomeds, she becomes pregnant. Then a local enemy lays siege to Windward, Eldri's castle. Moreover, Eldri is having grand mal seizures which are coming at more frequent intervals and threaten his life.This story starts slowly, but builds momentum to the point that the ending seems to flash by in an instance. The politics is frustrating, since it impels characters in unnatural directions. However, the call to duty is finally beat into subservience and the Skolia family members stop tormenting themselves over ideology. While the ending is not entirely a happy one, there is reconciliation, acceptance and rapport.Highly recommended for Asaro fans and for anyone else who enjoys tales of couples overcoming their own misconceptions and environmental obstacles to achieve happiness within a complex society.-Arthur W. Jordin"},{"Title":"Skyfall (Saga of the Skolian Empire)","review":"Catherine Asaro cannot make up her mind. I am sure from her point of view it keeps her from being bored. I prefer the science fiction side of her writing, but I admit, I liked this romance. It filled in some past/future gaps in the ongoing Skolian story and, unlike The Radiant Seas, was an easy read. But still the characters did not always ring true to themselves as described in other novels, especially Eldri. I had a hard time believing him to be so impulsive and hot-headed as a young man. The character's edges were not as hard and sharp as they were in Primary Inversion. The intensity of the Rhon connection that I felt with other Asaro lovers like Soz and Jai, Vryl and Kamoj, or Althor and Tina, was missing. This story is tamer. If this is your first time with Catherine Asaro's Skolian Sagas it is a sweeter, softer place to start. But my personal favorite will always be Primary Inversion. Forget having babies, I love it when the Skolian women kick ...."},{"Title":"Skyfall (Saga of the Skolian Empire)","review":"First, the good part. I love Asaro's science fiction ideas and her descriptions of alien worlds. Her descriptions of the planet Lyshriol (aka Skyfall) are always wonderful.However, at its heart, the novel Skyfall is little more than a cliche romance story. Worse, it follows a worn-out romantic plot that I've always found insulting: woman is forcibly kidnapped and held against her will, and then falls in love with her kidnapper and comes to identify with him and his world. Can we say Stockholm Syndrome?Asaro excuses this behavior with some of her nifty science fiction: that the people with Rhon genes are irresistibly attracted to one another (which also accounts for Kurj's rather tiresome Oedipus complex, one assumes). This explanation has shown up in a number of her books. Even with a reasonably sci-fi explanation, though, this particular plot is always guaranteed to get my hackles up.There are some fun political machinations going on in this novel. The scenes dealing with Kurj's origins, history, and tragic choices are terrific, and demonstrate how desperate (and amoral) the Skolians are to protect themselves from their enemies, the Aristos.But, sadly, there's just not enough of the nifty science fiction that originally drew me to Asaro's work. The main emphasis in this book is the Roca/Eldrinson romance. It doesn't help that Roca Skolia is the most perfect, understanding, stunningly beautiful woman in the whole entire universe and everyone wants her. I doubt this woman has ever had a bad hair day in her life. *G*Roca never is more than mildly annoyed and bemused at Eldinson's initial kidnapping of her, or the fact that he basically keeps her prisoner for quite a while. She's an empath, so of course she can feel that he's really a nice guy who didn't mean any harm. So hey, why not allow her pheromone-based attraction to grow? Bleah. Much too big an overload of romance fantasy cliches.This book definitely falls into the \\"Futuristic Romance\\" category, rather than science fiction. If it hadn't been part of Asaro's Skolian Empire series, bookstores probably would have shelved it in the romance section.It's a tribute to Asaro's writing that I even bothered to finish reading the novel. Like I said, I love her alien worlds, and her science fiction. But then I returned Skyfall to the library. This is the first of Asaro's Skolian Empire books that I haven't bothered to buy."},{"Title":"Skyfall (Saga of the Skolian Empire)","review":"In this chilly prequel the extraordinary Catherine Asaro takes us back to How It All Began.Roca, on the lam from her son Kurj, who's trying to ignite hostilities between the Traders and the Skolians while Roca's trying to prevent them, ends up on a low-tech backwater planet, Lyshriol (where part of story related in \\"The Quantum Rose\\" will take place), and the next thing you know she's carried off to a castle by the \\"barbarian\\" Eldrinson, who Roca quickly realizes is a powerful \\"psion.\\" You don't have to have read any of the other books to guess what's going to happen next.But this is a Catherine Asaro book and as always she can take the most hackneyed of situations and make something fresh from them.The treat here is not what happens, or when; but how. That's where the suprises come in.The last third of the book, which takes place mostly back in the high tech Skolian Empire with a bit of crosscutting, is emotionally wrenching and the climax is no bed of roses. As usual with Catherine, there's hardly a wasted word in the book's 307 pages (plus appendixes)."},{"Title":"Skyfall (Saga of the Skolian Empire)","review":"Asaro created a cast of likable, believable, sympathetic characters; deep, textured worlds; and well thought political tension. I could do without the romance, but it's not so pervasive as to ruin the story."},{"Title":"Skyfall (Saga of the Skolian Empire)","review":"I love this book. I'm almost halfway and I can't put the book down. I've read all the other 8 6 or comething books before this one and its nice to finally read the story about Roca and Eldrinson."},{"Title":"Skyfall (Saga of the Skolian Empire)","review":"Catherine Asaro is my favorite modern SciFi writer and this book is no exception. Though lighter in science than most of the series, it is still a fun read that lets you in on the softer side of Roca Skolia. I would rate the book itself at four stars.The reason I marked this book as only three stars is because of the Kindle format. Instead of displaying the reading-friendly, nicely spaced lines that you usually see on the Kindle, this edition looks exactly like the paperback version of this book. (I know, because I own the paperback.) While it is sometimes nice to preserve some of the unique look of a hard copy book, in this case it does the text a disservice; the words and lines are so closely spaced together that it is difficult to read in a way that defeats many of the characteristics I enjoy about the Kindle display. I wonder if this is the dreaded Topaz format that receives so many low marks in Kindle discussion forums.That said, I'm thrilled to see another of Asaro's books available for the Kindle. I already own almost all of her Skolia books in hard copy, and I would also like to collect them for my Kindle because they are books that I re-read regularly."},{"Title":"Skyfall (Saga of the Skolian Empire)","review":"I'm sorry to have to say this, since I love Asaro's other Skolian Empire novels, so in contrast this was almost unbelievably boring. En route to Parthonia, Roca gets accidentally stranded on Lyshriol, is kidnapped by barbarians, falls in love, and spends a winter stuck in Eldrinson's castle. That's the bulk of the novel.Since Asaro has apparently decided to go back and pull an Episode I-III on parts of her own universe, I was hoping we'd get some explanation as to why an incredibly famous, nearly 60-year-old dancer/Imperial princess/politician would fall in love with a hick who's literally young enough to be her kid on a planet where most people aren't even aware the rest of the universe exists. The answer is that he's really, REALLY, hot.I was also hoping for some interesting information about Lyshriol. In later novels (not published later in real life, but occurring later in the series timeline) it's implied that the original Ruby Empire set up the planet and genetically engineered its residents to be human computers who could connect to the Kyle web/psiberweb without machinery. The setting of this novel would have been the perfect opportunity to flesh out that idea and provide the Skolian characters with more clues about that lost history. Unfortunately we don't learn much about Lyshriol except that everything on it is pretty pastel colours, e.g. blue snow (no word on WHY this blue pigment is in everything, either). I really wish she'd left the lyrines out, as I outgrew interest in My Little Pony a long time ago.I'm giving this three stars instead of two because the parts that don't take place on Lyshriol are absolutely fascinating. We get to meet Dyhianna and Roca's colossal mother Lahaylia, who escaped from slavery to the Aristos, lived three centuries, and set up an empire to rival her former masters'. We get more information on how Skolian government works, as a half-democracy, half-monarchy, with a strong matriarchal tradition. And since Roca got into this mess in the first place by trying to evade her eldest son...we get more glimpses into the dark, furious, incestuous labyrinth of Kurj Skolia's psyche.Unfortunately, since this takes place during an uneasy detente with the Eubian Concord, this book is missing one of my favourite aspects of Asaro's hard SF: the cool space battles at relativistic speeds. I really wish someone would make a computer game where you could have that kind of combat.Recommendation: borrow this book from your public library, skim the boring bits."},{"Title":"Skyfall (Saga of the Skolian Empire)","review":"Well written, filling in important information about the Ruby Dynasty and how it was reinvigorated. Also provides background about characters who have a more central role in stories that have already been published.Most of the series I read develop chronologically. Asaro succeeds in writing stories out of chronological sequence so that I can get fully involved with the characters and plot even though I already know what will happen to them. One thing I notice in this and other books that move back in time (e.g., Schism) is that she develops characters whom I have already met without excessively repeating old information or contradicting it."},{"Title":"Skyfall (Saga of the Skolian Empire)","review":"This stand-alone novel is part of The Saga of the Skolian Empire. For fans familiar with the storyline, Skyfall tells the tale of how Roca meets Eldrinson [have you ever wondered how improbable that meeting must have been?]. For those of you unfamiliar with The Skolian Empire Saga, this is not a bad place to start. Way into our future, the story goes, humanity reaches the stars only to discover that we are already there. Supposedly, a very long time ago, some ancient race took a sampling of humans from Earth then seeded them elsewhere, then disappeared, leaving humans stranded and having to grow their own societies independent of outside aid. One of these cultures now calls itself the Skolian Empire. Though they are ruled by an Assembly, the strength of that Assembly is in Skolian royalty. Ruby Dynasty psions have strong psychic powers. They run an unmatched and instantaneous interplanetary communications system (the Kyle Web) that keeps their empire strong. The problem is there are very few Ruby psions and breeding them is a challenge for even the greatest geneticists.Roca is the daughter of Lahaylia Selei (Ruby Pharaoh) and Imperator Jarac [Skolian Empire fans know her as the mother of Soz, Kelric, and others]. Being that Roca is an Imperial princess who travels the stars the way we travel the highways, one can only wonder how it was she ever met a quiet man from the backworld planet of Lyshriol [Eldrinson calls the place Lyshriol, but prior to inclusion in the greater galactic society, outsiders just called that weigh-station Skyfall]. And so in this book we have the romantic meeting of two Rhon minds [one is reminded of the fireworks between Sauscony and Jabriol in PRIMARY INVERSION].So--just how do Roca and Eldrinson meet? Serendipitously, of course. Roca's grown son Kurj from her first marriage wants to go to war with their enemy the Trader Aristos--it's the age-old tale of territorial dispute--but he doesn't hold enough votes to the Assembly to sway the decision in his favor . . . but his mother does. Only problem: Roca will vote against going to war. Now Kurj loves his mother but he does want her where she can't cast those votes. Roca doesn't catch on soon enough, and when she does, events fall against her getting back to the Assembly in time to keep Kurj from using her votes supposedly in her name. In her rush to get back, Roca covers her trail from Kurj's Imperial security and takes a little known route. Then more events fall against her, trapping her on Skyfall/Lyshriol for many months. By the time Kurj finally tracks her down, more events have been set in motion (love, for instance) and Roca has another battle ahead of her with the Assembly and her family: that of getting them to accept the fact that she wants to be married to a nobody (who is also a lost link to the ancient Ruby dynasty).This is a nice love story with intriguing twists and action. Though classed as romantic science-fiction, neither the romance nor the science-fiction are over-played. It's a simple tale and an easy read. I recommend it most for Skolian Empire fans who like to get the entire story about the Ruby Dynasty. For pure entertainment, however, I think Asaro's PRIMARY INVERSION plus THE RADIANT SEAS offers more."},{"Title":"Excursions","review":"This is not a book for the first-time or even second-time reader of Thoreau, but for Thoreau fans, especially those familiar with the Princeton University Press edition of the Writings of Henry David Thoreau, the publication of this book is an event. The Princeton series, for those not familiar with it, is the definitive edition of the writings, with exhaustively researched texts and detailed textual introductions and notes, in this case for each of the essays included in this volume. \\"Excursions\\" is a welcome addition to the series. There are relatively few notes identifying named individuals and quotations in the text, and for that kind of annotation I would recommend the Library of America edition of the Essays and Poems, another excellent volume."},{"Title":"Excursions","review":"I enjoy reading Henry David Thoreau and have a number of his books and articles on my shelves, but since buying a Kindle, I thought it would be nice to have some of his works available on the Kindle, and it is, but I think maybe it's worth it to pay a little bit for a version that has a clickable table of contents and so forth."},{"Title":"Excursions","review":"Love it....Love it!

The book covers such areas as carrying secret messages, sabotage, and assassination. It also gives you back ground information on how they trained, executed their missions, and lived their lives. The result is a cleverly blended and transmitted text that will give readers of interest in the Martial Arts a greater understanding for the lifestyle they love."},{"Title":"Tiger Scroll of the Koga Ninja","review":"Tiger Scroll of the Koga Ninja is a fairly short book, just 81 pages of text along with some drawings. After a brief introduction the book is broken down into five chapters:>> Ninja, The Man>> Training>> Weapons>> Equipment>> MethodIn the first chapter \`Jay Sensei' tells us that spying was the most important work carried out be the ninja, followed by reconnaissance, sabotage and assassination. We are then given a list of what \`Jay Sensei' believes to be ninja qualifications, rules, and a description of the three ranks of ninjas: jonin, chunin, genin.In chapter two - training - we learn of physical training techniques used by the ninja such as running with a straw hat placed against one's chest, and running fast enough so that only the wind against the straw hat kept it firmly against the ninja's chest and kept it from falling to the ground.Chapter three - weapons - begins with a discussion of the ninja sword, and of course contains a discussion of the shuriken (which is always associated with the ninja). Also mentioned are blowguns, hand claws, and the kusari (chain). There is no real instruction in the techniques of using these other weapons, just a short discussion of each weapon along with drawings of the weapons.The fourth chapter - equipment - discusses various items ranging from the ninja's hood, to rafts, to water spiders, rope ladders and climbing ropes.The final chapter - method - teaches how to tell time by looking at a cat's eyes. We learn how the ninja found nourishment on a long journey, and how he hid from or escaped from his enemies.This is not a \`bad book,' nor is it poorly written - it is just very basic in its discussion of the ninja. Tiger Scroll of the Koga Ninja would be a fun book for a child interested in the ninja, but offers little for the serious student or practitioner of ninjutsu."},{"Title":"Tiger Scroll of the Koga Ninja","review":"This book is supposedly a translated version of the ancient text the tiger scroll. I'm not sure if its true or not but i don't really care the book is great and has drawings that will help you understand what is being described.

So anyone claiming to have, hold, been taught Koga Ryu techniques is either an unknown who studied under Grandmaster Seiko prior to his death, or a bald-faced liar who is using a combination of other martial arts training and attempting to pass it off as Koga Ryu techniques. Based on what I saw in the book, I am more inclined to accept the latter of these premises. Caveat Emptor, let the buyer beware.*UPDATE* Just as an update, Fujita Seiko died not in a car accident but from liver disease in 1966. He made the direct and confirmed statement numerous times that he did not have a successor to the Wada Ha Koga Ryu Lineage and would allow the school to die with him. He even left his scrolls and various items used by the Wada Ha Ryu that he inherited to the Ninja Museum in Iga Ueno. This alone should give any knowledgeable person who knows anything about the passing or not passing of knowledge in Japanese Martial traditions that he did NOT pass on Sokeship from the Wada Ha Ruy to any of his students. Again, this book is a nice read, but based on a lie and should NOT be interpreted as fact."},{"Title":"Tiger Scroll of the Koga Ninja","review":"The history of the Koga Ninja as well as their techniques and tactics are covered here.

It's a shame she's been sort of forgotten nowadays when she was a best selling author way back at the beginning of the 20th century.The story is a comedy of errors among the privileged class. Society gal Kit McNair tries to do her friend Jim a favor by posing as his wife so his aunt (who holds the purse strings) won't know he's divorced. A small dinner party at Jim's house quickly falls apart when the servants run for the hills after the butler is initially diagnosed with smallpox and the entire house is quarantined. Things are made even more difficult when Jim's actual ex-wife invades the scene and is forced to be cooped up with the now helpless group. (The men don't even know how to shave themselves!)As they attempt to survive the week, and each other, to see if anyone will come down with the disease, there's a minor mystery of some missing jewelry. But we're not here for that, we're in it for the romance. For Jim, who's still in love with his ex, is trying to woo her back, making it look like he's cheating on Kit when he's really not since they're not married. Meanwhile, Kit is developing a soft spot for Tom, one of the other guests, but he thinks she's married to Jim and Tom is livid at Jim's blatant infidelity.Add to the melee demanding Aunt Selina, who doesn't like Kit but expects her to fight for her man (which really _isn't_ her man), a group with cabin fever determined to break OUT of the house, a swarm of reporters and cops determined to keep them IN the house, and the struggle to figure out how to make an omelette and you have a pretty funny book with loveable characters and a quick pace."},{"Title":"When a man marries","review":"Very much in the style of Wodehouse. A delightful comedy about a bunch of silly rich people who get stuck quarantined in a house with no servants for a week. Complications include a jewel thief, a rich aunt, the main character pretending to be married to the nephew and a jealous ex-wife. A quick read and lots of fun."},{"Title":"When a man marries","review":"I really loved this book. I thought it was very well written, full of humor and wit. Definitely a must read! I can't wait to read more books by this author!"},{"Title":"When a man marries","review":"When she agreed to help a friend deceive his maiden aunt by posing as his wife, Kit never guessed the trouble that would follow. Quarantined along with a group of society's elite, including her friend's aunt and his former wife, due to exposure to smallpox, Kit soon finds herself in the midst of a series of crazy events including several burglaries, bungled escape attempts and a slew of mysterious occurrences...with a little romantic confusion, too! Who is stealing from the household? The same man she suspects of kissing her on the stairwell or someone else? Events gradually grow more and more strange and the solution more murky until the final chapters of the book when all is revealed and Kit determines whether or not the man who both attracts and repels her so much is worth her heart.Filled with Rinehart's trademark suspense and action, this book may not be one of her best but it is still a satisfactory, entertaining read."},{"Title":"When a man marries","review":"If your into the older time stories with mystery and I suppose romance then you might want to check out this book. And it cant really hurt since it is free after all. This story is about a hand full of rich people stuck in a house because of some type of illness. And the only way to keep it from spreading is to lock the people who have come in contact with it in the house. While they are locked in there things get stolen, people get blamed, well only one person gets blamed and that's the main character. The lock in all started because the main character wanted to lift the spirit of one of her friends. At the party the friends relative that give him the money is coming over. No big deal except the relative doesn't know that the guy is not married anymore. The main character gets tricked into playing the role of the wife, to only find out that first off the relative is a horrible old lady and secondly, the mans really which shows up. It seems just a few minutes after the really wife shows up everyone at the party except for the help gets locked in the house. So everyone has to keep the lies up so the old lady doesn't find out that everything is a lie, but also the main character has to lie to a love interest she has at the house too. Because he like the old lady, thinks that the main character is married. This book has unique twists and turn in the story that it might be hard to put it down. If my some what explanation makes any sense, and the story does sound kind of interesting, then you will love reading this book, because it is a lot better then what I can explain because I'm horrible at telling stories or explaining."},{"Title":"When a man marries","review":"I do understand why earlier reviewers here liked this book. But I must confess that the artificiality of the main characters -- they are rich, idle, silly, useless nincompoops -- turned me off. I had heard of Mary Roberts Rinehart all my life and recalled my mother reading her later novels. But I had never read anything by her, even though I knew she was a pioneer American mystery writer. It was the setting of this novel that irritated me and maybe I'll give Rinehart a try again in the future. And I will admit that this locked-room mystery (or, rather, locked-house [because of a smallpox quarantine]) is fairly neatly plotted. Hence three stars rather than the one-star I would have given it if it hadn't been for the plot."},{"Title":"When a man marries","review":"This book took off slow, then never really moved much at all.

Depicting the work of thirty-eight artists from Britain, the European continent, North America, and Australia, the photographs in this book will open minds to the creative possibilities of embroidery and provide endless inspiration for all enthusiasts. The range of work covers abstract, realistic and geometric modes of expression. Accompanied by statements by each of the artists about their influences, personal approaches and techniques, the vivid illustrations reflect a broad and colourful diversity in their international flavour and in the individual motivations and personal strengths that lie behind these glorious creations. The works display a variety of techniques, from hand stitching to machine embroidery, quilting, appliqu&eacute;, canvas work (needlepoint), assemblage, dye and paint techniques and printing, in the service of an equally wide range of decorative and expressive purposes. For example, in the abstract linear structures of Emilia Bohdziewicz or the illustrative hand-stitched pieces of Helen Daniel, in Tom Lundberg's use of symbolism and dream imagery as well as Tilleke Schwarz's affinity for simple, strong folk art, the embroidery works shown here represent, collectively, the most exciting and innovative ideas in the field today - seasoned by a willingness to incorporate in new ways some of the methods and media of other crafts and disciplines. This exquisite volume will delight and absorb all lovers of form and colour and those who revel in the possibilities of stitch and fabric manipulation, and will serve as a guide to some of the newest and freshest embroidery art from around the world. Anne Morrell is a Professor of Textiles and former Head of Embroidery at the Manchester Metropolitan University. In addition to her research interests in historic and ethnic textiles, particularly of the Indian sub-continent, she has taught for more than thirty years and has published extensively in the field of embroidery and craft textiles.

And that definitely is the first subject of the book. We get down into the violence of life on these islands, violence against the weak of course, all kinds of weak people, It is fun to be violent with the weak, especially if there is a reason like they are black, they are gay, they are girls, or just they are boys who would not fight back. What about the story of such a boy? Submissive, he will find pleasure not in the violence per se but in the submissive humiliation he will cultivate as a power over the bully, a power that will make him look for ways to give that bully pleasure even if it is at the cost of his own suffering in his hands or under his blows. And little by little, discovering sexual pleasure and all, sex will be a tool to give pleasure even to those who would refuse it straight away if they had not been charmed into accepting it, or even raped into accepting it. The main character thus develops a life of subservient sex in which he finds the pleasure he wants in the pleasure he gives. His initial submissive attitude he experienced with the bully on his island will lead him to get hooked to a pimp in London who sells the services of several originally male people who have kept their maleness, more or less, and satisfy the needs of men who are quite willing to accept gay sex provided it is from men who seem to be women by the way they dress, the hormonal body they have developed or the transsexual trip they have taken. It becomes poignant at the end because the man has been nurtured with hormones by his pimp for him to develop a female body, with a male organ. As an act of repayment, he decides not to use condoms any more and he gets hepatitis and he dies of it in a lot of suffering, turning gold little by little, loved in an extreme way by some gay bashing boy he raped one night with the help of two of his colleagues. The boy got attached to the experiment that turns into an experience and an absolute love that accompanies the man to his own accepted death. This novel about self-realization in extreme alienation is the denunciation of alienation, if we want to look at things from a political point of view, but it is also the poetical evocation of the enormous human power every single man has in himself, and women just as well, to create a full world of freedom and creativity, human compassion and empathy within that alienated frame. This is the extreme resilience the human species has and it explains why the worst possible wars or horrors do not deprive the survivors or the surviving victims to have a full life afterwards, partially based on forgetting and essentially based on creativity and the sublimation of the alienated episodes into positive thinking and action. You will enjoy this small novel if you are not perverted enough to be a fundamentalist about sex, if your empathy is bigger than your attraction or rejection of this other (not so other though) side of the moon or aurora borealis.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines, CEGID"},{"Title":"Venus As a Boy","review":"This book is Golden, I read all night and didn't even notice.The writing makes it seem like a dream.But it's so fantastical it may all be true...I kind of wonder if.. think that it is, but I don't want to go searching & risk breaking the illusion..You will fall in love with him.You'll wish you could go to Orkney & let him make you see the orchards & angels too."},{"Title":"Venus As a Boy","review":"Why haven't more people read and reviewed this book???This is the story of a boy with a gift - the gift to touch people with love, giving them visions of heaven.He is generous with his gift, offering his body up to be used and abused, perhaps because he knows how good receiving that love feels, having seen the visions once himself.However, while he's able to give love to others, the love he desires remains elusive to him, and though he goes through life hopeful of getting that feeling back, we know it's too late as he is telling his story from his death bed where he is slowly turning into gold.This book could well be a modern-day fairy tale, apart from that fairy tales are not usually associated with harsh reality and squalid backdrops.Despite its sordid \\"surroundings\\", this is a beautiful book."},{"Title":"Venus As a Boy","review":"I wanted so much for this to be a beautiful novel. Not so. It tells the story of Desiree (accents unavailable) a young man growing up in a small Scottish town on Orkney Islands. He succumbs to violence and racism which flourish in a town without law enforcement. His childhood is filled with cruelty and abuse from himself and his peers. Desiree, apparently, grows into such a sexually skilled commodity (not love) that his appeal crosses all orientations, gay, straight, and everything else. This should've been wonderful. But the focus of the story, and style of the author, paints a grim and sad life of poverty, apathy, gender turmoil, and prostitution.There's nothing remotely pleasant about Desiree's story. To boot, as it's being told, he's recounting his life and slowly dying, afflicted by some phenomenon that's turning his body into gold. I suppose this factor is meant to have a deeper significance, but it's hard to have sympathy for a character who succumbs to the worst in his environment, in himself, and doesn't give a damn about trying to make things better.

Eliot's masterpiece \\"Four Quartets\\".Preston's examination of \\"Four Quartets\\" consists of four chapters, each about one of the Quartets. He analyses each portion and connects it to the other Quartets and to outside sources. Preston attempts to seek a middle ground on which scholars can agree. He posits no outlandish theories nor attacks the interpretation of his colleagues. He writes, \\"What is needed to correct the deficiencies of one's personal reading is not an exchange of critical gun-fire, but quiet co-operative discussion of detail.\\"What I found most refreshing about Preston's work is that it connects \\"Four Quartets\\" to other things Eliot was writing around the same time, such as his play \\"The Family Reunion\\" and various essays.

You can hear that the 21 year old writing this book was on fire for God, and though I know both sides of the coin, I'd rather read a book that build my faith than one that quenches it. Like Lairdon said in pg. 8 \\"When I first started walking with God, everybody told me the things I could not do. No one told me the things I could do.\\" and I find this true to a certain extent.

By way of reply, Jesus said the man himself would be forced to tarry and wait until Jesus' return.By the thirteen hundreds, of course, that man had done a lot of tarrying and his story was used to underscore how bad the man felt at having deprived Jesus a moment's rest and in some cases his actual conversion to Christianity itself.Like the Passion Play of Oberammergau (particularly its 1935 and before manifestations) the story of the Wandering Jew was typically a story of antisemitism and hatred against Jews for their nonacceptance of Jesus as messiah.For reasons unknown to me, author Joseph Gaer like Edgar Goodspeed has largely passed into oblivion even among Biblical research scholars. That's particuarly true here where he manages to compress all the relevant data about this interesting tale into such a short accessible package.The only caveat I can offer about this book is that for some reason he omits the Chaucer version of this story when he discusses other author's treatments of the story of the Wandering Jew.Other than, he does include a reference to a 1933 movie of the same name (The Wandering Jew) starring the estimable Conrad Veidt. A clip of that film is available on youtube and is probably the best video short snippet version of this tale you can find anywhere."},{"Title":"The Complete Statistical History of Stock-Car Racing: Records, Streaks, Oddities, and Trivia","review":"&quot;The Complete Statistical History of Stock-Car Racing: Records, Streaks, Oddities and Trivia should be the bible for everybody in the sport-media business, P.R. people, marketing people, and fans.

As NASCAR has only in the last decade or so exploded into truly national notoriety and popularity, there are literally thousands of fans who know little or nothing about the sport's pioneers--men like Lee Petty, Red Byron, Junior Johnson, Fireball Roberts, Buck Baker, the Flock brothers, Tim, Bob, and Fonty, and the wild and crazy Curtis Turner. Many of them were men who learned their driving skills not at some high-priced racing school, but on the rural backroads of places like Georgia and North Carolina--running moonshine and evading the law. It was men like these who in the 1950's competed for small purses on mostly dirt tracks as part of the upstart organization known as NASCAR, which was seen by some as a low-class pretender to &quot;true&quot; American racing--the Indianapolis 500.

Yet, if we are honest with ourselves - we desire to change - we desire to be like Him - we know something is missing. This book walks you through how you can change the way God wants us to change, as stated through the Bible.James MacDonald does an excellent job of pointing out wrong ways we go about change and gives a mandate for serious change. I couldn't put this book down - it's honest, biblical, and serious about change, do not buy this book unless you are serious about change. Then, and only then, will this book be profitable to you. May this book be as beneficial to you as it already has for me - I gurantee you that you will not leave this book without some sort of positive change."},{"Title":"I Really Want to Change... So, Help Me God","review":"In a way, the book should be titled, \\"I Really Want to Repent...So, Help Me God\\" because the focus of the book *is* about change through true repentance.Having said that, it was a difficult (in a good way) book for me to read as it forced me to face my sins and make a decision as to whether I would trust God or if I would continue to do things my way.If you're struggling with depression or something similar, it may not necessarily be the book to read because it's possible to be depressed and not fully understand the source of the depression. I think in this case, praying to God and asking Him to reveal the source; there are so many different factors that cause depression.While it is a challenge, I highly recommend this book for anyone who is seriously desiring to change ... that is repent and turn away for their sins."},{"Title":"I Really Want to Change...

Real change is possible to those who are willing to make the commitment and willing to acknowledge the ONE TRUE source for overcoming.

He doesn't say there won't be any problems or temptations, but it's the road we choose that will make a difference.What I understood from reading this book is that I can choose to complain about a disease, emotional, or financial issues that I may have or I can choose to have faith in God by obeying and submitting to His Word, by being content and thankful for the things I do have. There is always one person out there in a much worst situations than we are.In this book, James MacDonald is transparent by giving examples about the things he goes through, just like everybody else. By doing so, he also gives examples on how he overcomes them. This is a very good book based on the scriptures. No matter what the situations may be, it always come down to our attitude.

So, Help Me God","review":"As a born-again Christian of over twenty years who is struggling with emotional issues, I found this book useless and stopped reading after the first couple of chapters. I have been struggling with the author's recommended methods of change for over twenty years and they have not allowed me to overcome my covert depression tendencies.To so cavalierly disregard other methods of help as he does in Chapter 1 does nothing to further along the process of helping those truly in need. What he is doing is telling a drowning person to swim harder, rather than throwing them a life preserver. I found the advice similar to that of a misguided individual who told a friend that their child died of cancer because they did not pray hard enough.Yes, I believe in God and Jesus Christ as my savior. However, I do not believe an individual unskilled in alternative therapies, as the author appears to be, should disregard meaningful help that can be used in addition to a solid belief in God and His tender mercies.Any one struggling with covert depression tendencies or trying to make sense of emotional distress will find the author's suggestions simplistic and a retread of what can be heard from the pulpit on Sunday."},{"Title":"To Love and Be Wise","review":"Of the 7 (she wrote 8) of her \\"mysteries\\" that I've now read, this is IMHO one of the best. It's not as good as the fantastic \\"Daughter of Time\\" but in a class with (but maybe not quite as good as) \\"Brat Farrar.\\" It's much better than \\"A Shilling of Candles.\\" Essentially, if you read Tey mysteries in the order written, you will see her getting better and better. As many have written, it's a shame we don't get to see what she might have written had she lived longer. As one of her later novels, this one includes several familiar characters: Inspector Grant (the protagonist), Marta Hallard (whose character is greatly rounded out herein), Jammy Hopkins (a cameo so to speak), & Grant's favorite Sgt., Williams. The book includes considerable humor and funny dialog as well as some lovely or interesting phrasing: \\"It is very dreadful being suspended from a spider's thread,\\" \\"So disheartening for a woman, don't you feel, to be weighed against a rabbit, and to know that she will inevitably be found wanting,\\" \\"One of the secrets of a successful life is to know how to be a little profitably crazy.\\" It's the only one so far that gives the reader even a ghost of a chance to guess the ending--though it's almost impossible here too. The ending is reasonable but hardly likely. One does wonder about Grant's dearth of romance considering the appearance of several women to whom he seems attracted. Not Tey's forte apparently. Still, this is a fine mystery novel, not dated, but comparable to some of the better ones being produced today."},{"Title":"To Love and Be Wise","review":"This is one of Josephine Tey's lesser known mysteries. &quot;Daughter of Time&quot; and &quot;The Franchise Affiar&quot; are, perhaps better known. This novel is in the Inspector Grant series and concerns the disappearance of a young man whom Grant had met briefly at a party.The writing and atmosphere of this novel are both excellent. Unlike some other Tey novels, I enjoyed this one more for the characters and setting, rather than plotting. Tey has a fine ear for dialogue and humor and Grant is a pleasure to go detecting with."},{"Title":"To Love and Be Wise","review":"Even in a book that has its flaws, Tey's writing makes it sparkle like a gem: \\"Common sense is halfway to kindness,\\" is only one example of her Austen-like humor and wisdom; but, at the risk of including a spoiler, the solution to the mystery was immediately introduced into my mind by the picture on the paperback edition. The same plot would not be nearly as effective in a detective story published in 2012, unless the story itself took place in 1950. So I would suggest to the publishers, change the cover of the book, and the plot will be harder to detect and more enjoyable for your readers."},{"Title":"To Love and Be Wise","review":"My introduction to Josephine Tey's novels was through The Daughter Of Time way back in the 1960s. It is only recently that I've started reading her other novels and I am finding them to be every bit as good as that one. This novel includes Marta Hallard - an actress friend of Alan Grant, the Scotland Yard Detective Inspector who both featured in \`The Daughter of Time'.Leslie Searle, an American photographer, has made a trip to the UK to look up Walter Whitmore as a mutual friend of theirs has died. They become friends and agree to collaborate on a book about a canoe trip down a local river. But Leslie disappears immediately after a public disagreement with Walter and because of the proximity of the river he is feared drowned.The local police are stumped and Grant is quickly called in to investigate. Right from the start he feels there is something he is missing. The plot is fascinating and presents readers with a great many red herrings as well as a substantial number of clues. The local community with its high proportion of people involved in the arts is well described though not always flattering language. I thought all the characters were well drawn - Liz, Walter's fianc&eacute;e, Lavinia Fitch and author and Aunt to Walter Whitmore as well as Leslie Searle himself.If you like your crime with well drawn characters and a complex plot and detectives who are something out of the ordinary then give Josephine Tey's novels a try.

He shows up out of nowhere and associates himself with the family of Walter Whitmore, local celebrity. Then, he disappears. Grant is assigned to find his body, but is Searle really dead?The title of this book comes from a question that is asked in the middle of the book: \\"Is it really possible to love someone AND be wise?\\"Every time I read one of Tey's books, the word 'delicious' comes to mind. I enjoy them so much that I want to savor them, never letting them end.

It's a shame she didn't have time to write more books."},{"Title":"To Love and Be Wise","review":"Tey again thinks outside the box in her plotting, years before that term existed. I wish she'd have had at least another decade to write in. I'd read all of her books that I could find 20 years ago, in the pre-internet & pre-Amazon days. So I'm glad to have found TO LOVE AND BE WISE. One thing I noticed was how little reference there was to WWII. Then I thought of the possible explanation: that a British writer in 1950 took the war for granted, while more recent authors felt they had to mention it."},{"Title":"To Love and Be Wise","review":"In no ways as prolific a writer of mysteries as the Queen of British Mystery (Agatha Christie) or most of the Princesses (Allingham, Marsh, James, et al), but at about the same number as Sayers, Josephine Tey has given us a somewhat offbeat puzzle for Inspector Grant, her hero, to put together. A strikingly appealing young man, a famously successful professional photographer, is invited to visit in the home of well-known media people in a small community heavily laden with similar types. After a brief time, he disappears. What happened to him? Inspector Grant, who has met him by chance, and is at ease with the social types to be found in the community, is brought in to find the missing person and to find out why he went missing.We get to meet these rather offbeat characters and to join in the hunt. The book draws us rapidly along the trail and, ultimately, confronts us with an offbeat solution.Of course, in 1950, when published, the theme, its development and resolution would have raised a melody in very light counterpoint, so to speak, barely hidden from the reader. Today, in 2011, the counerpoint weave sinuously and emphatically, to become unmistakable at the end.Naturally, the code of ethics of the mystery story reviewer prevents eucidation of the point, but it will be apparent to those who choose to share the general pleasure in Tey's books."},{"Title":"To Love and Be Wise","review":"To anyone of middle age wondering why the times of our youth are so much more memorable and vivid and magical than latter-life experiences, Tey sums it up nicely in one of the last lines of the book: \\"The fantastical was for adolescents; for adults there were adult joys.\\"PLOT TALK: there is a device -- and I don't know if you could call it a device, more a plot necessity; and that happens often in Tey's books, I've noticed -- that gives a big hint to the mystery in To Love and Be Wise. Inspector Grant was to conduct an interview with the missing Leslie Searle's cousin, a scene I was looking forward to. But then the meeting, due a circumstance of plot, had to be canceled; I could not recall any other book where the author sets up such a tasty tete a tete, then cancels it.

Leslie Searle seems to be famous. Lavinia's sister, Emma, dislikes him. Emma's daughter Liz, secretary to her Aunt Lavinia, likes him very much.Toby Tullis, an actor, has a place in Salcott. He is so famous he is surprised that Searle has never heard of him. Perhaps Searle, who photographs celebrities, is having him on. Walter and Searle decide to do a book together. Walter is a broadcaster for the BBC. His trademark is an unself-conscious friendliness. Liz is engaged to Walter.Lavinia feels a wrongness and a fascination with Searle. Liz is clearly fascinated. The book plan is for Walter to do the text and for Searle to provide the illustrations. It is to be a portrait of a particular river its entire length, from the source to the sea. The pair intends to use a canoe. The work is to have the title CANOES ON THE RUSHMERE.At the start they are to sleep in a cave. Five days later they walk into the pub, the Swan, where they usually drank. The men seemed to have been having a personal discussion and none of the others ventured to their area. Afterwards Searle said that Walter left in order to avoid throttling him. Searle disappears.Alan Grant arrives to question the BBC commentator, Walter Whitmore. He reported the disappearance the morning following the evening at the pub. Grant thinks the disppearance has an aspect of the sawn lady about it. Grant asks Walter if Searle is the person he purports to be, a photographer of celebrities. Perhaps Searle lost his way in the dark and fell into the river.The room Searle occupied is devoid of atmosphere. Walter Whitmore seems to be deteriorating, visibly. The press has reached him. Grant's friend Marta functions as a sounding board. The next development is that Searle's shoe is discovered.

Tey is a good writer, and this book is superlative when it comes to characterizations, but the mystery(?) is less than exciting. Grant is wonderful, and here we see an urbane Grant who has to go to the country to follow up the disappearance of a young man that he had met once at a cocktail party. He follows all clues, and comes up empty (even to dragging the river twice), but once back at home in London after awhile, the pieces come together and he figures it out.

All commercial manuals are beaten.Book presentation :George Fraser, a lonely, timid fellow, lived in a dream world of gangsters, gunfights and fascinating women, and to bolster up his inferiority complex he began to imagine himself as the toughest gangster of all of them. But he boasted once too often, and to the wrong person.

Recommended."},{"Title":"Family First (Larger Print Superromance)","review":"I really enjoyed this romance novel. The characters have strengths and flaws and quirks, just like people you know in real life. Although they're attracted to each other, they have real conflicts keeping them apart, things they can't fix easily with a conversation. I've stayed away from series romances in recent years because they kept disappointing me. Not this time. I'm going to keep an eye out for more books from Margaret Watson."},{"Title":"Family First (Larger Print Superromance)","review":"The department rules insist that when an officer uses his weapon he must see a psychologist. In the line of duty Police Detective Jake Donovan killed a dangerous murderer Doak Talbott before the killer murdered his own son and his aunt, but does not want to see the shrink especially to discuss his feelings. He just wants to go back to work, but the SOP forces him to talk with Dr. Kira McGinnis before he can return to field work.Jake makes the appointments, but does not open up to her about his inner feelings about the killing to the doc, whom he also finds quite attractive. Kira feels the same way about her patient, but hides her heart because she fears involvement and questions the ethics of an off the job relationship with a patient. Besides she has enough to do with raising her five-year-old daughter by herself and helping her troubled teenage brother.It is elementary that the key to this strong contemporary romance is Kira's relationships with her daughter and her brother as she willingly sacrifices her own needs and desires out of her love for them. Jake wants to do likewise for the shrink he loves, but also fears commitment. Margaret Watson writes a powerful character study of people caring for the wellbeing of others finding love, but fearing its intrusion.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Corel WordPerfect 9 Fast & Easy (Fast & Easy (Living Language Paperback))","review":"I liked the format of the book.

D. Barnes offers a striking revision of what was then current opinion on Tertullian. The book has of course two stated purposes: An historical and a literary study. Barnes states that no biography of Tertullian is possible. However, his historical analysis is keen. First of all, the author points out the dearth of information about North African Christianity prior to 150 C.E. and the sparseness of further information from the late second century C.E.This places Tertullian as the first major Christian author west of Alexandria in Africa. He carefully demolishes Jerome's assertions that Tertullian was the son of a Roman military official and a priest of the Church. Based on his reconstruction of Tertullian literary corpus, Barnes assesses what can be known. For Barnes' observations about the nature of the persecution of Christians by the Romans, the book is worth reading alone. He sees persecution as random in time and location. It crops up here and there but almost continually by the time of Tertullian. A frightening picture of fear is mapped out. Persecution and the subsequent responses to it in Northern Africa ripped the Christian Church there into schismatic factions. This situation was only settled by the eventual Muslim conversion. And, Barnes correctly argues that Tertullian eventually embraced Montanism. This of course put him at odds with the Roman Church center which eventually designated Montanism as heretical. The sweep of historical analysis presented here is wide and thought provoking.Why not five stars? The literary analysis is less persuasive. This was amply pointed out by A. Momigliano who was one of Barnes doctoral advisers in his review of this book many years ago. In spite of his Montanism, Tertullian had a lasting and profound effect on the Roman Church and its thought. Both Cyprian and Jerome credit him highly. However, Barnes gives Tertullian's theology far less attention than it deserves. His dating of the works of Tertullian's corpus is not argued with overwhelming force and is suspect. And lastly, Barnes proposes that Tertullian was a Christian Sophist which may be the weakest part of the work. However, all that being said, the two short reviews previous to this are right when they state that this is the place for all English speakers to start their study of Tertullian. There may be something in the French language that compares, but I do not read the language. It may also be the definitive starting point of any study of the early Christian Church in central north Africa. This is an immensely exciting book well worth reading and accessible to almost all."},{"Title":"Tertullian: A Historical and Literary Study","review":"Tertullian's thought and life come alive in this marvellous study. Written during the revisionist fashion in the 1960's, the book is still required reading. The text is very readable, and extremely detailed, containing more than enough references to take a newcomer to the critical literature. The starting point for any English speaker wanting to know about Tertullian, although not all of his views have found acceptance."},{"Title":"Tertullian: A Historical and Literary Study","review":"This book is the best book ever written on Tertullian in English. The summaries of the content of each work are full of life, and Tertullian himself lives in these pages.Much of the book is taken up with a detailed and systematic exploration of what we think we know about the man and the world he lived in. Barnes wrote this in 1971, under the influence of 1960's revisionism, and his conclusions have since been revised (see the appendix written in 1985 in which he discusses this). But simply reading how he goes about evaluating the data, and how he refers to it, will be a liberal education for most people.The humanities does not have to consist merely of people promoting their prejudices. It can be solidly fact-based and data-driven. Barnes provides this marvellous example of a Roman historian discussing a difficult subject in the most objective manner possible."},{"Title":"Tertullian: A Historical and Literary Study","review":"This book is a really treasure for everyone who wants to start seriously study Tertullian. It is full of new (provocative?) informationabout him(the opposite is f.e. &quot;Tertullian. in: Bardenhewer, O.: Geschichte der altchristlichen Literatur. 2. Bd. 1913.)

GREAT work!"},{"Title":"Knife Edge (Royal Marines 5)","review":"Of all of Douglas Reeman's Royal Marine novels this one was probably the least well plotted but it still was gripping in being character driven. Reeman has always been one of my favorite authors and I enjoy the personal stories he weaves into his books as much or more than intricate plots around historic events, so this book was satisfying from a character perspective. That said, I would like to have seen a bit more clarity in the plot, but perhaps the disjointed nature of what Ross Blackwood is facing in the story is more representative of the nature of the times Reeman is writing about.Regardless of the problems with plot in this novel, Douglas Reeman still has a knack for getting inside a character and showing you their strengths and their weaknesses. You begin to really care about the character. This is a gift that Reeman continues to use better than almost any writer in this genre and I will continue to read any book he writes."},{"Title":"Knife Edge (Royal Marines 5)","review":"A very good read. Reeman has done extensive research into the Boxer movement in China at the beginning of the 20th century. The action is swift and the characters well defined. Conflicts abound in plenty and are resolved in a logical manner. A typical work from a master story teller."},{"Title":"Knife Edge (Royal Marines 5)","review":"I have read over a score of books by this author and really like the writing.

Not the authors best work, in fact it reads more like a collection of notes about a story that may be writen someday."},{"Title":"Ground Zero (Paper Tiger)","review":"The first time I saw Fred Gambino's artwork was on the reprinted covers for the \\"Tripods Trilogy\\" by John Christopher. I was impressed by the level of detail in the illustrations: walls of a ruined house that seemed to include every brick; gleaming metal; meticulously rendered grass; the folds in a white tunic; an alien city glittering with light. These covers, almost photographic in appearance, were done before the illustrator had an electronic alternative to acrylics.Nearly twenty years later, much of Fred Gambino's output is produced with the aid of the Apple Macintosh. Apparently, Gambino was one of the first SF artists to explore the potential of computer-generated illustration. It proved to be a revelation for him. Nearly all the artwork in \\"Ground Zero\\" is computer-generated. Gambino describes the process in detail, sifting through a diverse range of reference material, building with polygons, turning photographs of ordinary people into out of-this-world heroes (or villains). On a couple of occasions Gambino has even used photographs of himself. We see him as a priest on the cover of \\"A Case of Conscience\\". Gambino points out with wry humour that the photo was old, taken at a time when he had hair. The cover illustration also includes a \\"lizard man\\" in the background, which wasn't shown in the final printed version. The art director told Gambino to remove it. When using a computer, that's no problem at all.Fred Gambino has had prestigious commissions, producing work for such well-known writers as Brian Aldiss, Frank Herbert and David Brin. Many of Gambino's covers are part of the growing library of SF Masterworks. Some of these are also included in \\"Ground Zero\\".The computer-generated imagery is very slick, crisp and clean-looking. Other artists have expressed concern with the over-reliance on computers, but this doesn't seem to bother Fred Gambino. He hasn't abandoned traditional media altogether, but there are plenty of advantages to working electronically, such as retouching images in a matter of moments, recycling reference photo's and so on. A lot of time and labour is saved. The computer still hasn't eliminated the need for good drawing skills.\\"Ground Zero\\" is an amazing collection of work. It would be good if another collection of Fred Gambino's earlier hand-done work was produced. It would certainly be a contrast."},{"Title":"Ground Zero (Paper Tiger)","review":"Fred Gambino is a world renowned sci-fi artist, and this book presents most of his best paintings in their full glory. The text is interesting, with material covering his transition from traditional painting into 3D and computer generated art."},{"Title":"The Battle for Jerusalem","review":"This is a very entertaining book about the desperate battle for Jerusalem during the Six Day War of 1967. The author was overall Israeli commander of this battle and his style of writing gives the reader a you-are-there feeling as the battle is planned and fought. If you like alot of action, you will enjoy this book. There is not a dull page. What I really appreciate about this narrative is the way it brings out the reality of combat. Seldom does anything go as planned. Mistakes are made and confusion is usually present. Among the bullets and bombs almost every human emotion is presented. War is terrible, but there is a time for glory.Basically, the battle is in stages. Various strategic points must be taken by the Israelis from the Jordanians in a precise order. The reader is taken from one point to the next and is introduced to the major Israeli combat units and leaders in the process. A nice map of Jerusalem at the time of the battle is at the front of the book, so the reader can easily follow the flow of action."},{"Title":"The Battle for Jerusalem","review":"Many readers will be familiar with Michael Oren's excellent recent work entitled \`Six Days Of War' which relates to the 1967 Arab-Israeli war.Perhaps the most significant event of that conflict was the actual battle for Jerusalem which saw Israel once again in control of the whole of Jerusalem, including east Jerusalem, the Temple Mount and the Western Wall. Areas so long occupied by Jordan.Monumental events that have since held intense, international, political and religious significance. Even today Jerusalem is central to the Middle East 'peace process' and the stumbling block to virtually all negotations. The momentous events described here eventually resulting in Jerusalem going on to be officially declared as the eternal and indivisible capital of Israel during August 1980. A fact yet to be recognised by most of the international community.Israeli Lt. General Mordechai Gur, the first to break through and reach the Temple Mount provides an excellent, firsthand account of the events leading up to, during, and following the 1967 battle for Jerusalem and the actual taking of the Temple Mount during the conflict.This is a highly personal, intense account of the actual fighting. You feel as if you are there with the troops on the ground. Those familiar with the streets and environs of Jerusalem &amp; the Old City will be even more so.The progress of the actual battle against the well-armed and well-trained Jordanian forces is documented throughout and the momentous sentiment expressed towards the end when suddenly at the Western Wall is almost palpable.An exceedingly well written, moving account which proceeds at a rapid pace hardly pausing for breath from once incident to another. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Battle for Jerusalem","review":"I found this book while at the Las Vegas airport. The book was in the bargain area of the bookstore. I decided to pick up the book, as I am a huge history buff. I could not believe that a book about so important an occasion in military history could be found in the bargain area. As I found out after I started to read, there was a reason why the book was in the bargain area. My main problem with book was with the way it is written. The book is written as if it were a diary or journal. There is very little background information given. No backstory. No explaination as to people and places. Figures come and go without regard. It is just poorly written. The guy who wrote it was a general who participated in the battle for Jerusalem, but he is no writer. My secondary issue has to do with lack of pictures, diagrams, photos, etc.. The only picture is that of a crudley drawn map of the city of Jerusalem. Hate to be a bummer. Love the history - hate the book. Glad I got it for a pittance, because I left it at the airport for someone else to judge. I understand that the book was originally written in hebrew, and then translatted. Maybe something was lost in translation. Not everyone is a writter."},{"Title":"The Battle for Jerusalem","review":"I totally agree with the other 5 star reviews.Even without a background in military history, it felt like I was there myself. I have seldom read a less sentimental yet emotionally more touching book. Especially the final chapter, the actual conquest of the Old City and Temple Mount had me reach for the tissues. And that famous picture on the cover is just perfect.It is true, knowing Jerusalem as a tourist does help, and this book takes you there again. I will remember what I read the next time I walk up to the Lions' Gate.The only thing that bothered me slightly was the rather obvious lack of proper editing. Maybe in a future edition? The book is certainly worth it.Oh, and a warning: I recommend this strictly to loyal friends of Israel!"},{"Title":"The Battle for Jerusalem","review":"Mordechai Gur was the commander of the Israeli forces in the battle for Jerusalem in the June 1967 Arab-Israeli war. His account of the war also relates part of the political background of the war, including the decision to take the Old City of Jerusalem only after Israel had been attacked by Jordanian forces. Gur gives a detailed account of the battle including the heroic struggle against the entrenched Jordanian forces in Ammunition Hill, and the dramatic taking of the Old City, the Western Wall and the Temple Mount. It was Gur who in the first rush of excitement electrified the people of Israel with his cry ' The Temple Mount is in our hands'. Gur was a strong, quiet soldier, a heroic person who served his country and people well in a distinguished military career. The taking of Jerusalem was the climax of that career and he tells the story in an accurate, and reliable way without great frills but with a deep and restrained feeling ."},{"Title":"The Battle for Jerusalem","review":"Motta d&eacute;livre une excellente narration minut&eacute;e des op&eacute;rations de sa brigade parachutiste.

Matter-of-fact, his name is not even listed in the alphabetical reference for Sci-Fi authors. Imagine my surprise when I looked up his name so I could review \\"Agent of Chaos\\" and found dozens of his novels listed, many with 5 star ratings!\\"Agent of Chaos\\" was published in 1970, and I have no idea how this novel became part of my Sci-Fi collection. It is yellowed and brittle now, and I picked it out one afternoon just because I was curious. No, this novel wasn't \`the find of the century', by any means, although it was an engaging and quick read (half a day).It is a story of a group of rebels trying to assassinate the leader of the Hegemonic Council that rule the solar system with absolute tyranny. Spinrad uses many clever ideas, and the world of the Hegemony is fleshed out nicely. Center to the plot is an enigmatic group called \`The Brotherhood of Assassins' who thwart the rebels at every turn, yet, also create havoc within the Hegemony. It is this group that heightens the reader's interest. Unfortunately, the protagonist (Johnson), who is suppose to be a great fighter and leader, turns out to be rather naive, and is easily duped (too easily). This may or may not have been the author's intent, but in either case, it frustrated this reader. Also absent was any hint of a love interest, leaving the reader with a fairly shallow story.Long out of print, \\"Agent of Chaos\\" does many things well, but when I finished the novel, it left no lingering memories. It's just a quick, enjoyable read for a Saturday afternoon. No depth here. Between 1 and 10, \\"Agent of Chaos\\" gets a 5. I'm more curious about the author, but it looks like if I want to read anymore of his work I'll need to look through used book stores."},{"Title":"Agent of Chaos","review":"When I was only thirteen I think my Father handed this book to me to read. This book is an early work of SF that takes place in a dystopian future. The book itself touches on the nature of power and freedom. Though I don't agree with Spinrad's ideas entirely, his book contains ideas about individualism that resonate even today. This book has been a major influence on my thoughts and beliefs and the story is still remembered by me to this day. I would suggest this to anyone who has some time on their hands."},{"Title":"Agent of Chaos","review":"Only a few of the previous reviews for this obscure old sci-fi chestnut really tackle its actual themes and points of view. This was Spinrad's second novel and he was still a few releases away from wide recognition, but here he shows some real ambition and creativity. While the book does get a little full of itself at times, and the rather wooden characters show the golden age sci-fi weakness of talking way too much, Spinrad spun a surprisingly unique and effective political focus into an otherwise typical little space opera. The story revolves around a quite fascinating philosophy of chaos as the natural state of the universe (and its inhabitants), with the order imposed by leaders as antithetical to the destiny of mankind. It's a rather anarchist political outlook presented in cosmological terms. Spinrad does well with this premise, plotting out some intricate political shenanigans as three different parties exploit each other while trying to impose their vision of humanity, with dueling strategies for creating order or chaos. In the process, Spinrad delivers some insightful ruminations on power, tyranny, and freedom - and what those seemingly cut-and-dried terms mean on a cosmic scale. While parts of this book are pretty outdated and it shows many of the minor weaknesses of its genre at the time, Spinrad delivered what might be the most ambitious sci-fi political exploration this side of Frank Herbert or Anthony Burgess. The fact that this ambition actually leads to readable results is all the reason to pick up this old lost classic if you come across it.

I would buy this book. But then again, I know a book with Spinrad's name on it will not be a waste of time or money."},{"Title":"Agent of Chaos","review":"The author opened each Chapter with a verse from George Markowitz, fictive author of the Theory of Social Empathy. He draws his characters in this story to produce conflict between the theory of social order and of that of social chaos. Sprinrad presents human emotions as random factors serving the forces of chaos. This is a very good job of using his characters to teach his anti-utopian ideal. Basically he is telling his reader to stop fighting the entropic degradation of the universe--just lay back and enjoy it. That one group committed suicide, as the Brotherhood of Assassins did, in order to accomplish their mission of universal planetary exploration was a paradox that enthralled the author. Thus he labeled victory by suicide as the Ultimate Chaotic Act."},{"Title":"Agent of Chaos","review":"I've now read this book, and to be honest, don't find it to be worth a lengthy review. Spinrad proposes three social forces in conflict - the Hegemony, the Democratic League, and the \\"chaotic\\" Brotherhood of Assassins - and populates each with two-dimensional stick-figure heroes and villains. It's ok if you are into lasgun assaults under plasteel domes on Mercury, but it's not the philosophical conflict of ideas that it pretends to be. No way it was \\"the great science-fiction novel now an underground classic in colleges all across America\\".At times it can be just ridiculous; for example, when the first intersteller probe comes back from Cygnus 61, everyone sits around waiting for the film to come back from the lab. And a secret agent travels to Mercury under cover as a business man deciding whether to relocate his desk calculator manufacturing plant there, as if that makes economic sense. Sheesh."},{"Title":"Agent of Chaos","review":"No, this is not a Get Smart adventure. Norman Spinrad's book is about one man's choice with regards to political systems.

I recommend it for every medical student entering his clinical period ."},{"Title":"A Bed for the Night","review":"\\"A Bed for the Night: The Story of the Wheeling Bellboy E. M. Statler, and His Remarkable Hotels\\" by Rufus Jarman is a very engaging story of the legendary American hotel man, E.M. Statler, and an excellent history of the development of the hotel industry. The fact that he was voted Hotelman of the Half Century in 1950 even though he died in 1928, emphasizes his long-term influence on a developing industry, and his life is a study of the entrepreneurial spirit. When Conrad Hilton bought the Statler Chain in 1954 it was the largest U.S. real estate transaction to date.

But as Kali the mother."},{"Title":"Six Years of Hell: Harpers Ferry During the Civil War","review":"I recently visited Harpers Ferry on a vacation where I was touring eastern Civil War battlefields and found the place so facinating that I wanted to learn more about it's history. While Harpers Ferry was an important location during the Civil War, in most Civil War books it's a sideshow of something larger such as the battle of Antietam. Fortunately with Chester Hearn's book it gets center stage treatment.The book itself is well written and is a nice 300 pages in length. John Brown's raid, Lee's invasions of 1862 &amp; 1863 as well as Early's 1864 raid are all covered and covered in depth in the book. Hearn's writing style is enjoyable and the book is well researched.Unfortunately the maps in the book don't live up to the writing. The four maps are some of the worst I've seen in any Civil War book. The first two are barely acceptable. The one of the town itself doesn't even show the Bolivar Heights. The last two are the worst. They are so dark and the lettering so small that most of the wording on them is unreadable and they do not help the reader in any way. None of the maps show such important landmarks like Sandy Hook and not until the last one is even the Bolivar Heights shown but the lettering so small that you can barely read it.This is a good book and Civil War buffs will enjoy it. You will be left with a better appreciation for the role Harpers Ferry played in the war. However Hearn would have served his work better and the reader would have gotten a better understanding of the events had he provided better maps and perhaps some photos of the area. It's one thing to read about the Loudoun and Maryland Heights and another to see them. A picture of these heights from the town would have greatly assisted the reader in understanding the terrain of the area and the difficulties they brought to defending it.I do recommend this book but if you pick it up I strongly suggest you search online for maps of the Harpers Ferry area and perhaps some photos showing the Maryland and Loudoun Heights."},{"Title":"Six Years of Hell: Harpers Ferry During the Civil War","review":"As some of the other reviewers have said, the maps in this are pathetic (worse on a Kindle). For a great account and telling of the story of Harpers Ferry during the Civil War, this is a fantastic book. I'm 3/4 of the way through at this moment. I actually just purchased it for the John Brown raid piece. While I've been enjoying the rest, I've found it hard to follow in a few areas for being somewhat new to the Civil War. That could just be me as names, dates, events seem to blur together. I still strongly recommended it and intend to read it over again."},{"Title":"Six Years of Hell: Harpers Ferry During the Civil War","review":"I am reading this book right now and it is very good.

Makes my skin crawl."},{"Title":"Down in the Garden","review":"Geddes' manages to degrade and isolate her subjects. Her prehistoric &quot;cutsie&quot; images, though appealing to a kitsch market, do not allow for a social comment to transcend the visual confines of her exploitive commercial &quot;photography&quot;. In some senses, she could be seen as a radical post-modernist artist, as she abstracts the subject from social normality and removes any dignity from the development of the child, if that was her so calling in contemporary art. Yet it is frightening to be in an age where people will grasp such superficially degrading images. Geddes has made a personal fortune off photographing babies, subjects usually positioned in inhumane circumstances (ie: babies in flowerpots or dipped in custard), which removes human dignity and allows us to question Geddes moral intent."},{"Title":"Down in the Garden","review":"Ms. Geddes fills her large, oversized color pages with stunning pictures of a whimsical garden populated by babies. Her tiny models appear as fairies, flowers, insects, birds, and other small animals in the garden. Her imagination will transform the way you see babies . . . and gardens forever. You'll be glad to have experienced her magical touch.The images are enlivened by simple texts of a few words just to help create a mood or a thought.The compositions are quite elaborate. One contains dozens of children dressed up in worm outfits, and then transposed onto an image of them all in tunnels underground in the garden. What an amazing effort this must have taken!One of her presentation techniques is to have a photograph inside a photograph. For example, there is a two page spread of a basket. Then, you can unfold the middle of the basket to reveal its babyish contents! In another place, she plays peek-a-boo with you by hiding one image within the photograph under a flap which you can open. When you do, the photograph's meaning totally changes.As wonderful as her imagination and compositions are, I think her finest gift is to capture the baby's personality while awake.The quality of the reproductions is extremely high, particularly considering that she is working with squirming infants in many cases.Here are my favorites in the book:Moth Orchid Triplets; Monica; Christopher; Aisha, Tayla and Grace; Wet Sparrow; Magnolia Bud; Sarah; Potting Shed; Starring Triplets -- Jim, Flora and Pearl; Window Planter; Strawberry Planter; Canterbury Belles; Ruby; Tea Pot, Watering Can and Milk Jug; Birdhouse; and Jessie.This book would make a wonderful gift for expectant parents. They would suddenly feel their budding love for the developing baby evolve in new ways.After you enjoy this book, consider where else a little magic and a dash of fantasy can create good feelings that will lead to more love and caring.

My wife is an early childhood specialist, and was once the head of the children's book department at a major independent bookstore, so she has seen MANY children's books. I teach illustration at two colleges, so I have seen a LOT of children's book art. We both agree author Sharon Creech and illustrator David Diaz have cooked up something really special with 'Who's That Baby?'.Creech's poems are brief but speak volumes. Her charming cadence rejoices in real-life details about parenting, babies, and 'Grandmas with not very big vocabularies' (who only say 'Oooh' and 'Aaah', and 'Awww', and 'Oh!).I was a David Diaz fan long before he won the 1990 Caldecott Medal, children's book illustration's highest honor, for Smoky Night, a sort of 'The-Snowy-Day-meets-the-L.A.-riots' child's-eye narrative that is both fierce and tender.

A soft cover book accompanies the video series to complement the eight VHS videos and allows for off-line review.The author provides content and instruction that is comprehensive and accurate. Three tapes cover the basic anatomy and &quot;how to&quot; standard for transesophageal echocardiography examinations. These three tapes provide the beginner with the framework for performing a complete echocardiography examination. For the experienced echocardiographer, these three tapes provide an extensive review that is of refresher course quality.Two videotapes are devoted to an extensive anatomical and clinical review of the mitral valve. High quality multiple clinical examples of mitral valve pathology are provided. Other videos covering critical care applications and utilization of TEE in hip replacement were of moderate utility. The critical care medicine applications provide nice examples of important critical care pathology; however, more clinical information, background, differential diagnosis, and management strategies for the presented pathology would have made this tape more informative and might have further emphasized the vital role of echocardiography in critical care medicine. The last video in the series provides multiple good examples of challenging video clips with an accompanying multiple choice examination.Although the content and organization of material within the video is excellent, some of the stills were less than optimal. The audio presentation of the material, although lacking in dramatics, is clear. The quality of the text material is adequate. The pages of the provided text were out of order.In summary, this video series is an excellent review of an approach to the complete transesophageal echocardiography examination. Institutions with intraoperative TEE services would benefit from the availability of this fine reference. I look forward to a DVD version with expanded references and content.Corey Sawchuk, MD, FRCPC, Hamilton, Ontario, Canada"},{"Title":"Video Seminars on Transesophageal Echocardiography (Book and 8 Videos--NTSC - US Format)","review":"Clin. Cardiol. 22, 684 (1999)Book ReviewVideo Seminars on Transesophageal Echocardiography is a book (126 pages) and eight 45-minute to 1-hour video tapes written by a cardiac anesthesiologist. It focuses on transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) performed intra-operatively. There are three chapters on TEE techniques (transverse, vertical, and oblique plane imaging), four on applications (mitral valve, mitral valve repair, and orthopedic and critical care settings), and a self-assessment test.The text and video tapes provide a comprehensive and practical introduction to the field of intra-operative TEE. The intention is to simplify TEE by using techniques to analyze and explain the patient examination process. The focus is primarily on the intra-operative evaluation of the mitral valve. A particularly useful chapter is the evaluation of the various regions of the mitral valve, including the identification of each of the scallops of the two leaflets. The 20 mitral valve repair cases presented are excellent, especially those showing the results of the different types of repair.The real success of this book lies in the many clear illustrations of mitral valve anatomy and pathology that are shown both in the text and on the videos. Since echocardiography is primarily a visual modality, the video tapes are an excellent enhancement to the text. Despite excellent descriptions in the text, however, I sometimes found myself wanting to see better use of the video medium. Too often the author is shown simply talking, whereas the echocardiograms or animated illustrations to which he is referring could have been shown simultaneously on the video tape. He also could have been an insert while most of the screen showed the echocardiograms. In addition, a more effective video presentation would have included still-frames and better labels with arrows to identify the particular abnormalities being addressed. Nevertheless, this video tape series will enhance the understanding of intra-operative TEE for both cardiologists and anesthesiologists and permit a more effective working relation-ship with the cardiac surgeon.Joel M.

Analg. 90, 235 (2000)Video Seminars on Transesophageal Echocardiography (TEE) consists of eight video tapes and an accompanying soft-covered manual. Three sections on basic TEE techniques, four on applications of TEE in the intraoperative and critical care setting, and a self-assessment test compose the series. The first three chapters and video tapes describe in detail the step-by-step sequences of horizontal, vertical, and oblique plane imaging. Particular attention is given to economy of motion, eliminating repetitive maneuvers for the novice. Diagramatic representations of each tomographic window in the basic TEE exam are juxtaposed with actual black and white TEE images. These diagrams are extremely helpful for orienting the beginner to the tomographic windows used in the basic exam.The fourth and fifth chapters and videos describe TEE findings in a series of 22 cardiac surgical patients with mitral valve disorders (specifically flail mitral leaflet and mitral valve prolapse). Mitral valve pathologies are described from both an echocardiographic and surgical perspective using Carpentier nomenclature. Sample cases address both pathophysiologic and surgical approaches to mitral valve abnormalities. Post repair systolic anterior motion is presented and thoroughly discussed. The process of localizing mitral dysfunction and repair is presented in a logical and reproducible manner.Sections 6 and 7 review the uses of TEE in noncardiac surgery settings. TEE is used to evaluate and diagnose various hemodynamic and embolic insults during hip surgery. This is discussed in the format of both case presentations and didactic form. Critical care applications are presented in Section 7. Topics include regional wall motion abnormalities, atrial septal defect, ventricular septal defect, pericardial tamponade, and intracardiac masses. Representative cases are used to illustrate these TEE diagnoses.The final section consists of multiple-choice questions that test basic TEE interpretation and image recognition of real-time echocardiographic images. The questions address thoracic aortic pathology, ventricular dysfunction, atrial masses, native and prosthetic mitral valve function, aortic and tricuspid valve pathology, and left ventricular outflow tract pathology.The major emphasis of these TEE video seminars is simplification of a rather technical methodology of image acquisition and recognition. Particular attention is paid to economy of motion in attaining the echocardiographic windows utilized in the basic TEE exam. The tomographic diagrams in the tapes and book are very useful to the novice attempting to understand the three-dimensional orientation of TEE anatomy. Although mitral valve pathology and its surgical approaches are covered well, the aortic valve is not addressed as extensively. The case studies are a very valuable inclusion in the seminars because they logically review the nomenclature used to describe mitral valve pathology and other uses of TEE. In general, these seminars are an excellent primer for establishing the &quot;groundwork&quot; knowledge for further study of perioperative TEE.Anand Tewari, MD, Department of Anesthesiology, St. Francis Medical Center, Pittsburgh, PA"},{"Title":"Video Seminars on Transesophageal Echocardiography (Book and 8 Videos--NTSC - US Format)","review":"Clin.

Wells which produced a child, Anthony West. It was her relationship with her son that was the primary drama of Rebecca's life, and was the source of most of her unhappiness, though I can't say that she was a victim of this scenario, but rather a perpetrator of it.West's father left the family when Rebecca and her two older sisters were young, and it seems that this act of her father's colored the rest of her life with paranoia, insecurity and fear. While West built a name for herself as a critic (critics are those about whom writer Anne Lamott quoted the simile that critics are like those who come on the battle field after the battle has been fought and shoot the wounded) and as a fiction and nonfiction writer extraordinnaire, her private life was upsetting, tumultuous and painful for her and those who knew her due to her intensely unhealthy relationship with her son Anthony. (Did her father's dramatic and painful leavetaking create a personality disorder in the young Cicily Fairfield, her real name?)Though she did have a longterm marriage to a man not her son's father, she felt her own recriminations in this area as well due to her husband's longtime illness, his apparent infedelitites and her dissatisfactions with some aspects of their married life overall.This book does a wonderful job of, I think, objectively portraying both the power and accomplishment of Rebecca West the writer, and the pathetically sad, cloying, manipulative and bitter Rebecca West, the mother. She is someone about whom one might issue the judgment, \\"She did the best she could. Unfortunately, her best was unacceptable.\\" But only in the area of her motherhood. In her writing life, her best was beyond expectations.About her writing, this book is also incredibly illustrative. I was particularly interested in the chapters about her work on Black Lamb and Grey Falcon: A Journey through Yugoslavia, which is one of my favorite books. The level of commitment it took to produce this 1000-plus page book as an amalgam of several trips, using her conversations with her husband as a stand-in for the various arguments about Yugoslavia -- and the world -- that the reader might offer causes the reader of this book to feel sheer and total awe of the labor of which this book was the result . Her other work, her critical articles, her fiction, her books on treason and the Nuremburg trials, were approached in the same complete, exhausting, demanding way. (And the reader deeply wishes her work on Mexico, envisioned by West as being similar to Black Lamb would have been finished.)Rollyson's book was an incredibly engaging study on the life of a woman whose difficult personality probably made her the effective and insightful critic that she was. Her choice of pen name was probably indicative of who she was, though she perhaps would have been the last to be able to articulate that. Rebecca West was the name of an Ibsen character who was an outcast and was accused of bewitching others...Rollyson portrays West's excellence as a writer and her failures interpersonally with her son and her grandchildren without bias, and even as the reader can see that West would not have made a good friend, the reader roots for her, hopes for her, and follows her life with high interest and respect. I recommend this book, not only as a portrait of a writer, or of a woman, but of the times in which she lived and how an ambitious woman responded to them, where she succeeded, and where she failed."},{"Title":"Chaucer's world: A pictorial companion;","review":"This book creates a lively sense of everyday life during the medieval period, making the task of reading Chaucer's Canterbury Tales much more engaging and comprehensible. The author begins with maps of 14th century England with which to tie in events and locales from the poem. The old plan of the city of Canterbury is included, with discussion of the city's cathedral. Illustrations and explanations of the calendar and the zodiac, the three estates (branches of feudal society), pilgrims, pilgrim inns and village life, are clearly detailed. For each of the characters in the poem, the author shows authentic illustrations and describes in detail the role which that individual played in society. This is a valuable resource for the reader who wants to understand more deeply the historical context of The Canterbury Tales."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"I am not sure that there are words capable of painting an accurate picture of the emotions that this book evokes. It is the unbelievably powerful story of the Joad family. Their trek to what they hope is paradise in the West is anything but.While the story can evoke emotions in us, it seems that the characters have had to let go of any possible emotion to cope with the state of affairs in their lives. That is except for Tom (Jr.), incapable of containing his emotions- and because of that pays a price.It might be tough for us to imagine the world that the Joads were forced into. But it was not that long ago. It is an important part of (recent) American history that, I think, is often forgotten.This book is bleak. There is no silver-lining. But Steinbeck's honesty should be appreciated. He shows that many of the great things with which America entered the 20th Century, disappeared in the 1930s. In the story, even the talk of God, once central to their lives, disappears as the Joads and their compatriots battle the Depression."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"I mostly read Stephen King, Dean Koontz and true crime but when I worked at Talking Book World I decided to listen to a classic.

Who would of ever thought the journey of a poor American family could be as moving and filled with the American spirit to succed would provaile in such a detailed and moving experience."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"I first read &#65533;The Grapes of Wrath&#65533; about 15 years ago as an assignment in school. I HATED this book! I thought it was the most droll, boring, depressing piece of ... I had ever read, at that time anyway. I read it again a few years ago and was amazed at how wrong I had previously been! It may have just been the difference between reading something because I was forced to and reading something because I wanted to, or I may have just been too young and/or nave to appreciate it back then, I don&#65533;t know for sure.Anyway, since then, I have gone on to read every other book Steinbeck wrote, and this is by far my favorite! This is the quintessential American novel and Steinbeck is the quintessential American writer. His character development, historical knowledge, vivid imagery are amazing, and the underlying sediments of human goodwill in, granted, often depressing circumstances, should be an example to us all. The way that Rose of Sharon, by far, the most ego-centric character in the book, winds up committing the most self-less act brought me to tears every time I read this.Anyone who gives this book a bad review is either too young and inexperienced to appreciate it (as I was when I first did), or doesn&#65533;t know a thing about literature. Have a mentioned that this is my all-time favorite read (besides also &#65533;To Kill A Mockingbird&#65533;)?P.S. If you do like this, I would also HIGHLY recommend Woody Guthrie&#65533;s &#65533;Seeds of Man&#65533;, another, much more humorous Okie tale.Also, if your into Steinbeck, check out \\"In Dubious Battle\\", the 2nd best book he wrote."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"This book is undoubtedly one of the greatest books ever written. It is Steinbeck's classic, which is really saying something. I've read some bad reviews here (though one spelled the name of the family wrong), but I just don't know how anyone can give this book 1 star.The Grapes of Wrath is the essential story of that time period, as it perfectly sums up the Dust Bowl and the Depression era American. Out of this setting, Steinbeck creates vivid characters that you will not soon forget.This book is not, however, uplifting. Yes it is pessimistic, but he is trying to make a point. And it can also be dry at times, though when you finish it I believe you will have found it well worth the read."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"This is easily one of the best books that I have ever read. I was one of the few in my 12th grade english/history class that read the entire thing from cover to cover. It tells the story of the Joad family during the great depression and the dust bowl. They make their way from their desolate farm land in the mid-west to california to find work in the many orchards and farms. This is an american epic that no one should skip reading. The only one complaint that I and many other people have with the book is the last line or two. It does not ruin the book but really hurts it's quality."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"I say that because this book will leave you despondent. If you're already poor, this book might not inspire you to succeed. It might make you feel like you can't.The book is incredibly written and the intercalary chapters are informative and educational.Everybody should read and learn from this book but be sure to read something inspiring when you're through to build you back up mentally."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"This book was quite simply one of the most powerful novels ever. Any serious reader will be moved, inspired and humbled by Steinbeck's emotional, rythmic masterpiece."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"The first John Steinbeck book i read, but absolutely not the last. The authors vivid descriptive language draws one into the world as it looked like in USA at the time. Being non-american it really helped me understand a lot of the time being - and in addition to the history-lessons ;) I also felt that i had spend a great time with a great book. Certainly a 20th century classic. I love it. Now you go read it."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"It's a shame that the majority of people who read this book are forced to do so as a school assignment. I don't think you can fully embrace the scope of this work with the anxiety of a report hanging over your head. I was fortunate in that, I was able to read it just because I chose to. I found myself becoming completely absorbed by the book, to the level that it started to seem as if it were a part of my life. I actually felt empty after I had finished it, sort of the way you feel when you leave a loved one for an extended period of time.I would also like to point out, that I am not what you would call a bookworm. I read about 3 or 4 books a year, generally in the summer. I started reading this book while on vacation. I had just finished Hemingway's &quot;The old man and the sea&quot;. For those not familiar with the old man and the sea, it's less than 100 pages long. It took me the same amount of time to read both books (1 week). I think this speaks volumes about how engrossed I became with the grapes of wrath, considering it is over 600 pages.I have only seen bits and pieces of the film version, but I found it helpful to be able to put the face of Henry Fonda on Tom Joad. I do plan on viewing the film version, but somehow doubt that it could be that true to the book. I am curious how the film version will end. Based on the era that the film was made, I doubt that they can end the same.The ending is the only thing I found disappointing about the book. As I read toward the last few pages, I started to realize that it would not end in any sort of finality, unless it were a catastrophic tragedy. If ever a book needed a sequel, this one begs for it.If you read this book as a student, and as part of an assignment, I would highly recommend re-reading it. It has the potential to make one realize just how fortunate most of our lives are, and how insignificant most of our problems are."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"I had to read this book for my Honors English Class. I thought it was going to be boring but I read the first 250 pages in one sitting. It was a good book. I did not like the ending but it was still a good book."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"It amazes me that people found this book boring. I read 300 pages in one sitting and found that Steinbeck provided a vivid account of life in the early part of the century. Too often we forget that there was something besides two World Wars in the early 1900's. I encourage those of you who gave it poor reviews to re-read when you are a little older. I think when you have matured and experienced the real world, this book will have much more meaning."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"Amid so many people disliking this book, I love it. The length can throw off a few people, but when I decided to read it, it only ended up taking a few days. Steinbeck is brilliant and shines once again"},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"This book was excellent. When I first saw it, I wasn't too sure about it since it was over 600 pages long, but once I started reading it, I couldn't put it down. It was not only insightful, but also a key historical novel. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"This book gives a thorough and blunt look at the lives of the Family that travel from Oklahoma to California in search of work. It is still as well read today as it was nearly 60 years ago when it won John Steinbeck the Pulitzer Prize. Tragedy and the endurance of the human spirit has never been so well captured on paper."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"\`The Grapes Of Wrath' was the unforgettable story of a migrant family who suffer from hardships and the depression of nineteen thirty three, and forced from their drought-ridden farm and lured to the paradise and serene fields of California."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"I usually prefer historical fiction like The Triumph and the Glory, or The Killer Angels, or the Aubrey/Maturin books by O'Brian, but John Steinbeck has always been a favorite of mine, and I recently ordered a new copy of The Grapes of Wrath from amazon.com, just finished it, and remember now why Steinbeck is one of our greatest writers."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"A remarkable story of the adverse livng conditions during the depression.

The story will haunt you. A masterpiece.I could not recommend it more."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"I am no literary expert, but this book has to be one of the best I have read. Its depiction of suffering and the (sometimes losing) battle against adversity is something which should always be remembered in a country which likes to highlight that its &quot;American Dream&quot; is open to all. It is important not to forget what happened to real people in the past - how can we improve the present if we don't learn our lessons from the past?"},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"Hi, I am not going to tell you my name, But I will tell you that I am 11 Years old and in the 6th grade, I read this book for an advanced English project ( When tested i was found to read 400 words a minute) and I absolutely devoured it. it was a very very discriptive, detailed book. If I were asked to read more of Mr. Stienbecks books, I would definitely exept READILY. In fact, although I hav'nt been asked to yet, the next time i go to the library I think i will see about getting some more of his books.P.S. Just for the record, I started this book on the evening of Sunday, October 25th and finished on Wednesday, October 28th"},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"I really liked this book. I was forced into reading it by my AP English teacher. I'm glad she did, because I really enjoyed it. The gruesomness of the animal killing wasn't great, but I overlooke that. I like his style, and it's amazing that an older book can create an effect like it did to me."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"I have not quiet finished this book yet and I am wishing this book would never end. The Joads symbolize more than just their era. They are paradigms for persecuted people everywhere. There search for simple decency is one that is brilliantly written by Steinbeck. His commentary between chapters is outstanding and gives us poignant scenarios of the time that echo today. Please take the time to indulge this book. I thought it would take me a long time to finish it, instead it has taken me by storm and 12 days into it I have 110 pps left. Which is the only reason I have yet to give it 5 stars."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"This has to be the most real and emotional American novel ever written. It's a book that intimately describes people to whom you'd never give a second glance, showing them as intelligent, stupid, loving, hateful, hopeful, and familiar."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"I am a junior in high school, and our class just read this novel. I was appalled at some of the reviews given by other people. They must not have grasped the concept of the novel. Steinbeck's purpose was not to criticize or complain, but to inform by creating a fictional family in a real-life scenario from the past. He uses detailed diction, colloquialism, and an extended syntax full of methaphors to add vivacity and keep the reader interested! This is a great novel and an important lesson about the past for people in society."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"Every epoch or so a book comes along that gives you a painful insight into the nature of man in the face of suffering and the most abject of circumstance. &quot;The Grapes of Wrath&quot; is one of those books.The book exemplifies in each moment, between its powerful essays interlaced in an intense story of survival and compassion in the face of the greatest adversity. Steinbeck defines the greatest elements of man, defining the vital passion that separates him from his bestial predecessors. And he demonsrates his brilliance and the insurmountable power of his diction by containing all the power and suffering that man must overcome in life with the mere description of a turtle crossing the road.I'm am a lover of novels, perpetually immersing myself in books. But of them all, this shines as my favorite novel, and has changed my life in a way that I cannot describe."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"I chose to read The Grapes of Wrath as part of my English coursework and found it a truly amazing book. The imagery was so powerful, it actually feels like you are there with the Joads, sharing their trials and tribulations. I reccommend this book to everybody, please do not reject it as too long or too descriptive; if read carefully, you will find that it is all part of Steinbeck's effect of creating the reality of the awful treatment of the Joads and the plight of the migrants of Oklahoma. (If anybody shares my view, them please e-mail me with your ideas as I need to make a collation of information for my coursework -thanks!)"},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"I recently read this book, being forced to do so by my college level English course. I can clearly see from this work the reasons why Steinbeck eventually received a Nobel Prize. His syntax is creative, clear, understandable for those with less progressed vocabularies, but intriging enough for those with greater knowledge to remain intrested. However, this ending is quite vulgar, but, if taken on another level, it shows how Rose of Sharon grown. The end also leaves the audience guessing what happens next."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"Here is a book about a family living in the most desperate of conditions. In fact, as the book proceeds, you come to realise that not only has this family lost its land - its home and livelihood for generations - but that they are also in danger of losing their lives, to of all things, starvation.Today, with our Western economies booming, low unemployment, improving standards of living, most of us desperate to lose weight rather than gain it, it's easy to take for granted the simple things in life: a roof over your head, enough food to eat, running hot and cold water, the respect and friendship of your fellow countrymen, the health of yourself and your family.What most impressed me about this 58-year-old book is that it made me understand something of what it must have been like for those people that made the terribly hard journey to California. I understood their dreams of finding a new home, new friends, new jobs, new life. I understood their fears as news started to filter through that things might not be so wonderful in the new world after all, that the future was increasingly uncertain. I understood their desperation as their loved ones began to leave or die, and their hunger began to grow.As the book proceeded, I grew to feel that these characters - Tom, the Preacher, Ma, Pa, Rose of Sharon, Winfield, etc. were real people, people I wanted to overcome the terrible treatment they received, to succeed, to survive.It shocked me that such horrors could have occurred just 60 years ago in the wealthiest country on the planet. Surely, if it can happen in America, it can happen anywhere. We know that many people in Africa and Asia still live in such squalor. Perhaps similar deprevations are now being inflicted upon the Russian people.Solzhenitsyn's &quot;A day in the life of Ivan Denisovich&quot; gives a moving account of a man living for his next meal in a prison camp. However, it is all the more shocking when you see a whole family living (or dying) this way.The ending of &quot;The Grapes of Wrath&quot; provides a shocking image, even by today's cynical and graphic standards. Even now, over a month since I finished reading the book, I cannot shake this image from my head. Perhaps that is the best tribute I can pay it: even after all these years, it's a book that still has the power to shock."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"This book was pretty good, but I think it could have laid back on the details. Overall, though, I think it was an O.K. book. I recommed it for high- school readers."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"No one really needs my opinion, this book is a CLASSIC. I recommend reading all of John Steinbeck's books and short stories, especially this book."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"I bought this book to help me understand the depression in a macroeconomics class and although it has its slow points it really is an interesting and well detailed book. Recommend this for ANY college student!"},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"The only thing I can say about the purchase that was somewhat negative, was not realizing that the year of print was different from the copy we had taken out from the library. We decided to buy, since the book was due and had not been read through. All the notes taken on particular pages had to be searched for in the new book since the pages were different. A lesson learned!"},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"Everything was great with the ordering process; however, there was an awful lot of notes and underlining from the previous owner in the first couple of chapters. This, to me, disqualifies it from being 'like new' by any stretch of the imagination. Then again, what did I really expect for under $.50? I would recommend being a little more honest about the range of conditions that can be expected."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"The writing in general,plot and character development,and settings were magnificent. The only criticism I have is that the book ended too soon!"},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"I really enjoyed this book, which is surprising because it was a summer reading book. I don't really know why I liked it. Maybe it was because you really got into the story and wanted to know what would happen to the Joads. Or maybe it was because you just really liked all the dynamic characters. Well, whatever it was, it made the book great. So... READ IT!!!"},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"Steinbeck is the best American writer of his time. His power of observation is amazingly acute. Recommended reading for anyone interested in understanding the depression era."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"At first I was very skeptical about how much I would like The Grapes of Wrath, but I was pleasantly surprised when I found it to be extremely readable and engrossing. The story is not at all dull, the characters are pleasant, and even the feel of the book is comfortable(the paper is not starchy and hard to handle like so many novels). I would most definitely recommend this book to anyone looking for a beautiful read that not only provokes the mind but also the senses.PS: read it, you won't get the same effect from cliff's notes"},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"The Grapes of Wrath is in my mind the best american novel ever written. I began by liking the movie and then read the book. Important deatales are left out of the movie and they should be featured. This book shows the struggle of a family unaceppted everywhere they go. It shows the prejudices felt by people just because they are different and don't know the way of life in California. It is a wonderful book and everyone should read it."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"John Steinbeck wrote The Grapes of Wrath in 1939 on account of the great dust bowl in the 1920's. This horrible blight upon the land caused the topsoil to be literally non-existent; choking off crops of grapes, corn, and other crops that tenant workers of the time depended on for every day survival.The Grapes of Wrath is indisputably Steinbeck's best novel ever written, and is one of the best and most well known novels in history. The Grapes of Wrath also brought Steinbeck a Nobel Prize in literature, and world praise for his realistic depictions of daily, southern California life on the ranch, and the troubles that eat at the inhabitants daily.The Grapes of Wrath is a story that starts out with tom, a regular man, who is in search of his family. Tom soon finds out that his family has been forced to move to California the land of \\"new opportunities,\\" because the bank had repossessed everyone's land in that region for the growth of cotton, since the soil was so bad. Along the way, however, the family undergoes many hardships such as lack of money, food, and low, tired spirits. Finally, the family reaches a fertile valley in southern California where peaches are grown. The family picks the peaches for the farm, but soon loose their dream job due to difficulties. The family must now resume their search for a suitable job that is capable of supporting the over ten members of the family. The question is, will the family get their needs met by the new job, or will they find that hardships are too difficult in California, and they must move elsewhere? Steinbeck used chapters in the book describing the main family of the novel, but meant to be a broader, more generalized group. The dialogue in these chapters is not suggested with quotations, but is rather noticed by the reader through the different tones. This gives the further impression of hardship by allowing the reader to make associations to ones that they know whom have gone through the likewise.Steinbeck's classic novel, The Grapes of Wrath is a very sad book, however shows a very realistic view of life at that time and location. It shows themes of endurance through hardship, the importance of family, and that one day, a hope may be come upon, no matter how hard it may be to get there. For Steinbeck's great story telling capabilities, as well as his great usage of local dialogue, intricate character description, and portrayal of daily life, I deem this one of the best novels that I have ever read, and I gladly recommend it to all those who are up for a good classic."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"The Grapes of Wrath tells the story of the Joad family, a poor farming family who have been forced off their land and journeyed west to California in search of prosperity. The story of their continuing hardships gives the reader a personal connection to the plight of the poor population during the Depression.This was an excellent novel, putting the human face on one of the darkest periods of our American history."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"This is a wonderful story that will take you on an often painful journey. The characters are so vivid and one can really emapathize for what they are going through. The story tells the larger story of a nation in transformation. No longer will small farmers be able to compete with large corporations. The spirit and determination of Ma is admirable as she maintains perspective and hope in the face of so many tribulations. This is a story of survival and the strength of family."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"The gem has it all. Humor (you'll laugh out loud at some of the scenes), frustration, beautiful imagery not difficult to understand and ulimately, love. You will believe the ultimate triumph of love and compassion we have for each other as family no matter who we're born to. Let yourself see the pictures in your head Steinbeck gracefully describes as he writes. It's not hard. It's not difficult reading. If nothing else, read the part about the one-eyed man getting hilarious, believable advice about how to succeed with women. Great laughs!"},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"Truthfully the only reason I read this novel is because it was part of my summer reading assignment this year for highschool. Somehow being told you HAVE to read a book rather than wanting to on your own makes the reading experience something to dread. Well all I can say is I am SO GLAD I HAD TO READ THIS!!!This is probably one of the best books I have ever read. I have added it to my list of favorites way up there with Animal Farm (people think 'cause they read it in junior high it's for kids, WHATEVER!!)and Wuthering Heights. Every chapter is a feast for the mind. You can picture ever bead of sweat, every loss and tear as if it were right there in front of you. The story goes from humorous, to serious, to hopeful, to emotional so quickly you almost don't realize it's there till it hits you.The story takes place in the 30's based on real events, following the fictional accounts of the Joad family. Apparently back then, there was a crisis where farmers had overworked their land to the point where the soil had been reduced to worthless dust annd could no longer grow crops. The bank then had to take it from them because, well, god forbid they lose any money. Thousands, maybe millions of people were kicked out from their homes, the homes that their grandfathers had built, where children had been born and lives been lived. They were forced to all move west to California, selling what little they had for cash, dreaming of a new life. Flyers promised work and good pay, but when only 10,000 workers are needed, and 100,000 see the flyers and come looking for work, what happens then?This is a story of survival. Not like in that movie Cast Away where he's stranded on a deserted island with no food or anything, but a time not unlike today. A place filled with stores and restaurants and yet a man still can't feed his children and they are dying from malnutrition. How can you buy food if you don't have any money? and how can you make money if there aren't any jobs? \\"water water everywhere and not a drop to drink\\". And hungry men become desperate, which turns into fear, which becomes anger, and this makes teh Californians afraid. So wages drop to pay for security, to pay for more sheriffs and police and spies, and all the while this anger grows...Like I said this is a wonderful book. I'm so glad I read it.Some parts were so touching I actually cried a little. They weren't even necessarily sad but very moving. Anyway, I recommend this book to everyone as a great read. Yeah and to the person who said teenagers can't appreciate a book like this, I guess I just proved you wrong."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"Steinbeck's Graphes of Wrath is an amazing book. I recommend this read to anyone who enjoys Steinbeck's style of writing. It is an excellent story."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"Forget about SAT success, SAT key and other useless stuff -This is the real thing. I raised my verbal by 160 points just after reading it (note that I didn't use any other prep material - just the book!) Considering the fact that I'm an international applicant, and English is not my first language - I guess any IVY-caliber kid should definitely buy it and make sure he memorizes every unknown word he comes across."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"I was assigned this book in English to write an essay on, and I saw the length and was a bit dismayed to see the least. But, as I read through it the plot developed into something a reader can appreciate and understand. Steinbeck's small 'metaphorical' chapters (that occur seemingly in every other chapter) enhance the message of the book. When I finished this novel 600 or so pages later, I realized my attitude towards life had changed. You come out for better or worse, a little different after reading this book."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"I was much more impressed by Steinbeck's distinctive writing style than I was with the general concept of the book. The author brings characters to life better than any book I've ever read. It's very difficult not to be enthralled while reading The Grapes Of Wrath. The book has historical value, and sentimental value aswell. And it just simply belongs in any personal collection."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"I did not expect to like this book because I hated Of Mice and Men, but I really liked it a lot. Although slow at times, I thought the way that the plot was layed out, and the strange inter-chapters were intrigueing. The story was extremely believable, and I found myself wanting to know what would happen to the Joads next.This is truly a great piece of American literature. I'm glad I was forced to read it in English! :)"},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"&quot;The Grapes of Wrath&quot; takes place in the 30's. It starts with Nate Joad coming back from prison to his hometown in Oklahoma. He returns to find that the banks are repossessing land because the farmers could no longer afford to pay their loans back. (Also, the stock market crashed which brought &quot;The Great Depression&quot;) When he returned his family was evicted from their land and living at their parents (his grandparents) house. The family had received fliers about California. From there, they decide to head west. The Joads loaded up the old Studebaker truck, full with all belongings, and went to &quot;Get their kicks on Route 66&quot;. Which was the only highway connecting east and west coast. Many problems were encountered on the way there. This is where life took on a whole different meaning.This book was like a real person. It had flaws, imperfections, but also had character and personality of it's own. &quot;The Grapes of Wrath&quot; wondered in and out of little sub stories while, all the way it kept on a main story. The little sub stories served a purpose though, they all had a little meaning that built into the main one. Sometimes the sub stories became a nuisance, because when the real story was getting interesting, it switch to something else. The book was also slightly long winded, but was still well done all in all."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"Ordered book for school...exactly as described and very good price. Fast shippin ghad book in plenty of time for class"},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"I'm sure you already know this book is set in the struggling Great Dust Bowl era. What fun to be taken back to a time I've never lived in, and read such poetic descriptive language. You rarely find anything like this in today's novel; imaginative and expressive in detail."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"Another book group choice that I openly groaned about at first. I have only read one other of this authors books, \\"Of Mice and Men\\", and while I loved that book (and the film) I thought that this book would be a painful struggle to get through.I was right about it being a struggle to read and almost gave up at page 105. However, I am glad that I kept on reading to the end. It is a book that has many different facets to it and will make a thoroughly interesting discussion for a book group.The story is a hard one to read because it is just still too real in today's society, where there is enough for everyone but the rich would rather destroy it than distribute it to the needy. Now I am not a Socialist by any description but this book certainly did make me think strong and hard about it. I am looking forward to discussing this aspect of the book with my Russian friend who was brought up in the most extreme end of the socialist scale in Russia.The writing style was varied throughout the book. Some parts of it were very descriptive and emotional and really drew me into the feelings of the characters while there were whole chapters that I thought were just too wordy and did not add significantly to the book as a whole. I, initially, struggled with the vernacular of the migrants on the road but eventually got used to their way of speaking and, in fact, it made it feel more real to me and put me beside them in their lives.The ending was intense and somewhat shocking to me but it did give me back some hope in the goodness of humans that had been stripped from me by the rest of the book.4 out of 5 with one star deducted because it was a struggle and could not be described as an enjoyable read and would not be for everyone. I would suggest starting with \\"Of Mice and Men\\" if you have not read any of this authors works before as I think this book would put you off reading any of his other books. However, put it on your list of books to read before you die.Why is it usually those that have nothing that will give everything to help a fellow person! And that is my closing thought."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"I ordered these books to help my niece who is a high school English teacher and has no budget and no library at her school.She was thrilled!"},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"One of my favorite books of all time.

I am in love with this book and with the Joads."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"John Steinbeck is a mastermind. I had to read this book for a class and was reluctant. it became quickly an enjoyable read I recommended to many friends."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"The Grapes of Wrath is a well written, intriguing, darn good book. I was truly impressed by the art and detail that is put into this novel. The book begins with the telling of the truly hospitable conditions that farmers in the south-eastern plains were experiencing. The story follows a family named the Joad's and their desire and pursuit to get to California in search of work, easier times, and a happy life. Tom Joad, who is the main character in the book, is one who I became attached to early on, because of his rash and hasty nature, but kind and merciful attitude. His journey and growth really captured me through-out the whole book.The theme of the book was quite interesting. Humanism, unity, family, and the concept of the Oversoul persist in being the top reasons behind all the events that transpire in the book. The concept of Humanism, family, and the moral reasoning of leaving no man behind are powerful things. Ma Joad, mother of Tom, demonstrates the greatest form of humanism and family, by always wanting to help others in need, and making sure that people were working together to accomplish goals. She is also the one person in the family that is constantly trying to keep the family intact and functioning. Ma even gets physical when she feels her family is going to be broken up. This leads to the next theme, which is unity. Unity is shown in both the camps of people that the Joad's come across, and in a bigger sense of family, the community. The groups of people that the family stumbles across are groups in which everyone had a place, and people worked for the benefit of each other, not themselves. This is something that really takes a mental toll on some of the main characters, who go on to enact their newfound sense of place. Jim Casy, a former preacher, joins the Joad's early on in the book, and is really trying to figure out how to help people who are in need of spiritual help. He comes upon the idea of a shared soul, and no one person being separated from another. This concept of the Oversoul has a profound effect on both Tom and Jim Casy, who make steps towards who they are going to become through-out the book.This is a book that I truly do like, for all the detail and gritty realness of the whole situation that many people were in. However, it can get very dry, very quickly. The first part of the book definitely takes it's time to pick up, which it does, and it becomes very interesting after that point. The character development was excellent and I became enticed with the people surrounding the story.I recommend this book to those who want to read about the harsh conditions and times that people went through, but beware of some long, uninteresting conversations about life."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"Amazing story of dignity and the human will to survive. Very dark, Very well written. Steinbeck tells a gripping story."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"Very interesting and compelling. Much of it is based on the notes of a lady who actually lived through this experience and happened to run into Steinbeck and shared her notes with him. Her own book was not published until 2002 a year before she passed away."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"This book is the tits. I'm totally a Joadie (roadie for the Joad's) after reading this Steinbeck ca-lasssic. Bravo sir!"},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"SPOILER THREAT: MINIMAL. I've tried to stay general as much as possible.The Grapes of Wrath makes you feel vulnerable and exposed to a monster greater than all of us. It doesn't take much, a couple seasons of drought (in this case), you miss those payments, and pretty soon the bank has your house. What can you do? You struggle to find a place to live or find a place to die. The dustbowl isn't what makes us vulnerable, it's the system itself; tragedy like this can strike for many reasons, and therefore is, in essence, inevitable.Steinbeck was an incredible talent. A lot of reviewers have said the book is slow, but I disagree. The plot moves forward immediately, but I think reviewers are responding to a plot that sneaks up on the reader and Steinbeck's emphasis on voice. He alternates his voice seemingly effortlessly between the Oklahoman drawl in chapters devoted specifically to the protagonist Joad family and the other chapters that magnify the tragedy to multitudes of families suffering a similar fate.Not only is Steinbeck brilliant with his use of voice, but his understanding of cool transcends time. Tommy Joad is straight up cool, and he's as cool today as he ever was. The world loves a man that does what needs to be done: supporting his family, being a strong leader and brother, but also when circumstances force him to action, Tom won't back down, up to and including killing a man (or two), going to prison, and possibly leading a communist revolution. I'm not advocating these actions, but you can't argue what a great character Tommy makes.There is also a great deal of gender role development throughout. When things are good, the family is structured one way, but as things go bad, the family structure must react, or adapt. Characters are pushed to their limits and strength is shown as both a masculine trait, but also as a subtle and often deeper feminine trait. Some writers seem capable of writing dialogue for only one sex, but Steinbeck proves himself to be a master of both.Another common complaint is that the ending disappoints. I assume those that didn't complain, probably went out and hung themselves. Yes, it's a depressing book! That's the point. When things get bad, you have to do unbearable things to survive. The worse things get, the farther the Joad family is willing to go to help their family and others. The events push the limit of human endurance. You think this book would be worth reading if the Joad family found steady work and lived happily ever after? But the ending is also beautiful in a way, exemplifying love and unity of man. It's unpredictable through omission and inclusion. It's worth it, so finish the book.The Grapes of Wrath is powerful, memorable, and remains relevant to modern society; it is truly a classic work of literature."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"Never read it as a kid, kinda glad because so much would have been lost on an adolescent mind. As a &#34;seasoned&#34; adult, I can see Steinbeck's political viewpoint come through in a way I would not have been aware of had I read it 30 -40 ago.

The people are uneducated yet there is so much wisdom in what they say. I don&#8217;t think I have ever enjoyed a book this much."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"Steinbeck's novel of social injustice was from the beginning considered a Great American Novel selling over 300,000 copies in its first year, \\"a phenomenon on the scale of a national event. It was publicly banned and burned by citizens, it was debated on national radio hook-ups; but above all, it was read.\\" Steinbeck scholar John Timmerman sums up the book's impact: \\"The Grapes of Wrath may well be the most thoroughly discussed novel - in criticism, reviews, and college classrooms - of twentieth century American literature.\\" Within a year John Ford made a major movie starring Henry Fonda and in 1962 the Nobel committee cited The Grapes of Wrath as a \\"great work\\" and as one of the committee's main reasons for granting Steinbeck the Nobel Prize for Literature.Perhaps it's most fundamental message is the equality of life, there is no difference between the poor and rich, other than a bank account, all life is sacred. Treat a poor person with dignity and respect and they will and can do as well as anyone else. It is a timeless message and one that bears constant repeating, although Steinbeck's treatment is a bit folksy and sentimental.Contemporary critic Carl Van Doren said \\"This novel did more than any other Depression novel to revise the picture of America as Americans imagined it.\\" The American image of the frontier pioneer moving westward had shifted to the Joad family. The Joads encapsulated the American character and spirit of independence, scrappy can-do hard-working virtuous, an American hero archetype. Martin Seymour-Smith says the work is fundamentally flawed because Steinbeck can not show why the California businessmen's behavior is wrong - after all, they are just trying to make a living, would the Joad's in their shoes have acted any different? \\"There is a conflict in him [Steinbeck] between the philosophical unanimist and the humane socialist,\\" in other word how the Joad's treat animals (as objects) but demand equality in humans. Thus the books message of all life being sacred, no matter its circumstance, is fundamentally contradicted.In the end Grapes of Wrath is of epic proportions and a gripping story. It's often seen as the quintessential American novel of the 1930s and certainly one of Steinbeck's best (along with Of Mice and Men)."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"As a quick comment, the ending of the book is different from the movie. The book is a bit more depressing, especially near the end. Overall, the movie and the book are similar in plot, but here in the book the reader will find much more detail. In short, the book is a literary masterpiece while the movie is good but not great.I came across an Amazon.com \\"Listmania\\" list for the top 10 American works of fiction. I had read a few of the books, but not all so I decided to buy all those that I had not read. These include the present book, and some that I have now read and posted reviews including Lolita by Vladimir Nabokov and On the Road by Jack Kerouac. All of the books have been interesting reads and not what I had expected - lots of surprises.When I bought the present book I did not realize that this book is actually two books in one. There is a 44 page introduction (what I call the first book) by the Steinbeck scholar Robert DeMott. His introduction is much longer than I had anticipated. This is in fact a mini-biography that describes Steinbeck's state of mind prior to and during the writing of the book. Also DeMott describes Steinbeck's life leading up to the book and what happens after the success of Grapes of Wrath. In addition, DeMott has \\"suggestions for further reading\\". So I would recommend the present book.It is hard for me to rate the Grapes of Wrath since it has become something of a classic with about 15 million copies or more in print. The rating is a bit subjective, but I would say 5 stars, even if it was not famous. The book is a \\"reality fiction\\" or simply realism, i.e.: pure fiction but like many other fiction writers it is based on real events that are accurately described and has a few characters based on friends of the author.Steinbeck received both praise and criticism for the book. Many thought he had exaggerated the problems of the migrant workers. But as explained by DeMott if anything Steinbeck who had first hand working experiences with the migrant worker has slightly moderated the descriptions of the hardships faced by the migrants as presented in the book, and in no fashion did he exaggerate their problems.This is a very interesting book and I would highly recommend buying and reading. It seems that the world has not changed that much since 1939. We still have migrant workers working under bad conditions although they are no longer from Oklahoma. They have been replaced by illegal aliens from Mexico, eager for the jobs. We still have some corporations and politicians trying to deny the reality of the hardships and issuing counter propaganda. We have perhaps even more problems today such as global warming, also denied by some. The world has not changed in 65 years - but the book is still of interest and perhaps even timely."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"Just finished the book. I spent the first 1/3 of this book not very interested at all. I appreciated Steinbeck's passages showing the workings of capitalism, but found the dialoge to be pretty artificial and, since so much of the book is dialogue, found reading it pretty grating. About halfway throuh I was finally able to suspend disbelief and forgave the bad dialogue. I suppose by then I was deep enough inside the world of the book that I was willing to accept the dialogue as real - like one might accept the dialogue in bible translations. By this time, I was pretty interested in the story, but still not convinced I was reading a great book. Good, not great. This view continued until the last few paragraphs. I don't know what more to say but the ending took my head off. Wow. Its almost an hour later and I'm still having brief fits of tears. The ending was both devastating and inspiring. For a writer to manage that is genius.Whatever you do, don't skip to the end. Saving it will be so worth it."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"The Grapes of Wrath, by John Steinbeck was the book I read for learning more about the 1930's decade and was a very interesting book to me, and overall helped me understand more about the Great Depressions and what it was about. I'll admit I wasn't too excited about reading The Grapes Of Wrath, but to be honest I liked it a lot. To be honest, I did not know a whole lot about the Great Depression, just some of the really general, easy facts that most people know, or at least I would hope knew. I knew when it was, how the stock market crashed, and how there were very few jobs available. This book helped me understand what the depression was all about because it gave me a personal tale of someone living during this particular time in history. The main character, Tom, is released from jail and goes back to his family farm. After being gone for four years, he realizes most of his neighbors have disappeared, and one of the town preachers tells him that everyone went to California to find jobs. So Tom and his family travel over there, even though it takes forever because everyone is on the same highway to California, they eventually make it. As they arrive at California, one of the immigrants tells the Joad family that there are barely any jobs and throughout the rest of the book, they struggle to make money and keep their family alive throughout this hardship.For me, it is hard to imagine that a personal story like this was probably very common for families during the 1930's. It was sad to read that many of Tom's relatives actually died on the trip over to California because the conditions were so rough. Before I read this book, I thought there were some similarities between the depression and all the job losses going on right now, but now I cannot even compare them because they are so different. Sure, people have lost a lot of their jobs right now, and although that may be tragic for that single family, it is nothing like what happened in the late 20's and early 30's. Families had no means of getting food for themselves because in the book it talked about how many of the factory owners were scared of a workers strike, so they made sure that there weren't many jobs for them to have.Later on in The Grapes of Wrath, it explained how when the Joads were done picking for cotton season, they must return home to find work, but rumors around the country were that there wasn't going to be any jobs at all for the next three months. That may not seem like a lot, but 90 days is along time with no income. I was so interested after I read this book because it made me really appreciate everyone who lived through that tough time and made it out stronger. We should not judge any single person, or their past, because unless we are put in the exact same situation, we can't really have an informed opinion on it. I think from this book I realized how many really hard years that our country went through, and that it is all worth it because it can only make us stronger and give everyone hope to make things right again in the future. Personally I would recommend this book to anyone."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"I hadn't read Steinbeck since high school and I have to admit that the brilliance of his work escaped me then. It didn't this time. This book is impressive on many levels. Steinbeck has captured the reality of life in America during the Depression like few others. In doing so, he has also captured a snapshot of America that is both poignant and enlightening. The greatest works of art and literature transcend themselves beyond the immediate and become timeless and that is very much the case here. Most readers will find they have little in common with the Joad family and yet Steinbeck portrays the human side of an Oklahoma family so well that most every reader can relate to them. Steinbeck's brilliance is apparent in his ability to portray and to relate the human condition. It is also apparent in creating a work of vision that is both immense in scope and finite in detail. Oddly, in a tragic story largely full of despair, Steinbeck still manages to communicate a sense of optimism and hope for our society. This book is worth reading more than once and I have to agree with its rating in the top 10 of the century."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"This book like no other one before it or after it expresses the dire situations that captalism and the endless need for profit that is built into the human psyche can create for our race. Steinbeck, a moderate leftist, portrays a family of &quot;Dust Bowl&quot; migrants as they travel through the Midwest to California, to seek land and new jobs(the banks supported by the government[in many cases being the same thing] pushed millions of people off their land at the time), but when they arrive all they find is people who are so corrupted by money and an endless fear of loss of capital that they do not offer the family any support or aid.Steinbeck wrote this book as a summation of real events that happened in the 1930's. His book realizes the need for social change in America and the world. It does not make anyone look &quot;evil&quot; or &quot;bad.&quot; It simply makes the system humanity follows seem like the one tearing us apart. Just one of the things that makes this novel maybe the best one ever written. If only steinbeck was alive today, maybe he'd write a novel or two to take Bush down."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"\`The Grapes of Wrath' is one of the most famous books written by John Steinbeck, and it also is largely praised as one of his best works. The book received a Pulitzer Prize and was made into an Award winning movie. This novel is one of the best when it comes to portrait the consequences of the Great Depression in the life of poor families that were forced to leaver their homeland to search for food and jobs.The narrative is filled with details of the landscape and the people. The main characters are the Joad family who embarks in a road trip to California, where they expect to find a better life. Throughout this journey they run into every sort of people --good and bad -- that will help, or not, them. Every new stop is a new challenge for the family, a new barrier to overcome.Not only is the story beautiful, but also very compelling. Steinbeck created an unforgettable portrait of those lives, which were so sad and difficult. One of the major qualities of \`The Grapes of Wrath' is the language. While the narrator has a clear and grammar-perfect voice, the author could reproduce the dialogues with perfection. They were written in the way those migrants would talk. It is difficult for the contemporary reader, but not impossible. Such device requires more attention of the reader, but it gives more pleasure once one gets used to this language.This novel interweaves two different kinds of chapters. In one of them the writer sets a general view of the migrants, their way of life, their habitat and such. In the other he talks about the Joads. Using such device, he makes the Joads' story universal. This single family could be everyone's who has to leave their homeland to find job and food in another place. The problems this family face are very down to earth. And, this kind of thing still happens everywhere.With \`The Grapes of Wrath', John Steinbeck created a story that criticizes not only the ferocious capitalism, but, above all, the human nature. The evil nature that always wants more and more, and that doesn't mind exploiting, deceiving and hurting other people to fulfill its ambitions."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"This is an utterly poignant tale - a reading experience that rends the human spirit. My week-long journey with The Grapes of Wrath is an intimate one because it has the expressions of passions whether tragic or bitter that have been beautifully written, an ingenious verisimilitude that is as close as a personal story. Although this intimacy is only but a woof of the awesome fabric, the warp is its universal allure; its actions - alive, soulful, depressing and frank that appeal to any man and woman regardless of experience and race.The Grapes of Wrath reflects the hellish downpour of misery upon the farmers who lived and loved their land as much as their life but whose farms have been encroached by capitalists whose only concern is profit and wealth at the expense of the abuse of the farmers and their family. This is a great tragedy, an allegory, by which an enduring family travels through life's travails. The story revolves around their sensibilities of hope and survival, that in spite of the foreboding, they are dauntless in their seek for a better life. The Joads mirror the plight of the migrant workers- depicting the same suffering, the same fear and the same hope. And all the misanthropies that happened have its bitter toll on them, nevertheless under the frosting of modernity, within the fillings of promises of abundance by science and economics and above little dashes of fraud and selfishness. And all these infuriated the migrant workers but whose voice are stifled under the narcotics of hunger.The whole story runs toward a single-paced arrow but the characters bounce back a certain tense, or perhaps a curiosity. They play transparent roles in a way that a reader is carried along some of their introspections. In particular, Tom who is the main character is given a trenchant role in the movements and resolutions of the story while their mother who is such an audacious persona embraces the moral force so that the other characters maintain their moral substance. The other interesting character is the defunct preacher, Casy who constantly denies his capacity to preach again, and who eventually becomes a martyr for the cause of the Joad family and for the migrant workers which he led during the labor strike. The rest of the family and the other fleeting characters also played brilliant roles - either in rich metaphors or as colorful realism.Along the precarious highway 66, their life-story evolved and adapted as they settled in from camp to camp. It is depicted as free as flying dust, as treacherous as the desert at the roadsides and as promising as the land of the west. It is at this highway that Steinbeck rolls most of his radiant poetic flair. John Steinbeck has smoothly used paradox in his materials, he has proved a master in dialogues and his metaphors and symbolisms elegantly put flesh between the story lines."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"The scope of this work far exceeds any novel I've ever read. In this magnum opus by John Steinbeck, he covers theology, philosophy, history, sociology, class struggle, and an awesome breadth of the topics of man. His attention to detail gives the strangest sensation that I am actually there in the wagon with the Joads, giving a personal feel to the novel that is untouchable by any other writer out there. Certain images are absolutely unforgettable: Pa's last stand, Rose's lasting image, the spell-binding oratories of Tom, Ma, and Jim.On the other hand, John Steinbeck knows this is magnum opus, but he sets out on a course to prove it to the reader. He can be pedantic, didactic, and overbearing in his writing. He is so absolutely blatant in his symbolism (particularly his religious symbolism) so as to leave a bitter feeling in the reader that the author thinks him a fool. Steinbeck can seem a times as if he's WORKING to create a great work, utterly unnatural.Looking past these misgivings though, this book is an excellent exploration into the 1930s as well as human nature in general. The characters are spellbinding, their dialogue excellent. The intercleary chapters are for the most part excellent snapshots of time, with the exception of those that involve absolutely blatant symbolism. While the progress of the book can be a tad on the slow side, I find that it gives the book an excellent feel of rambunctous wandering and exploring a la Ruthie, physically, and a la Jim Casy, spiritually. The status of this novel as a classic is wholly deserved, and it is also deserved of several readings to capture the full breadth of the novel."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"In The Grapes of Wrath, by John Steinbeck, the Joad family fled their Oklahoma dwelling, in search of fictional California jobs. Scarred by the Great Depression and the seemingly everlasting Dust Bowl, the Joads futilely traveled to California, a land they dreamed was filled with opportunity, countless jobs, and acres of fruit that one could pick right off the tree and eat. With a large family plagued with hunger, sickness, death, and a pregnancy, the Joads struggled daily to survive among the thousands of other refugees from drought and famine. Steinbeck writes with startling bluntness. Nothing he writes is \\"candy coated\\" or semi-truthful. He tells accurately of the troubled times the Joads faced and tells us exactly what they would have said. He uses the words, the grammar, and the thoughts that such \\"Okies\\" would have expressed; as shown in this passage: \\"Danny in the back seat wants a cup of water. Have to wait. Got no water here. Listen - that the rear-end? Can't tell.There goes a gasket. Got to go on. Listen to her whistle. Find a nice place to camp an' I'll jerk the head off. But, God Almighty, the food's gettin' low, the money's gettin' low. When we can't buy no more gas - what then? Danny in the back seat wants a cup of water. Little fella's thirsty. Listen to that gasket whistle.\\" I liked the honesty and truth that John Steinbeck writes with and thought it was interesting how he would shift gears every chapter and, instead of focusing on the Joad family, would show the reader a bigger picture. He stops focusing on one particular family, and illustrates the daily routines that every \\"Okie\\" family dealt with. I recommend this book to anyone interested in an awe-inspiring and shockingly true book."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"Here's another book I once avoided, an arrogant young student impressed with my collection of bitter satires by bitter, younger writers who thought just as little of humanity as myself. Surely my decision to drift through a test and a paper on other people's discussions (ranging from 'greatest book ever' to 'a tiring, endless bore')was appropriate at the time for my cynical inexperience had not yet adjusted me for the sheer force of humanity of this titanic struggle.A story in pictures and abbreviated words, The Grapes of Wrath paints an honest vision of crushing defeat endured through hard times when visualized hopes were the only things required for living. We are swept in to a duststorm, a cascade of brief apocaylpse that batters our eyes shut only to force them open to see what is going on beneath the howl of the wind. This is what calamities cause and here is how man will always scramble for survival.The world opens up and becomes filled with people, beginning with the solitary wandering of a just-released inmate ambiling through the dead, dried out land, to search for his family. People join and surround Tom--later the Joads--and the dazed survivors all travel, bringing customs, and search the wide world for a new place to make a living. Their dreams and ambitions mix and then expand, groups are formed, families split apart and multiply, the crush of the storm has infected the people and now they go forward and tear up even more of the land in the search for a home.The book ends in the rain, all pain and dryness washed away into the mud, the dreams coming to an end, situations grown more desperate but at least temporarily endurable--the truth about where hope lay shining and glistening before them, lost in the bible or dreams of wealth or hopes for the future or the nucleus of a loving family surrounding them. Something is planted in that rain, finally, the milk of human kindness mixing with the mud to burst forth flowers and dew and yet another new chance to make something out of survival.It really is a wonderful story told with great wisdom, dignity and style."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"The novel The Grapes of Wrath written by John Steinbeck is a master peace of literature. Through the travels of the Joad family you get an incredible feeling of what it felt like to travel during the Dust Bowl of the late 1930's. The novel starts with a recently paroled Tom Joad hitchhiking to his family's farm in Oklahoma. After being let off, Tom starts walking towards where his farm was before he was put in prison for homicide. Soon after he begins walking he meets up with another main character, Jim Casy who is a former preacher. After shooting the breeze for a while the both of them continue the journey to the Joad farm. Upon arriving at the farm, they find it deserted. Tom, clueless as to what happened does not know what to do. After looking around the property for a while, Tom notices his neighbor Muley Graves, coming towards him and the preacher. Tom asks him if he knows where the Joad family is. Muley states because they cannot afford to stay on their land they were forced to relocate to Uncle John's farm. After spending the night at the Joads house, the preacher and Tom Joad continue on their journey to Uncle John's. When they arrive at Uncle John's two things happen to Tom. First of all his own mother does not recognize him, second of all, after everyone does figure who he is, they all asked him when he escaped. To which he replied, \\"I was paroled\\". Soon the family realizes they cannot celebrate Tom's freedom. They quickly load their 27' Dodge pick- up with all the belongings they will need, and soon they are on their way to California. The character that forms his identity throughout the book is the main character Tom Joad. He does what is best for the group by going with his family to California. He easily could have stayed in Oklahoma where it would be safe for him. But instead he breaks his parole in order to go California with his loved ones. I would defiantly recommend this book to anyone who likes thinking while they read. A book such as this one deserves the utmost attention while reading it."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"My title says it all. To me this is the greatest piece of literature ever written. I had to read it in high school and even now 30 years and many more books later it is still my favorite. It is the most compassionate book I have ever read."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"I am a John Steinbeck lover for sure. In this wonderful depiction of the horrors the Oklahoma farmers faced during the great dustbowl of the 1930's, I was once again awakened to what a story is supposed to be about. Too often, we are zapped with this wild tales of one explosion after another, with characters so much bigger than life that they would need the whole universe to survive in. Here, we see the intimate interactions of those who must struggle to survive in a hostile environment. We even see those little devilish schemes certain characters assume in order to be human. (The preacher is the perfect example.) I was mesmerized by the wonderful way the great novelist paints the mannerisms of each of his characters.The story evolves in a slow and natural way, blazing a trail through the perils the Joad family faces on their journey to California, where hope drives them and keeps them sane. And even when they complete this trials, other, more severe setbacks are waiting for them in ambush. It is a story of struggles and greed, of honesty and deceit. The story finds its way into the deepest chasms of your heart and then tears out a piece.I recommend reading other Steinbeck books first, to savor the best for last."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"I think that everyone should read this book. It is very deserving of all of its praise. It probably was not my favorite Steinbeck, but is definately a true classic. While I sometimes find Steinbeck a bit too descriptive and wordy, he definately tells a beautiful story."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"An extremely touching tale of a family seeking greener pastures, this book will surely change the way you look at big time capitalistic maneuvers. No denying that the big corporations brought the deadly efficiency and productivity to major markets, but in the face of all the success, one would tend to forget the millions of people who suffered for most of their lives to make way for the changes.It also brings us up close to the situations during post-depression times which drove people to abject poverty and suffering. The kind of treatment the characters of the book undergo due to the policies of the rich landowners will surely make you shudder with shock. People can be so cruel at times to their own fellow beings that it is hard to comprehend the reasons behind such behavior!Inspite of all the adversity, the characters in the book exude a level of endurance that is truly heartening. Anyone who reads this book will definitely face life's problems in a far more spirited and never-say-die manner. It definitely redefines one's conception of adversity and pain!I highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to learn more about the happenings which have moulded modern America. If not for the historical insight, this book is a fantastic journey into man's calibre to face challenges. One could read it just to discover the emotional strength of Ma in the Joad family. I am sure this is a book to be remembered for a lifetime!"},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"It's hard to know how to begin talking about a novel with as many threads running through it as the The Grapes Of Wrath. For me, it's primarily the story of how capitalism, initially a benign force, became the ravenous &quot;monster&quot; that it is today. But to portray The Grapes Of Wrath as merely some sort of leftist tract is to betray its power, its depth. It's the kind of novel that you're constantly quoting to people as you read it, picking it up and saying, &quot;Hey, listen to this...&quot;.It's simply one of the finest American novels I've ever read."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"One of the great novels of the 20th Century. This should be required reading at the high school level.The story is that of the Joad's, a displaced family from Oklahoma who migrate West,looking for work in the rich agricultural areas of California.No novel tells the story of depression era America better than the Grapes of Wrath.The Joad's, like millions of other Midwestern and Southern farmers, lose their land through a combination of generations of bad farming techniques, dry weather that occurred several growing seasons in a row, and the depression.The end of the rainbow is California, rich in agriculture with the promise of plenty of work. Along the way the family endures physical and emotional hardships, as well as ridicule and humiliation.Once they arrive in California, the Joad's find that the labor supply is so plentiful that the promised jobs are either non-existant or the pay is paltry. Furthermore, the California land barons want the 'Okies' to stay only long enough to pick the crops and they employ whatever means necessary to keep workers migrant.There are many poignant scenes in this novel and the character of Ma Joad is truly a classic as she strives to keep her family together and from starving to death. The last scene involving the loss of a child and a straving man are heart rendering.But the real value of this novel is in the social conscience that it attempts to evoke. For his work Steinbeck was villified as a Communist, although his later work showed Steinbeck as a political moderate."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"The passionate saga of the Joad family, who like thousands of American farmers lose their homesteads through a combination of bad luck and poor farming techniques. The Joad's travel west under the false promise of plentiful work in agricultural rich California.The journey is long and frightening as the family endures humiliation and the threat of starvation. When they arrive in California the Joads discover thousands of other displaced 'Okies' looking for work forcing down wages that the landowners were are willing to pay. They also discover that the landowners will do whatever is necessary to keep wages low.The Grapes of Wrath is an important American novel that tells a tragic story of an American family trying to stay together and survive under the most dire of circumstances. Generations of young Americans have grown up and never seen economic hard times. Although the bleakness of the conditions may be exagerated, depressioon ravaged America was not anything like it is today. This book gives an insight into just how tough times were.Ma Joad is one of the strongest female characters ever depicted in American literature as she struggles to feed her family and keep them together. The last few pages involving the still born birth of a child and the feeding of a starving man are tragic. Steinbaeck's novel is passionate and heartbreaking and he had to endure public vilification because of it. His later writings revealed a more conservative nature. Every young American should experience this novel."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"I watch the movie whenever it is on TV, its one of my favorites from that era. This past spring, I decided to read the book, something I rarely do if I've already seen the movie. I can understand now why the movie, compared to the book, tried to put a more promising spin on the Joad's (and many Americans) situation at the time. After all, the future for the working class and the country as a whole,was very much in doubt circa 1930's America. I recently saw a documentary on the making of the movie and it mentioned how the famous speech from Ma Joad towards the end of the film,about how they are the -&quot;little people&quot; and how there's many more of them and they just keep a-coming and things will eventually work out- this dialogue was actually added by Daryl Zanuck to end the movie with some hope. The book offers none of that hope...I was shocked at just how unforgiving and relentless the book is in its outlook of despair and misery for the Joads and others like them. The final chapters truly are some of the most desperate and hopeless depictions of the American Dream gone bad that I have ever read. You can really appreciate the progress we have made over the past 60 years in assuring that the country doesn't undergo anything close to &quot;The Great Depression&quot; again(so far)...Even if you've seen this movie first, the book is well worth reading and is dramtically different in its scope and mood..Definitely one of the best of the century."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"Grapes of Wrath may look daunting at first but it, like most Steinbeck, is very easy reading and well worth the read. The book is one of the major landmarks of American Literature and has permeated our entire culture and served as the voice of those striving to move west during the Dust Bowl and, even more so, the American spirit. Preacher Casey and Tom Joad have become classic characters and have even been the subject of many songs by the likes of Woody Guthrie and Bruce Springsteen.When you're reading this you're a piece of American history at its finest and most tragic. Steinbeck paints a wonderful picture of the human condition against the back drop of one of the most interesting, exciting, yet tragic times of American history. If you're looking for a long, easy read pick Grapes of Wrath over Harry Potter and you'll certainly get your reward at the end."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"I write this review from the perspective of a union-side labor attorney. Prior to reading this novel, I only knew that the subject of the novel was a group of &quot;Okies&quot; (dust-bowl farmers from Oklahoma) and their struggle to survive the Great Depression. However, that is just the protagonists' starting point. From these origins, the Joad family is evicted from their nearly worthless farmland and are forced to travel westward to California. California to the Joad family--and thousands of families like them--is a promised land of milk and honey. As they continue to travel and ultimately arrive in California, they discover it is anything but a promised land.And here is where Steinbeck's utter rage shines through. The Joad family (and thousands of families like theirs) travels to California because they have seen flyers proclaiming the need for grape pickers, peach pickers, cotton pickers, etc. The flyer states that 500 pickers are needed. In reality, only 250 pickers are needed. Additionally, the printers of these flyers (the greedy farm corporations, replacing the individual farmers) distribute these flyers to far more than 500 people. Thousands and thousands of people receive the flyers, creating the farm corporations' dream come true--a glut of starving workers fighting for any job they can get.Therefore, the starving workers undercut each other. While one worker says he will work for $.25 per day, the other worker who is hungrier says that if he gets the job, he will only require $.20 per day. The vicious cycle continues. The rich get richer, and the workers starve. And the outbidding is really the best time of the year--in the winter, there is no work and hence no bidding or money. Whenever anyone talks about organizing the workforce, he is labeled a &quot;red&quot; and either put on a blacklist or killed on the spot.This book is really a rallying cry for the necessity of unions. There are people who now say that unions have served their purpose and are no longer necessary. To that, I must respond that those people do not really understand the watchdog effect of unions.It seems that people remember &quot;The Jungle&quot; as more of a tribute to unions than &quot;The Grapes of Wrath.&quot; I have read &quot;The Jungle&quot; also, and while I think it is a great book and a very important one, it lacks the literary finesse of Steinbeck. Both books are stories of rage, but Steinbeck's prose is beautiful, haunting, both mournful and intensely angry. As he writes an indictment of the farming corporations, he also writes a love song to America, highlighting the beauty of its land and the bravery and kindness of its people. The Joad family is overwhelmingly good even in the face of one of the cruelest chapters of American history. The last paragraph of the novel both breaks your heart and renews your faith in humanity."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"This is one of the best books I've ever read, and it certainly is the most American. John Steinbeck shows us the same place every time, but it's a place worth going to, where the hills roll dustily to infinity and the horses run free; where there are men who will never stop &quot;westering&quot;; where men are MEN--something that seems more than a little obvious, but when you compare Steinbeck with other authors you realize it just isn't so. The book centers on one of the most unjust, trying, disgusting (call it what you will) times in America, and by the end you ARE one of the heroes, one of the simple men, one of the hardy westerers who only have each other and know it, but also know that that's all they need. The book is, if anything, far more necessary now, for Steinbeck's breed of men have faded from our America, and only a book like the Grapes of Wrath could ever bring them back. Read it; it's not only worth your while, it's worth America's."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"When I read the last page of this book I was stunned in a way that is hard to describe. I have never had such a deep emotional reaction to any book before or since. Just read it. It's an incredible experience."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"What amazes me about this book is the writing. Steinbeck was a wizard of desription and characterization. His book challenges you to see the world with new eyes- the unfairness of things as well as the beauty of small gestures. I am shocked by some of the negative Amazon reviews. It appears that some of those writing have no concept about the ideas presented in this novel or are in denial about American history. But getting back to this book: read it slowly, linger over Tom and Ma and Rose of Sharon and their sorrows, their daily sacrifices. There is nothing boring here but you will be challenged as to your religious and political stances. The Joads are America itself. Powerful stuff."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"Most people read this book for the first time in an english class. Thus they have to read it fast and they don't get as much out of it. I did not. I chose to read this book, partly because I had heard more good than bad about it, partly because though it was in the 50's, my dad took route 66 from Missouri to California, but the main reaso I read The Grapes of Wrath is because after I got out of High School I wanted to read Literature finally at my own pace, and mainly read the books I never did in school.I dont think I would have liked this book had I had to read it in school because it is 600+ pages but I tell you this. The Grapes of Wrath is the best book I've ever read, and Steinbeck is far up if not the best American author of all time. This book can be compared to Huck Finn. Poor folk, some in trouble with the law make an odessy to a new place, far away. The thing that separates the Steinbeck from Twain is that in this book there were chapters, almost every other one, that didn't pertain to the Joads. They were more an generalized vignette of expiriences that happened to many families who made this journey. May it be lack of food and water on the road or the dustbowl storms destroying a corn crop.Steinbeck weaves characters like a master and Tom Joad's final speech will live on in my mind forever: &quot;Wherever they's a fight so hungry people can eat, I'll be there. Wherever they's a cop beatin' up some guy, I'll be there.... An when our folks eat the stuff they raise an' live in the houses they build-why, I'll be there.&quot;In short, this book is fantastic, one of the best and a must read for anyone. It is a great story of a family's strife against the elments, struggle for enough money to live, and their belief in the good things getting them by."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"Before I read this book, I was told that it is a slow and boring read due to not having much action. Well, the action part may be true (depends on what you consider to be &quot;action&quot;), but the boring part is definitely not the case. I literally couldn't put this book down. In a nutshell, it tells the story of a depression era family that is driven from their family farm and describes the hopefullnes and heartache that entails their journey across the country to California in search for work. I realized the degree of struggle of which we today do not, and could not, understand, yet it was so real to those living just a couple of generations earlier. If you stick with this book and give it a chance it will definitely prove to make you think. If you're pondering whether or not to buy it...I say what are you waiting for?"},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"Whatever you political principles and ideas about economics, you would have to be inhuman to fail to grasp the utter injustices committed against poor peasants during the Great Depression, reflected in the desperation and dehumanization brought about on the Joad family, who lost all they had and were forced to wander the American West in search of pure survival.Tom Joad gets out of jail (where he had landed after he killed another guy in a fight)just to find his family destituted and forced to leave their land. So begins what has to be the saddest road-novel of all times. The Joads jump up into a waste of a car and start traveling to California, looking for the chance to get jobs in the prosperous citrics-growing trade. In the road they will suffer all kinds of setbacks and humiliations, until the terribly beautiful, meaningful and symbolic end. Several characters will leave you indelible impressions: Tom Joad himself, a simple but brave man; JC (get your conclusions about his symbolism), the appearing and disappearing ex-preacher; and, above all at least for me, the mother of the Joads, a lovable, courageuos, indestructible human being, one that makes you want to weep for her while feeling a towering admiration for her dignity.Inserted between chapters are short reflections and background about those times, as well as small asides full of symbolism and literary beauties. Some say that Steinbeck's explanations have been proved distorted: don't let that interfere with what is a work of fiction. Such things have happened throughout human history, and what this book does is remind us all that we have a debt to our fellow men (and women, of course).An epic of the eternal fight against indignity and misery, it deserves its fame and prestige."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"With over 300 other reviews listed here, I don't have much to add, except to echo what others have already said: 'The Grapes of Wrath' is one of the most powerful novels you will ever read, American or otherwise. As you journey from Oklahoma to California with the Joad Family, you'll experience the same obstacles and emotions they experienced: hunger, pain, separation of family, deplorable living and working conditions, tears, laughter, life, death. But this book is so much more. Whether or not you agree with his political views, no one can deny that Steinbeck was a brilliant writer. That brilliance is evident in every page of this novel. I don't think I will ever forget the book's final scene. It will stay with me for a long, long time. A great novel."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"So often I find myself chasing the best sellers when looking for a book to read but more recently I have moved back to the classics and after The Grapes of Wrath I am thankful I made the move. The story is perplexing and scares you into wondering how the country let its fellow citizens live the way they did. There are some wonderful characters and they come and go in mysterious ways. Take the time to read some of the classics and start with the Grapes of Wrath."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"If any novel could sum up the tragedy the Great Depression was for the working classes, this is it. I liked almost everything about this book--the characters, the story, the history, the dialogue. One of the only complaints was the abrupt and pointless ending, although I do commiserate with the author because how do you end a novel such as this? This novel is a masterpiece in itself as well as in what it accomplished by bringing to light the impact of the Great Depression on the working poor. It's hard to know if this story is the worst of the worst or just the story of an average family during this time. Either way, it's a tragedy and very moving. As a sidenote, Steinbeck definitely exhibits a hope in communism and socialism to bring equality and end the kind of poverty illustrated in this book. When this book was written, history hadn't yet judged the communist/socialist experiment which has now been shown to be responsible for more injustice and poverty than what it replaced. Along those lines, the novel's villains are the \\"big bankers\\" and \\"big farm owners.\\" Ironically, FDR's New Deal policies dictated price controls for farm goods and wages which led to mandated government destruction of food during the Depression. So, the New Deal was just as big a \\"villain\\" as the bankers and farm owners even though the book leaves that part out."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"Who am I to review one of the greatest literary works of all time? Could I possibly give this book anything less than the maximum rating it so richly deserves? Should I even commence? Those were just some of my private thoughts as I finally put down a copy of this book - read. This is the book which stirred the American conscience, caused political reform and brought about change when first published in 1939. This is the book which described how families were starving to death because of corruption. This is John Steinbeck at his exceptional best. For those people who never got around to reading this engaging and absorbing account of the Joad family, may I suggest you actually purchase a copy (any copy!) and finally read it.Today the world is either in recession or emerging from the dark grip of this latest financial catastrophe. Whilst we may live in a time when millions of families are no longer allowed to starve to death - well, not in the developed world at any rate, I earnestly believe there are lessons to be learned from this book about the rich and powerful who care not for their fellow man but only for personal gain. More importantly, those lessons are as relevant today as they were in 1939.Another similarity also failed to escape my notice; In this book we see how US police and other officials use their positions of authority to threaten and even blackmail the many thousands of American migrants who were simply looking for work in order to feed hungry mouths. These people had not arrived from any foreign country and were not even black - something which would have made their persecution much easier. No!, these ordinary white American folk were honest farmers who had been forcibly evicted from their homes and the land they had worked for generations. Seventy years on, here in the UK, we are besieged by TV programmes depicting our different police forces undertaking their various duties around the country. Yet more cheaply produced \\"reality\\" television! Significantly, however, I have occasionally noticed how some police officers deliberately provoke a hostile situation where exists. Whilst not on the scale portrayed in this outstanding work, it is interesting that I should recognise that underlying attitude of arrogant superiority.Whilst some may find the book slow going at the start, Steinbeck quickly gathers in those loose strands until they suddenly pull together to assume a story, reveal a mental photograph and produce a relevance into which the reader becomes fully immersed. I promptly learned local words and understood the dialect in which they were spoken as the Joad story unfolded. I could hear those southern accents as hardships are endured and explained through the actions of those who lived them. This was the organised, legalised daylight robbery and exploitation of the poor by the rich who were actively supported by the law enforcement agencies. A week's work for 1,000 fruit pickers paying 50 cents an hour is advertised to 3,000 hungry people who then pass on the message. Consequently, 5,000 starving workers arrive in search of that employment. With so much competition, the rate is lowered to 30 cents - take it or leave it! It was a deliberate ploy repeated time after time. Anyone attempting to organise his fellow workers is photographed, black-listed and branded a communist. Now feed that to your children. Then the banks insist the farmers reduced the rate to 25 cents and any landowner who questions that decision is swiftly reminded of his own vulnerability as a mortgagee! In short, either you pay them 25 cents or you join them! My own immediate reaction was to recognise a similarity between then and now - specifically with those modern banking practises which preyed on the sub-prime market. Anyone who cared to consider precisely what \\"sub-prime\\" meant, knew it was a policy destined to fail. And fail it did in spectacular fashion - and yet, the fat cat bankers still draw bonuses based on \\"personal performance\\" and not on their company's overall profit or loss...I note from some of the comments appended to certain editions of this book, that various issues have been produced in which, apparently, Steinbeck's prose are changed to make the work an easier read. Please don't take the easy option, take the version written as it was intended to be read - i.e. the version written by Steinbeck. If not, you cannot claim to have read this book at all - instead you have the equivalent of, say, a Romeo and Juliet story - set in Manhattan in the 21st Century - and there are plenty of those...In closing, I would urge anyone (indeed everyone) who has not already read an original version of this book If to go out and buy a copy - any old copy and then simply read it. Having done that, you too will draw parallels with our modern age and understand what I mean. You will also be richer for having done so - as would those fat cats who, unfortunately, will probably never bother.

From all of these the people are in flight, and they come into 66 from the tributary side roads, from the wagon tracks and the rutted country roads. 66 is the mother road, the road of flight.\\" -- John Steinbeck, The Grapes of WrathI live near Route 66, or what is left of it, in San Bernardino County, the largest county in the continental United States. The great highway which used to connect Needles on the Colorado River with San Bernardino is mostly gone now, replaced by strip malls and freeways. But a few reminders remain. The Tee-Pee Motel on Foothill Boulevard .... Little concrete tee-pee rooms with barred windows against the meth-heads and gangbangers. There are still hamburger stands and greasy spoon diners, and signs memorializing Route 66's place in the history of the West. Etched into the mountains behind the old road is The Arrowhead: a geological anomaly which was revered by the Indians and now is the symbol of the region.Once a year, San Bernardino... where 50% of the population is on public assistance of some kind, and which has the highest proportion of parolees in California... holds a \\"Route 66\\" festival to commemorate the muscle cars that made the region famous in the 50's and 60's. It is the only sign of life in a moribund community.It's difficult now, 70 or 80 years later, to understand the desperation of the Okies in the face of the dustbowls and their obsession to reach California. And there is irony in that California...the Land of Gold and dreams ... is now mired in unemployment and debt. Its budget is $ 42 billion in the red, its once awesome aerospace industry virtually nonexistent, its highways impassable, and its once world-class educational system a disaster. The Okies have been replaced by illegal migrants who still work for less than legal minimum wage, lack health care, and face deportation or worse. In a larger sense, the US is as close to depression as it has been at any time since the 1930's.John Steinbeck's epic depiction of the Joad's journey to California ranks among the best American fiction and social history."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"I can't remember the last time I was moved so profoundly by a work of fiction. I finished the book two weeks ago and have not been able to stop talking or thinking about it. Read this book. It will truly change the way you view the world.The book is beautifully written. Steinbeck's style flows so smoothly and is so accessible. The book follows the Joad family for about nine months as they are driven from the place they've called home for generations and travel to California, only to find out that it is not the land of opportunity they expected. Steinbeck's formula here is to intersperse the lengthy chapters chronicling the Joads' journey with short chapters that encapsulate some nuance about the period or the people, giving you a picture of the greater struggle taking place, of which the Joads are just a small part. It creates a very powerful effect. This migration west involved hundreds of thousands of individuals. You see in a few pages the big picture, then you are pulled back into the intimacies of the Joads' lives and the tragedy is made very personal. In one especially startling example, Steinbeck puts these words into the mouth of a character after selling a nameless migrant and his family some gas for their car, \\"Well, you and me got sense. Them goddamn Okies got no sense and no feeling. They ain't human. A human being wouldn't live like they do. A human being couldn't stand it to be so dirty and miserable. They ain't a hell of a lot better than gorillas.\\" In the next chapter, the Joads make camp along a stream and Ma is so happy for the clean water and the chance to stay put for a day so that she can take a bath and wash the family's clothes. The Joads are good, honest, decent people looking for the means to earn an honest wage and thereby feed their family. The thought of charity repels them. At one point Pa talks about the prospect of picking cotton and is so excited about the fact that it's good, hard work, worthy of the wage he'll earn. How soft and incredibly privileged it makes us all seem. \\"They streamed over the mountains, hungry and restless - restless as ants, scurrying to find work to do - to lift, to push, to pull, to pick, to cut - anything, any burden to bear, for food.\\"I live in a citrus community in Florida, which is populated by a large number of migrant workers. It never occurred to me to wonder how they felt about their lives. I never thought to wonder if they had dreams of someday owning their own home and staying put for a while. I've read criticism that \\"The Grapes of Wrath\\" is a communist manifesto. It may have socialist leanings, but how long can individuals or a society overlook the less fortunate without feeling some shame? Read this book. It should be mandatory, but would be wasted on most teenagers. Pick it up as an adult, as I did, and read it. You'll never again look at others or yourself in the same way."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"I don't know how anyone could read this book and not give it a five star rating. The true test for me of a &quot;great book&quot; is one that stays with me -- one I can't stop thinking about long after I've finished. I read this book for the second time in my life a month ago (first time was in high school many years ago), and I'm still haunted by the suffering endured by the Joad family. The interesting thing is that Steinbeck wrote this book in 1939 at the height of the injustices being fraught upon the migrant workers in California. I'm sure it wasn't popular then as it brought to the forefront the corruption of some powerful people in America. It also spoke to the conscience of every American which eventually led to political reform in California. After reading this book, I did some research into Steinbeck's motivation and learned that he was haunted by the plight of California's migrant workers to the point of obsession. To fuel his anger, he would visit the migrant camps each day full of their dirt, disease and hungry people and then return home to write about those people responsible for these conditions -- people he considered to be murderers.Steinbeck concentrated on the circumstances of one family, The Joads, tenant farmers in Oklahoma until they were forced out by the larger companies who wanted their land back. With dreams of luscious grapes and peaches in abundance waiting to be picked, they loaded up their belongings and began their journey on Route 66 headed for Bakersfield, California. They began their trip with a bevy of colorful characters led by Ma and Pa Joad. It's amazing how much power Steinbeck gave to Ma Joad -- years before women had any right to a voice. Unfortunately, just as the Joads were heading out, so were thousands upon thousands of other families. This would ultimately lead to supply and demand. There would be too many workers for the few jobs available and, consequently, people would be agreeing to work for peanuts just to be able to feed their families.Steinbeck's writing is astounding as the unrest of the migrants builds to a crescendo and just as the dust has risen in Oklahoma, so will the voices of the poor migrant workers. Steinbeck says, &quot;In the eyes of the hungry, there is a growing wrath. In the souls of the people, the grapes of wrath are growing heavy.&quot; It is just a matter of time before their wrath is unleashed and you can feel it in every page you turn. He says that, &quot;Our people are good people; our people are kind people. Pray God some day kind people won't all be poor. Pray God someday a kid can eat.&quot; I don't know how you can read some of his words and not get teary eyed. But sixty years have passed since the writing of this book and there are still migrant stories to be told and kids who have no food to eat yet sadly the world continues despite its injustices.I won't kid you into believing that this is an easy book to read. The first 150 pages are so slow going that I almost had to put it down. But I kept on going just as the Joad's kept on going and I'm certainly glad I did. We could all take a lesson from their quest for survival and their quest just to be able to eat the next day. Their determination, in light of all the obstacles they had to face, is truly a lesson to be learned. You feel a sense of accomplishment after reading a book like this -- I know I did."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"I have never read a better novel written by an American than THE GRAPES OF WRATH. Steinbeck's deeply touching tale of displaced families and a nation rent by Depression will never cease to be relevant.The Joads and thousands of others are driven out of Oklahoma by drought and the Depression. It is bad enough they lose their farms to homes and have to move. It is worse that the big business fruit growers in California print misleading flyers claiming to have far more well-paying jobs available than they ever intended to have. It is miserable when they get to California (where the people curse them as \\"Okies\\") and find out that as few as one man owns as much a million acres--much of it lying fallow in front of their eyes.As difficult as the plight of the Joads and families like them, Steinbeck does not paint the Californians or their police as evil so much as scared into treachery and violence in order to protect their own. No one wants to starve and starvation after the dust bowl and thanks to the exploitative wages paid by the vineyard owners is a very real possibility. Nor does he canonize the migrants--the societies that grow up by the side of the road each night have their own laws and lawbreakers, stout hearts and slatterns--but does show them as civilized people who don't deserve being treated like animals. Many fearful Californians don't agree.Steinbeck's character Tom Joad (whose ghost lives on in a Bruce Springsteen's song recently covered by Rage Against the Machine) is as important to American literature as Huckleberry Finn, Holden Caulfield and Jay Gatsby. Joad knows life offers no simple solutions, but he also knows that fair is fair. When a man's employers charge him for his work gear AND operate the stores where he must buy his food so that he often ends up OWING his employers more at the end of the week than his pitiful wages can cover, Tom Joad knows that's not just. He knows the land is fertile enough to feed everyone, so don't try giving him any speeches about \\"private property\\" and \\"supply and demand.\\" If the test of a system and a society is how it treats it poorest members (especially in a crisis like the Depression), then the world the Joads live in fails miserably.No less strong a character than her son Tom, Ma Joad embodies all the cliches about being a tower of strength without actually being a clich&eacute; herself. She and her family possess all the true grit and hearty spirit America prides itself on as a nation of pioneers, but by the 1930s the frontier has been bought up and the pioneers are in desperate straits.This book is occasionally criticized for being too socialistic. This criticism is misguided; what THE GRAPES OF WRATH does is show how capitalism can and often does enrich the few while the many suffer. Steinbeck shows how breadbasket farmers were thrown off the land they had worked for generations so bankers in the East can make more profit. Can this happen today, even in a time of tremendous prosperity? Ask today's family farmers what agribusiness has done to them. THE GRAPES OF WRATH is no call to play the \\"Internationale,\\" but it does starkly and intelligently raise questions about the meaning of equal opportunity and justice for all.This is a book that should be required reading for Alan Greenspan, the editors of THE WALL STREET JOURNAL, and triumphal capitalists everywhere who wince for their stock dividends when the unemployment rate goes down. Not to mention every single elected official in the United States. The subject matter is extremely heavy and sad, but Steinbeck's style is straightforward and easy (even with the various dialects he employs perfectly). THE GRAPES OF WRATH does what so very few great novels can: it will take a lot out of you, but leave you with much more than you had when you began."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"I always hesitate before attempting to write a critical review of a classic novel, particularly one as monumental as &quot;The Grapes of Wrath.&quot; So let me start this out by saying, YES, the book is a well-deserved classic, and YES, I would recommend that each and every person go out and get a copy. As many other reviewers have pointed out, this novel has an uncanny ability to affect its readers, to make them re-evaluate the nature of compassion, fortitude, and human dignity. Much of this is due to Steinbeck's brilliant structuring of the novel, as he alternates the chapters dealing with the direct struggles of the Joad family with more elaborate &quot;big-picture&quot; depictions of the migrant movement in general.That being said, however, &quot;The Grapes of Wrath&quot; can be an extremely frustrating reading experience for an unprepared reader. Its sheer length (around 600 pages) can be initially daunting, and the copious amounts of dialogue (all written in dialect) take some time to get used to. &quot;Grapes&quot; can even be difficult for Steinbeck fans because it is in many ways rather an anomaly in his canon. Though the story of the Joads is compelling, there is evidence that Steinbeck was somewhat uncomfortable with these parts of the novel: Characters introduced in the beginning simply disappear halfway through, contributing little to the overall story, and in general the characterization is weaker here than it is in other novels like &quot;Of Mice And Men,&quot; curious considering that &quot;Mice&quot; is about one-fifth the size of &quot;Grapes.&quot; There is repetitiveness in the dialogue and the trials faced by the Joads, and the novel's pacing likewise suffers.In my opinion, the &quot;Big picture&quot; chapters are better written than the Joad chapters--on the whole more interesting, more powerful, and certainly more complex (as Steinbeck switches back and forth with his narrative voice and point of view). Chapter 25, in which the novel's title (taken from the Battle Hymn of the Republic) appears is probably the finest of the novel. Moreover, in spite of some weaknesses in pacing and plot, the story of the Joads personal hardships contain several scenes which are infused with a similar ability to produce a devestating and uplifting feeling in the reader. The novel's final scene with Rosasharn is positively brilliant in its conception and execution.I've tried to be fair and honest in this review, and I hope my comments will help you to enjoy &quot;Grapes&quot; without frustration. It is a remarkable novel."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"&quot;The Grapes of Wrath,&quot; written in 1939 by John Steinbeck, is a book about the Great Depression, and one poor sharecropper family's struggle to survive the worst deprivations that American society in the 1930's had to offer. Indeed, perhaps no American work of fiction fits the label of &quot;The Great American Novel&quot; better than Steinbeck's wonderfully written and still highly controversial masterpiece of fiction.Set in the 1930's, in America's &quot;Dust Bowl,&quot; this is the tale of the Joad family, a large clan of poor Oklahoma sharecroppers, and how they are forced into a decision to migrate to California. It's also the story of the many trials and sufferings that they endure during their long and harrowing journey.Forces of nature and the forces of economics have conspired to force the Joads off their farms. So, this proud, hard-working family, sells most of their worldly possessions in order to buy a run-down old jalopy. The whole family - Ma and Pa; Granma and Granpa; Tom (the oldest son, and an ex-convict recently paroled from prison); Al (Tom's younger brother); Uncle John (Pa's brother); Ruthie and Winfield (Ma and Pa's youngest children); the heavily pregnant Rose of Sharon (Tom's younger sister) and her husband Connie; and the Reverend Jim Casy (a family &quot;friend&quot;) - pack themselves, along with their essential goods, aboard their decrepit old vehicle, and depart for the &quot;promised land&quot; on America's west coast.The vast majority of this compelling novel tells the story of the Joads' plight while on the road. They are almost immediately confronted with the death of a loved one. This compounds their grief at the loss of their home and possessions. They find that most people they meet along the way despise, reject, and vilify them as dirty, filthy &quot;Okies;&quot; they receive aid and comfort from very few along their route. Yet, they remain undaunted; throughout their struggles, they remain focused on the ultimate realization of a dream: jobs, high pay, and a new life in California.The great climax of &quot;The Grapes of Wrath&quot; sees the Joads once again suffering in unspeakable squalor as they attempt to survive the violent forces of nature and humanity in this, the great western &quot;promised land.&quot;The basic plot of &quot;The Grapes of Wrath&quot; is exciting, suspenseful, gripping, and possessed with a terrible beauty. It is written perhaps in the finest traditions of the early twentieth century &quot;muckraking&quot; novels, exposing, as it does, the worst societal ills that were prevalent in American society of the 1930's.This book serves as Steinbeck's soapbox, as he deplores the exploitation of California's migrant workers during this era. Indeed, the author is frequently barely able to contain his moral outrage at the sufferings of thousands of &quot;Okies,&quot; and their often violent treatment by landowners, businessmen, and even law enforcement officials.&quot;The Grapes of Wrath&quot; abounds with wonderful character studies. The effects of indescribable suffering and abject poverty give Ma Joad the steel to evolve from her traditional role as a silent, obedient wife to become the true leader of the family. Conversely, Pa Joad's traditional role seems to diminish; he recognizes the fact, and, after only brief resistance, he defers to his wife's new role. Tom, ever so careful not to do anything to jeopardize his parole at the outset, finds himself increasingly outraged at his family's plight, and emboldened to action as a result.This novel's central theme is still as relevant today as it was in 1939: the growing disparity between the &quot;haves&quot; - the rich - and the &quot;have nots&quot; - the poor. Perhaps this is the real reason why the book still generates such controversy. It holds a mirror up to us, and forces us to confront some unpleasant truths that we, as an &quot;enlightened&quot; society, would rather not face. And that, in itself, makes this brilliant book well worth reading."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"If you have not read this book, what are you waiting for? Is it because it was written before you were born? (1939) Does its name scare you, as it did me, into imagining it would be about all sorts of odd things, as I did? Well don't let your preconceived notions fool you. It's a terrific novel. It is a great piece of literature that won Mr. Steinbeck a well-deserved Pulitzer Prize, and eventually, with his other contributions to literature, earned him a Nobel Prize.What can I say about the Joads that has not already been said in the past sixty-odd years? How could I have missed knowing them earlier? I read this story, with its \\"country speech\\" and \\"country ways\\" and wanted to take them all in. I wanted to comfort them all. I didn't know what I would find at the Joads when we first meet Tom going home. Who is this Tom Joad Jr. and why was he in jail? He must have had a HORRIBLE life to end up there, he must have. Then you meet the 'fambly.' You live with the 'fambly.' You see proud Pa try so hard to be the head of the home during the Dust Bowl migration. This family, who for generations upon generations, upon generations lived off their land. The land wasn't a piece of property, it was family. It fed them, it housed them. They raised a crop to sell, so they can pay off the loans they took when times were tough before. When the rains stopped coming, and the payments to the bank stopped being made, the 'banks' came and told all these people to leave. Imagine someone coming to tell you that the land you have lived on all your life, the land of your fathers and grandfathers belonged to the banks and you had to leave right now. Imagine the dread. All your life spent in the same place, with the same neighbors, the same strong values; \\"Yes Sir! Yes Ma'am!\\" No talking back, everyone knew their place. And then the dust came, and took away everything you knew.The Joads sell everything they own, load up a beat-up truck with the necessities (food, water, mattresses, clothes, pots, pans) and head towards the promised land of California. Along with 500,000 other displaced people. All looking for land to work; it's all they know. You get land, you work it, it's yours. They had no idea what life outside of Oklahoma was really going to be like.There's Ma, trying so hard to keep the family strong. She's the backbone. She eventually takes charge, which, back on their farm, was unheard of. Times were changing.Ma & Pa, 6 kids, Grandma & Grandpa, Uncle John, the Preacher Casey, and Connie, the husband of one of Ma's daughters. Thirteen people in one truck.I wanted to bring them home, let them eat, give them a hot bath, tell them it'll be ok. I wanted to simultaneously smack the heck out of Rose of Sharon (Rosasharn) and comfort her in the end; tell her she really did do good in God's eyes at that very last paragraph. I saw Ruthie grow in those 7 or 8 months into someone I did not like. She was mean, she was vindictive, she was 7. I saw humanity at its worse. Things like this really did happen in the early 1930's, after the Great Depression and the Dust Bowl. These \\"Okies\\" were treated with contempt. They were kicked off their lands, treated like animals, paid meager wages or in some cases, they were paid with a loaf of bread for 16 hours of work, and it's disgusting. How would you fare? What would you be willing to do to feed your starving family?It's a terrific book. I wish I knew how Noah fared. I wish I knew what happened to that spineless Connie. Is Tom ok? Did he take up the cause that Casey so tragically and instantaneously had taken from him? I imagine so. I imagine Tom forcing these cities who spurned them, who burned them out, who arrested them, to have to accept them; 500,000 strong. If not directly, then inspiring others to go on and on. The packing plants who throw away food, while these people sit outside the gates dying. The orange growers who sprayed kerosene on the overstock of oranges rather than give them away for free. The food thrown in rivers, with armed guards making sure no one took the food. Pigs slaughtered because they could not sell them, and hungry people staring, not understanding that there's a profit to be made.\\"And they stand still and watch the potatoes float by, listening to the screaming pigs being killed in a ditch and covered with quicklime, watch the mountains of oranges slop down to a putrefying ooze; and in the eyes of the people there is a failure; and in the eyes of the hungry there is a growing wrath. In the souls of the people the grapes of wrath are filling and growing heavy, growing heavy for the vintage.\\""},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"I don't know if I can adequately express how wonderful I think this book is. Steinbeck writes with incredibly vivid imagery and passion in all his books but this is his best and affected me the most.Grapes absolutely should be required reading, not only because it is Steinbeck or excellent literature but because it is a powerful story of human nature, social conscience, prejudice and classism. This book opened my eyes to the plight of yet one more minority group, migrant farm workers. I cannot drive by fields filled with people picking our fruits and vegetables without thinking of this book and the lives of these folks. Thank God for people like Cesar Chavez and the union he created to help. But I digress....This is a heart-wrenching, sad story of a family's search for relief from the Dust Bowl of Oklahoma and a better life in California. The better life doesn't come by the end of the book but the reader is left a more compassionate person. Quite an accomplishment. Thank you Mr. Steinbeck."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"Detractors of this novel will tell you that The Grapes of Wrath is melodramatic, contrived, and relentlessly preachy - and I can't argue with them. The Grapes of Wrath is overwrought and about as subtle as a hand grenade, but it is also a powerfully affecting novel. I challenge even the most cynical reader not to be moved (at least a little) by the tragic story of the Joad family.The novel is often described as a \`sweeping epic' (which means it is longer than the average book). It is undeniably a classic and well worth reading, but is not without its flaws. The novel is compelling and I found myself having trouble putting it down as I neared the final chapters, however it does get bogged down in spots and some of the dialogue is repetitive. Steinbeck is unquestionably one of the most important writers of the 20th century, but (and let's be honest here) his prose is largely unremarkable (certainly when compared to Fitzgerald's \\"The Great Gatsby\\").And then there are the politics...Personally, I don't have a problem with an author having a strong point of view and expressing it in a novel. Yes, Steinbeck portrays a complex issue as if it were clear-cut. He portrays the migrants as good and noble (the men-folk may behave badly at times; drinkin', brawlin', and womanizin' but they are inherently good). Meanwhile, the banks and the land owners are evil personified. There is no middle ground in The Grapes of Wrath.Despite what some reviewers would have you believe, The Grapes of Wrath is not a communist manifesto. It does however, question how a country so plentiful can allow so many to starve and suffer and Steinbeck doesn't hesitate to point his finger at those he feels are to blame. Reality is considerably more complex. The plight of the dustbowl farmers was inevitable as the economy changed and small family farms became unsustainable.Steinbeck's narrative alternates between the Joad family's story (the even numbered chapters), and a series of expository chapters (the odd numbered chapters) that provide a broader perspective of the migrant experience. These expository chapters are the most politically charged and blatantly biased of the novel, but they also feature some of the best writing.My review sounds mixed because I have mixed feelings about the novel. It is bold, but contrived, compelling, yet melodramatic, powerful, but preachy. All in all though its strengths outweigh its shortcomings. The Grapes of Wrath is well worth reading, just don't set your expectations too high. This isn't one of the best novels ever written, in fact, it isn't even Steinbeck's best."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"I first read this in high school- 40 some years ago- and I am still deeply moved by its power. Steinbeck never wrote highly polished prose and he liked plebian themes. It's easy to dismiss him, particularly if you think great novels must be word perfect or concern renowned people and events. In my second reading, Steinbeck's politics and philosophy came through more insistantly than I was aware of as a teenager.The 1930s federal government was as inept as present day FEMA. The police were as facistic as the Nazis. The banks and rich landowners were as greedy and grasping as Enron execs. The moralistic religious were as closed minded as Fallwell. The public was as whipped up over \\"Reds\\" as it is today over \\"terrorists\\". The heros are the Joads and other Oakies who have unlimited reserves of ambition, industry and resourcefulness, but by novel's end are reduced to questionable survival. You know they don't deserve their fate: people that eager to work, that loving and generous, that willing to improve the world should not end up destitute, hunted and starving.Since my first reading I have traveled the length of Route 66 and actually lived in some of the spots wherein the fictional Joads picked peaches. I've encountered numerous Oakies who made the trek and are proud of it. (By now, even the kids of the '30s are gray and choose to remember the best of times.) However, the hard times and nastiness in Grapes of Wrath is not a fabrication. Steinbeck researched the migrant camps extensively and came away with plenty of evidence and strong opinions. He chose to take the lowest point in his American history and expose its faults. In so doing, he also consecrated its common people. The novel also hints at themes that are currently more in vogue: agricultural ecology, the wisdom and strength of women, the need for new economics. America deserves a great novel for every era- this one nailed the dirty thirties."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"When I was first assigned to read John Steinbeck's book The Grapes of Wrath in English class, the first thing that I noticed was how huge it was. Over 600 pages! I was afraid it would be a story that wandered all over the place and didn't really have a point. Even after I had begun reading, it seemed that this assumption was correct since all book seemed to be doing was telling a very detailed and slow-moving story about a family in Oklahoma. However, as I continued reading, I began to realize that the very way the book portrays the life of these people so realistically and what the reader learns from their situation is itself the point of the book. The Grapes of Wrath is the story of the Joad family, an Oklahoma family of tenant farmers during the Great Depression who are kicked out of their homes because they cannot make a profit on their crops. As more and more farmers are kicked off their land to be replaced by men on tractors, over 300,000 people migrate west to California in hopes of earning a living picking fruit, cotton, etc... for owners with larger farms. Hardship follows them during the long trip to California. Even once they get there, they're divided against themselves as they compete for work so they can just feed their families. Throughout the book the family encounters opposition from all sorts of people, including land owning farmers who must pay extremely low wages in order to make a profit, cops who cause more trouble than good, locals who are afraid of the massive influx of people, and a government that seems unable to help. In the end it's sheer will that gives them the strength to continue to fight as the Depression relentlessly tries to break the people's determination and the family bonds. The Grapes of Wrath gives a very realistic view of the Great Depression and tells it from viewpoints you don't see from just reading about it in a history textbook. The book is divided into narrative chapters that tell the story of the Joads, and, every other chapter, the inter chapters that give information about the situation in a style that's part documentary, part editorial. Throughout the book, especially during the inter chapters, Steinbeck uses symbolism to convey ideas. In particular, there are many allusions to the Bible, including the title. Due to its realistic portrayal of the life of the migrants, the book has also come under considerable controversy for its profanity and sex, since those things were parts of the lives of these people. Also, Steinbeck uses the inter chapters both to make people aware of the problems and to give suggestions for how to deal with them, and many of his beliefs could be seen as Communistic. I have really found The Grapes of Wrath to be a difficult book to rate. On the one hand, it's a slow-moving book that contains a whole lot of talk that people who aren't really into reading books for fun will likely find boring, and it's just too long to hold some people's interest. On the other hand, however, the character interaction is very realistic and human, being based on actual migrants Steinbeck knew. Because of this, we get to feel like we really know the people in the book. The seemingly excessive length of the book is actually needed to give us a real understanding of how these people lived their lives. When the characters get into intense situations that threaten the physical and psychological well-being of the family both as a group of individuals and as a single unit, the book reaches hights of drama and emotional intensity that is almost never matched today in movies, books, video games, music, or any of our other forms of art. I often found myself just sitting there thinking about what I'd just read for a while after I finished with the required reading for the day. There's not really space within this 1,000 word limit to fully discuss my thoughts on this book, but what I can say is that it will draw you into the world of the migrants in the 1930's and show you plainly and truthfully just what it was like. I can understand the opinion of people who hate this book because it's all a matter of taste, and some people just would not be able to forgive the many parts they consider agonizingly boring. Although I give this book four stars overall, there are parts of it that I'd give 10 stars if I could. I highly recommend this powerful book to anyone."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"The Grapes of Wrath is a book to be treasured...Steinbeck's weaving of storyline with the historical background of the dust bowl era served as an education for me. Just when you thought you were getting tired of all the additional background information, though, the plot kicks in to high gear. Following the life of the Joads was both emotional and suspenseful. The scenes were so vivid to me that I still can picture certain scenes in this book years after I finished it. One thing I found particularly intriguing about this book is the ending. You can read it all you want before you start the book, but understanding doesn't come until you've read the whole thing. I'm a huge Jack Kerouac fan, but I have to bow to Steinbeck, who showed me that spontaneous prose existed in a professional form before Kerouac and the Beats."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"As I look over the reviews of the classic works of literature, I am appalled by how often I see the word boring being used. I guess it's because great books don't come with big screens, speakers and a joy stick. Welcome to the Millenium."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"this book is amazing because it reveals so much about the human condition and the perils of capitalism when taken to an extreme. i very much enjoyed this book thoroughly. this is a story that is troubling at times, which just adds more to the experience presented. this is the kind of book that leaves an aftertaste that doesnt soon go away. with all that said, will someone please email an explanation of the ending to me? i have come to my own conclusion, but find it altogether unsatisfactory."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"Without a doubt this is one of the greatest novels ever written, if not the best. Steinbeck captures the feel of the dustbowl and transports the reader to the era. The book is long, has many references to socialism, and ends somewhat abrubtly, however throughout the entire novel Steinbeck masterfully shows how life was for the poor during the depression. At the end I could only sit, stare at the wall, and thank God I was not alive during the depression. Then it occured to me that the book could be written today, not portraying the okies, but maybe Vietnam in the early 1970s, or Mexican migrant workers today. The book is a hisorical account of what life was like, but it still rings true today.Afterwards I read two more Steinbeck novels: In Dubious Battle, and East of Eden. Both were excellent but neither carried the impact of The Grapes of Wrath. Steinbeck wrote a powerful novel that I think everyone should read. If you don't like it the first time, reread it ! until you understand it. This book is amazing."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"I thoroughly enjoy many of John Steinbeck's books. I truly recommend East of Eden and Of Mice and Men to anyone who hasn't read them. This book however I found very tedious, slow, and overall quite boring. I know it's a classic and all but really had a tough time getting through it and after all that work I really felt the conclusion left me hanging."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"I have been reading and re-reading this book for last couple of weeks and haven't been able to get over it. The backdrop, the politics, the facts behind the fiction, are all a different world to me. Separated by several decades. Yet, there are factors that connect you straight to the book. Tom is a man who reminds you of someone you wanted to be in school after being expelled. Ma stands for strength in adversity. Pa for being an understanding human being.Amidst everything, the characters Steinbeck has created are ephemeral yet so touchingly representative of human strength and dignity. The language of the characters is also communicative of the understanding of the lot Steinbeck has wanted to portray. The Scriptures' discussion between Tom and Ma when she comes to ask him to go (and her understanding the fact that children, especially adoloscents are likely to make mistakes in the heat of the moment) has a stark resemblance to the discussion of Indian scriptures I have overheard travelling to my village. It makes you wonder about the irony that when you are engrossed in reading such stories in fiction, you get appalled. But when you are just skipping through the newspapers, you miss the stories. There are quite a few Joads living out there, but we do not have the time to read through the stories in between the lines of the news columns.To sum it up, Grapes of Wrath is like a huge picture on a very large canvass that portrays the human life with a perspective that is way larger than we choose to adopt towards life. A must read."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"As a Junior AP English student, I was bombarded with summer work, and my assignments included chosing a summer book to read from a selected list. I chose the &quot;Grapes of Wrath&quot; by John Steinbeck, and was immeadiatly captured in the sad story of the Joads and there turbulent Oddessy. Sad and depressing yes, but hopeless it is not; if anything this book is about hope and compassion and empathy for others, and for many of us, including the characters in this novel, that is a lesson learned the hard way. There will probably never be a writer as talented as John Steinbeck; he has a way of making you not only imagine, but feel what is happening in his story. Steinbeck uses his great skill to show both great beauty and harsh reality, and I hope at the time this book was published that it caused political uproar and brought the people in American aristocracy down to Earth to realize what was occurring. Although people moving from Oklahoma to California are the least of our great nation's worries, the thoughts expressed in this book have the power to open the eyes of Americans to many troubling situations that exist today."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"This book is probably the most influential book that I've ever read. It has truly opened my eyes to a different time to help me appreciate the life that I have, now. The story follows the Joad family; they are heading West, to California, after being kicked off of the land that they farmed and were sharecroppers on. The Joads have heard that California is fruitful, rich, and beautiful. What they don't know is that 300,000 people just like them are also heading West to the &quot;green pastures&quot;. Along the road, they battle death, hunger, and fatigue. When they get to California, they battle poverty, crooked authorities, and hunger. The family struggles to find work and find a decent place to camp. The story has varying chapters. One chapter is a generalization of what is happening at each stage of the migrants' journies. These chapters use vivid descriptions, metaphors, and history to create a picture for the reader. The other chapters are specific to the Joad family with plenty of personal adventures and dialogue. With each new chapter comes more intrigue, hardache, and adversities. Excellent, emotional portrayal of this devastating time period. I would have liked if there was a little more closure at the end. The book is long as it is, but I was left wondering about some of the characters. I guess it's just one of those cravings, same with movies, when you never want it to end. Steinbeck has opened up a world, to me, that is begging to be delved into and researched. I can't wait to learn more about what I read.This book has really made me think about my life and the gratitude that I owe to everyone in my life. It's excellent to find that feeling of true thankfulness."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"As a reader, I move pretty quick. I tend to devour books in weekends, or in some cases, overnight. It took me over two months to read Grapes of Wrath. And it was well worth the time invested. I can liken reading it to drinking a fine wine. You don't gulp, but savor. Enjoy. Relax.Steinbeck nailed it. He captured the flavor, feeling, behaviors, attitudes, societal woes, and speech of that era. The prose was beautiful, and the ending was extremely profound on so many different levels. A great novel will educate the reader in some way, or at least challenge their thinking about the world around them. This book did just that. I've heard the term &quot;Okies&quot; used a slur several times during my childhood, but never understood where it originated. Now, I do. Whenever I hear that term again, I will have an image ingrained in my mind of Americans, our brothers and sisters, searching for not just a new way of life, but FOR survival. I won't soon forget this novel."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"This book sat and sat on my book shelf for years. Thinking it would be one of those &quot;classics&quot; that I &quot;should&quot; read I neglected it. One day I picked it up and found out the my fears were misplaced. It reads like any pleasurable popular fiction, with suspence, mystery and great characters, but it also goes beyond and delivers a powerful and heart wrenching message.How do &quot;we&quot; (those in power, those with wealth, those with land, those with plenty) choose to neglect &quot;them&quot; (powerless, poor, disenfranchised)????? This book isn't so much a look at political systems or an indictment against the rich, it really is a deep glare into the heart of man. And man's heart is often a dark and terrible place.What really makes this book great are the little victories, those things that made me the reader long for the great sense of love and community that followed the Joad family wherever they went.Sometimes a man's heart has been recreated, and when it has, nothing dark or evil can overcome."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"Good black and white DVD viewing, and a salutary lesson in how not to treat your fellow man human beings!"},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"The Grapes of Wrath has always been my favorite .

The question he posed is how can the economical factors help with the sociological situation. It has got to be more than a 'bottom line' philosophy. There has to be a safety net with the ability to rise out of poverty. While Steinbeck wrote of the thirties, what makes this a classic is that still speaks the truth today."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"The human spirit is as relevant today as then. The great struggle of the working poor and the money motives of business that take advantage of the desperate. This book must have led to many new laws that protect people. A review of his work is really superfluous."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"Steinbeck is amazing with how he tells a story. He's also brilliant when it comes to character development. This book also refers to the Dust Bowl and how farmers were getting taken advantage of by the government. This is a great book to explain in more detail how greed especially in government is greater than the welfare of its own people. It reminded me of 1984 but in this sense, these events truly did happen which made this book more frightening to read. Well done, Mr. Steinbeck!"},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"Steinbeck and unfamiliar readers merit at least the first page of this American masterpiece.

Liked it then, but now at 69 I realized just how powerful a book this is. Our book club had rave reviews and felt we gained a lot more reading this with the benefit of our life experiences.Grapes of Wrath"},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"I just finished reading \\"The Grapes of Wrath.\\" Steinbeck's simple but poetic prose shows a mastery of subtlety and expertise. The dialog was very believable and realistic. The period in which J. Steinbeck wrote as did Hemingway was the realism movement, which never really strayed too long into what the characters were thinking or feeling. The characters words on the surface is what portrayed who they were and Steinbeck expertly reveals all of them, even down to his tertiary characters, Ruthie and Winfield. Ma Joad and Tom are beautifully realized as was Casey the former preacher.If I have any quibble with the story, it's some of the chapters, which were a little too polemical and didactic. I felt Steinbeck trying too hard to drive his personal beliefs down my throat about \\"The Man versus the corporation and big business.\\" Overall however, I still came away with great admiration for what he tried to accomplish with this story, considering we had just come out of the Depression only about five or six years later followed by the destructive Dust Bowls, created by man.I now understand why this novel is considered in such high esteem by so many experts and admirers of fiction. \\"The Grapes of Wrath\\" is truly one of the great American novels!"},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"I only actually have to read this book as a Summer Reading assignment for my AP English class. I'm not a really a big fan of books that have this genre but when I reached halfway through the book, I started loving it. I find the feelings portrayed in this novel clear enough for me to understand it with the help of vague dialogue of the characters. A message is there and though you need to read more to understand what they're saying, the reality is always present."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"One of the greatest American novels written. Period. I read it about three years ago and whenever I see this book in stores the feelings and images I had while reading Grapes come flooding back to me. Read this book! You may, like me, be slightly disappointed with the ending, but you will not be disappointed that you took the time to read Grapes of Wrath."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"There are very few American novels that can be called a classic, but the trails and tribulations of the Jode family during the Great Depression stands at the pinnacle of 20th century literarute.

I was \\"forced\\" to read it in high school, and we all know how much teenagers appreciate great American literature. (wink wink.)I am so glad I decided to pick it up and read it again, because it was as if I'd never laid eyes on the book before. This book is beautifully written, powerful, and heartbreaking. I did not fully realize the plight of the migrant workers in the 1920's and this book made me grow to respect and empathize with the Joad family and others like them.This book stayed with me for a while after I read it; I kept thinking about it and analyzing it. I couldn't wait for my husband to finish reading it so we could talk about it. If anyone is intimidated by the phrase \\"classic novel\\" or has bad memories of being forced to read classics in high school, I strongly urge you to read this book--I read everything from People magazine to Patricia Cornwell to chick lit--and I LOVED this book."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"If you haven't read The Grapes of Wrath, do yourself a huge favor and read it!!!

It is a descriptive novel, which gives a good insight as to what living was like during the Great Depression by telling the story of the Joad family, whom are moving out West looking for work because the bank has kicked them off the land. It was a good novel about the struggles of life in the 1930's."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"This book has stood the test of time and remains an American classic. Throughout the book, Steinbeck gives us an intimate insider's view of the Joad family by providing a narration and dialogue with an incredibly fine level of detail. The description of the poverty and difficulties of the Joads is so vivid that I couldn't help but feel for the human condition back then. To be poor is one thing, but to live without knowing where your next meal is coming from is quite another.The most vivid passage for me is in Ch. 28, when the Joads have been working on the cotton farm for a while and Ma Joad has accumulated enough money to finally go on a &quot;spending spree&quot; at the market. She probably didn't have more than a few dollars, yet when she buys enough food for the whole family, I actually felt a sense of relief, for it seemed they were as rich as kings.To me there are two resounding themes present in this novel. First of course is the strength of the family in the face of adversity. &quot;Family&quot; means more than blood ties; it means people who have shared your suffering and will lend a recipricol hand when needed. This relationship also means that walls will be built to keep some out: note how Tom quickly brushes off the one-eyed mechanic who hopes to come along on the trip. The second theme for me is the yearning for labour, &quot;muscles aching to work, minds aching to create beyond the single need -- this is man.&quot; We still see this today in America: a need to work for something beyond just money, it is a need to be productive and busy, to surpass our parents, and to produce successful offspring.A final note about this Penguin edition: It evidently reproduces the original typesetting from 1939, so it quite long at 619 pages. However, don't be put off by the length. The font is large, and the interline space is relatively wide. This book could easily be around 100 pages less with a more modern typesetting."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"\\"I figgered the devil was the enemy. But they's somepin worse'n the devil got hold a country, an it ain't gonna let go till it's chopped loose.\\"Grapes Of Wrath is the story of the desperate battle of migrant labourers with the rich, greedy, malevolent and the mean. When the Joads arrive in California from their native Oklahoma, their troubles and tribulations are rewarded not by bounty, but by even more hardship. What ensues is a timeless battle. It is waged by the spirit of the downtrodden on the one side, and by the mercenary mean muscle of the other. The story is primordial and resonates with any reader with a sense for perception.The classic work of fiction describes a world where the rich, with their glitzy cars, ride alone and never mind hitting a man or a noble dog should one come in their way. Then there is the poor and oppressed who, despite their condition, extend a hand time and time again and never forget what is important on the great round dustbowl. The wheel in the sky seems to work against those who toil and possess a heart, but cruelty and oppression are exposed as mere facades that once removed reveal nothing more than a faceless corporate entity bereft of the right to exist.It is in this setting that John Steinbeck writes in amazingly authentic and sanguine dialogue the flight of the strong-at-heart from, and again into, the belly of a system bent on browbeating compassion, kindness and veracity."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"\\"The Grapes of Wrath\\" is an American classic which, though showing its age, says much to the America of today.A masterful story teller, Steinbeck unfolds the story of the Joads, a family of dispossessed Okies, set adrift in a sea which they do not know, by forces which they do not understand. As we watch them lose their farm, travel with them in the truck to California, then search with them for work in their new world, we begin to appreciate the life of a penniless migrant of the Dust Bowl Era.As enthralling as this story is, it is periodically interrupted by chapters of social commentary. Nobody seized the land, it was the bank. No one set the wages, the growers association did. There is no personal responsibility. The little people are crushed by impersonal organizations.The theme of class struggle runs deeply, but is seems a bit dated. When Steinbeck wrote, the Joads probably seems to be part of a struggle driven by deliberate decisions made by people who were willing to ruin the lives of little people for profit, all the while hiding behind the claim that their actions were compelled by impersonal forces.It seems that, to Steinbeck, the struggle over land was one in which \\"The People\\" could determine the outcome. Knowing what we now know, the mechanization of agriculture set in motion forces which inexorably reduced demand for agricultural labor. The prosperity which the world enjoys today is incompatible with world the Joads knew in Oklahoma. The Tom Joads reaped the Grapes of Wrath, but many of their grandchildren eat from the Horn of Plenty. The tragedy is not, as Steinbeck seems to posit, that the Joads lost their land, but that they were unable to successfully adapt to the changing times. They could not adapt but, in their own ways, they did cope.Although the specific struggle of the Okies is passed and many of their grandchildren have achieved prosperity in the mainstream economy, their problem remains. There are still economically marginal people unable to adapt to the changing times, people who have to cope in their own ways. They too, have a spokesman in John Steinbeck.This book is powerful. It is moving. Come, ride into yesteryear."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"Grapes of Wrath is a very different book I have read from many others. I'm a high schooler, and I usually read cheesy romantics and books for teens, so it took me a long time to get into this book. It starts out slow, (actually very slow) and it kind of gets repetitve in the sense of that they're in the great depression, they're tired, hungry, and they want to get a job. Then you get into two thirds of the book, where they live in a nice camp with actual toliets that flush, hot showers, etc. and it all starts to come from there. The hardships the Joads family has to make, and how Ma is more like the dad of the house, and keeps everyone going and under control.The ending was very... different. It just sort of ended, just like to Kill a Mockingbird.This is probably one of my top ten books, and just like other classics, it takes a while to get into."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"I read Grapes of Wrath just out of interest when I saw it sitting on a bookstore shelf, it wasn't part of my school ciriculum or anything of the sort. I found it was not really entertaining and at times it's not really a page turner, but you will want to read till the end to see what happens.The problem I have with GoW is that it repeats the same monotonous message over and over again. The same lesson, the same insight, the same issue. While this may be effective in driving home to the reader the fact that the migrant situation during the depression had a far reaching and catastrophic impact on certain americans and the segregation there was in the community, I just wish I didn't need to know the same details constantly.Steinbeck did do a great job of creating a wonderfully written (sometimes poetic, especially inbetween chapters) story with wonderful characters but I do see areas where there could have been improvement. There is little description in a characters actions or movements. While you may feel what the character is going through, it can be a little more difficult to 'see' whats going on as Steinbeck was sparse with descriptions. If that's his writing style then so be it, I didn't really like that about the novel.GoW throws the reader through problem after problem, with only the strength of will of Tom and his mother keeping the family glued together, you do feel the injustice and hardships that they experienced, and the vain hope that they can obtain a piece of land.The ending is a bit of a mystery to me, I can't quite catch the metaphor in the last scene but I do see how it works overall. Anyway, if you are interested in tasting a bit of classic work, read GoW. You'll come away satisfied."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"Steinbeck is a wonderful writer and extremely thoughtful in writing this book. he incorporates several different aspects and allusions including biblical ones, marx, emerson into the book without making the story heavy or boring. there are many different symbols, ideas, and themes of steinbeck in this book and one cannot help but appreciate how much work steinbeck has put into it, and how he intertwines it all in a perfect ending. steinbeck uses interchapters between plot chapters to explain symbolism and key ideas. he also has a great style and is quite a literary genius."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"A classic, don't miss it.

I made this mistake because the introduction is incredibly long. then after the introduction-to-the-introduction, it begins a chapter-by-chapter breakdown and analysis. You might understand why i mistook this for the main body of text when i was 10% through the ebook and there was no sign of Steinbeck anywhere. If you are not a lit geek and don't want to read a complete commentary first, avoid my mistake and open the table of contents and go straight to chapter 1. Otherwise i thouroughly enjoyed this one.

I read it in preparation for taking a tour of Route 66, The Mother Road, and it added a lot of color to my tour."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"The chapters were interspersed such that one tells of the general conditions of the Great Depression, then the other one would relate the details of the events in the life of the Joad family. The narratives describing a place, an event, a feeling or emotion were so well written that the reader would feel transported back in time, to the place, made to see the event as it happened, made to feel the emotions. This, no matter if one has to struggle to understand some of the spoken words in context.A lot can be learned from this book, not only about history and the appreciation of what we have in the present day, but also more about the human strength, tenacity and innate goodness in the face of a seeming insurmountable adversity. I really wish it has a happier ending, say a reunion of the Joad family, or better times...but really, what happier ending could it have than one's giving of self to a stranger in dire need? Somehow, the reader knows, as Mama Joad had known, that all will be alright in the end."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"I think it would be in my top 10 novels ever read.It didn't change the way I view the world at all. You'd have to be living under a rock not to see how all sorts of groups of people are being abused and mistreated and so on by corporations just so their profits can be a little higher. (Including patients with M.E.!) It was good to see such issues dealt with in a novel though and in such a non-heavy handed way.I also just loved the language. I smiled every time I read the words 'fambly' or 'tar'd.'The first 150 pages are hard going, but I'd urge readers to stick with it. It is worth persevering with."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"I still remember elements of the Joad story long after having finished reading this; their story really is an American story. Steinbeck's ability to capture an enduring spirit in a sprawling family novel is a profound experience."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"I was reading about religious revival meetings, a topic not far from my own experience growing up in a little country church, and it came to light that such events were similar to 18th century \\"Holy Fairs\\" in Scotland. As many of the inhabitants of rural America--especially in the South and Appalachia--are of Scotch-Irish descent (many of my own ancestors included) it is natural to expect that the American revival meeting might have its origin in Lowland Scotland. I also found that these Scottish \\"Holy Fairs\\" were ridiculed by the poet Robert Burns in his poem \\"The Holy Fair\\", as can be found inPoems and Songs of Robert Burns. Indeed, Burns considered such gatherings to be an assembly of hypocrites who attended these meetings in order to arrange assignations with the young women attending such events. Of course Burns (the sire of numerous illegitimate children) was all for debauchery--just as it was indulged in a way that was free of pretense! As I continued thinking about this aspect of religious revival meetings I remembered the section of The Grapes of Wrath in which Tom Joad encounters Jim Casy, who had been a revival preacher in Tom's youth. Casy tells Tom about how he would bed young women in the grass after they had been excited by such meetings, which seemed to have acted as a sort of aphrodisiac. In Casy's confession to Tom he worried about his own hypocrisy in those days--leading those girls into sin just after exhorting them to shun such encounters."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"This is a great book. I finished reading this in December(now it's April) but I still remember how realistic this was written by Steinbeck. He makes the characters come alive and breathe. Their hard lives are seen as heroic and well done scenes in a long play.This is supposed to be a communistic version of California with the scenes of the goons beating up the union leaders. Look now what is happening to destroy unions in Wisconsin, Indiana, and Ohio(pretty soon New Jersey, Florida, and who knows). So Steinbeck was right in 1938 to portray unions as the enemy of the rich capitalist ranchers and agricultural powerful interests. The poor Joads were only trying to do honest work and look what happened to them.First the banks wouldn't lend to them back in Oklahoma so they decided to travel to California to make a new living. Then when they tried to make a little more money they were beaten by the union haters. Their camp was destroyed by the owners.Supposedly John Steinbeck wrote this in 5 months in 1936 at the time of the Dust Bowl. This is history that is rarely taught in America today. Young people should read this American classic. There is a Steinbeck Museum in Salinas, California and I hope to go there as soon as possible."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"If you give the book a chance it will change you in ways you never before dreamed of. The Grapes of Wrath stacks up in its theme and scope to the greatest world novels, such as Anna Karenina, Crime and Punishment, Of Human Bondage, War and Peace. Its scope and theme are universal. Its ultimate message: Human dignity and suffering. If the Grapes of Wrath doesn't stir and shake you, check your pulse. A powerful and arresting masterpiece that should be required reading for anyone who considers themselves a member of the human race, and who has ever suffered deeply and wishes to be healed by the power of humanity. Read it and treasure it."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"John Steinbeck had a gift for capturing the American spirit...both those who have and those who have not...but when you read his words you have to wonder if those who have really do 'have' anything worth capturing. At the end of 'The Grapes of Wrath' I was expecting to find a happy ending...and then I thought I didn't.......but then after I thought about the ending I thought about the lengths that some people will go to to help their fellow Americans and that all bad things that happen to us happen for some divine purpose...This is a true novel about surviving...and yet not putting yourself first. About surviving through helping others. This is a novel because not too many people look to the good even in the bad....well I can't say no more so just read it...."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"Not as good as East of Eden but way better than most books. The Joad family epitomized the wave of mid-westerners that were exploited during the dustbowl years by large farm owners. You feel for them and hang on their every hope and feel their agony as they are used by shysters, on the way to losing everything they have. The tale is so gripping and heart-wrenching! Another example of why Steinbeck is my favorite American writer!"},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"I can remember reading this book in high school, and again in college. It is a powerful book, about a time in American history that was among the most difficult we have ever faced. This book is a story of the survival of a family that manages to keep their dignity and spirit; no matter what hardships they must endure. Steinbeck's writing grabs you and draws you into the story of the Joad family, along with a vivid portrait of America. It's a book that once picked up is hard to put down. It has been called one of the greatest novels ever written, and that is an opinion I heartily agree with. No other book that I have read captures this period in America's history better than The Grapes of Wrath. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"I felt that this book was amazing. The story came to life as the characters traveled through hard times. Not only did they work together physically, but they also used their minds to oversome the many obstacles they encountered on their journey. It truly was an excellent read, and I encourage everyone to read it."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"This book absolutely strikes at the core of the American spirit. We, like the Joads, are all immigrants. Their story is the story of America. The migration from Oklahoma to California mirrors the migration from Europe and Asia to America. We all have a common bond with the \\"Okies.\\"While Steinbeck does seem to propose a collective style economy in several of his works, he also is able to identify the fierce individualism that has allowed a nation of immigrants to survive and prosper in a harsh and unsettled land. I think that he is off the mark in demonizing the haves and glorifying the have-nots. The true story lies in the battle of the just against the unjust. The struggle between givers and takers. There are good and evil on both sides.I did not especially care for the ending. I would have preferred that he follow Tom to some sort of climax as he stood out as the central figure all along. Of course, Ma was equally important and worthy of attention.In summary, we have become a soft people. We have forgotten the struggles and hardships that were overcome by our ancestors so that they might simply survive. There is, most likely, a strong spirit within most of us today. Unfortunatley, this spirit is buried very deep and held down by our numerous creature comforts and distractions. The Joads, and all of those like them, were no better than the rest of us. The circumstances of their lives, the proximity to mortality, forced their spirit to the surface.To me, the importance of this book is that it causes the reader to take a breath and to reflect on the struggles that we all are confronted with. We all have our desert to cross. We are all the same no matter how hard we try to be different."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"This is a wonderful way to understand what its like to be truly deprived of the things we treasure most in life. it helps to better understand how precious life and family are. one minute they're there and putting up a fight, and the next thing you know, they're gone. There could be no worse feeling then knowing that your family is failing. The journey through life is a hard one and every moment should be cherished."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"I'm not a huge John Steinbeck fan, so I was a little hestitant to read this book. I wasn't sure what to expect. Fortunately, this book was beyond my expectations. I was able to absorb the characters depths. John Steinbeck allows the reader to grasp each and every characters personalities and traits. He writes in such a fashion where it felt like I was actually there. The plot was fantastic and moved at a relatively quick pace. I didn't find any lulls in the story developement. The only weakness, which isn't a big one, was the ending. I thought the ending was akward. I was expecting a bit more to happen. This certainly is one of the best books I've read, and it's one that doesn't leave your mind the day after you finish."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"I enjoyed this book, but I read East of Eden right after and found it to be the better of the two."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"A beautiful story and history. Steinbeck writes the classic american tragity with Tom Joad as the tragic hero. Steinbeck captures the hard life of the dust-bowl migrants and his sparse writing style is refreshing and very enjoyable! I love this novel and consider it one of the best books I have ever read"},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"&quot;The Grapes of Wrath&quot;, I believe, can be compared to such stories as &quot;The English Patient&quot; and &quot;Das Boot&quot;. While few if any of the people in these stories actually existed, the events portrayed did happen. Whether or not the latter two are more lushly romantic or exciting, respectively, it's a lot more enjoyable reading historical fiction than some dry textbook account. And, while &quot;The Grapes of Wrath&quot; does get a little draggy and detailed for most modern tastes, try slogging through &quot;David Copperfield&quot; some time!"},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"In 1987, I read &quot;East of Eden&quot; and it immediately raced to my top 5. Timshel! For over ten years I did not want to over-Steinbeck myself, so I waited until the proper time to read &quot;The Grapes of Wrath&quot; (sadly, it was not required in High School). Well, now was the time and I did NOT want this book to end. I lived with the Joads for just three days, but I aged years in that time. That book resonated deeply in my soul. I wanted to melt inside the book and help them...I wanted to live with them so I could share the load...this book has made me a better person by opening my eyes to the plight of the poor. My '90s eyes kept expecting a newer stranger to deny the Joads help, to not share their food, to not lend a hand. But that moment never came. Everyone pitched in when things got rough - except, of course, the ones who could monetarily afford it. How little our society has changed in 60 years! This book should be required of ALL 16-year-olds. But as I found out this week, a 34-year-old can be deeply, deeply affected as well. READ THIS BOOK."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"A CLASSIC! JET FUEL FOR YOUR SOUL."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"This is a book that cannot be read quickly. The slow pace of it gives the reader more of an opportunity to fully appreciate the greatness of Steinbeck's talents. This is a story of how people adapt to poverty and despair by increasing the concept of &quot;family&quot; to encompass all of those suffering the same conditions. Being united against &quot;them&quot; (the banks, the landowners) is the only way to survive. This is shown on the group level by the self-governing government camp and on the personal level by Rose of Sharon's act of kindness to a starving man. Steinbeck does a masterful job of developing the Joad family - from Ma Joad's increasing strength to Tom's gradual enlightenment. Steinbeck was, indeed, a genius."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"This book has a good theme and VERY descriptive writing. The characters are protrayed very well and the sufering the family goes through is heart wrenching. I think it makes a person ask what they would do if they were suddenly wrenched from their homes and had to travel to an unknown place to survive."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"I read the Grapes of Wrath 10 years ago and it changed the way I looked at the world. The potential of mankind to be brutally cold and greedy was shocking. But there were also people who were willing to share everything out of sheer goodness. Re-reading it again made me realize the message is still relevant today. Read it for sake of your soul."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"I have just finished the Grapes of Wrath a couple of weeks ago after it was sitting on my shelf for three years. I must say that it was perhaps the &quot;deepest&quot; American novel of the first half of the 20th century that I am familiar with.Even though the times and way of life it chronicles are long gone, there is an immediacy to the writing that transports one to what the Joad family, and all dispossessed families of the era, must have felt and endured.The novel is imbued with a sweet sadness much of the time, but there is also a spirit of faith, decency, and joy that this brave family, not soon to be forgot, displays which is quintessentially both American and universal."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"This wonderful book, while slow and sometimes hard to drudge through, is an insight into the plight of the farmer during the dustbowl. For all those looking for a book to impress your English teacher with, or just a historical fiction book about an important time in the history of the United States, I would recommend that you read this book."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"No one since Steinbeck has so craftily woven the names of places and things into the fabric of the characters' lives. It is a complete joy to read the melange of roadside towns and attractions that seem to haunt the Joads' journey. Their jalopy becomes a metaphor of a broken down world that entraps them. However catastrophic the tragedy becomes, it is a slow and deliberate kind of grief. There always seems to be someone to help send the Joads' on their way. The tale hits home when the Oklahoma family reaches California, the land of hopes and dreams, of liberty, for the Joads' and the rest of the nation. There awaits them a cauldron of discontent among those sharing a similar fate, in the migrant worker camps. Of course, like all Steinbeck works, the novel ends on a dark, albeit sardonic note that is brilliant and one that only he could have produced. This book was a benchmark for what has become the great American road tale"},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"When I read this, slow, steady book, which mirrored the pace of the jalopy moving from Oklahoma to California, I felt like someone was beating me over the head with a small stick. It didn't hurt at first, but it kept getting worse and worse, more and more depressing. But just when I thought I had reached rock bottom, the ending gave meaning and even satisfaction like no other book has ever done.Truly a masterpiece."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"This is a good book, but it is a tad long a wordy at times."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"on time, speedy delivery and everything as it was said to be in the description. Thanks!"},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"I read OF MICE AND MEN in high school and still remember the book fondly. I couldn't believe that I had never read more than bits and pieces of THE GRAPES OF WRATH and decided recently that I wanted to read this classic book. I must say that although I enjoyed the book and liked the characters much of the book seemed preachy and heavy-handed. The pages also seemed to drag on and on and on... Finally, I don't want to spoil the book for those of you who haven't read it yet, but the closing scene completely through me for a loop and will give me the &quot;heebie-jibbies&quot; for the rest of my life."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"I generally like early Steinbeck but this book is irritating to read.Every poor person is all good every rich California land owner all bad.All the Okies need is a spark for Bolshevism to ignite on and on and on....East of Eden and other of his works where Steinbeck remains a fly on the wall observer and non political are so much better don't waste your time on this."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"If you don't mind getting dropped at the end of a story, The Grapes Of Wrath is the novel for you. It is a marvelous story of the Joad's struggle across the country to California to make a living for themselves after their farm was reposed by the bank. You follow them every step of the way through different problems; death, starvation, jobs, and cops. You gain a kind of bond with and empathy for the characters. You care about what happens to every member of the Joad family. You would be sad if they never made it, but at least you would know what happened to them. You never find out. In the middle of a crisis Steinbeck decides to drop you like yesterday's sour milk. It drove me nuts.If Steinbeck had had some sort of ending to the story, it would have been the best story I have ever read. It has no ending. The book is like one of those really annoying sequels that draws you in, gets you addicted, and then says to be continued. Well it is just your luck that you don't get a sequel; there is no to be continued.Other than the minor detail with the terrible ending, it is well written with a style that is easily comprehended. Anyone could read this book. It has what I like to call &quot;story relief chapters&quot;; that is a chapter between each chapter on the main story. These specific chapters give you a view at the world around the Joads smoothly. These chapters don't even mess up the flow of the story.So in conclusion, this book is well written with no ending. I give it three stars because a book can't only have a good story, but it must have a good ending (or any ending for that fact). You can judge it for yourself if you do read it, but that is my review."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"I find it highly irritating when others start acting condescending towards people just for not liking their choice in books. I am eighteen years old, and I read THE GRAPES OF WRATH &quot;for fun&quot; (in other words, it was not a school assignment) in high school. I did not like it. Does that make me an &quot;immature&quot; reader? I don't think so! Contrary to what you seem to think about those who hate TGoW, I do enjoy &quot;serious&quot; books (The Good Earth; The Butcher Boy; Animal Farm; 1984; those not serious enough for you?) You would do better to stop making such outrageous presumptuous remarks based on a teenager's taste in books. Obviously, you cannot be much more mature than the readers you criticize, if you cannot handle a difference in taste. I personally love Lord of the Flies, for instance, but I understand that there are those who do not. Unlike you, I do not go around saying that those who do not like LotF are simply missing the bigger meaning behind the work."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"Now unlike many of the other readers for Grapes of Wrath, I disliked most of the book. Yes it does tell the story of the migrant workers in California. And yes John Stienbeck is descriptive. In my opinion the way his writing is completely bored me. I had to literally force myself to read this book it was so boring. It was far sure way to long and also a very slow reading book. This book bored me so much that I would fall asleep when reading it. Every now and then there was a good chapter but mostly pretty boring of a book. His writing is not nearly as interesting as other authors. Stienbeck is considered a great author, but not really to me. Save yourself some pain and do not read this book unless you have to!"},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"The picture that appears is exactly what I wanted but sadly does not represent in any way the product that I received. When I sent my view to First Editions Etc. I received a very unsatisfactory reply which stated that the picture shown does not represent the actual product. If that isn't misleading and false advertising I don't know what is!!!!! I won't be doing this again."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"The Grapes of Wrath is supposedly an American classic. The fact that it is considered such explains many of my problems with American literature and American culture in general. In order to show what a poor contender this novel is, I'm going to contrast it to something that's actually great literature, Crime and Punishment by Dostoevsky.Where to begin? First and most importantly, the narrative is uninspiring. The prose is dry, dispassionate and bland. Not dessicated and spare and powerful like Camus, but just dull. The interchapters, in particular, are tedious and pretensious exercises in literary superfluity. All of your middle-school english teachers no doubt told you that when you write something you should 'show not tell,' and that's good advice, but Steinbeck just tells you the story and keeps telling it for 600 miserable pages. So thus the manner of the novel's writing adds nothing to the book, and indeed detracts from it. Contrast this to a novel by Dostoevsky like Crime and Punishment or Notes from Underfround where the narrative itself is feverish, illucid and grating, reflecting the protagonist's wretchedness.Next, all the characters are delightfully black and white, on the whole. Casey is messianic, the men killing him are devils, and there's no in between. Contrast this to the moral ambiguities of Crime and Punishment and you'll see why Steinbeck comes off the worse.On a related note, the novel seems to have no means of conveying a spiritual message of its own, since the prose is so soulless, but Steinbeck tries to make it spiritual by inserting Casey's tedious neotranscendentalist sermonizing. Contrast this to Crime and Punishment, where the moral is so integral to novel that any expounding of it is entirely natural.So if you enjoy complex, multilayered characters, an interesting writing style and stimulating philosophical questions in a novel, stop yourself before you pick up this inexplicably 'classic' novel and read something by a Russian instead."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"\\"The Grapes of Wrath\\" is one of those intimidating \\"great books\\" that everyone knows about and no one reads. The irony is that it is a book about ordinary people, and the language and plot are hardly difficult at all. The Joads, driven off their Oklahoma farm by the encroachment of industrialization, seek a better life in California - with thousands of others in the same position. The migrants are forced to compete for survival, but only by leveraging their power as a group can they ever truly triumph. The theme of individual vs. group is further emphasized by the form of the novel. Steinbeck uses alternating chapters about the Joads and \\"interchapters\\" about the migrants as a whole. Thus the book, besides being the great American epic about the Joads, is also a social and political novel that caused an enormous uproar upon its publication. This is a book that is part of the collective American conscious and should be read by everyone who wants to feel thoroughly educated."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"BORING. MEANINGLESS.I was not at all absorbed, it's just a piece of sh*t"},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"The two words that best descibe John Steinbeck's The Grapes of Wrath are long and dry. Although I found the plot (the plight of the Joad family and their journey to California to find a better lifestyle) interesting and thought provoking, the novel is too long to keep the interest of the reader. Intercalary chapters (usually odd numbered) add seemingly pointless symbolism and can confuse or bore readers.Another aspect of the novel that I severly disliked was the diction (an older Oklahoma twang) that was hard to understand.Overall, I didn't like many aspects of the novel, but I thought that the plot was interesting. Also, in my opinion, the ending was somewhat sick and twisted.So if you're in for a long read with a lot of symbolism, the Grapes of Wrath is the perfect book for you. Otherwise,I would recommend a lighter, more interesting novel."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"When you reach page 300 of a book and it's still boring, STOP. NOT ONE WORD MORE. Any optimism won't change the unread content. Unless money has been tucked as a bookmark later on, you won't miss a thing. &quot;Grapes of Wrath&quot; made me want to have a glass of wine and plot my revenge on those who have declared it a classic.

Buy it from Amazon for $3.99.hello?"},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"The book \\"The Grapes of Wrath\\" was a great book for showing the effects of the dust bowl and depression on Americas people. This book shows how america has changed from a state of chaos and uncertianty in the dust bowl of the 1930's. Now it is a state of what america was meant to be, a land of success and prosperity. We truely see America as a place of confusion and uncertianty in the entire trip that the Joad's made. The Joad's don't know where they are going throughout the whole trip they were going to a better place for everyone(so they thought). The confusion happened thoughout the whole trip because they had heard so many good things about this wondewrful new land of work and money. As they go their though they realize through the people coming and going from the land of 'prosperity' that it isn't all that it's cooked up to be. They learn through people and their own experiences that the land of prosperity for one man isn't that for the other. But, they are confused and uncertian about this througout the whole book until at the end they realize that this land doesn't mean prosperity, it means death for them, but at that time it's too late.I didn't like this book because I believe it took to long to get to things. I think they could have cut out several chapters about the tractors and migrates because they just repeated themsleves and didn't really state a strong knew point. I would have enjoyed it more if they had condensed it and threw out some of the unnecessary stops and converstions as well as chapters and people they meet. I do believe most of the people were important like the Wilsons and the people at the government camp like Thomas, Mrs. Sandry, etc. But, the people they talk to at the stops sometimes and people they associate themselves with for a night that takes a chapter. Why do you even put them in? This book could have been a lot shorter if you cut out alot of the unnessecary things.I think this book has very good themes and gives you a good idea about what the 1930's and dust bowl was like though. I shows you the pain and suffering that people had to endure in different ways and ages. They showed you the Granma and Granpa, Ma and Pa, Al, Tom, Rose of Sharon, Connie, and Casey, Winfeild and Ruthie. Each person show you how this effected their age of people and the way they did things and conducted themselves. This doesn't acount for everyone in their age group, but a good portion. One example is Tom. He resembles the common worker who is ambicious and angry at where he is. It shows him nearly killing himself to try to get fair work and to be respected at the same time. Everyone resembles a different group in America and how they were effected by the turn of events that was happenign in America.I liked the books purpose, theme, and reasons for writing it. I think that some of the individual componients could have been changed, but over all I can look over those and see a very well written book with a great meaning and purpose."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"The Grapes of Wrath had to have been one of the most boring books I have read in my entire life. The plot is switched around so many times it is confusing, the some of the characters were given way too many names, and I couldn't tell what character was being talked about half the time. Most of the book is entirely pointless and the important part of the story is about ten pages long. The plot of the story is boring, and the story its self is ended in a very confusing manner. If you don't believe me, you can read the book, which you probably won't finish anyway."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"Since I am seriously considering becoming an English teacher, I decided that I should get a head start on things and read as many classics as I possibly could last summer. \\"The Grapes of Wrath\\" happened to be the most difficult one to get through. The story line is quite boring and seems very pointless at times. The book does, however, redeem itself slightly when it is not focusing on the main story line. John Steinbeck writes about the Great Depression from other character's points of view other than the main family the story is focused upon, and he gives some profound insights of his own on this time period every third chapter as well. I would seriously suggest skipping the chapters which contains the main story line, and read the others instead. It would be much more worth your time and sanity."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"I like steinbeck. i really do. east of eden was wonderful. every other book i have read by him was good. however, this book is a waste of time. the people in the places he wrote about were insulted, and i don't blame them. my family were farmers(not in that area). i guarentee that they read, write, and do not get put in jail. they actually use proper english(gasp of astonishment). and they have shoes(does that blow your mind?). that said, this book makes a powerful statement about the time it was written, but i can't get past the characters. i cannot force myself to like tom joad, or the nasty preacher. any comparison to christ is just disturbing. maybe the mark of a good writer is to push the envelope, but i don't care to read a book written just for that purpose. good books are honest, and i simply don't believe this one is. also, look how long it is. as an added discouragement, my religion teacher likes this book. so to me that is another reason to avoid it. one last word about farmers. farmers are some of the best people in the world. and they are not stupid. and there are people who believe in God and actually act the right way. granted, a lot of people don't. but i am sick of all this one big united spirit garbage. and people think Christians are stupid for believing in God. you want something stupid, look at this transcendalism garbage. when are people going to stop saying something is beyond them when it is really below them?"},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"I wouldn't even give this book 1 star. IT was horrible. IT was boring. IT was over-exaggerated. It is total communist propaganda.

I started it one summer, but only got about twenty pages or so into it before I gave up. I didn't get back to The Grapes of Wrath until my freshman year of college when I had to read it for a Geography class. I wasn't sure why the book was assigned for Geography, but was glad that I finally had an excuse to read through the book. It was assigned at the begining of the semester, and I think that I finished it about a month before we even started talking about it.This book deserves every bit of praise that it has recieved. It tells the story of the Joad family, \\"Okies\\" who are journeying to California after their farm has been destroyed by both the effects of \\"The Dust Bowl\\" and the attempts of the United States government to control crop prices. At first, they believe that the \\"Golden state\\" is abundant with oppertunaties; Grampa is so excited that he says he wants to smash grapes all over his face when he gets to California. Yet soon all their hopes turn sour. Their trip exposes the rural farm family to the hardships of literally surviving during a time of economic downfall. The Joads experience loss of several family members and blique hopes for steady employment when they finally reach California; yet by the novel's end Steinbeck ensures that the Joads--and all the migrant farm workers in general--will continue to endure. Steinbeck inspired the characters in The Graphes of Wrath with heartfelt emotion, and by reading it you will truely experience their difficulties.A unique characteristic of the novel is that it contains \\"interlude\\" chapters after every narrative chapter or two. These chapters describe the the overall effects of others during The Dust Bowl and weave their way into the events of the Joads themselves. The first interlude chapter about the turtle is quite interesting and serves as a symbol of the story overall.This book is a must read for anyone and can be interpreted on quite a few different levels, including an allegory of the journey to the promised land. There are even a few funny jokes that I underlined in my text to remember. Although the novel may not imediately seem all that interesting, stick with it because it is worth finishing."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"I used to be dubious of the fame that some books have achieved, and wondered if the popularity was often earned. This is one of those famous books we all hear about. I was delighted to find that, not only was the writing beautiful and profound, but the characters seemed life-like, and the story well developed. When reading the story of the Joad's struggle, the only thing that you cannot feel is apathy. I found myself enraged by the atrocities committed against these migrant people.I honestly believe that 95% of everyone who reads this book will be impressed and, to some degree at least, transformed. Out of my favorite books, this one is probably in my top five."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"Overall, this book was fantastic. It was interesting with lots of backround information, and showed how people struggle in life, and even though I am only eleven, I know struggling is something even our modern generation can relate to. My only complaint is that for the first one or two hundred pages it was very slow, and practically nothing happened. I put the book down for nearly a month before I felt like reading it again. Although when I did finish reading it it was very good, even if the ending was abrupt (that always makes me so annoyed!)."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"I read this tragic story with a constant smile on my face. The characters are so completely enjoyable. The situations heart rending yet so vividly described that it is entertaining/amusing.The story is not so much amusing because it is humorous. The smile is pure amazement over Steinbeck's ability to create this work where I could be a first hand witness to the characters and events. Some situations are laugh-out-loud funny although serious. Even the tragic events bring a smile and a lump to your throat at the same time. Every page pulled at my heart, my mind, and my face. I thoroughly enjoyed this book.It is also a real eye opener to the industrial revolution, big finance, and the depression era.As another reviewer wrote 'This is a book which will make you feel different about your fellow man.'"},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"I can't say enough about Dylan Baker's reading of this extraordinary book. I've read the book and fully enjoyed the experience but Baker's reading brought my appreciation of this timeless novel to a new level."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"I read Grapes of Wrath about a year ago and the imagery is still very vivid in my mind. Needless to say, I think it's a great book and thoroughly deserve it's classic status. Granted, Mr. Steinbeck wasn't the best in prose like an Anderson or Fitzgerald but I think the most important part of a story is the story itself and Steinbeck is a great story teller. I've never felt more anger than when the Joad's were called &quot;Okkies&quot; or more sickened when they were cheated by the farm owners. The style of alternating the chapters was quite clever and I think it just sort of builds up the suspense. The ending to me is just right although a bit melodramatic, it captures the essence of hopelessness that prevails throughout the book. I thoroughly recommend this book and Steinbeck will make a cynic out of you yet."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"After losing their family farm in the red country of Oklahoma, the Joads must move to California to find their dreams and a better way of living. Together, they give support as well as life to their fellow neighbors who are experiencing the same difficulties of traveling to the west for a more satisfactory life.I thought this book was very well written by John Steinbeck because he brought out each character very distinctly. None of the characters were EXACTLY the same as another. I could almost imagine myself working together with the Joads, scraping around for food and water, trying to survive just for a better life. Steinbeck captured all the touching moments as well as the tough times that the Joads went through, and brought them altogether in the end.Another reason why I enjoy Steinbeck's books: Stated in the Nobel Prize Acceptance Speech of 1962 - &quot;The ancient commission of the writer has not changed. He is charged with exposing our many grievous faults and failures, with dredging up to the light our dark and dangerous dreams for the purpose of improvement.&quot;Our imperfections that we often try to hide from the world is brought straight out to us in Steinbeck's books. He is not afraid to state the facts. But, even with those flaws we are working towards growth and development in our lives.I relate The Grapes of Wrath to Of Mice and Men because just like the Joads who are moving to improve their lifestyle, George and Lennie are doing the same on a smaller scale. They are all in search for their dreams and goals that they set for themselves. Furthermore, I do recommend The Grapes of Wrath if you want to experience the captivating characters and the hardships one family goes through to find happiness."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"This book is quite possibly the best book I've ever read. It is a story of the Joad family; a poor share-cropping family in oklahoma during the dust bowl. Having fallen on hard times thanks to bad crops and an uncaring system, they are forced to go west. Their journey exposes the very worst of class distinction. The Joads are forced to live in unspeakable conditions, and like the other migrant families are constantly harrassed and exploited by the powers that be. This is a vivid tale of the human condition and a message to all of us. Steinbeck does a masterful job of telling the story. He pulls no punches and makes no excuses for the barbaric treatment of the migrants. He tells a story that the world might have otherwise forgotten, and makes us consider the fairness of it all."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"As a 9th grader I am a great fan of Steinbecks work. Of Mice and Men, The Pearl, and East of Eden are but a few of my favorite books. John Steinbeck has a way of digging into every reader of his books. His books help his readers learn about past events and even about themselves. The Grapes of Wrath is one of his greatest books, second only to &quot;The Winter of Our Disscontent&quot;. Grapes of Wrath is full of tragedy, love and suspense, yet remains to be a very intelligent and insightfull book on the human soul. Im not saying this book is for everyone though. Its 619 pages long and most of that is dialoge. Every odd chapter tells the setting of the chapter to come. This can become tedious but truly gives a vivid picture of exactly the Joad family and the country are going through. I do recommend this book, but I believe the reader needs to have a lot of patience and a lot of time on their hands."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"I put this book down, and I had no idea what to say. It was such a terrific book. I am glad that I picked this book up on my own, rather than being forced to read it in a class. I was able to enjoy it so much more and read it at my own pace. I felt myself seething with anger at times, laughing at others, and at other times just sitting spellbound by the excellent use of imagery. With so many books, a reader can find it hard to see in his mind what the author wishes a reader to see. With Mr. Steinbeck, I encountered no such problems. Another technique that I enjoyed (that other reviewers seemed confused by) was Steinbeck alternating between the story of the Joad family, and a sort of social commentary, every other chapter. I would rather Mr. Steinbeck DIDNT use quotations in these chapters. If he did, it may feel he was confining the situations presented in the &quot;odd&quot; chapters, to a single character. But by removing the quotations, I felt myself imagining that he was speaking for all the dispossesed, not just a single person. A masterpiece."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"As staged in the 1920&iexcl;s, Steinbeck starts with a subtle beginning. A slow developing plot, but worth while if you be patient. This book is definitely worth the time and effort, if you read a book once a year. A mixture of both intimidation and desperation sets fills your mind, and entices you to continue reading. The Joads, a family of four from Oklahoma, are on a journey westward toward California, with grandpa and grandma, after a famine sets over and destroys most of their crops. As the story continues on, the Joads realize that death and hatred pay a significant part out of their country. Death was the biggest cost from reaching their goal. Many family members died, and so, the family started to question the destiny. Being intimidated and threatened treason from the other states, the Joads feel despised. There is only one communication that Steinbeck wants to communicate, &iexcl;the hard workers survive&iexcl;. The weak does not. The perseverance and indifference from the other people create this silence war from other states. Some where nice folks and some didn&iexcl;t crack a smile at all. People not only scorn them, but actually refuse to serve them. As a book, it would be one of the most memorable one, and to compensate the slow pace, the conclusion. The Great Depression brought many people down, and this is actually what life was during that time.It is fairly a nice body, with many uses of southern accented language. Steinbeck should be famous for using all those apostrophes and accents, which I would never know how to do it. &iexcl;I ain&iexcl;t got nothin&iexcl; for you, boy,&iexcl; quotes the Joads, as an example.The ending was actually quite a shock. It was like, &iexcl;then I woke up and it was all a dream&iexcl; endings. I don&iexcl;t want to spoil it, and certainly I wouldn&iexcl;t tell you. It was abrupt and unexpected. A must read to all people of all ages, but beware; you are in for many surprises."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"Nestled between the parched earth of the Oklahoma country and the flooded fields of the California valley lies a tale so stark that its own nakedness adorns it like the most precious jewel. The story is narrated in the rustic tongues of the Joad family and the poetic maelstrom of the author's conscience; the guileless, earthy wisdom of country folks and the refined, high-flying ideology of Steinbeck. I don't recall being more moved by any other piece of literature ever.The younger Tom Joad is easily one of the finest characters I've read. There is no magic attributed to Tom or his family and the author does not ask you to suspend reality anywhere in the novel. If anything, the reality is so overwhelming that I often found myself breaking in-between and taking a few minutes off to unwind.The book is written with excruciatingly detailed observations like \\"Joad took the bottle from him (Casy, the preacher), and in politeness did not wipe the neck with his sleeve before he drank\\"! To write something like that, a person would have to have powers of perception that transcend sight or sound. We've read so many times of vague emotions; unidentifiable joys, unnamed pains, inexplicable kinship and intuitive distrust. With Steinbeck, there is no ambiguity. It is, as is.Every alternating chapter details the journey of the Joads while the ones in between are the author's discourse on the larger issue of human depravity of which the sufferings of the Joad family are but the most nominal instance. My favourite such chapter in the entire novel was Chapter 25. To quote, \\"The Spring is beautiful in California. Valleys in which the fruit blossoms are fragrant pink and white waters in a shallow sea. Then the first tendrils of the grapes, swelling from the old, gnarled vines, cascade down to cover the trunks. The full green hills are round and soft as breasts\\"...The author proceeds to describe in the most tender and in the most fascinated of terms, the luscious growth of fruits and vegetables and flowers and the men who work to create this marvel of plenty. He sings paeans to their ingenuity and slowly trundles through to the ripening and maturing of this plentiful produce and suddenly we find ourselves facing the most abhorrent of truths. In the face of exploitation and refusal to pay the wages for this harvest to be reaped, Steinbeck wreaks his vengeance on this paradisical beauty so elegantly painted in his lyrical prose. He commands the birds and the wasps and the flies to feast on the decaying, stinking, putrefying apparition left in the aftermath of his destructive force. His weapon, his mighty pen. Truly, no sword could obliterate with such completeness.\\"Men who can graft the trees and make the seeds fertile and big can find no way to let the hungry people eat their produce. Men who have created new fruits in the world cannot create a system whereby their fruits may be eaten. And the failure hangs over the State like a great sorrow.\\"Steinbeck has had his revenge. It does little to comfort him.\\"There is a crime here that goes beyond denunciation. There is a sorrow here that weeping cannot symbolize. There is a failure here that topples all our success.\\"I shook when I was done reading this chapter. I am no Communist, not even quite a Socialist. But this book is one of the finest examples of how high the human mind can fly, how far and wide it can see, how unflinchingly it can comprehend and how limitlessly it can feel. I consider myself most fortunate to have read this book. Read it."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"I can remember the brown clouds rising up and sweeping over our home, even in Oklahoma City in the early 1950's. And the stories from my parents and grandparents who stayed in Oklahoma through the depression, and the stories from my grandmother who moved to California looking for work, but it wasn't until 1967 when I was in the Navy in San Diego situations would inspire me to read this book.Even today in California, being called an &quot;Okie&quot; is not a compliment. It is said with a derogatory note of disdain akin to so many other predjudicial nicknames, and you really don't feel the entire impact unless one is directed at you.What was this about? Why was there such an attitude towards people from Oklahoma? A friend told me I would find the answers in this book. It was in reading this book I lost my naivete about the depth of human prejudice and callousness. It was this book that inspired me to participate in civil rights demonstrations when the Navy transfered me to Mississipi. It was this book that woke me up!I will always be grateful to Steinbeck for the skill to tell a story such as this, and I can only hope it's message will endure through all time."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"\\"The Grapes of Wrath\\" is a powerful indictment of the oppression endured by the migrant families of the American mid-west during the depression years of the 1930's. The farming-belt of the mid west had suffered severe drought. \\"Dusters\\" swept across the farmland, skimming off the topsoil, leaving behind a dust bowl, only a few sparse sprigs of wheat surviving. The tenant farms were foreclosed and the families forcibly tractored off the land in a ruthless drive to maximise profit margins. Circa 250,000 migrants, \\"refugees from the dust\\", pulled up stakes and headed west on route 66, the road of flight to California, the golden land of dreams and opportunity, drawn by the prospect of picking work, harvesting oranges and peaches. The influx of rootless migrant workers centred on the San Joachin valley, California, and the huge farms therein, drifting in search of work from squatter camps to government camps to shacks in tied labour camps charging excessive rents and inflated company-store prices. The overwhelming glut of migrants flooding through the valley swamped the harvesting work available, driving down wages to peanuts level, as they desperately scrabbled \\"to pull, to pick, to cut - anything, any burden to bear, for food\\".This is the destiny that fate had in store for the Joad family in \\"The Grapes of Wrath\\". Forced off their farm, truck piled high with their meagre belongings, the Joads set forth on an epic 2000 miles haul from Sallislaw in Oklahoma through the western desert states of New Mexico and Arizona and onto the San Joachin valley. The gut-wrenching story of the Joads heroic journey is interspersed with short \\"relief\\" chapters on peripheral aspects of their route 66 experience, the trickery of used-car salesmen or a snapshot of life in a truck-stop diner, to give but two examples; other chapters function as social commentary on, for example, the stomach turning practice of spraying mountains of oranges with kerosene or dumping potatoes in the river under armed guard to protect market prices, at a time when hundreds of thousands of migrants were literally starving. This structure enables Steinbeck at once to follow closely the fortunes of the Joads and cast a wider eye over what is happening in society during the depression years.However, Steinbeck's narrative, in my view, is at its most powerful and compelling on the road, chronicling the Joads suffering and misfortune trucking along the endless narrow concrete miles to Bakersfield, California, revealing qualities of grit, guts and resilience in their desperate struggle for survival in the face of death, starvation, hostility, exploitation and harassment. The strength of the human spirit is witnessed in Ma Joad's struggle against the odds to hold her family together. Steinbeck's powerful story depicting the plight of the migrants during the hard times of the 1930's depression years, the hardship and oppression endured by thousands upon thousands of families like the Joads, will resonate for generations to come - a timeless classic that has inspired my belief in social justice."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"This book is the story of the Joad family, a family that has been forced off of their land in Oklahoma during the 1930's. Like hundreds of thousands of others, they decide to migrate to California where work supposedly is. Throughout their tale they face prejudice, hatred, and injustice. But, through these trials, they learn the imporatnce of family and strength in unity. The structure of the story is amazing and a sure bet for a good read."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"This book shows the hardships of life in the 1920s, depicting the lives of migrant families who were forced out of their farms and homelands. As the characters go on both physical and personal journeys, the book shows how faith and hope can guide people through the hard times."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"&quot;The Grapes of Wrath&quot; is at times painfully beautiful. John Steinbeck's skills as a writer are amazingly displayed throughout, and what most struck me about this novel is the way he can transition from one chapter that delves so fearlessly into the inner psyches of his characters to another that looks at the time period and events unfolding with an almost documentary-like detachment.I can see how this book can turn off some. I must admit that the first time I started it, I didn't get past the first 100 pages or so. But something about it kept nagging at me to finish, and by the end of that particular summer, I had. Then I re-read it a few years later, and couldn't put it down. What keeps it so readable, at least for me, is the pure respect and dignity with which Steinbeck treats his characters. These are decent, hard-working people trying to make the most that they can out of a desperate situation, and the book is never condescending.&quot;The Grapes of Wrath&quot; is filled with such humanity that it very nearly brings one to tears at several points---yet it's never maudlin. A scene involving a diner waitress offering free candy to two poverty-stricken children could be saccharine in any other hands, but here it's a wonderful instance of one human reaching out to another. And in a world like the one portrayed here, where retaining even the barest vestiges of human dignity becomes a struggle, scenes like the one above take on immense proportions.It's a shame that to many this book represents drudgery. For me it was actually intensely readable, to the point that I didn't want to stop, and the ending took my breath away. Again, it could have been hammy and heavy-handed, but it wasn't. Not with Steinbeck behind the scenes."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"The Grapes of Wrath was the masterpiece of Steinbeck's carrer, the full embodiment of his previous writings, his social, political, and religious views, as well as his look on human nature.Take it as a prediction for a socialist revolution in America, take it as a revelation of human injustice, take it as a story of the American Dream and the will to survive, whatever the book means to you, you'll take something away from reading it. Even if you don't buy into Steinbeck's political and religious views - that we are all &quot;one soul&quot; and that should work together as one big family - you will feel a compassion for the injustice that has occured to the working poor throughout history. It is a harrowing and powerful novel well worthy of five stars and its place as a classic."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"Must read! Wonderful descriptions and character development. One of my top favorites."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"Truly one the greatest books of all time, and my favorite book as well, from my favorite author. This book has two different chapter styles, one is the traditional story, the other is strange, poetic observational view of the immigrants plight as a whole and the twisted, corrupt world they must live through. The story begins with Tom Joad returning to his home in Oklahoma from prison. When he gets home however, he finds his family kicked off their farmland. Since the family before their eviction had been getting notices from california that made California seem like some kind of utopia full of food, long green fields, and happiness seeping from the land. So the family, along with some other people, head on to California across the country. Along the way however, the family witness trauma, injustice, and hardships as they head onward to California. And when they finally get there, they recieve even more pain and agony, and are constantly geeting abused by the oppression and injustice forced upon them by everyone else around them, from the law enforcers, to the regular California citizens.This book is not quite for the light of heart, or the hopeful and optimistic, and possibly conservative. This book hits you heavy, and leaves you in a glum, melancholy state. Any glimpse of hope or happiness found within the dark confines of this book is ripped apart, raped, and thrown into the infinite blackness within these pages. John himself that he wanted the reader to not quite feel satisfied but rather deppressed and sad after reading this book, And John succeeds greatly. John, who I consider the king of character emotion and development in literature, perfectly paints the dark and twisted world he set out to create, and has perfect characters to inhibatit it to boot. I won't tell you about anything else so you can read the book in a comftorble cloud of uncertainty, But prepare to see characters strained and twisted and bent under the injustice they must endure, as well as characters who break under it all.The other style of chapters in this book is interesting and further establishes this book's identity. It is a poetic style of prose that observes the plight of the immigrants as a whole, from their land evictions, to finding a car with the little money they have, to the journey westward and the perils that follow it, the the pain they must enudre in California. These chapters hit you so hard that you may find yourself recuperating from the book and laying down on the couch, resting your fractured head. This just makes the book all the more disturbing in its power.Besides the fact that this book does drag on a little bit in a few parts, I can't really think of a problem with it. I have heard that some people (Mostly rule following scholars and other people of such a type) din't like it because of the book bring too sentimental, and the talkin' style of the Joads and immigrants was a littl' stupid or somethin' like that. I for one found the dialogue interestng, and anybody that thinks this book overtly sentamental is most likely an emotionally hardened, cold person. A true classic."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"A towering masterpiece. Realistic and poetic at the same time, angry and compassionate, and still amazingly relevant after two-thirds of a century. This brings the Depression more real than anything I have read, and yet it is far from being a depressing book. One of Steinbeck's themes is how when people are cast out and cast down, their basic humanity draws them together into a big family governed by the laws of simple goodness and compassion. Perhaps this is a sentimental view, but it is attained one agonizing step at a time. Against this he sets the impersonal forces of big business, a pitiless economy, besieged communities hiding behind a corrupt police force, and the indifferent hand of nature, portrayed in short interleaved chapters that can be lyrical or bitter, passionate or cynically understated.These short anonymous sections are absolutely necessary to the scale of the book, but some of them have a set-piece quality that at times seems somewhat dated. Not so Steinbeck's treatment of the main narrative, especially his portrayal of individuals: Tom Joad, prison-hardened and wiser than his years, Casy the preacher who loses his faith to arrive at stronger truths, and Ma Joad who holds the family together. These are people totally of their time and place, and yet timeless, a testament to the almost unquenchable power of the human spirit. And nothing is more moving than the way the novel ends: with a simple act of kindness by one broken human being to another, that in Steinbeck's hands becomes a sacrament of grace, bringing tears to the eyes and hope to the soul.[PS. I first tried to read THE GRAPES OF WRATH four decades ago, in England in my mid-twenties, but gave up. I found it impossible to follow the dialect, I utterly lacked the knowledge of American history in the Depression era, and I dare say I lacked the life experience to appreciate the book's moral strength. For the second and third of these reasons, at least, I thus find it strange that the novel is so often assigned at the high-school level. After living in the USA now for 35 years, it means so much more to me. This is not because of history or language, but because the issues which made the book relevant in 1939 are still present in American life today, in its politics, its corporate culture, some aspects of its religion... but also in the enduring human spirit which Steinbeck so powerfully celebrates.]"},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"As much a political manifesto as the simple story of a family forced to leave their family farm and seek a new life in California, the Grapes of Wrath is a masterpiece of American literature. Set in the American West at the start of the mass migration to the West Coast, the story follows the Joad family from the foreclosure of their farm through the long road trip along Route 66 and finally to their lives as migrant workers in a land overflowing with workers. Their lives and hardships are vividly painted in Steinbeck's outstanding prose.Steinbeck alternates styles each chapter. Every other chapter details the story of the Joads. In the remaining chapters Steinbeck uses a repetitive, haphazard, ungrammatical, absolutely brilliant style to sketch a scene from the life of a migrant family, ostensibly the Joads. In these chapters, he conveys scenes such as the high-paced action of a used car lot, the bitterness of a family receiving foreclosure notice, or the back breaking work of cotton picking with such clarity and color that the words of the book seem to fall away leaving the reader with a tangible world in which voices are shouting or the breeze is tossing the cotton tufts into the air. In my own reading, I've seen many authors try to mimic this unstructured, repetitive style, but never done as well as this.The story is rich with symbolism and emotion. While there are some spots where Steinbeck seems to be working too hard, the book as a whole is a wonderful read. You will come away a little more educated about that era in America's history, a little more sympathetic to the plight of migrant workers, and maybe even a little more left-leaning in your political views. Regardless of what you intend to get out of it, the Grapes of Wrath is absolutely recommended for anyone of the maturity to understand the deep themes that run through the story."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"Although I have reviewed dozens of books, this is the first time I have felt speechless. It is not because I do not have anything to say, rather, it is because the book is so deep and complex and evokes so many feelings that I do not even know where to begin. I guess I'll begin by saying Steinbeck's ability to illustrate a book with just words is phenomenal. The imagery in The Grapes of Wrath is so enjoyable. Steinbeck describes every detail perfectly. You will actually be able to feel the hunger pangs, sense the heat of the desert sun on the back of your neck, and feel the hurt of death and loss. It is truly incredible.I really enjoyed all of the characters. I felt they were all well developed and had distinct personalities. Ma was tough, but always on the brink of being broken. She was like a teeter-totter - the slightest weight would send her to a breakdown. Tom was sensible and always under control. The two little ones, Ruthie and Winfield, were cute. I liked how they always repeated what they heard the adults say --- even if it didn't make sense! My favorite character though, was Casey the preacher. He really had a lot of insight to life. I liked they way he was always \\"thinking\\".For me, the only downfall of the book was trying to understand and endure the sandwiched descriptive chapters where no one in particular was speaking. These are the chapters in which other reviewers complain that Steinbeck should have used quotation marks. I really struggled with these. I know they were there for a purpose and housed a lot of symbolism; I guess that's why I was so frustrated. I wanted to experience those chapters the way Steinbeck had intended, but I found it very difficult. The good thing is that these odd chapters are very short (only a few pages) and they fall every other one. The \\"meat\\" of the book, (the long chapters) is where you'll get your enjoyment. Because of this, I am only going to give the book 4 stars; however, this is even a struggle for me, because in a way, I really feel the book deserves 5."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"Who am I to review one of the greatest literary works of all time? Could I possibly give this book anything less than the maximum rating it so richly deserves? Should I even commence? Those were just some of my private thoughts as I finally put down a copy of this book - read. This is the book which stirred the American conscience, caused political reform and brought about change when first published in 1939. This is the book which described how families were starving to death because of corruption. This is John Steinbeck at his exceptional best. For those people who never got around to reading this engaging and absorbing account of the Joad family, may I suggest you actually purchase a copy (any copy!) and finally read it.Today the world is either in recession or emerging from the dark grip of this latest financial catastrophe. Whilst we may live in a time when millions of families are no longer allowed to starve to death - well, not in the developed world at any rate, I earnestly believe there are lessons to be learned from this book about the rich and powerful who care not for their fellow man but only for personal gain. More importantly, those lessons are as relevant today as they were in 1939.Another similarity also failed to escape my notice; In this book we see how US police and other officials use their positions of authority to threaten and even blackmail the many thousands of American migrants who were simply looking for work in order to feed hungry mouths. These people had not arrived from any foreign country and were not even black - something which would have made their persecution much easier. No!, these ordinary white American folk were honest farmers who had been forcibly evicted from their homes and the land they had worked for generations. Seventy years on, here in the UK, we are besieged by TV programmes depicting our different police forces undertaking their various duties around the country. Yet more cheaply produced \\"reality\\" television! Significantly, however, I have occasionally noticed how some police officers deliberately provoke a hostile situation where exists. Whilst not on the scale portrayed in this outstanding work, it is interesting that I should recognise that underlying attitude of arrogant superiority.Whilst some may find the book slow going at the start, Steinbeck quickly gathers in those loose strands until they suddenly pull together to assume a story, reveal a mental photograph and produce a relevance into which the reader becomes fully immersed. I promptly learned local words and understood the dialect in which they were spoken as the Joad story unfolded. I could hear those southern accents as hardships are endured and explained through the actions of those who lived them. This was the organised, legalised daylight robbery and exploitation of the poor by the rich who were actively supported by the law enforcement agencies. A week's work for 1,000 fruit pickers paying 50 cents an hour is advertised to 3,000 hungry people who then pass on the message. Consequently, 5,000 starving workers arrive in search of that employment. With so much competition, the rate is lowered to 30 cents - take it or leave it! It was a deliberate ploy repeated time after time. Anyone attempting to organise his fellow workers is photographed, black-listed and branded a communist. Now feed that to your children. Then the banks insist the farmers reduced the rate to 25 cents and any landowner who questions that decision is swiftly reminded of his own vulnerability as a mortgagee! In short, either you pay them 25 cents or you join them! My own immediate reaction was to recognise a similarity between then and now - specifically with those modern banking practises which preyed on the sub-prime market. Anyone who cared to consider precisely what \\"sub-prime\\" meant, knew it was a policy destined to fail. And fail it did in spectacular fashion - and yet, the fat cat bankers still draw bonuses based on \\"personal performance\\" and not on their company's overall profit or loss...I note from some of the comments appended to certain editions of this book, that various issues have been produced in which, apparently, Steinbeck's prose are changed to make the work an easier read. Please don't take the easy option, take the version written as it was intended to be read - i.e. the version written by Steinbeck. If not, you cannot claim to have read this book at all - instead you have the equivalent of, say, a Romeo and Juliet story - set in Manhattan in the 21st Century - and there are plenty of those...In closing, I would urge anyone (indeed everyone) who has not already read an original version of this book If to go out and buy a copy - any old copy and then simply read it. Having done that, you too will draw parallels with our modern age and understand what I mean. You will also be richer for having done so - as would those fat cats who, unfortunately, will probably never bother. Having finally finished reading this outstanding work, I wonder how many of you will still be wondering whatever happened to that perfectly matched pair of Bays! I do...NM"},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"I read this book in high school and did not pick it up again until I was 50. What a difference a few years makes! This book is about hope while facing incredible challenges. If there is hope, there is life. When the voices of the suffering come together, they simmer, begin to boil and rise up (hence, the wrath of the migrant workers). It is about finding strength in different sources (a mother surfacing as the leader of her family). It is about families circling the wagons and holding onto to each other because often that was all they had. This story has been told many times in the course of history of laborers and is the backbone of the unions. Chapter 29 says it all. Very moving. A must read over and over again."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"Highly recommended. Steinbeck's prose is used to superb effect in detailing the upheaval of the Joads and their search for a better life in California.To anyone that dismisses it owing to the fact that they read it in high school - re-read it. There is so much going on that a high schooler probably could neither grasp nor appreciate.As well as focusing on the Joads, Steinbeck also take time out in various chapters to provide a social commentary of the times in which the book is set. Farmers taking loans on their lands, the depression/dustbowl, banks/landowners questing for profits, car dealers and suchlike taking every advantage of others misfortune, destruction of crops to maintain profit margins rather than feeding the starving.Through this nightmare world the Joads and countless others have to find their way: death, family fracture and shattered dreams become commonplace. The ending is simply superb."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"This is one of the great books of this century, if not the greatest. Within its pages, it plumbs the depths of both hope and despair, hostility and love, family ties and soulless corporations.Probably most people are aware of the basic story line: the Joad family, forced off their land by the confluence of the great drought of the late twenties, the beginnings of mechanization of farming, and banks that care only about their bottom line, travel to California in search of work as harvesters. But once arriving, instead of the paradise they were led to expect, find little work, a hostile local population, and living conditions far worse than those in prisons.But this bare-bones description of the story doesn't begin to indicate the power of this book. Steinbeck's characterization of the Joad family, Ma, Tom, Pa, Uncle John, Rose of Sharon, Connie, and the tag-along former preacher Casey are extraordinary. Tom is the nominal protagonist, the decisive one who does his best to plan and get things done, but I think most people identify more with Ma, the rock around which all the vicissitudes of life thunder and break till they must retreat, defeated. Her main priority is just to keep the family together, keep on going, while still maintaining the dignity and honor that being human implies.But perhaps the real protagonist is America itself as it existed during this time period. The portrait of America is painted in alternate chapters from those dealing with the Joad family, mainly told from an omniscient viewpoint, and much of it reads like a prose poem. Here we find the description of the weather and farming practices that led to the Dust Bowl, a turtle determined to continue on his course, a truck stop vignette that just might break your heart, the soulless actions of the banks and land owners, the desperation and determination of those forced off lands they had farmed for generations, the used car dealers out to make a profit regardless of the pain their junk jalopies will cause the buyers, the vast river of migration that occurred in those same jalopies, and the communities that formed each night during their arduous journey to the magic land of California. These images have remarkable staying power - I don't think I'll ever forget that turtle or the dust-laden house knocked askew by the tractor. Much of Steinbeck's message and theme is presented in these chapters - one of the evils of unbridled capitalism and the virtues of socialism.This is a portrait of America in transition, from a mainly agrarian society to an urban mechanized one, and like all great changes the \`little' people suffer the most. Here we find workers willing to work for less than starvation wages, just to try and put one more meal on the table, before their children die in front of their eyes. And the owners can offer such wages, because they know there are always enough people who are desperate enough to take those wages, and that unionization and working towards a common purpose will not work as long as there are such desperate people. Steinbeck does indicate that there might be another solution to this dilemma, namely that the people in such straits must learn some other trade (car mechanic, radio repairman), but also shows that the great majority of people will never actually make such a change in their trade.After each of these chapters we return to the Joad family - and see the general portrait painted in living detail, forcing the reader to see more than the abstract, to see the pain and suffering, to hope against good common sense that there is some better ending ahead. But there is no paradise, no Pollyanna future, only a slide into more and more desperate conditions. When you reach the final pages, you will find what despair truly is, right alongside the indomitable will to keep going, just keep going.---Reviewed by Patrick Shepherd (hyperpat)"},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"The Grapes of Wrath is a complex story of a migrant family from Oklahoma traveling across America to get to California, or \\"The Promised Land.\\" Once in California, they find it not so promisising. John Steinbeck thoroughly describes the hardships experienced in the travel to California. The reader travels looking through the eyes of both parties; the poor migrants and the wealthy Californians. Steinbeck perceives an authentic and contemporary description of the Great Depression. The Joads are a tightly-knit group, led by two main leaders, Tom and Ma, who are both amazing characters. Tom, the middle son, is the stronghold of the family. A smart and precocious young man, Tom leads the family through times of hardship and difficulties. Ma Joad is the female binding of the family. She is the mother, the strong yet caring fastening that keeps the falling-apart family together in their journeys. John Steinbeck shows himself as an advocate of female rights in this novel, displaying perhaps one of the strongest female characters. Between these two characters, the loss of the family is a minimal. Tom and Ma create a captivating and gripping story.John Steinbeck really makes the story, however, with his unique style of writing. He smoothly alternates between large chapters that focus on the story of the Joads, and smaller chapters that construe lifestyles, troubles, and ways of the poor migrants who have traveled to California in search of a better life, a new home, or at least a scrap to put on their table. Steinbeck is thrillingly descriptive, sometimes to the point of repulsion. For a work of fiction, the characters in The Grapes of Wrath are very authentic and practically existent. The book differs in many ways from my usual reading material, and stands out in my mind as an admirable representation of the Great Depression."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"The Grapes of wrath is John Steinbecks masterpiece. That he never again wrote an opus of this caliber is of little matter. few others have,either before of since. Steinbeck tells the tale of America during the Depression,by making one family come to life,the Joads. Now a part of the american Lexicon due to the movie of the same name[and a later bruce Sprinsteen album,the ghost of tom joad},the Joads are once proud Oklahoma famers devastated by the dust bowl droughts of the 1930's[which Steinbeck describes brilliantly.} They gather together, tie up their meager belongings, and head out furthe west to California, the land of opportunity. Needless to say, their plight mirrors that of literally millions during that decade, and theier reception in California is less than welcoming. They fight with crooked cops,abusive migrant bosses and &quot;instigators&quot; in camps,until they finally find a labor camp that treats them, and others as human beings. The Joads,in their utter despair and poverty,retain, even ennoble the human condition, by growth and compassion and kindness. There are tow ways people react to adversity, to lash out or reach out. the Joads become, then, paradoxically,with their poverty and rough edges, the quintessential Americans:tough, undogmatic,principled,compassionate,not looking to take advantage even when the opportunity presents itself. The final scenes, with Tom forced to go on the run again,the final conversation between Tom and his Ma are astonishing, and Sharona {the roseofsahrona, as she is referred to] nursing a dying man with her breat milk intended for her stillborn baby, is as unforgettable as exists in all Literature. If Moby Dick is not the great american novel, then this is. One of the very very few pieces of literature as relevant as when it was written. as Masterpiece, a galaxy full of stars would not suffice, never mind 5 stars. MAGNIFICENT,UFORGETTABLE.A MASTERPIECE."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"That's what we learn from reading this Steinbeck masterpiece. The irrepressible Joad family takes an unforgettable journey west to the promised land of California from their bank-confiscated farm in desolate Oklahoma. Steinbeck utilizes the setting of the Great Depression to the fullest through his vivid imagery of the colors of grey and red, his naturalism, which makes the land a character in its own right, his transcendentalism and symbolism, both which bring ulterior meaning to many seemingly mundane goings-on throughout The Grapes of Wrath.Steinbeck brings to life characters that I empathize for and felt after 200 pages as if I were a member of their family rooting them on after all they had persevered through. The struggle of the Joads to put food on their plates at the end of the night after picking cotton or peaches all day long for next to nothing makes me extremely thankful to have food and shelter -things most of us take for granted. The Joads struggle for their place in society and for their identity, which was unconscionably taken away from them and thousands of other &quot;Okies&quot;. The Joad family undergoes a stark transformation from naive idealists to destitute pessimists and finally back to optimistic and hopeful for the future. Te Grapes of Wrath proves to be the definitive novel of the Great Depression and one that every American should read in order to fully understand the most apocalyptic time in American history and fully appreciate our lives today and the many luxuries that we all take for granted. Undoubtedly one of the top 5 American novels of all time."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"Shouldn't we all read the grapes of wrath and reexamine ourselves...learning understanding, compassion and empathy for our fellow man? East of Eden and so many other wonderful books...Greed leads to need. Thanks Johnny Steinbeck!"},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"Many readers have complained about the abrupt ending of Steinbeck's immortal classic, \\"The Grapes of Wrath\\". Like Preacher Casy, I went off and did some thinkin' and then some more thinkin', and here's what I think probably came to pass in the lives of the principal characters:Ma Joad: The trials of migration, familial disintegration, and non-stop tragedy finally break this great lady down. An excess of greasy food causes a massive heart attack. The children, Ruthie and Winfield, returning from gathering firewood, find her dead on the ground near the cooking fire.Tom Joad, Senior: Being displaced as the head of the family wears mightily upon his mind. He catches pneumonia from the exposure to the flood, and dies in the barn two weeks after the original novel ends. He is delusional, and seems to be permanently in the land of shades.Uncle John: Scrapes up enough coin to \\"enjoy\\" one last big drunk. Found floating in the same river as the bundle he was sent to bury.Rose of Sharon: Finds work as a \\"hostess\\" in a bar in Lodi. Sells her favors for a while, then meets and marries a grifter and bunco artist. They travel the west, hanging bad paper, and one day she finds herself alone in a cheap motel. Goes to sleep forever after taking an overdose of something.Winfield: Lies about his age and joins the US Marine Corps in 1940 at the age of 15. Killed in action on Okinawa, 1945. Posthumously awarded a Silver Star.Ruthie: Found wandering near Bakersfield, picked up by a kindly childless family who are moving to Oregon. She lives in a good home surrounded by people who love her. Completes high school and then nursing school in Seattle. Specializes in pediatric nursing because of her love of children. Retires in 1968, dies 1970.Tom Joad, Junior: Caught just one month after last seeing Ma Joad, charged with First Degree Murder. Zealous young \\"leftist\\" public defender J.I. Hurwitz gets the charges reduced to 2nd Degree, but Tom still gets a 25 year sentence, at notorious Folsom Prison. His inflated reputation (by the press) as a \\"red troublemaker\\" and \\"cop killer\\" precede him, and guards make his life miserable. He does a lot of time in solitary, for petty infractions. After six years inside, he is a broken man. Found hanging in his cell, 1943. Foul play suspected but never proved.Al Joad: At last, a \\"success story\\". Many readers have noticed that Al is better adapted to a changing America, with his uncanny knack for fixing cars, coupled with a \\"can-do\\" cockiness. You can't keep a good man down, we all know that. He and Aggie Wainwright hitchhike to L.A., where Al gets a job as a \\"lot boy\\" at a big Chevrolet dealership. War breaks out, and the management finds out Al is a crackerjack mechanic. He quickly rises to be Service Manager, all the time squirreling away money from his day job and his moonlight job, fixing cars and trading in black market tires with fellow Okie Eddie Moon.In 1946 he takes over a down at heel used car dealership on Long Beach Boulevard. He gets the land and stock for free because the former owner owed him money from a deal that went bad. He buys lots of spot ads on local country/western stations, appealing to struggling young people to \\"come on in, yer job is yer credit, we know how it is, we BELIEVE in YOU!\\" Before long he is the owner of most of the used car lots in Long Beach, although leaving in place the former names. In the 50's he becomes a Chrysler/Plymouth dealer, and a constant presence on local TV, sponsoring wrestling matches, music shows, and demolition derbies. An only son, Thomas Winfield Joad, is found dead of a heroin overdose in Hollywood, 1969. Al retires from the car business but becomes a fierce spokesman for the War Against Drugs. He dies, fabulously wealthy, without an heir, in 1975.My apologies to Mr. Steinbeck. I mean no disrespect. Maybe too much's thinkin's bad for a fella."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"The characters may be very simple country folk, but John Steinbeck creates personalities so palpable, that you crawl inside them and live their journey; you feel their trials and joys. The journey through American country side is so rich in detail, that you feel like you're in the back of the truck, travelling the roads. The strength of the human spirit when faced with such adversities, yet still managing to find joys and triumphs is truly indicative of the peoples of old. The march over and beyond human souls by the 'big boys' is so painfully unjust, that you truly feel those pains and injustices and join in the rage against the machine. Beautiful snapshot of the ability of man to endure adversity, and a terrible indictment on what the love of power and money will allow to be perpetrated on our fellow human beings.The Grapes of Wrath"},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"When absolute naked wild Capitalism rules and there is no Government intervention, it wreaks havoc in society and the weak and the poor are at the mercy of the rich and powerful, ordinary working people become instruments like animals, worthless cogs of a machine that at the same time grinds them, This seems to be the main idea behind this colossal novelThe story begins when Oklahoma farmers are forced to leave their land, and head west to California because they are replaced by tractors, as the actual owners of the land, the ruthless Banks, understand that hand labor does not yield a profit. One of these families is the Joads (the collective character of this tale), which \\"in group\\" confront the continuous adversity \\"individualism\\" is offering them every step of the way from the moment they leave Oklahoma until they finally try to settle down in California where they had gone following the indications of a handbill requesting orange pickers and just one unique hope, to find work, but in California things does not seem to be the way it looked, and the battle renews and rages on. Contemporary issues arise, such as immigration, equality, unemployment, egotism, hunger, strikes, law, authority, social demands. The ending leaves a message of hope, related to the will each individual possess in its more intimate and spiritual values. Almost a classic, this novel has been classified among the best written in the 20th century by book critics"},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"To summarize the Grapes of wrath is to destroy the book. But This book encompasses feeling, story telling, and symbolism, and incorporates them. The book is set in the beginnings of the great depression, and the travel of the people between oaklahoma, and California, and in particular, the Jode family, (Tom Jode, Ma Jode, Pa Jode, Noah, connie, ruthie, Winfield, Gramdpa and Grandma, Al, Rose of Sharon, and The Preacher Jim Casy). Who travel to California in hopes of having a better life. But durring the journey, Grandma and Grandma Jode die. But after the drive, they run out of money and supplies, and wind up in a camp in California that is bullied on by the corrupt cops, to which they set on fire, and drive everyone out. After a string of bad misfortions, the Jodes wind up in a government camp with crazy people, and still no work, but eventually, they find work picking peaches, and live in a box car, where the story ends with the now not pregnant Rose of Sharon feeding a starving man.The grapes of wrath breaks ground on a lot of levels. Even through my fourth read i feel as though im still picking out new concepts. I suggest this book for study and to read because John Steinbeck is truly a master of story development. I feel that the characters are vividly formed, and his scenes feel real! But the grapes of wrath encompasses an element rarely used on this scale today. Many people see the grapes of wrath as a book that merely is about the Jodes and their journey across America. But to look at this piece of literature from that perspective is to miss the book altogether. The stories theam is far greater than one family. It uses metaphors to express the pain felt in America. In the beginning it makes a bit of mention of a tortoise whose heading towards a single direction. The tortoise is knocked down and forgotten. But it seems to be a metaphors to the solemn perseverance of the American spirit. But this is far from the greatest bit of expression in the book, Steinbeck purposely utilizes characters in the book for hidden meanings. The preacher: Jim Casey. His role as a character is to provide a slightly religious influence to the book. Though Jim Casey is a preacher, he has frustrations with religion. This seems to express some of Stienbeck's views in religion. With the purpose that Jim Casey serves in this book, I believe that it isn't consequence that his initials are J. C. . Another brilliant use of a metaphorical concept falls with rose of sharron. She through out the book held a fairly useless spot. She constantly was a \\"lesser\\" character than most, but stienbeck uses her to illustrate another theme. The book ends with her and a starving man. The starving man cannot eat regular food without getting violently sick. He had no more options for food... Rose of Sharon just experienced her baby dying prematurely before even being born. So she has a source of food ( I found no other way of wording that...) so she feeds the starving man with her unused milk. To me it seems extremely strange that a book of this kind would end with a character as \\"unimportant\\" as this. He used rose of Sharon as a metaphor to how we as people look out for each other furring the hard times. Over all this book is a stellar book to read. It is full of vibrant illustrations, perfectly formed characters, and meaning on a deep level as an American, and as a human on this earth."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"A massive work about the migration of dispossessed farmers from Dustbowl Oklahoma to California in the 1930s, the story traces one such family, the Joads, as they seek the Promised Land of oranges and cotton, only to realise the truth isn't so simple, and the destination as arduous as the journey.Criticised for its less than in-depth psychological analysis of the characters like Tom Joad and ex-preacher Jim Casey, I however felt that the cinematic vision of the text came through because of the way characters are revealed through what they say and do. Ma Joad, in particular, struck me as an unwaveringly strong character who tries to hold her family together, even as it disintegrates before her eyes.In the interchapters, Steinbeck casts his lens on the larger situation and suffering of these migrants, and makes a sobering social commentary on the state of America and its politics of commerce and capitalism. Some readers have commented on the oppressive view that Steinbeck forces on the reader, but that to me is secondary, because the narrative persuades through both the examination of the micro as well as the macro, and it is a point of view that demands careful gaze."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"As a 5th generation born and bred Sooner, this novel resonated deep in my soul. It isn't pretty or heart-warming, but rather a (gritty) honest look at the desperation and hardships poor folks faced during the dust bowl era. It's a riveting glimpse at our history that refreshingly hasn't been glossed over. Writing does not get any better than this."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"A brilliant look at the Great Depression and how it effected people. Steinbeck was one of the great American writers and this was likely his most important work. The book will educate you and also make you feel for the characters."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"The Grapes of Wrath is so profound, so moving and so forever a source of debate and controversy that one may forget that it is first a great story. It gives voice to a people suffering badly and it portrays them as they surely would like to be seen - as honorable decent people trying to make their way against the forces of nature, man and economics. John Steinbeck masterfully interweaves the struggling of one family into the great calamity of the dust bowl that brought out the worst in some people and best in others as millions deal with poverty and dislocation.You could argue that he idealized the virtuous indigent and vilified the wealthy as cruel and callous but much of what he wrote came of direct observation and much of what occurred in fiction happened in fact. When the pie from which we all feed from shrinks the fight for what remains is dirty and there's a tendency for the empowered to leave the rest behind regardless of legitimacy.The Joad family have lost their farm in Oklahoma and they are joining the great migration to California and the promise of jobs and opportunity. They are a healthy close-knit family that care and look out for each other. The strain of homelessness and uncertainty pays a heavy price which is at the root of the book's story. It would be a hard man not to feel empathy for them and the millions like them. Steinbeck wrote the book in 1938-39. He is staring right into the abyss of the Depression. You can feel the immediacy still. His writing is beautiful as his characters take life and the scenes are clear.When you read one of the most famous books in American literature do you try to ignore the hype and just read the book? There is so much going on here. Is he arguing for bigger government? Is he anti-capitalist or perhaps supporting communism? My conclusion is he saying \\"look - people are suffering. We Americans have a collective responsibility to each other.\\" I did not see this as philosophy or a soapbox polemic against anything other than the breakdown in respect for human potential. It is a book that is supposed to raise your empathy and recognize the wasted potential of so many.That the book is still popular and evoking passions 70 years later is a good thing. I wonder if our legislators in Arizona or Alabama recognize their own actions as creating another generation of homeless, dispossessed immigrants who are fleeing their homes, jobs and schools. What are the costs for these broken families that will no doubt slip into poverty similar to the Joads? I hope there's a Grapes of Wrath being written now to give voice to them"},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"Some politicians and economists tell us the 'recession' is over, but it sure doesn't look like it to most Americans. In fact, when you see friends and others out of work or losing their homes it looks a LOT more like a 'Depression'. A recent article in the LA Times pointed out that what we *don't* yet see coming out of the hard times this time around is great art - it seems the movie makers and musicians are too far removed from the plight of normal Americans to see what's going on. I guess we can always revisit some of the art to come out of that *other* Depression back in the 1930s, like Steinbeck's The Grapes of Wrath.The book centers around the Joad family from Oklahoma. Having lost their farm to the bank they decide to move to California after seeing fliers advertising high pay for farm workers, and hit the road in an old truck converted to haul all their worldly belongings. On the road, however, they notice a lot of others in similar circumstances are also heading to California with similarly high hopes. And when they arrive they find a vast oversupply of labor has driven down wages to levels making it impossible to support a family. Even worse, however, they arrive to find that nearly all the land is owned by huge corporate farmers who are colluding to exploit workers and keep wages low, and using law enforcement officials to prevent unions from forming.In spite of the optimism the Joad family has for making a better life in California, this is not a happy story and was not meant to be such. Steinbeck famously wrote \\"I want to put a tag of shame on the greedy bastards who are responsible for this,\\" and there's a lot of that same sentiment today. While the migrant worker aspect of the story might remind readers more of the Mexican workers of today along with its attendant racism (\\"Okies\\" were as reviled as \\"illegal immigrants\\" are now), the fear of losing one's home and not being able to provide for a family will resonate with most everyone. And the book illustrates well the effects of the economic disaster on families. The Joads find themselves disintegrating even while on the road, and they learn that they must rely on their larger community more and more. Assistance by the federal government is an oasis from the persecution by the harassment of the California deputies, but isn't enough for them to become self-reliant again.The style of the writing is fairly raw in its portrayal of the poor. The Joads are people of the land and their language is coarse and talk of sex is frequent. Nonetheless, they come across as honest and deserving of respect and sympathy. Interspersed throughout the narrative are chapters that leave the Joads to show the larger view of the situation. And while I found some of these diversions annoying, the overall story is so powerful it makes the reader angry at the situation. Also, it took me about 150 pages before I really got into the story. It's not what you'd call a \\"pleasurable\\" read, but it's compelling for the gravity of the story and you can't help but feel hopeful for the family to get a break. And it's probably a story that should be read again in these difficult economic times."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"The Grapes of Wrath by John Steinbeck took place in Oklahoma. Steinbeck shows many classic examples of the events in the 1930's. For an example how farmers in the Dust Bowl suffered not only from the drought but the Depression also. I liked how Steinbeck is always paying attention to detail when he describes the family's and the living conditions.The 1930's was a very bad time for this nation. I think that Steinbeck not only shows the Depression setting but also what they done in order to survive. Steinbeck gives many examples of how the family's lived and their everyday lives. I think that this is important because unless you lived during the 1930's you wouldn't know how things were.He gives many examples along the journeys of the family's life from their home place to search for more work to feed their families. By doing this it gives the reader a glimpse of how they might have had to live if they lived during that time period. Sometimes it feels as if you are right there on the journey with the families. Like the world today only the strong survived the Depression in the 1930's. Some of the events that happen in The Grapes of Wrath are very sad and touching all at once.I suggest that if you want to learn about the Depression and the 1930's this is the book to read. It is not only is packed full of examples but takes you along with the family's journey for success in California. This book will make you glad that you're not in the Joad family's shoes."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"John Steinbeck is the most perceptive and creative authors I've read. I read Grapes of Wrath sophomore year, and it spawned a complete love of literature. This book takes the reader through an odyssey of emotions and troubled times. It so perfectly represents the 30's depression, and America in general. It opened my mind to the values of this country, and inspired me to see everything from a different eye. This is a book that will change your life. I will not vote for a president who has not read this book."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"The book reflects on the struggles that the poor farmers went through during the Period of Depression. As for Joad's family , they decided to move to California to find better jobs and get a new life. On the trip to California, Joad's family met other family that also moved to the West. They helped each others to survive through the hardship. The humanity that people had for each other was so wonderful, and nothing was better than that. I don't think nowaday we can have that humanity in society because as time has changed, people don't share similar experience and it hard for them to understand each other."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"While Steinbeck's masterwork fit more perfectly into the era of recovery from the Great Depression, it addresses human interrelations in a most timeless fashion. Those of us who have discovered what it means to lose all (or nearly all) of our tangible possessions, as the Joads did, grasp a deeper meaner of life. The Joads demonstrate greater respect for fellow humans than for the clothes on their backs.Steinbeck also provides an eloquent look at those who clawed their way to retain tangible wealth. These people wanted no part of sharing with folks in desperate need and Steinbeck demonstrates this through both the path of the Joads from Oklahoma to California as well as more general looks at the circumstances of the dustbowl's victims."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"I read this awhile ago, but it sticks in my head. I must agree with some other reviews that the chapters explaining what is going on around the family can drag slightly. However, they become less and less and story is amazing. What these people went through and how they thought still amaze me. Great stuff. You will definately enjoy this classic and learn alot along the way."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"There are at least 5 different levels to this story and the more you soak in it the more they are revealed. The ending is perfect. It's not a happy book, then again most starvation stories aren't very cheerful. That's the point.I really like the flow of this book, with the alternating chapters about the characters and the explanations of current economic/social conditions.I read this book for the 1st time im my life while I was in my 30s. I'm glad I didn't read it in highschool. Teenagers simply don't have enough life experience to appreciate this book. How could they understand this when they can simply go to the freezer and take out an instant dinner every time they get hungry?"},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"Take one recently released criminal, an old man who dreams of bathing in grape juice, a nave and pregnant young newlywed, and add them to a bowl of thousands of recently misplaced workers, and you have the award-winning recipe for the greatest American classic, The Grapes of Wrath. With alternating chapters stuffed full of symbolism and spice, Steinbeck captures the picture perfect photo of Americans struggling through the Dustbowl. Not only does the dialogue fill your hunger for personality, it creates a bond between the reader and the characters. Closing the pages of this book is like turning away from a family member. If you're looking for a novel with inspiration hidden between the lines, pick this one up."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"I had to read this book for school, I was very skeptical at first, but it turned out to be fantastic. An amazing story about one family's hardships as they search for a better life. I recommend this book to everyone I come across."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"Dylan Baker manages to give distinctive voices to the Joads and to each of the other memorable characters in this masterpiece --without obscuring the essential voice of Steinbeck himself. This is a reading worthy of this magnificent novel."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"This book cannot but be considered one of the greatest works of American literature. Its plot is simple, almost literally pedestrian, but it magically conveys the feelings not just of its characters, but of an entire social movement and era.The device of alternating chapters between the tale of the Joad family and descriptive narratives of the society around them only strengthens things. This is no academic, dusty view of history; this is reality, as people lived and thought and experienced.The human attachment to the soil, the desire for home and community, the struggle for social justice, the tyranny of property, the myth of the Promised Land, the hope and dreams of a new life - there is something here on every level, the social, the spiritual, and the emotional.The beginning of the novel is a bit slow, but it slowly picks up momentum as it travels west. By its end, one cannot but be riveted by the Joads and the struggles they endure. And one can feel the grapes of wrath building, the knowledge that some way, somehow, the human will to survive can never be defeated.But, despite its clear social messages, this is not a political tract. The novel's ending takes one of the most intimate of human actions into a bare, stark necessity. Eroticism, motherhood, generosity, desperation - what is it? We cannot tell for sure, but we know only that it is human. The most horrific of our trials only serve to bring out our humanity. A haunting and unforgettable message."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"I finally got around to reading this classic tale of migrant workers during the Great Depression and I am so glad I made the effort. Lots of history here and a good explanation of the rise of the collective labor movement. I did study some of this in my school days and I would have enjoyed having the benefit of reading this relevant work back then. Steinbeck's portrait of the Joad family brings all of this much closer to home and some of the stories (most notably the chapter describing the roadside diner)are really terrific. It is not a quick read but it does stay with you. A great investment of your time to better understand major issues still confronting our country today."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"I can see why some may consider this book to be a jab at capitalism. It definitely doesn't hold back when it comes to demonizing banks and business. If you can set that aside (which I think most people can), this novel is truly one of the greatest American tales of all time. It would take a cold-heart person to not be moved by the story of the Joad family. My favorite Steinbeck was always Of Mice and Men, but THe Grapes of Wrath easily took its place the from the second I finished it. You must read this amazingly well-written novel."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"\\"The Grapes of Wrath\\" is the story of those who left their friends and extended family in the Mid-west to pursue the American dream in California. Steinbeck painted a vivid picture of the struggles and hopes of poor men and women. They weren't looking for wellfare, but simply a job so they could feed their families and get ahead.The story focuses on the Joad family as they sell most of their possessions to raise enough money for the long journey from Oklahoma to California. Intermixed with their story are great descriptions of the land, the road they took (Route 66), and the hundreds of thousands of people doing the same thing the Joad's were doing.The book doesn't get into the factors that led so many families to head West, and after reading \\"The Worst Hard Time\\", it doesn't appear to be the Dust Bowl as much as it was the overall depression the country was going through in the 1930's.While I enjoyed the descriptions and brutal honesty of the novel, I knocked off a star because I didn't care for Ex-Reverand Casy's view on morality nor the ending of the book that left me wanting more closure for the Joad family. The ending got me to California with the Joad's, but didn't give me any sense of their fate."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"I received this book and couldn't believe the good condition it was in.

Could relate to a lot of the places mentioned in the book."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"and I realized, even then, what a great book it was. And what a great talent as a writer Steinbeck was. His easy, fluid, yet intensely descriptive style is second to none. I have read books by him I appreciated more, and books I appreciated less, but I would say that this is his masterpiece. His high level of detail meshes perfectly with a gloomy, depressing slice of real American history. All of which he intensely researched. It's a well told story, and provided me with quite a bit of mental fodder to mull over. You don't have to bond with, or even like, the main characters, to enjoy the epic and panoramic nature. I am an artist and writer. I write my own novels now. Steinbeck still remains one of my biggest influences.You don't have to agree with every position held by Steinbeck to enjoy his writing, and at no point in this does he push communism on the reader. You know what one of my favorite novels is? Atlas Shrugged. I vote libertarian. My favorite genres tend to be dark Sci-Fi and horror. That's what I write, and what magazines I do illustrations for. That is also entirely beside the point."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"\\"My whole work drive has been aimed at making people understand each other. . . .\\" --Steinbeck in a 1938 letterAfter years of suffering through the Great Depression and sweeping devastation caused by \`Black Blizzards' during the Dust Bowl era, farmers and share-croppers of the southern plains began an odyssey toward hope and the green valleys of California. This was a time of sweeping social and economic changes. This was a time when banks, powerful land owners, mechanized farming, prejudice and bigotry sent people packing.While working as a journalist in San Francisco, John Steinbeck wrote a series of feature articles about these migrant workers. He developed a powerful respect for their initiative and empathized with their plight. Those articles were the stimulus that drove him to write Grapes of Wrath. A short time after its publication, Grapes of Wrath received the 1939 Book of the Year Award from the American Booksellers Association. In 1940 it won a Pulitzer Prize for Literature.Steinbeck used powerful, lyrical prose while establishing many of the scenes his characters lived in and passed through. He had a gift of writing in the vernacular language of the people of Oklahoma, and the surrounding states. Most chapters were anchored in dialog between the Joad family members and those with whom they had contact. Most of the story centers on protagonist Tom Joad, second son and parolee from an Oklahoma state prison. Ma Joad, the matriarch of the family is the bond that keeps the family together.The first half of the book follows the family along Route 66 from eastern Oklahoma across the state into the Texas Panhandle, New Mexico, Arizona and deserts until they are awed by the beauty of Califonia. Along the way, they experience devastating losses, disappointment, and innumerable hardships. The Joad family meets and bonds with fellow travelers, and experiences generosity by a restaurant cook and waitress. After arriving in California, the family learns harsh realities of life as Okie migrants while camping in one of the infamous Hooverville camps or shanty towns.Steinbeck gives the reader glimpses of the causes and social issues as seen through the eyes of his characters, but he doesn't stop there. At times he breaks up the journey and branches into short narratives that read like prose poems. In these narratives he frequently uses repetition to drive home his message. He hammers on banks. He has little patience for land owners who call the migrants squatters even though they acquired the land earlier though questionable means.He shows us sheriffs, vigilantes and private security officers working as pawns of the powerful. These are the implements of injustice and the source of escalating tensions. They will stop at nothing to quash dissent. Migrants are exploited through the devaluation of their work by these land owners.Grapes of Wrath lives up to its accolades. Be prepared for an emotional ride. Use it as an opportunity to assess your prejudices and preconceived ideas about this trying time in our history. If you haven't read Grapes of Wrath, you need to do so.The Grapes of Wrath"},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"In this novel about Oklahoma farmers forced by the Dust Bowl and the Great Depression to seek a new life for themselves as migrant laborers in California, John Steinbeck may well have written the Great American Novel. \\"The Grapes of Wrath\\" is the story of the Joad family, but it's also the story of a people on the move, a nation in crisis, and humanity in its extremes of greed and goodness.The first quarter of the novel tells of young Tom Joad's homecoming after several years in prison for killing a man in a drunken brawl. Contact with his family has been minimal over the years, and he looks forward to seeing his parents, grandparents, and siblings again - but the house is empty, obviously abandoned, like so many others in this land where a combination of drought and poor agricultural techniques has resulted in failure and foreclosure on countless family farms. Fortunately, Tom learns from a neighbor that his family has gone over to his uncle's place, and he arrives there just in time to join them on their way to California, where they've been told there's plenty of work in the state's lush Central Valley.The second quarter of the novel is the story of the Joads' arduous journey west on Route 66, a trip distinguished by breakdowns, death, and intimations by those who have been there that California may be something less than the paradise they've been led to imagine. The final half of the novel follows the Joads after they arrive in California, only to discover that it's possible to starve even in a land of plenty as too many would-be workers are forced to compete for available jobs by accepting wages barely sufficient to buy enough food from one day to the next. The novel ends with one of the most stunning and affecting scenes you'll ever read, and although nothing at all is resolved, the story feels complete.The structure of the novel underscores Steinbeck's creation of the Joads as the human face of a social crisis. Long chapters that advance the plot alternate with short chapters in which the Joads are never mentioned, in which Steinbeck's richly poetic prose establish the physical and moral setting of his work: the conditions leading to the Dust Bowl, the loss of a way of life, the journey to a new beginning, and the disillusionment and growing anger of the migrants - all on a massive scale. These short, poignant chapters are as beautiful, captivating, and necessary as the story chapters, as they provide context and grant a kind of holy universality to the Joads' experiences.Steinbeck's writing is raw, earthy, and viscerally powerful. This is realism at its finest: full of small, telling details, and at times casually vulgar, not for shock value but because life itself is casually vulgar. I was about 13 the first time I read this novel, and the blunt honesty of the writing was a bit much for my somewhat sheltered mind; I remember feeling uncomfortable when an old man reached into his pants and \\"contentedly scratched under the testicles,\\" as that wasn't a word I was used to seeing in print, at least outside of biology texts. I loved the background chapters but found the Joad chapters distasteful for the first hundred pages or so, when I finally allowed the vivid immediacy of Steinbeck's style to make the characters real for me. As an adult, I have no such difficulties and am able to appreciate the masterful style and rich characterizations immediately. This is a mature novel, about people too crassly human to elicit our pity, but too warmly human not to elicit our compassion.I must admit that as a native Californian, I feel a special connection with this novel. For most of my life I lived just a few blocks away from the old Route 66 (although farther west than the point where the Joads left it to go north). Several of my husband's children live in the Central Valley, around places Steinbeck mentions by name. However, Steinbeck's skill is such that even if you've never been there, you'll close this novel feeling as though you had. This is a novel every American should read - indeed, everyone interested in what it means to be human in trying times. These days more than ever we need this book, we need this reminder of the values of proud self-sufficiency and fierce decency, for it is when we stop pulling, and pulling together, that we lose our way."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"The book arrived in described condition in a timely manner. This is an excellent edition if one is reading this for educational purposes. I'm just reading for pleasure, but it's nice to have the extra info if needed."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"The book is beautifully written. Steinbeck's style flows so smoothly and is so accessible. The book follows the Joad family for about nine months as they are driven from the place they've called home for generations and travel to California, only to find out that it is not the land of opportunity they expected. Steinbeck's formula here is to intersperse the lengthy chapters chronicling the Joads' journey with short chapters that encapsulate some nuance about the period or the people, giving you a picture of the greater struggle taking place, of which the Joads are just a small part. It creates a very powerful effect. This migration west involved hundreds of thousands of individuals. You see in a few pages the big picture, then you are pulled back into the intimacies of the Joads' lives and the tragedy is made very personal. In one especially startling example, Steinbeck puts these words into the mouth of a character after selling a nameless migrant and his family some gas for their car, \\"Well, you and me got sense. Them goddamn Okies got no sense and no feeling. They ain't human. A human being wouldn't live like they do. A human being couldn't stand it to be so dirty and miserable. They ain't a hell of a lot better than gorillas.\\" In the next chapter, the Joads make camp along a stream and Ma is so happy for the clean water and the chance to stay put for a day so that she can take a bath and wash the family's clothes. The Joads are good, honest, decent people looking for the means to earn an honest wage and thereby feed their family. The thought of charity repels them. At one point Pa talks about the prospect of picking cotton and is so excited about the fact that it's good, hard work, worthy of the wage he'll earn. How soft and incredibly privileged it makes us all seem. \\"They streamed over the mountains, hungry and restless - restless as ants, scurrying to find work to do - to lift, to push, to pull, to pick, to cut - anything, any burden to bear, for food.\\""},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"this is the greatest book of Steinbeck.don't buy paperback edition, the paper is ugly."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"I have to admit that I probably never would have read this book if it hadn't been a reading assignment from one of my first American Literature classes. But since taking that class I have always been very grateful that I was assigned this reading assignment as it has been life altering. Steinbeck is probably my favorite of all of the classical american literature writers. He speaks the voice of the common man and ultimately shows that humanity and dignity are not limited by social class."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"I know, you read this book in high school. and you can't remember a thing about it.I reread this book after 30 years.

John Steinbeck is pure story telling genius.I must warn you it is not a quick read but it is all worth it.this great classic is wasted on the young."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"I found that I had this book because it was required for an English class. I remember I could not find it when it was time to turn it in and my parents had to pay the school for the lost book! Then it turned up years later and I decided to re-read and I am so glad I did. I think I lacked the maturity in high school to appreciate the story but as an adult I can really appreciate it. The character development in the first part of the book is kind of long, but so worth it. You begin to love the Joad family as you do your own and you feel so slighted for them as they move from one work camp to another and are exploited over and over again by greedy landowners and employers. You feel their hunger and their pain of loss many times. I'm pretty sure this book is fiction, but the story is very real and is true for many families that tried to survive during the great depression.

I watched this movie last week hence I thought I read the reviews of this book- movie is quite different from the book - I like the book better. I am unable to review it myself. I am so happy that I read it during my college days otherwise I would not have found some time in this busy schedule."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"Steinbeck's work shows us the grit, pain, tiredness, disappointment, and failure of humanity. He did it by bringing us into a story by telling it to us. Secondary to that he showed us the story. Yes, he was a great story teller and he obviously had a voice of his own. Interesting thing is his books made great movies but they still remained top sellers for decades. \\"Grapes\\", is still up there with the best Amrican writers.It might take a while for some readers to get into the pace. Steinbeck doesn't write like many of the current best sellers. So if your expecting a drop dead crises on every page, a cliff hanger with every turn - forget it. Steinbeck's novels pull us in and keep us there because we feel what is happening to the characters, not because we have to know what happens next. What a master!Who can review Grapes of Wrath and say something new or different and still be relevant? Not me, and not a lot of others either. This is a five star read and I thought so decades ago when I first looked at it. I appreciate it even more now."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"Set during the Great Depression, this novel chronicles the life of a family of sharecroppers, the Joads. They are driven from their home in Oklahoma due to the Dust Bowl (a series of dust storms causing severe drought) and hard times. Along with thousands of others who have also lost their land, the Joads decide to move to California with the promise of work and a better way of life. However, once they get there, they find that there is not much work to be found and even if they get work, the pay isn't fair. The Californians they encounter treat them with disdain, calling them \\"Okies\\" and fearful that these newcomers might band together and take over the land.John Steinback's writing is so vivid that you could almost believe that the main characters actually existed in real life. The protagonist, Tom Joad, is portrayed as a man willing to protect his family, but with a temper that occasionally interferes with the course of his life. The novel opens with Tom Joad being released on parole from killing a man in self-defense. The man he encounters on his way back home, Jim Casy, is another artfully crafted character; a preacher with a penchant for giving long speeches about life and its inner workings. They walk together to Tom Joad's former residence, only to find that it is deserted. When they get to the house of Tom's uncle, the rest of his family is preparing to move, thus Tom Joad and Casy decide to go with them to California, and so the story goes on.A combination of authentic Oklahoma dialogue and articulate descriptions of scenery and action allow this novel to almost live and breathe, as if it is being presented before your eyes. The effect of this novel is similar to that of Charles Dickens' writing; that is, the novel is so close to the history it represents, it will leave quite an impact upon you and serve as a reminder to how powerful great story-telling can be."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"As many reviewers have noted, I had a difficult time getting started with the dialogue in the book. Once I got used to it I realized how imperative it was to the story. Stick with it past the first few chapters and you will see the light!The characters in this book are simply put \\"inspiring\\"! As a mother, I found it impossible NOT to draw strength and purpose from Ma Joad. This is a fantastic, emotional read and worth every second. I doubt that there are authors of this caliber anymore.The ending was unexpected and gut wrenching, but oh so appropriate! I want so badly to know what happens to the Joad family. (The sign of a good book when it leaves you wanting more!)If you like the premise of this book, try reading \\"The Good Earth\\" by Pearl Buck.John Steinbeck, wherever you are, I salute you."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"Since the birth of America in 1776, this country was known as the place where the poor could come and get rich. Reflected in the politic, religion, arts and literature; the possibility of hard-working, moral families falling thru the cracks and becoming poor was unspoken in the American psyche. Yes, you could become poor if you took to the bottle, like Huck's father in \\"Tom Sawyer\\" and \\"Huck Finn\\". Yes, you could become poor thru illegitimate and illicit behavior, such as the fate of the protagonist in the \\"Scarlet Letter\\". And yes, if you were new to the country, your fate was likely poverty, such as that seen in Sinclair's \\"The Jungle\\". But to be a native of America, white, Christian, upright, and hardworking, you were expected to succeed, or at least survive. Then came the harrowing experience that was the Great Depression and with it this novel, \\"The Grapes of Wrath\\".Playing out in a series of alternating chapters; half the book lays forth the personal experiences of the Joad family and those they cross paths with from Oklahoma to the grape fields of California. The other half of the book extends the experiences of this one family to those of the nation. To read this book is to understand the mechanisms by which individuals, families, and entire communities succumb to poverty, crime, destitution, and eventually death. The trials of the Joad family at the hands of banks, lending agencies, the police, creditors and employers is all to real back then and now. For example, within an impoverished community, creditors will often divide and conquer by offering jobs to the very poorest that require them to betray their fellow citizens; such as repossessing their property.One of the most important, and missed points of this book, is how the economic success of entire communities depends on mother nature. The Dust Bowl is a great example of economic disaster caused by natural events; a unique tragedy in US history, but a yearly experience in many other countries. Another important point in this book is that when it comes down to it, the US economy is built along the same lines as those of other countries past and present; land ownership. The wealth of the US and the relatively high living standards here can be argued to be due to the large amount of livable land.All in all this is one of the best books written in the 20th century. A careful reading of it provides insights into economics, sociology, human behavior, agriculture practices, the entire concept of property rights, migration and immigration, and the convolution of business and politics. I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"I bought this book as a gift - a classic read that withstands the passage of time!"},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"I thought The Grapes of Wrath by John Steinbeck was one of the absolute best books I have ever read. I only wish I hadn't waited so long to read it. On the other hand, years of personal life experience helped me to truly appreciate a book of this nature. It earned Steinbeck the Pulitzer Prize in 1940, and I think it's well worth it.The story follows the plight of the dirt-poor Oklahoman sharecroppers who became victims of the great draught of the 1930's. The land literally dried up, turned to dust and blew way, so the banks and the landowners had no other choice but to expel the sharecroppers from their farms. Just like that, their services were no longer needed. The sharecroppers, in turn, were lured to California by a rain of colorful flyers depicting California as the land of opportunity with plenty of well-paying jobs and the chance for a brand new life. All they had to do was get there. So hundreds of thousands of displaced workers packed their eager belongings and headed west.The perspective of the story is from the Joad family's point of view. They were a typical poor family who managed to fix up their old truck with sweat and bailing wire and put together just enough cash money to make the long trip to the agricultural heartland of California. But, of course, something went wrong. Not one thing, but a series of misfortunes. And in my opinion, John Steinbeck did a brilliant job of writing a story that immerses you deep into the heart of the action, as if we, the readers, were sitting in that old broken down truck right alongside the Joad family, breathing the air they breathed, eating the food the ate, feeling their pain, and experiencing everything they experienced. And life on the road to California was tough beyond imagination.By some miracle, the Joad family eventually made it to California. But it wasn't exactly like the flyers had depicted it would be. It seems that the California farmers and landowners had send out thousands of flyers to fill a small number of jobs. If a farmer needed five hundred workers, he'd send out twenty thousand flyers. This tactic resulted in an all-out hunger panic, and forced thousands upon thousands of starving migrants to compete for a relatively few jobs. Thus, wages were negotiated lower and lower until it wasn't even enough money to feed a family. For instance, a man with a wife and children would gladly work for less than a man with no family. And the women broke their backs and worked their own fingers to the bone tending to their impoverished families, oftentimes feeding them nothing more than hot gravy made from a splash lard and flour. So the migrants basically found themselves in the same shape they were in before they left their homes in Oklahoma. They had no money, no food and no gas to go elsewhere. And on top of that, the locals didn't want them near their towns, houses, stores or children for fear of being overrun by thieves. So the police constantly harassed them, shot at them, threw them in jail, and drove them off the property and back onto the open road. Poor, starving, and marooned in a strange land, for the Joad family, as well as the thousands of other migrant families, California proved to be anything but the land of opportunity.John Steinbeck wasn't a writer known for using big bang endings, but to me, the ending of this book was exceptional and, in my opinion, can only be truly understood after you have read the entire book. You'll have to judge for yourself. I give Grapes of Wrath my highest recommendation."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"The crime and the sorrow that the subject sentences refer to was aptly characterized by Steinbeck in a previous paragraph: \\"Men who can graft the trees and make the seed fertile and big can find no way to let the hungry people eat their produce. Men who have created new fruits in the world cannot create a system whereby their fruits may be eaten.\\" I first read those words some 40 years ago, have carried them with me, along with the intervening image that Steinbeck described, that of hungry people not being able to eat the oranges that had been dumped, and squirted with kerosene in order to destroy them, essentially because the \\"market\\" demanded it. The hunger that Steinbeck described in America has been attenuated, but not eliminated over the years, and there is still a vast operation here in ABQ, involving thousands of volunteers, to \\"feed the hungry.\\" I live only four miles from the old Route 66, and each day one can still witness America's \\"lumpenproletariat,\\" although they would certainly never use that word, wandering up and down the street, on their way to California, where their life will be different, or returning, after it proved not to be.With the \\"new hard times\\" upon us, and \\"the market\\" has again proven to be \\"a god that failed,\\" I thought Steinbeck's book worthy of a re-read. It has lost none of its power over the intervening years; unfortunately the issues described resonate today. Only a few days ago there was a picture in the NYT of new homes being demolished in Victorville, CA, again, because \\"the market\\" demanded it.Steinbeck is a master storyteller. The epic of \\"those dustbowl days,\\" when large swaths of American farmers in the Mid-West were driven off their land, and turned into migrants, is told in microcosm, personified by the Joad family, trying to stay together in adversity, with the centrifugal forces pulling them apart. Ma Joad, in particular, is a stoic, heroic figure. And Tom was famously played by a young Henry Fonda in the movie. Steinbeck alternates these chapters with short, pithy descriptive chapters of the macrocosm, the overall social and economic forces that produced this tragedy. Steinbeck is a master of dialogue, capturing the rural patois of the heartland. His characterization of the members of the Joad family, and people they meet along \\"the mother road,\\" Rt. 66 is likewise strong. There are some charming vignettes, like the waitress in the diner, dealing with the nasty, economically affluent, and the kindness of truck drivers, the \\"knights of the road.\\" Steinbeck won the Nobel Prize for this book; modestly he claimed he did not deserve it, but no other book has so successfully captured the anguish of that era.Lessons for today abound: \\"And the great owners, who must lose their land in an upheaval, the great owners with access to history, with eyes to read history and to know the great fact: when property accumulates in too few hands it is taken away.\\" (p324). It didn't really work out that way. World War II was to finally provide the \\"meaningful employment\\" that ended the depression, and dealt with the issue of surplus production far more dramatically that kerosene on oranges. Essentially nothing has changed, save for the more global dimension of the issue, since Steinbeck wrote: \\"And money that might have gone to wages went for gas, for guns, for agents and spies, for blacklists, for drilling.\\" (p388)Later in life Steinbeck seemed to have forgotten: \\"...and they reassured themselves that they were good and the invaders bad, as a man must do before he fights\\" (p 386). Steinbeck supported the Vietnam War!I was surprised and sadden by the number of 1-star reviews, mainly by high school students, \\"forced\\" to read the book, \\"irrelevant ancient history\\" that they might start re-living. One even said that Steinbeck was a communist, apparently not having read: \\"A red is any SOB that wants thirty cents an hour when we're payin' twenty-five\\"! (p 407). Unlike some books that I had to read in high school, it is a good, solid, easy-to-read book. Alas, many of these students will become adults, who never read a book again, though they might now have the time standing in the unemployment lines.\\"The Grapes of Wrath\\" was excellent the first time around, and equally so, and even more relevant today."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"I love this book for a variety of reasons, and I'll share these before offering my criticisms:1) Wonderful tale of a painful time and place in American history2) Great characters - and powerful bonding between them. I loved their ability to sacrifice for each other - at great costs.3) A metaphorically redemptive message: this book shows the strength of human perseverance in the face of awful odds4) Incredible local color - accents, speech, behavior! John Steinbeck really knew his stuff, and brought it to LIFE! Kudos!5) Beautiful writing - so many times Steinbeck wrote scenes that sing off the page, transcending the story, the characters, and himself6) I just love Steinbeck's character of Preacher Casy. He adds such a strong dimension of honesty, emotional courage, and truth-seeking to the book... He's one of my favorite characters in all of literature.My criticisms:1) Having previously read this book fifteen years ago, I learned then that the \\"filler\\" chapters - the ones NOT about the Joad family - were unnecessary to the story, so I skipped them this time around. This made the book infinitely more readable and enjoyable. I would guess these skippable chapters account for about a third of the book's volume...2) I found the ending cheesy - didn't like it fifteen years ago, and still don't. I won't go into details (don't want to be a spoiler), but I found it too intellectual and emotionally disconnected to the pulse of the story...3) Steinbeck uses various of his characters (particularly Preacher Casy) to make all sorts of philosophical comments on life, but never does he state the obvious, much less come near it with a ten-foot pole: DON'T HAVE SO MANY KIDS! The whole book is about people trying desperately to feed their children - for whom they cannot provide. To me this leaves the parents - sharecroppers, who, at the best of times, had life REALLY hard - and not just society, responsible. Even ONE little comment to this effect would have been welcomed. Yet has anything changed since the 1930s? Does anyone suggest that starving adults in Darfur not have children?

If you have never been unemployed or underpayed you simply will not understand the life of the Joad family in search of their part of the &quot;American dream.&quot; Steinbeck's timeless adaptation of unemployed and displaced America shows the sagas and differences with the endless problems between the &quot;haves&quot; and the &quot;have nots&quot; and the working class American looking for what is rightfully his; dignity. This struggle did not begin with this novel not did it end with this novel but Steinbeck did his part in showing the struggles of those leaving their homes to find a way to keep their family together. If you read this novel and are not touched by the strength of a great woman doing everything she can to keep her family together then it nothing more than a book. If you look deep into the metaphor of what life really is like for the working class then you can take with you what Steinbeck intended. Life is hard. Steinbeck was one up on women's liberation. This truly is the &quot;Great American Novel.&quot;"},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"This book was excellent in the way that it portrayed the life of a migrant farm family during the Great Depression, but it could have done without the meaningless chapters like the one about the turtle. I mean, who really gives a crap about a stupid turtle crossing the road. But other than the fact that it was just a little too long (about 600 pages), this was a very good book."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"Steinbeck is one of the few writers who actually understand human behavior. Everyone should be required to read this book and all Steinbeck novels in order to understand our history as a nation. This book had a such beautiful symbolism that it must be read several times to catch it all!"},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"Whoever said they &quot;burrned the book&quot; or other such stupid statments are extremly immature.

SOME PEOPLE THINK THIS BOOK IS CORRUPT, WELL I THINK YOU ARE."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"The Grapes of Wrath is a literary masterpiece. When I first started to read it I thought that it was boring, until I really thought about what Steinbeck was saying. The book is a harsh, insightful and true to reality book ( as Steinbeck's books almost always are) that is a MUST READ!"},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"In the early chapters you'll show little compassion for a group of people refusing to change or better themselves as society around them changed. Soon, you will find yourself showing sympathy for a sector of American society that underwent unimaginable humiliation and persecution. The extended family, one that lives to remain together, working to survive, unable to ever achieve the simple riches they see in their dreams. You will become the vehicle of the dreams, regarding your reading of the book as a task, ever hoping to see the family succeed in the next chapter. While several chapters will irritate you, in that they describe the current status of the era, you will cherish the chapters that deal directly with the Joad family. This book will soften any cynical attitude toward the homeless and forgotten of our country and cause you to reassess your ability to share your personal riches."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"This book is certainly an in depth affair, it goes in to the charechters in great detail, unfortunately it was so boring I burned as fire wood."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"This is a good book so far.

It truly sits equal with Twain. The praise of the government camps seems a little erky now, but just remember it's a symbol for government action. The inner chapters have an almost Jazz like quality. So innovative."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"I think if there was ever a time to read Grapes of Wrath, it's now. There are many parallels in the novel's plot to what is occurring in our economy today. There are differences, too, and they are poignant: the strong family bond, the lack of governmental aid to the poor, and how they lived, from their cars to their houses both simplifies and complicates the Joad's journey to California and they hope, stability for their family. Anyone who has driven along Route 66 or the Texas panhandle, for instance, can really appreciate Steinback's intense description of the Joad's journey to California and just how nerve-wracking it must have been without the benefit of a good car, motels, bottled water, and credit cards.For those who might complain that the narrative intermingled with the Joad's story is too lefty or smacks of propaganda, I think it adds a good balance to the story. It gives you a sense of the anger and sadness building among nameless people as their lives fall apart, while the Joads give a name and a face to the suffering. And again, I think it is pretty on par with what is going on today: a universal feeling of helpfulness that really hasn't found a purpose, plan, or footing among private struggles of individuals.Long story short: Grapes of Wrath is a really good novel. And anytime I read a book where there is a moment when I actually have to put the book down because it is too painful to go on, I can't help but love the book."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"It arrived in new condition. There was nothing written in it and the cover was not bent of wrinkled.

Although set in the thirties, it still resonates today -- perhaps more than it did ten or fifteen years ago, given the current economic and political situation. The reading by Dylan Baker is great; no phony Oakie accents, no trying to sound like a woman or little kid, but still each character comes across as an individual. I couldn't ask for a better vocal interpretation of the written words."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"It has been said that The Grapes of Wrath is one of the most famous novels in America, perhaps even the world. John Steinbeck shows that literature can be about real people in real situations. This novel is timeless. It speaks to generation after generation. There may be no greater American author than Steinbeck and this story is surely one of his best."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"The Grapes of Wrath was a truly amazing novel. John Steinbeck expertly tells the story of the Joad Family. The way Steinbeck wrote of the Joads' struggles was entertaining and informative. This novel was somewhat depressing, however, because of how real it was. Families moved to find work during the Great Depression and found themselves struggling to find work, just like the Joad family. A quote I found very interesting, \\"For man, unlike any other thing organic or inorganic in the universe, grows beyond his work, walks up the stairs of his concepts, emerges ahead of his accomplishments,\\" shows the significance of growing from experiences. The Joad family grew from everything they went through. This was one of the best books I've read, and I will definitely be revisiting it!"},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"you may have read this 10, 20, 30, or even 40 years ago as a high school student, but do yourself a favor and read it again as an adult to understand our current economic system."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"The explores an era in American history from an incredibly human perspective. Much shorter than his other seminal work, East of Eden, Steinbeck seem to really refine the plot and characters to nothing more than what was needed to tell this beautiful, heartbreaking story. A must read for any fan of American lit."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"A classic book that anybody who watched the movie should most certainly see! I read this book over the course of 4 weeks (it's long, about 700 pages). A wonderful recount of the history of the US Great Depression. Sad but insightful and illustrative of a time when people really had nothing and searched for hope on the Western Frontier."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"While Steinbeck does, in the end, manage to convey an image of a portion of America during the Great Depression, it was an image confused by wordiness. The chapters describing the family where extremely slow moving, with dialogue and descriptions that would go on for pages, but which did not have any real point in the context of the story, and, perhaps more importantly given one of the main purposes of this novel, was not necessary to give the reader a \\"feel\\" of the times. This overabundance of irrelevent information detracts from the story, in that it makes it difficult for the reader to fully submerse his-/herself in the story and, in the end, obscures the portrait of America at this time, as the reader is given so many details, that they begin to run over each other. Essentially it is a portrait that is completely lacking a frame, and this lack of a frame- or a context for all of the details, leads to a very confused image and story.I did not loathe the entire book, and even enjoyed some of the intermediate chapters describing the country as a whole (I particularly liked the one about the used car dealership), as I felt that these were well written, and the most concise. Furthermore, the symbolism was rather good, but again, overdone, as was Steinbeck's use of naturalism.However, the main plot line, the Joads' migration, was overly convuluted and, after the umptenth tragic mishap, left me utterly apathetic to the fate of the family or their plight, especially since there seemed to be a tendency to \\"kill off\\" or otherwise subject the characters to tragic fates before they had been developed to the point that I actually cared what happened to them-- that they became more than just characters in a book (with the sole exception of Casey). When I reached the end of the book, I found myself asking-- \\"what was the point?\\" Steinbeck dragged this family through the depths of hell, and yet it was done in such a clinical fashion that it lacked the human and emotional essence needed to make it be for a point, or even just that no one should have to suffer so pointlessly. One acknowledges that (hopefully) already on a logical level, but this book failed to invest it with any kind of emotional level, despite the seven page conversations. Having read \\"Of Mice and Men,\\" I know that Steinbeck can do better. I was decidedly NOT apathetic to the fate of Lennie and George. Even with allowances made for the different purposes of the stories, I cannot give a great deal of credit to a story seems pointless (except maybe post-modernism :-)"},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"ok so im a teenager so my thoughts are probably a little different than adults out there. I had to read the grapes of wrath for my junior year and i absolutely hated it..stienbeck did not keep me enticed and the plot was the same throughout the story..the story line waS pointless and although it was closely related to real life, the point of the story was hard to get at. the same things were repeated over and over and my mother literally had to sit me down and force me to read the book..i opted for the cliff notes..for all u teenagers out there...pick a different book to read and for all u adluts out there i dont know you probably would like it."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"Ah yes, The Grapes of Wrath, a true \\"American classic.\\" Yeah, it appeals to the migrant worker in all of us. Unfortunately, the thing will take you about three years to read due to it's excessively boring, uneventful passages and, unless you're Jeff Foxworthy, impossible to decipher Southern dialect. So the Joads go from job to job, making a nickel a day. And then they lose their jobs and go to another job. This continues for the first 400 pages. Finally,if you are able to survive that ordeal, you reach the final ten pages, waiting for the killer, \\"Boo Radley is a nice guy\\"-esque ending. Nothing. In the end, they are still poor and desperate. I suppose that in its time this book was a revelation of sorts, exposing the pathetic conditions in which the average man toiled in during the Great Depression. Now? It's an easy cure for any insomniac, as it will bore you to death with its monotony. Classic, schmassic. Pantheon, smchantheon."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"Steinbeck is not an great author. Rather, he is an author who knows how to pick his topic and manipulate his readers. As in his other well known novels/novellas such as \\"Of Mice and Men\\" and \\"The Pearl\\", Steinbeck had again chosen a innocent good (the Okies) struggling against a unlimited evil (the California captalists). To give credit where credit is due, Steinbeck indeed does potray the hardships of the dustbowl sharecroppers vividly and at the same time, tells us of the awsome collective powers of humanity and society via Jim Casy. Unfortunately, the literary value of \\"Grapes of Wrath\\" ends up just about there. As Steinbeck repeatedly stresses the Joad Family's mistreatment, he does not explain nor justify why the so called \\"big greedy captalist\\" exploit the \\"impoverished sharecroppers\\". Furthermore, Steinbeck does not offer us a fair resolution, he simply and conviently leaves the readers hanging in the end without new revelations. Think of \\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\" or \\"Cry, the Beloved Country\\", we learn that sometimes the society is filled injustice, however, in the end, all people, white or black, rich or poor are inherently good. Sadly, \\"The Grapes of Wrath\\" fails to transcend its melodramatics. In essence, like a teenager's unwarranted complaint against his or her \\"phony\\" society which cannot be called literature, \\"The Grapes of Wrath\\" does not deserve the label \\"a great American novel\\"."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"Words cannot express my hatred for this book. If Amazon allowed it, this book would get a -10 star rating. If I could find every copy of this book I'd bundle them up and hurl them into the nearest nuclear reactor, gather the residue, and put it on the next probe to a neighboring galaxy. If I had a functional time machine, I'd seriously consider making sure this book never was created.Somehow, John Steinbeck manages to simultaneously whine while also using an author \\"voice\\" that drips with unparalleled condescention. I consider The Grapes of Wrath an atrocity foisted upon generations of unsupecting students by brain-dead literati who call it Literture---most likely because they feel a tremendous need to prove they are intellectually superior to everyone else by forcing garbage down their throats.My grandparents were very much like Okies from the depression era. They came from the Missouri Ozarks, got married in 1933 and raised 11 children. During this era, my grandfather worked as a laborer on a pig farm, mostly shoveling pig manure. Obviously, my grandparents were very culturally similar to the Okies Steinbeck attempted to portray in this \\"novel\\". I find The Grapes of Wrath to be completely insulting to their legacy.The reason why is that The Grapes of Wrath uses symbols and referrents that were completely alien to their world view. In no way would my grandparents conceptualize or symbolize the world like Steinbeck does. Of course, Steinbeck doesn't care. He's too good and too arrogant to try to look at the world through their lens. Instead, he transmorgifies their world view into something palatable to self-indentified intelligensia based in university English departments. Of course, their experience, expressed in symbols that would have spoken to people immersed in their own culture wouldn't be sophisticated enough to make their experience \\"valid\\". Oh no. Instead, he needed to create something totally alien to them, and then claim it to be the ultimate expression of their experience.To understand how offensive The Grapes of Wrath is, it's as if someone tried to write a novelization of \\"Boy'z 'n the Hood\\" using symbols and cultural referrants typical among members of Augusta National Golf Club, using dialog with ghetto slang as rendered into dialect by a white man who spent his life in exclusive clubs, then trying to tell people the result is the definitive rendition of American urban experience. The Grapes of Wrath is a 169,481 word definition of Noblesse Oblige.In short, Steinbeck is saying we can't care about people like my grandparents unless we turn them into something the eastern liberal establishment can understand (while validating their self-proclaimed intellectual superiority).No passage demonstrates Steinbeck's psuedo-intellectual posing more than the scene of the turtle crossing the highway. Steinbeck tries to import evolutionary concepts into his work; but, he so thoroughly botches the attempt he shows his utter ignorance of evolutionary theory rather than the erudition he wishes to display. This passage clearly depends on something known as group selection theory; a theory that is, at best, a very weak force in evolution. Group selection was blown out of the water by altruistic gene theory. To be fair to Steinbeck, altruistic gene theory didn't appear in biological journals until the 50's (well after Wrath's 1939 pub date)---even so, anyone with a sound grasp of Darwin's Origin of the Species can see that Darwin himself understood the basics of altruistic gene theory. Thus, a truly knowledgable individual would have known group selection was an unsound basis for literary symbolism.I do recognize that my hatred for this book is extreme, probably driven by being forced to read it 3 times during my education AND WRITE PAPERS ON IT. Reading it was bad enough. Having to write three papers on The Grapes of Wrath is traumatic enough to make someone refuse to put pen to paper for the rest of their life. I so hated this book that I found myself wanting the California farmers to grind the Okies into dust so that the horrible thing would end and I could stop reading it. Or, perhaps, that the entire Joad family would get mowed down by a Zephyr hurtling down the highway so they'd be put out of their misery. Unfortunately, Deathrace 2000 wouldn't get made for another 36 years.I wrote this review hoping that people who revere this book (and I recognize that there are many) can understand why legions of students (I would suggest they are a silent majority) hate it (as I did many years ago). I'm trying to give a voice to these people that cannot be dismissed with condescending insults like \\"you're not mature enough\\" or \\"you're just not capable of understanding\\". I thoroughly understand Steinbeck's craft, and I despise it.I must admit, however, that part of my implacable hatred is a matter a taste rather than objective reason. I would like to think---were I to find myself in the position of the Okies---I'd find a way to \\"beat the game\\". The Grapes of Wrath offers no character with any hope of such an outcome. Instead, it portrays the \\"no win scenario\\" (to paraphrase the pop-culture Star Trek movie \\"The Wrath of Khan\\"); which, sadly, is reality for far too many people in this world. While knowing this situation to be part of human experience, I don't want it in my fiction. And I certainly don't want 169,000 words of it.What makes The Grapes of Wrath even worse is Steinbeck's undeniable literary gifts. The Grapes of Wrath is the artistic equivalent of Pablo Picasso painting a heroic mural glorifying Josef Stalin's treatment of the Ukraine."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"I liked East of Eden better, although, The Grapes of Wrath is Great History. But, I was under the impression that the Oakies came West in Horse Drawn Buggies because I thought that it had taken place earlier. Of course, I knew that there was a DUST BOWL. But, I didn't realize that the farmers were Sharecroppers that the BANKS had abandoned, so that the Land could be cultivated by MODERN TRACTORS. I thought that the LAND itself had gone BAD. But, that's not True. The farmers in Oklahoma were displaced by AUTOMATION. In fact, the tractors knocked their houses over because they didn't OWN the land.But, it took place less than 100 years ago, so that's Shocking because I thought that the country had a lot more ON THE BALL. In fact, it gave me a Stomach Ache because none of the characters demonstrated (or manifested) the slightest CONTROL over their own Destiny. They followed their Noses. They were just like Lemmings. And the only people that Successfully ESCAPED were Single Men who didn't have any Family to worry about or worry about them (e.g., Connie, Casey, and Tom etc). But, Tom's ma gave him seven bucks so he could escape to Los Angeles because he was on Parole (in Oklahoma) and he had Killed somebody else (a Posse member) that had killed Casey, The preacher and Union Leader, right before his very Eyes (in California). But, Families couldn't ESCAPE. They were Stuck in a RUT. Just like a BLACK HOLE.The FOOD (?) that they Ate was JUNK: nothing but Lard, bacon fat, pork fat, and absolutely NO VEGETABLES (except for an onion once). They ate Fried Dough (which's nothing but flour fried in lard) everyday. And Meat (Hamburger, Bacon, Pork, and Salt Pork). NO EGGS. Bread and Potatoes occasionally. Some Fruit that they Picked at work. They had Coffee with some sugar. Biscuits with pork gravy was their main faire. I'd barf!!! They lived on GREASE that they should've Thrown AWAY. Therefore, they probably suffered from LEARNED HELPLESSNESS as well as chronic MALNUTRITION because they worked just for FOOD which was practically GARBAGE.But, the government Camp (in California) had HOT water and Toilets, so they were clean for the First Time in their entire lives, but they had to leave there soon because they ran out of money, even though they managed to survive the RIOT that the Sheriff had instigated at the Dance. In fact, Tom, nipped it at the bud. Too bad the government Camp didn't attempt to provide everyone with FREE FOOD. Perhaps, some of the Women could've cultivated some of that Excess Land to grow Vegetables for everyone in the Camp. That's what I would've suggested.If I had to live like that, I'd probably MOVE BACK TO EUROPE."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"There are few early 20th century books that are more self-important, ponderous, self-indulgent, and overexposed than John Steinbeck's Grapes of Wrath. Ostensibly a novel that is intended to highlight the labor injustice in the California agriculture industry experienced by Dust Bowl migrants of the 1930's, the reader quickly finds that the gaunt frame of this plot is heavily draped with endless similes, metaphors, and other descriptive machinations that merely serve to bore even the most persistent. Chapter after chapter Steinbeck's words ponderously crawl across the pages on their hands and knees, begging the reader to flip forward a few pages just to relieve the monotony. It is sure to delight every English literature college professor and fill Steinbeck devotees with self-righteous pleasure and an endless supply of meaningless excerpts to be pressed on unsuspecting but appreciatively nodding folks at the specialty bookstores in Hyannis Port and Berkeley. But for most readers, Grapes of Wrath is an unrewarding chore.Given the novel's pretensions it is no surprise that in the intervening decades legions of harried college freshmen and gawky high school students have been required to read, and lord help us all, interpret the words of Steinbeck in Grapes of Wrath until no remaining literary stone is unturned and whole forests of trees are cut down to feed the maws of the paper mills that produce the neatly ruled blue notebooks favored by professors and teachers for book reports and final exams. This constant exposure and the endless self-reinforcing literary acclaim in the seventy odd years since the publishing of the novel might lead the unsuspecting reader to consider taking it on as thoughtful grist for the mental mill. Let this review serve as warning label that should be on the back cover. There are hundreds of thousands of works written in the century before, during, and after that will better serve to both entertain and provoke the critical thinking the reader is looking for.Yes, Steinbeck was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for Grapes of Wrath, a dubious distinction if there was ever one. Pulitzers are liberally handed out to the newsprint literati for purportedly socially meaningful articles and books that uplift the oppressed and cast down the powerful. So it is no surprise the Grapes of Wrath was so recognized for shining a light on exploitative corporate farming interests and the conditions endured by many in the horrid years of the Great Depression. Throw into the mix the ecological disaster of the Dust Bowl and one has a sure fire formula guaranteed to please hard-to-please snarky book reviewers. Is the book a good read? Heck no, but that is hardly the point.Steinbeck, this reviewer is sure, meant to ape Victor Hugo's Les Miserables (1862) when he wrote the Grapes of Wrath. It is telling that even the English translation of Les Miserables towers over Steinbeck's novel in terms of depth and readability, no mean feat when one considers that the French novel was excoriated by reviewers of that era as overly sentimental socialist tripe. Grapes of Wrath continues to be a tempting resource for classroom assignments, particularly given its message of class struggle, social justice, and the neat ability to refer glowingly to FDR's social engineering conducted in his first two terms in office. Unfortunately this focus is in spite of the fact that the style of writing is tortured and archaic, that most plot elements have not aged well over the years, and that none of the main characters are overly interesting. These drawbacks are real achievements given the continuing relevance of questionable modern agricultural practices and illegal immigrant migrants in the 21st century.In terms of early to mid-20th century social relevance one could do better with The Jungle (1906, Upton Sinclair) or 1984 (1949, George Orwell). In the same era, but for literary visualizations, the reader is much better off diving into Something Wicked This Way Comes or Dandelion Wine (1962 & 1957, Ray Bradbury). And just about anything off of the Amazon bestseller list would be vastly more entertaining."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"I believe it is a mistake for schools to continue to assign their students the job of reading The Grapes of Wrath. This is a book written for mature, adults, and it is obvious from reading the numerous negative reviews left by teens that they are not mature, adult readers. How can anyone expect a teenager from today's hurry up, rush rush, society to enjoy a book that develops as slowly as The Grapes of Wrath. And how can anyone expect today's teenagers to enjoy anything that doesn't have crashing cars, explosions, graphic sex..etc. etc. about every 3 pages. Teachers would be doing all of the mature readers who can appreciate a book as great as this a favor by not forcing their students to read it, and thus sparing us from their immature, ridiculous reviews.

The Grapes of Wrath might of had a powerful message but there were many things about it I didn't like. I have often heard The Grapes of Wrath called an analogy with Christ's life and the preacher portrayed as Christ. I think this is a ludacris analogy because the preacher was an immoral hypocrite. The sexual content and such took away the power of the message that Steinbeck was attempting to convey to his readers. So while The Grapes of Wrath is considered a classic I would personally choose to never pick it up again."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"Grapes of Wrath is, by far, the worst book I've ever read.I'm not kidding. I'm not saying this lightly. This book is all about some dumb farmers. And, unlike most Steinbeck, it doesn't end with all the characters dieing-- you just wish it did. This man spends an entire chapter on describing the movements of a turtle. Not a joke. A far more intereasting story then this one would probably be the man the main character supposingly killed, but even that would suck. Steinbeck would write it something like this:\\"And after seeing the corpse falled, he cried. He cried like he had never cried before, tears streaming down his face endlessly. Rivers of water flowed out from his eyes, drowning bacteria and skin pores alike. The tears tasted salty; like ramen. But he couldn't help it.His father had worked the land. His grandfather had worked the land. He had been born here, he had lived here, he would have wanted to die here. The land was like his lifeblood, flowing through him. Goddam bank people taking the land. The land! His forefathers had lived on this land!

John Steinbeck was a well-known leftist. So what? So was Victor Hugo, but Hugo was a bonafide romantic writer. Steinbeck couldn't even devise a plot, aside from the weary, disconnected journey of a destitute family.Aside from its nauseating politics, the entire novel is filled with filthy characters doing nothing in particular save a near-constant whining about their sorry &quot;fate.&quot; And the end is so unspeakably stomach-turning that any virtues _Grapes_ might have had are dashed for a cheap gross-out.Save your minds and stomachs.

Steinbeck, by following the Joads from Oklahoma to California shows not only their way of dealing with the Great Depression, but also how many other people dealt with the time of the dustbowl. This is a must read for anyone who values American history or great works of fiction."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"See my one line review."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"I've been rereading The Grapes of Wrath, still stunned by how great it is. After reading some of the reviews below, I get angry that people cannot grasp the effect the book has. YES, the depression was depressing, YES, there was a lot of description, YES, it might not make you feel really great about that time in America, but God, isn't that's what great literature is supposed to do- take you to a place you would never know about and tell you what it was like? I don't want to sound condescending, but not every book is a romp in the park, and The Grapes of Wrath is one of them."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"Grapes Of Wrath is one of the greatest novels ever written. This book will challenge what you believe about America and make you realize thatnot all history books speak the truth. With a graceful , sad prose, Steinbeck brings to life characters as real and as alive as your friends and neighbors. I felt that I wanted a magical force to sweep me into this book and allow me to help the Joads and help fight the evil plantation owners, and only the best books make you do that. Simply put, this is must reading for anyone who lives in America , and even the world."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"John Steinbeck is the true American author. His use of symbolism and allegories in &quot;The Grapes of Wrath&quot; immerse the reader in the Joad's world. In my opinion, this is the greatest piece of American literature available today. The tragedy and heartbreak Steinbeck portrays can wrench your heart. His writing abilities are far beyond any author. If you need a good book to read, make it this one. A masterpiece!"},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"Steinbeck's Grapes of Wrath is one of the few books whose &quot;classic&quot; status I agree with. His descriptive writing is beautiful but not for everyone. For example, one chapter is dedicated exclusively to the description of a turtle crossing a road. Reading on, one discovers that this was in fact an allegory to the life of the Joad family. The book is filled with allegory and allusion. Despite its use of figurative devices, I don't think this book has to be studied in order to be enjoyed. For a long trip or a secluded vacation, this book is excellent."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"Grapes of wrath , simply put is one of the greatest stories ever penned by Steinbeck . This along with East of Eden are truly masterpieces and confirm his position as the pre-eminent author of this century."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"I read this one long summer after having read Ayn Rand's Atlas Shrugged. Both are marvelous stories, that interweave the author's political bent so well, that they each could be text books for a political theory class. After reading both, I found myself questioning everthing I thought I knew. If you really want to challange your mind, read both then try to decide which theory you believe."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"Dylan Baker's extraordinary reading of Grapes of Wrath is amazing! The story, of course, is an all time classic, but what makes this special is the exacting impersonations of each character and the mournful tempo of the read. When I finished this one, I wanted to put in tape 1 and keep on driving. Highly recommeded."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"This is of course an American Literary Masterpiece. I would highly recommend this novel. It may seem wordy if you are a slow reader. Steinbeck can get that way. This novel will give the reader great insight into the 1930s agrarian culture."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"The word &quot;classic&quot; doesn't always mean a good book. But in this case, The Grapes of Wrath deserves the label. Being forced to read this book through an assignment, I started off with a bad outlook. After finishing the book, I found that my opinion had changed. TGOW has a great mixture of history and plot while being written skillfully and wonderfully. I would suggest it to anyone who enjoys the history of the Great Depression or Dust Bowl era; or to anyone researching biblical illusions in literature."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"This is a great book. I could hardly put it down.I was supposed to read it in college but somehow couldn't get into it back then. I was looking through some boxes and found the book. I read it every free moment I had. It was hard to get into it at first but after the third chapter I started to get it, then I was hooked. I felt very connected to the Joad family.I was pleased with the book up until the last page. I understood the message but was disapointed in lack of closure with the characters. I truly wanted to know what happened to them.Although it was long I would have been more than happy to read another 600 pages if I thought there would be character closure.I guess the author felt that if people during that time would lose track of their own family members we could sit back and wonder what happened to this family."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"There are some authors that have so much talent that it is inhuman. Eudora Welty, T.S. Eliot, Faulkner, and, quite obviously, Steinbeck. If you are a beginning writer, do not read this, because it will depress you to no end."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"In his own way steinbeck has captured the true picture of what was going on in a time of great suffering. This story has forever captured what our grandparents went through. Listeb to the voice Steinbeck has called uo from the past and experance the true story of suffering and survival."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"This is the best novel I have read since &quot;The Choosen&quot;. It truely does show the hardships the Joads went through on their search for work and home during the 1930's depression era. Although it does have an uncanny ending, I suggest you read it!"},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"This is John Steinbeck's finest work! It is truly a heart-breaking story. In The Grapes of Wrath you see capitalism at its worst, at its most hateful. The common man is nothing but scum. There is a lot of cussing in this book, which I did not appreciate, but that's Steinbeck. He is still a genius. The ending is a real shocker! I never dreamed it would end this way, and when it came, I couldn't believe it! It depicted, in no uncertain terms, the devastating, unspeakable hunger of a human being and the compassion of another human being in attempting to assuage that hunger. I saw the movie twice; once before I read the book, and then again after having read the book. The first time I saw the film, I thought it was great, but after having read the book, the second time I saw the movie, it just did not measure up at all; it was a real disappointment. I think Hollywood did a mediocre job of trying to bring The Grapes of Wrath to the big screen. It just didn't work, and of course the ending in the book couldn't possibly have been shown on the screen, not way back in those days, nor in these modern times of anything goes. It simply would not be possible. Is your curiosity aroused? Then read the book. The Grapes of Wrath is not merely a novel; it is a soul-searing experience!"},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"Steinbeck's chilling masterpiece about the American dream gone bad still resonates loudly and hauntingy today as it did sixty years ago. Police brutality, racism, and unfair labor practices still manage to take center stage and thwart the idea of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness being entitled to everyone.The superhuman strength and will of Ma Joad will rudely wake you up from your slumber and inspire you to go out and make a difference. Steinbeck eloquently takes you on a lengthy journey of faith, hope, and despair that, at times, requires patience, but that patience will be rewarded a hundred times over.Through Ma Joad, Steinbeck hints that the world is a better place to live in and more conquerable if people saw outside their own families and became one big extended family. A practice that is sorely needed today as technology increasingly diminishes the human element.STOP READING NOW IF YOU DON'T WANT TO KNOW ENDING.In the greatest ending of a novel in American literature history, Rose of Sharon, who just delivered a stillborn child, offers her full breast to a hungry stranger in a barn. Steinbeck paints this beautiful picture of the ultimate act of human kindness with an amazing combination of power and poetry. This brilliant ending clinches &quot;Grapes&quot; as one of the greatest American novels ever."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"I always hesitate before attempting to write a critical review of a classic novel, particularly one as monumental as &quot;The Grapes of Wrath.&quot; So let me start this out by saying, YES, the book is a well-deserved classic, and YES, I would recommend that each and every person go out and get a copy. As many other reviewers have pointed out, this novel has an uncanny ability to affect its readers, to make them re-evaluate the nature of compassion, fortitude, and human dignity. Much of this is due to Steinbeck's brilliant structuring of the novel, as he alternates the chapters dealing with the direct struggles of the Joad family with more elaborate &quot;big-picture&quot; depictions of the migrant movement in general.That being said, however, &quot;The Grapes of Wrath&quot; can be an extremely frustrating reading experience for an unprepared reader. Its sheer length (around 600 pages) can be initially daunting, and the copious amounts of dialogue (all written in dialect) take some time to get used to. &quot;Grapes&quot; can even be difficult for Steinbeck fans because it is in many ways rather an anomaly in his canon. Though the story of the Joads is compelling, there is evidence that Steinbeck was somewhat uncomfortable with these parts of the novel: Characters introduced in the beginning simply disappear halfway through, contributing little to the overall story, and in general the characterization is weaker here than it is in other novels like &quot;Of Mice And Men,&quot; curious considering that &quot;Mice&quot; is about one-fifth the size of &quot;Grapes.&quot; There is repetitiveness in the dialogue and the trials faced by the Joads, and the novel's pacing likewise suffers.In my opinion, the &quot;Big picture&quot; chapters are better written than the Joad chapters--on the whole more interesting, more powerful, and certainly more complex (as Steinbeck switches back and forth with his narrative voice and point of view). Chapter 25, in which the novel's title (taken from the Battle Hymn of the Republic) appears is probably the finest of the novel. Moreover, in spite of some weaknesses in pacing and plot, the story of the Joads personal hardships contain several scenes which are infused with a similar ability to produce a devestating and uplifting feeling in the reader. The novel's final scene with Rosasharn is positively brilliant in its conception and execution.I've tried to be fair and honest in this review, and I hope my comments will help you to enjoy &quot;Grapes&quot; without frustration. It is a remarkable novel."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"I had to read this book for an English class and it is definitely the best book I have had to read for school in the last 5 years. I would recommend it to anybody who likes history."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"I thought this book was very good in the fact that it brought the depression to life. Some of the people who hate this book don't even know what it is about. The person who was complaining about the chapter dedicated to a turtle probably has no clue that the turtle chapter is a summary of the entire events of the entire book!"},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"John Steinbeck understood the condition of conflicting interests that had developed between the boundaries of man's landscapes. He wrote at a time of tumultuous social change and climatic severity in mid-west America. Faceless banks and machines were changing the labour-intensive family-based agriculture, and forced families and whole communities to migrate to California in vain hope. The image is of them being followed by a cloud of dust, as huge machines representing agribusiness and development ate at the soil like monsters. Steinbeck explored the negative trade-offs that are born when the land becomes removed from the psyche, and the whole, for all intents and purposes, no longer exists. His is a sombre comment on an approach which places value on particular components of the land and their functions, to the exclusion of other components, and this included the people. Steinbeck seeks to claim back an holistic perspective of the land and makes comment on the inappropriateness of linear Analysis. His thesis is one that cries that the land is more than just its analysis, that there is some other dimension with deep personal and social implications involved. Comments welcome - email me!"},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"This was rated #3 in the Modern Library top 100 book list of Radcliffe Publishing Course. So I decided to read it and it is very good. Each chapter has a new meaningful of what happens to the Joad's family, like the Joad's are heading of to California to look for a job. Each chapters are good but most chapters are boring because the family talk too much. That's why nobody likes this book. I think this is one of the best book I ever read because it tells you what does the Great Depression looks like. You feel that you are really in it. What's more this book is not just about the Joad's family but there is lots of information of what the depression looks like. The preacher of Casy is my favorite character because he talks too much and help each other. Too bad he is dead on the end. It is not a hard book to read. I would reccomend this book to everybody."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"Having just finished a series of Ayn Rand books regarding objectivism and pro-capitalism, I thought I would be truly appalled by Steinbechs' great &quot;proletarian&quot; master piece. The truth was anything but! This story does not promote communism as some other reviewers on this page suggests, but rather shows the results when free market economy capitalism is exploited and perversed. The book shows that when labor organizes it is percieved as &quot;red&quot; since hundreds, if not thousands of individuals must publicly ban together. When the big boys (in this case the large farm land owners) ban together, they do it covertly and are never questioned about their patriotism.Steinbech has brought all of these moral and social issues together in his moving (if not sometimes over sentimental) story of the Joad family. Yes, it sometimes tends toward being long winded but it is one of the most compelling novels I have ever read."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"&quot;Grapes of Wrath&quot; is one of the greatest novels of all time. I am 14, and after seeing the Henry Fonda movie, I decided to read the book. What a masterpiece! To those who want to cut all of the description, it is necessary. That is setting the mood. Without the description, it would just be some cold, detached dissertation on the Depression. The description entrenched me into the book. I didn't feel as if I was reading a book, I felt I was THERE. I was part of the family, traveling in the car, feeling their pains, feeling their joys. It was as if I was Jim Casy, tagging along with the Joad family. This book is a great experience for any high schooler. Along with To Kill a Mockingbird and Gone With the Wind, The Grapes of Wrath is one of the greatest and most electrifying novels of all time. This should not be missed by anyone who likes to read."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"It is astonishing to me and quite sad that so many of the negative reviews posted here find the book &quot;hard to relate to.&quot; One (rather callow) reviewer writes there is nothing but &quot;useless dialogue.&quot; (Lord, help us!) Another condemns Steinbeck as an &quot;anti-American.&quot; (McCarthyite, a touch, wouldn't you say?) Since when is it considered &quot;anti-American&quot; to empathize with the restless and downtrodden? (&quot;Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses,&quot; anyone?)If one cannot relate to the plight of the destitute and the hungry (which is far too often the case in our society, especially among our youth), that is precisely the reason why one should read Steinbeck's masterpiece. My, how the Reagan years have warped us into heartless, moneygrubbing solipsists!!"},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"The Grapes of Wrath is one of the best books of all time.

I imagine many older readers with affectionate emotions attached to this book would have a thing or two to say about my rating. Either way, I should enjoy recalling what my personal experience was like with this interesting piece.Steinbeck is a brilliant author. No need to deny that. He has written many different works that both the young and old can enjoy and contemplate on. I believe Grapes of Wrath may have been on of them. I gave this a 3 stars although I would've preferred a 3 1/2.This book was somewhat long and a bit slow-paced for me. Yet, luckily, it managed to barely hold my attention with a calming and vaguely melancholy air. It is definitely not a read if you were looking for tragedy and disaster and bucketfuls of tears by your bedside. Instead, Steinbeck tends to sneak in touches of bittersweet passages and theme that mingles with the smooth flow of the words. It certainly describes the lives of the common family during the Great Depression and I suggest it for educational purposes as well.I find that most books its length would have to be pretty catching to make me read through it and Grapes of Wrath did manage to do that. I probably would've rated it higher had I not had the experience of reading a book of comparable length (Helter Skelter) and seen how much more I could enjoy one . But I have, and it has made it evident that this classic was not satisfying enough to my tastes. It is a neutral opinion overall, that really depends on what kind of person you are or what kind of book you aim to read. I do suggest you read it at least once but perhaps you might want to try it out at a library before you actually invest and buy it. It might be a while before you feel like reading again as it likes to describe somewhat similar things or events that makes the whole book blend together into a blurry illusion. The ending was not particularily enjoyable for me, either. I admit that I am the kind of person that likes a clear, stable, and satisfactory finale which leaves me thinking &quot;Yes, that's right. All is said and done and as it should be.&quot; Grapes of Wrath might leave you in a bit of a fluster after ending a bit abruptly and mysteriously.Still, it is generally an enjoyable book and I wouldn't advise a person to avoid it. I think many of you will find that you can develop quite a few opinions about it depending on your mood. I enjoyed it in it's own way and I presume the majority of others will be able to, too."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"This story is a foundation of \\"modern classic literature\\". It not only tells the story of an idividual family, but paints a picutre of an era as a whole, and more than that; speaks to the humanity in everyone."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"Steinbeck was a red, and this book is infused with politics; but, unlike Upton Sinclair's The Jungle, The Grapes of Wrath is a fine work of literature. Not perfect, not without flaws, not as good as Zola's similarly-themed Germinal, but still a classic achievement by a truly great American author. Everyone should read it, from socialists to Shriners, and, as with any work of fiction, take it cum grano salis.Steinbeck didn't like capitalism, because, especially during the Depression, there were many things about it not to like. His prediction that the private ownership of the means of production was soon to be over (as of 1939) hasn't been borne out...but the guy is not remembered for being a commie pantywaist, or a spectacularly-wrong prognosticator.He was a writer, an exceptional one, and most people claim this is his best book. (I would argue that Of Mice and Men holds that distinction, but Grapes is almost five times as long...and how can a six-hundred-page book be worse'n a novella?)Whatever you think, about politics, economics, or literature, this book is not a waste of time."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"I personally have read a majority of John Steinbeck's works, and I've found that the more popular the piece happens to be, the worse the piece is. The Grapes of Wrath is certainly no exception to this. The characters in the novel tend to be rather unamusing compared to some of Steinbeck's others, and they very often do things without any sort of reason. The plot is rather bland as well, with the action mostly repetitive through the majority of the novel. The novel also includes many irrelevant scenes that does not pertain to the story or its characters itself. The reason for this is mainly that Steinbeck designed this novel to be more of an illustration of the Great Depression than a story. To be fair, though, as a depiction of the Depression, this novel is great, showing all of those scenes which are unrelated to the characters that illustrate other aspects of the Depression that they do not encounter. If you are looking for a novel that will give you some of the attitudes of tenant farmers and others during the Depression, then this is certainly your book. However, if you happen to be more like myself, simply looking for an interesting story, you would be better advised to look elsewhere. Perhaps one of Steinbeck's lesser known works, like Cannery Row, Tortilla Flat, or East of Eden, which are all wonderful novels, even though they are often overlooked."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"I can go to a used book store and find this book for $2 or so. It is ridiculous to charge this much."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"I've been re-reading some the books I read 40-50 years ago. Some were required reading, others not. Many read better after you have more life experience behind you. For example Dickens, Hemmingway, Twain. There are things in those books you simply couldn't see or understand when younger. Little of that applies to The Grapes of Wrath. Even setting aside the tedious political and economic navet&eacute; of the author, the treatment of the principle characters is condescending and stereotypical. They are cardboard Hollywood caricatures. Maybe that is why it was turned so successfully in to a movie.I have/had parents and grandparents with dust bowl and southern California connections to that period so I have real people with which to compare the characters in the book. Perhaps the disconnect between Steinbeck's imagination and real people I knew is why I can't suspend disbelief.In sum, the book is interesting from the point of view of literary history, but if you want a good read try one of authors listed earlier, or even Bronte or Austen if your taste runs that direction."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"Does anyone have the Grapes of Wrath on Kindle?

I just want to say the following:This is one only about 5 books I have read in my life that I would give 5 stars to. It is more than a book, it is a statement on Americana. Steinbeck's masterpiece, every sentence has meaning. This book transcends generations. Read it!"},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"I ordered the book for my husband, and he was extremely happy with it. He feels everyone in American should read this book today."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"Although I have heard a lot about this book, for some reason, it did not appeal to me as a \\"must\\" read. Truly an historical novel reflecting the misery and hopelessness of the despression but yet demonstrating man's resilence and hope. The 1930's are almost three generations ago yet the book and it's story is timeless. My only regret is that I waited so long to finally read this masterpiece."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"The old style presentation of the Centennial Edition was not what I expected, but it works. The rough cut page edges are quite cool to look at, but the book (being new) holds together and has a shiny (sturdy) cover with fold out flaps to mark your place when reading ... so you get the best of both worlds - old and new - as you read. The old style theme of the book presentation also helps to set the scene (by \\"visually\\" taking you back in time). However, as you get into the story you realise you don't need this stage prop. Steinbeck is a master of words and describes the characters and events in such detail that you are there suffering with them, or enjoying the small happy moments they manage to grasp as the travel to California. This book was something we probably had to read as high school students and I somehow missed out. So, it is with great pleasure that I can do so now when I am older and am mature enough to realise what a tragic story it is and can understand the real history it portrays so realistically ... but in a way that you still don't want to put the book down. I totally recommend this book, and the Centennial Edition format is certainly a easy to read font and size to hold for the long periods you may want to keep reading it."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"I read this book for my AP Composition class in school and I loved every little bit of it. Not only does it do an amazing job in reflecting the hardships of the society back during the Great Depression, but it also uses a variety of symbols that just wows the readers.

This book is definitely one of the best classical literatures ever written."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"I read this book for my AP Composition class and it is just simply astounding.

It brings today's reader back to the 1930's. This is truly a timeless classic. Steinbeck undoubtly defines the era, a people, and the hardships that occurred."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"This is the fifth Steinbeck novel I've read, and I'm deeply impressed by him. The fact that there are currently some 445 other Amazon reviews out there (almost all ravingly positive) attests to the universal power of this novel. So, I'll just submit my humble little offering to this Grapes of Wrath shrine with 5 stars, and a caveat:The Grapes of Wrath is long-winded, and slightly &quot;boring&quot;. However, that said, don't be put off, it's actually hard to put down and reads relatively quickly. The style of writing matches the content perfectly, and if you read it at long stretches you'll find yourself rhythmically attached to the story. The long, drawn out narrative is meant to coincide very neatly with the long, depressing hardships the Joads face on their journey to California. What happens to them along the way, and how Steinbeck chronicles different aspects of 1930's America in alternating chapters is what makes Steinbeck an artist here. I don't think Steinbeck had quite reached the artistic capacity to create as vividly unique characters as he later does in Cannery Row &amp; Sweet Thursday, but again, The Grapes of Wrath is larger than specific characters, and Tom Joad isn't simply some displaced Oakie, but rather, he is a &quot;spirit&quot; that thankfully, refuses to die. This novel is as much history as it is a good story.At times you will feel indignant over how our country treated these people, and over the thoughtlessness of it's economic policies during the depression era. And you will probably find just as ugly parallels today in the arenas of civil rights, education, social welfare, tax reform, and so on. Thus, Steinbeck has created for posterity an American &quot;ghost&quot; which continues to haunt us. An American classic, on the &quot;dark side&quot;.If you're so inclined, Steinbeck kept a journal during the writing of this novel, titled, &quot;Working Days&quot; which I highly recommend for further insight into this masterpiece."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"I'm shocked I was never forced to read it in High School. However, I think by reading it some years later I likely have a better understanding and appreciation for the book. Steinback's writing is truly impressive - each detail provided so that the reader really feels a part of the story. You feel the pain and sacrifice of the family... you share in their small joy and heartache. Lives up to its &quot;classic&quot; standing without a doubt...the Grapes of Wrath is my new favorite."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"We just read \`The Grapes of Wrath' in my AP Language &amp; Composition class and I loved it.

I recommend this book to any and all people, while recommending this particular edition to true fans. It would make a great gift to a lover of great literature and/or John Steibeck himself."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"The Grapes of Wrath is a compelling novel dealing with the many hardships the Joad family undergoes while struggling to survive during the depression. John Steinbeck takes the readers on an emotional roller coaster as each chapter introduces new twists and turns hooking the reader and bringing them in. Throughout their endeavors the characters seem to transform and take on new roles; whether it be a desperate man trying to forget the past, live in the present and move into the future, a hopeless reverend striving to find meaning and holiness in life or a husband coping with failure and the fact that he cannot support let alone take care of his family without the strength and guidance of his wife. The Grapes of wrath focuses on family ties and humanities need of relationships and companionship.The novel is centered around one of the themes concentrated on this semester; the person's fear of loneliness as well as inability to be content with solitude and constant need of interaction and new relationships with that of other persons. This theme is very evident throughout the novel from the very beginning with the quickly evolving comradeship of Tom Joad and \\"Reverend\\" Jim Casey. The men find each other in the desolate and barren environment, which at one point had been a thriving community. Each man is in search of something; for Tom it is his home and family that he has been away from for four years and in Casey's case he is on a spiritual endeavor in the hope of finding holiness and renewing his faith. The two men find comfort and consolation with their camaraderie. The theme repeatedly presents itself in various situations for instance: the relationship the Joad's family forms with the Wilson's while venturing to California in hope of a promising new beginning, the effort of uniting the migrant workers against the intolerable working conditions they are forced to cope with initiated by Casey and finished by Tom Joad, and the last scene in the book in which Rose of Sharon saves the life of a man starving to death with her own breast milk. The Grapes of Wrath is an incredible as well as realistic tale of the ability to mend a desperate soul with the love and solidarity of another."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"I enjoyed this book up until the last few chapters. The death of the baby and nursing of the sick man was just too much for me. It was too melodramatic and overdone. Up until the disappointing and forced ending I relished in the descriptions of the drive across the country to California during the Depression and life in the migrant farms."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"In 9th grade, they made us read \\"The Pearl,\\" by Steinbeck and I swore I'd never read another book by him. I had to read this one for a college history class and came away with a whole new attitude for Steinbeck. Since then I've read several of his other books and he has turned out to be one of my favorite authors.The story follows the Joad family from Oklahoma to California during the Great Depression. They lost their farm to dust storms and greedy bankers and were forced to go somewhere else to try to earn a living.This book has been banned by school boards for years, and I recently read that the reason for this is that the bankers who serve on the boards don't like the way bankers are portrayed in the book.It's a great book and an accurate look at one of the worst eras in American history. If you like the book, the movie is also worth watching."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"&quot;The Grapes Of Wrath&quot; is an American Classic. You've got to read this one. Although it isn't as colorful as much of Steinbeck's work, it is a wonderful story of a very important part of our nation's history. It's very much worth your time."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"This novel takes place during the &quot;Great Depression&quot; and gives a general view of the 1930's, but also follows the Joad family as they endure many struggles on their way to find work in California. Like thousands of other families, they encounter hunger, violence, and despair during these troubled years of our history. This was kind of a difficult book to get through, but if you want to learn about the affect the &quot;Great Depression&quot; had on everyday families and the struggles they encountered during this time, then you have found the right book"},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"John Steinbeck is the most perceptive and creative authors I've read. I read Grapes of Wrath sophomore year, and it spawned a complete love of literature. This book takes the reader through an odyssey of emotions and troubled times. It so perfectly represents the 30's depression, and America in general. It opened my mind to the values of this country, and inspired me to see everything from a different eye. This is a book that will change your life. I will not vote for a president who has not read this book."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"At first when I started out, I wasn't too sure I would want to continue. This book is written in local dialect which I thought would be tedious but I was in for a surprise for it was not. After a while I began to love the dialect as much as I loved this book to tell the truth. No wonder John Steinbeck won the Pulitzer Prize in 1940 for this work.The Grapes of Wrath centres on the Joads; a Dustbowl family from Oklahoma whose land was confiscated from them, along with others in the Midwestern states. All these families head for California where it is understood that there is lots of opportunity in that golden state to start again. This being in immigrant work or farm labour in grape, pear and peach reaping.The trek is long but it's supposed to be well worth it with expectant good wages. and somewhere decent to live, somewhere to call home.Meet the Joad family of Ma Joad; a good Christian woman and as the strength and spine of the family, she holds a tight reign on the entire bunch of them retaining their team spirit, and keeping the morale alive amongst them. Then there is Casey a sometimes preacher man; Tom Joad her eldest son who is driven and afraid of nobody, but just anxious to get out to California to make some money; his brother Noah, a man consumed by quiet moments and little to say; Al the brother who drives the loaded down truck from Oklahoma, out to the West; Uncle John a restless soul, but who can blame him! These along with Pa Joad, the Joad sister Rose of Sharon, and the young ones Ruthie and Winfield, they make up the exodus. An exodus like none ever seen, we share in each heartache and disappointment as well as their hopefulness which Ma stokes daily.As the Joad family turn from farmers in their own right to immigrant workers, it gets harder for the family to retain their dignity. The reader will find himself living through these characters lives, and experiencing gratefulness for the little things which are so often taken for granted day in and day out.I would love to encourage anyone interested in good literature, to get your hands on this powerful book soon. It certainly encouraged me to look at life differently.Reviewed by Heather MarshallJanuary 10th, 2003"},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"John Steinbeck, in my opinion, is probably the most talented author I have ever read. His descriptions are awe-inspiring, his narration unique, and his stories are emotional rollercoasters. I found myself, while reading 'The Grapes', at all times either laughing, crying, or just plain ticked off. In this novel is portrayed one of the saddest, yet least know tradgedies in our countries history. The story of farmers kicked out of their homes, forced to a strange land and despised, cheated, and starved when they arrived reminded me of medievil times but the sad fact is it happened while our grandparents were growing up. I admit I was not proud of America as I read this book! But it is oh so important of a read because if it can happen 50 years ago it can happen today, and only by learning from history can we avoid these same mistakes.But despite the feelings you may have while consuming this book please do not avoid it, for it is a must read. If you have somehow made it past high school without having read this one, then why not do it now. It is probably the best book I have read by an American author and too important to pass up. I don't guarantee you will happily enjoy it but I do guarantee you will be better for having read it!"},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"In John Steinbeck's fictional classic, The Grapes of Wrath, readers get aboard the Joad family's jalopy and venture through the southwestern part of America during the 1930s Dust Bowl. Through Steinbeck's intense descriptions and meticulous detail, his characters pop out of the book, and become alive in the reader's imagination. Due to these dynamic figures, readers begin to feel their emotions, experience their struggles, and share in their happiness. Although the tone underlines a grueling expedition, one filled with hardships, losses, and failures, readers still recognize that tremendous bond and overwhelming love within a family can prevail over all. Steinbeck's use of setting is critical in the book. The setting adds to the impact of suffering experienced by the characters and sets the dismal tone for the novel.The characters are so extensively described that a perfect portrait of each member of the journey is painted into the readers mind. Physically and emotionally we know who they are: laugh when they laugh, cry when they cry. The book sends a powerful message of everlasting love which is identified with all readers. The dry, dusty, hot, and painstaking setting is influential in the family's drive. The luscious, green, moist land of California lures the readers in for an unreachable dream, and symbolizes a life that the Joad's can never have."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"My youngest daughter is an avid reader and loves re-reading books she was assigned in English class. In fact, she is a collector of these required assigned readings such as John Steinbeck books."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"I know Steinbeck has one a Pulitzer prize for his writing, but that is not what impressed me and made me buy his books.

This is a novel for mature readers who enjoy books which don't have excessive violence, or mindless action on every page. Many high school kids are clearly not mature enough to appreciate a book such as The Grapes of Wrath. Perhaps their teachers should let them stick with works that are better suited to their maturity level, such as comic books...."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"i dont know why everyone hates this book. not only is it &quot;america's novel&quot;, its a novel that can be planted into todays plight of the mexicans and italians. its a story that is timeless and sincere and has much more significance than all those &quot;la-di-da&quot; novels that sell for 20 bucks and are composed of pure smut. you want some deep emotion read this book. i cant understand why everyone hated it i just think they are a bunch of immature asses who either cant read it or have no deeper literary aspirations. thats my opinion, bite me!"},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"I think the reason why I love this book is because 60 years after it was written, it still has a place in our society. While some books come and go, this one remains. Replace the &quot;Okies&quot; with Mexican immigrants, and you have todays society. This book is excellent and shows us a side of America we may not like, but need to see."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"What pathos! This is the timeless story of the struggle for survival. This time concerning the Joad family - a simple crop sharing farm people - uprooted by changes both climatic and economic (it reminds one of the recent downsizing and the loss of blue collar jobs) on their trek westward searching for a new hope. This book works on all levels and raises important issues if you can get a handle on the depression. As literature it is excellent. Any author that can devote an entire chapter to the life-and death struggles of a turtle crossing the road and keep you on the edge of your seat deserves fame (what is the symbolism any how?). This book also raises the important issues of today. What to do with displaced (homeless) people? Who's responsible if anyone for peoples well-being. Are their abuses in the work place? Who's fault is it? What should be done? Are simple people to be admired or pitied?. Fortunately, he doesn't give you all the answers, but makes you think for yourself. Admittedly, he does go into melodrama. His brief dealings about the communist ideals with the government camp, and the breast feeding of an ill man showing how people must help themselves are two such examples. Yet, I feel it is a must read even if it leaves you drained and questioning your own ethics."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"Wasn't it Albert Einstein who said, &quot;the map is not the territory?&quot; Just as TV and movie actors are mistaken for their characters, so are authors often taken for their stories. No, kids, Mark Twain was not a racist, in spite of the langauge of his characters. Had these myopic critics opened their eyes a little more, they might have seen that Jim the slave is a superior man to his lighter-skinned contemporaries. What &quot;Grapes of Wrath&quot; represents to some is a threat, a not-so- gentle stirring up of uncomplacencies, a brutal kick in the rear to the comfortable. Working in a grocery store I see this every day in my affluent customers. Most haven't a clue where or how their fruits and vegetables make their way to the produce stands. Some have vague ideas about unwashed and illiterate Mexicans, toiling away in the feilds like beasts of burden. I live in California, home to Proposition 187, and all of the attendant misconceptions about illegal immigrants. Why, it was only last year when federal authorities raided a strawberry farm in the Salinas Valley, discovering living conditions that mirrored exactly those portrayed in Steinbeck's novel sixty years before. In spite of the efforts of Ceasar Chavez, whom I regard as a saint, and uncounted others, working conditions for the farm worker have scarcely improved since &quot;The Grapes of Wrath.&quot; Remember the grape boycott?I'm getting a bit afield, I know. I recently tried out an American literature course at my local community college, and was unpleasantly surprised. Instead of a careful reading of good books, I was inundated with the crimes of the Eurocentric Male. Oh, and the books were included as supporting garnish. Seems to me that our culture of destructionism and revisionism is taking an awful toll upon our understanding of literature. Like the traveler confusing the map with the territory, our unimaginative academics are confusing the messenger with the message. Rather than spending precious time bashing the author, wouldn't it be more prudent to disucss the ideas as presented? Had Steinbeck been a Communist, would his ideas then be considered more suspect? I invite other readers to share their ideas. We need more of this."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"It does not surprise me that those brilliantly compassionate people who above criticized the book could only come up with: it sucks, man, its a piece of sh*t. What in depth understanding of the book! When it was released in 37, it became the most controversial book of its time. People saw hints at revolution in it; communism was seen. People thought that the harsh portrayal of class differences and some of the &quot;tough&quot; imagery and ideas given to the reader, along with the possibilty that America was not perfect and was deeply corrupted and injust, were reasons to ban this poignantly beautiful and epic story that defines an important novel and is both significantly historical and universal in its content. Those who argue for it to be banned today, like those who ban Huck for being racist(when its one of the greatest anti-racist books ever written), Salinger, and Of Mice and Men, do not understand it; perhaps they haven't read it- if they have, the obvious importance and beauty of the book has been lost on them. So yippedeedo! Once again people think it their right to keep us from reading books that are not only worth the read but important in literature and very influential in enhancing our moral intelligence. There was once a place across the sea that decided to not only ban but burn books; suppress important ideas from people who deserve freedom- and what a society that turned out to be!"},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"Regarded by many as the seminal Amercian novel, The Grapes of Wrath is not merely a snapshot of Dust Bowl poverty, but of the strength of the human spirit. While the movie focuses on the character of Tom Joad, Steinbeck's book is really about Tom's mother, and how she eventually assumes the leadership of her family. The pages are literally choked with the red dust of Oklahoma's ruined farms, and of the dust and exhaust fumes on the road to California. The dialogue is colloquial and accurately portrayed. His characters are rich in substance, as is the entire story. Throughout the book, the scene is introduced with poetically-written interludes, giving the reader a clear sense of where he or she is. For those who feel content with the John Ford film, I recommend the book, if only for the sheer enjoyment one can get from reading this work."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"I would like to get this book for the kindle but I cannot bring myself to pay 50% more for the Kindle edition versus the physical book.Hopefully these publishers will wake up and realize that they can sell an E-book at a lower sticker price than the dead tree version and still make plenty of profit. If they are not careful these publishers are going to price themselves out of business!!!!!!!!"},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"This was required reading for school and our bookstore sold out fast. I ordered this for my childs summer reading requirements."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"I am a little young to have lived through the 'dust bowl' but Steinbeck's classic allows a person to do just that.We see man's inhumanity to man, how a family struggles even through adversity that may break or change some people. We see the tested quality of the human spirit.Steinbeck takes us to a place where good values, morals and ethics were challenged. The descriptions are clear,the characters profound and easy to relate to.Reading this books whets ones appetite for more era styled books of this nature that weave a fictional person(s) in with a real part ,time,history of the United States.

I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"The Grapes of Wrath Descriptions of people and their surroundings are wonderful. I really feel like I can see and feel what these people went through."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"This was the first book I have read of John Steinbeck's, and I thoroughly enjoyed it. Steinbeck writes with a simple elegance, while telling a sad, yet compelling story about struggles through the Great Depression.In The Grapes of Wrath, Steinbeck uses a peculiar combination of diction. Overall, the book seems very conversational. Steinbeck uses very simple words, with the occasional large word thrown in, with a folksy sort of feel. His use of simple diction makes the book extremely understandable, in turn making it more relatable as people tend to relate to things they understand.To get more specific in areas concerning diction, I'd like to discuss the diction used when Steinbeck includes dialogue. In the dialogue, Steinbeck's grammar is atrocious. Words are left incomplete, sentences unfinished; the grammar is just awful. However, this does not detract from the appeal of the novel as would be suspected. It instead enhances the appeal of the book by making it more realistic. The way Steinbeck shows the way people would have talked in the era of the Great Depression. Personally, I quite appreciate Steinbeck's efforts to make the novel as realistic as humanly possible.The other aspect of Steinbeck's writing in The Grapes of Wrath that I came to really enjoy and appreciate was his use of figurative language and imagery. Steinbeck does a phenomenal job painting a picture in the readers' heads. He uses very detail oriented style, full of very rich adjectives.While the adjectives do more to fill the role of imagery, Steinbeck has an incredible talent in his use of figurative language. I found one of his favorite figurative language devices to be the extended metaphor. In one of the between chapters (the broad chapters, that aren't character specific) almost everything was an extended metaphor, and everything was being compared to one central thing. Everything was compared to a monster; the bank, the tractors, even the guys who drove the tractors were all somehow made out to be a monster. Even in the chapters that were character specific, Steinbeck loves his extended metaphors.Steinbeck uses these devices, and many others, to create what is a literary masterpiece in my mind. An important story was shared with the many people who have read and will read this book. It is a book that can be read multiple times and a person wouldn't tire of it. Steinbeck's use of simple, detail oriented diction creates a wonderful base on which to build such a story.This being the first of Steinbeck's works that I have read, I have been thoroughly impressed and will continue to read novels written by him. The Grapes of Wrath tells a phenomenal story in a simple fashion that is so incredibly understandable, and relatable, that I found myself completely drawn into the story; after the first 150 pages or so anyway, which I found to be a bit slow. Even so, I would highly recommend this book to anyone looking for a good, understandable book to read."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"Powerful, gripping, and realistic story of one Oklahoma family, along with other migrants, forced to migrate to California due to changes in financial and agricultural industries.

Hopefully I will find an equally fascinating novel describing those stories!"},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"The story of the Joad family is compelling and important.

I have such regrets for not reading The Grapes of Wrath many years ago. I was motivated to purchase it because of the Ken Burns' recent TV series. Very informative about the period (except that people I have met from that part of the country say that the Dust Bowl era is not over) and the relationships among the characters were outstanding.

It was an eye-opener for me, partly because I had so little understanding of the Great Depression, and the truth and power of the story telling. I'm no Steinbeck fan, having read a few of his other books, and he's too old-fashioned and misogynist for me.

What would you do, and how would you react?I can honestly say I am of no political persuasion so it was easy for me to relate to the Joads' frustrations of identity. Although we have it better these days, these days are not looking bright. It would benefit anyone with care and concern for each other to read this important novel (I think, the MOST important novel ever written).For some who could not find a plot, consider this: The only plot in life we are guaranteed is the one they lay our body in when we die. I believe if you look past all of the biased political criticisms about this wonderful book you will see Steinbeck only attempted to show survival during the Dustbowl era depended upon help from each other; and that is only just skimming the surface.

Having lost their land to creditors and pressed to vacate, the Joads watch helplessly as land held by their family for repeated generations is unceremoniously uprooted and industrialized. With little left to their name, the dispossessed Joads set off on a westward journey in search of a better life. On the road they are joined by many thousands making the same trek, and soon new connections and kinships are formed. Their journey consists of hardships, deprivations, and death, pushing the Joads to their outer limits of endurance. However formidable their journey to California was, their toughest challenges still lie in wait beyond the Mojave Desert...Brilliantly woven, John Steinbeck's novel is a must read. I found it both inspiring and depressing; capable of imposing both grief and hope simultaneously. The Joads tragic losses will have you mournful one moment, while the next will find you filled with a hope that their undying resilience inspires.READ THIS BOOK. You'll be glad you did."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"The second Steinbeck book that I've read as an adult, and probably one of the best books I've ever read. I had no idea California was so messed up until I read it. Unlike some modern readers who may complain about the alternating chapters, one dealing with plot and the other with seemingly irrelevant information, I thought that they added a lot to the book and gave it the feeling that there was more to it than just the story of one family.

I'd never read Grapes of Wrath for school, like most people, I figured it was about time. Having high hopes, I was a little disappointed. I did not like it nearly as the other Steinbeck's I'd read. But, still the overall work makes an amazing piece of history, fiction and memorable tale. Personally, I think it's highly relevent at this period in time with what our country is going through.Mainly, this book was a little tough to keep reading on, as the story didn't immediately grip me. I was about half way through before I really got into it. Before I really began to care about the characters and get where this novel was going or what it was trying to convey. Yet there were times when I'd just sit back and slowly read a page and take in the beauty of what was written.I did give it 4 stars because I think the writing, the story that it tells about the Oklahoma farmers & migrant farmers and the symbolism was phenominal! To me this book tells the story of our history, one that is important to tell and remember. There's a reason it won the Pulitzer."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"The Grapes of Wrath by John Steinbeck is a book that I really did enjoy. A couple of years ago I took the trip west that they talked about in the book. I went with my uncle who actually grew up on the pan handle in Oklahoma and took route 66 to California. A book that he suggested that I should read was The Grapes of Wrath. At first glance I did not want to just because of the size of the book. But I really wanted to see why he thought this book was so good. While reading the book I could really understand what the characters were going through. My uncle still has relatives in Oklahoma and we went to visit them on their farm. Comparing them to the characters in the book, I would say that the farming in that state has not gotten any better. My uncles' childhood home had fallen to the ground, and it just showed me how everyone really did just pack all that they had and left. John Steinbeck really emphasized the emotions that the Joad family went through. What kept me reading was wanting to know how the next leg of their journey would be and if I had been where Steinbeck was talking about. I felt like while the Joad family traveled through each state on their way to California I could relate to the same adventure. I remember going through Arizona and feeling the dry heat in the desert, or stopping at a Now that there are only pieces of route 66 left I could not get the whole affect of taking their trip, but I feel that I have taken a trip with the Joads now.

They face many hardships along the way and find the truth about California.The book might have been more interesting and enjoyable if it wasn't required. Although the book went off topic in a couple of chapters, the story got interesting towards the end. I admit it was a little dull at the start but then it captivated me by the middle of the story. The book teaches us that many issues from long ago still trouble us today and that everything that shines isn't gold. Steinbeck does an exceptional on describing the situations that many \\"oakies\\" or migrants from Oklahoma face on their fight for survival in the hostile land of California.The Grapes of Wrath may not be the best book ever but its not the worse.

He tended to be unpopular among his peer group because he became a champion of the poor working class. This novel is about migrant farm workers, in particular one family who are refugees from the Dust Bowl.The novel details the family's stuggle to survive under difficult conditions. High unemployment provides a surplus of labor which farm and orchard owners can exploit, paying them as little as possible, and gouging them further with high prices at the \\"company stores.\\" Attempts by workers to advance themselves were held down. The law is on the side of the landowners. It was an era when workers were easy to replace so little thought was given to their safety and welfare.This was an era that gave rise to labor unions, and open warfare between employers and unions.

He later received the Nobel Prize in literature."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"\\"The Grapes of Wrath\\" is a powerful indictment of the oppression endured by the migrant families of the American mid-west during the depression years of the 1930's. The farming-belt of the mid-west had suffered severe drought. \\"Dusters\\" swept across the farmland, skimming off the topsoil, leaving behind a dustbowl, only a few sparse sprigs of wheat surviving. The tenant farms were foreclosed and the families forcibly tractored off the land in a ruthless drive to maximise profit margins. Circa 250,000 migrants, \\"refugees from the dust\\", pulled up stakes and headed west on route 66, the road of flight to California, the golden land of dreams and opportunity, drawn by the prospect of picking work, harvesting oranges and peaches. The influx of rootless migrant workers centred on the San Joachin valley, California, and the huge farms therein, drifting in search of work from squatter camps to government camps to shacks in tied labour camps charging excessive rents and inflated company-store prices. The overwhelming glut of migrants flooding through the valley swamped the harvesting work available, driving down wages to peanuts level as they desperately scrabbled \\"to pull, to pick, to cut - anything, any burden to bear, for food\\".This is the destiny that fate held in store for the Joad family in \\"The Grapes of Wrath\\". Forced off their farm, truck piled high with their meagre belongings, the Joads set forth on an epic 2000 miles haul from Sallislaw in Oklahoma through the western desert states of Arizona and New Mexico and onto the San Joachin valley. The gut-wrenching story of the Joads heroic journey is interspersed with short \\"relief\\" chapters on peripheral aspects of their route 66 experience, the trickery of used-car salesmen or a snapshot of life in a truck-stop diner, to cite but two examples; other chapters function as social commentary on, for example, the stomach turning practice of spraying mountains of oranges with kerosene or dumping potatoes in the river under armed guard to protect market prices, at a time when hundreds of thousands of migrants were literally starving. This structure enables Steinbeck at once to follow closely the fortunes of the Joads and cast a wider eye over what is happening in society during the depression years.However, Steinbeck's narrative, in my view, is at its most powerful and compelling on the road, chronicling the Joads suffering and misfortune trucking along the endless narrow concrete miles to Bakersfield, California, revealing qualities of grit, guts and resilience in their desperate struggle for survival in the face of death, starvation, hostility, exploitation and harassment. The strength of the human spirit is witnessed in Ma Joad's struggle against the odds to hold the family together. Steinbeck's powerful story depicting the plight of the migrants during the hard times of the 1930's depression years, the hardship and oppression endured by thousands upon thousands of families like the Joads, will resonate for generations to come - a timeless classic that has inspired my belief in social justice."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"I read this book when I was 12 and I loved it! It's interesting to see how the people of the Great Depresion lived through things. John Steinbeck is a great author and I think he deserved the nobel prize. After reading this book of his, I'm also going to read 'Of Mice and Men' and 'East of Eden'. I'm sure they'll be as wonderful as 'The Grapes of Wrath'. This is probably my favorite Pulitzer, read it!!!!"},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"The Grapes of Wrath was written by John Steinbeck. It basically describes the tragedy of the Oklahoma sandstorms. The first section of the book is nothing more than a very detailed chapter, describing the sandstorms and the lives of the people living in Oklahoma at this period of time. Steinbeck does a great job at describing the miserable life of these people. I thought this was an essential part of the book because it set the mood of the book. It showed the reader, right away, what was going on in the world, and how horrible it was, before he gets into the characters of the story.During this horrible time, a family decides to leave Oklahoma like every other family was. They decide to travel to California in search for some fortune from the Gold Rush. Their trip is very long and harsh. They all travel across the country with a carriage and a couple of horses. They experience a lot of hardships on their journey. Close to the end of their trip a family member dies because of a disease in their foot. When the family finally gets to California they are expecting an easy life and they are expecting happiness but all they find is more poverty, like in Oklahoma. Nothing was different.This is the part of the book when I finally realized the family's pain. I finally started to feel really bad for them. This is a huge reason why I loved this book. Towards the end of the book I had serious feelings for the characters. It amazed me.The Grapes of Wrath doesn't have a very complex plot. It actually doesn't have much of a plot at all. It simply follows a family through a period of their life."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"My favorite book. Simple. I love this book. I was not someone who was forced to read it (although we did do Catcher in the Rye for English, and I loved it still) and all the can say is &quot;ThiZ book sux!11!1&quot; Steinbeck is a master storyteller. He is not a master of the language as say, Dickens, but that is why he is so brilliant. I feel like I'm right there with the Joads. I've read this book three times in a year, and I always love it. Steinbeck's writing is so simple, you feel like you are listening to your grandpa tell a story. His initial description of Grandpa is hilarious! I love how he changes back and forth between the Joads and the scenes of the other migrant farmers. Two scenes really stick out in my mind. The car dealer and the trucker diner. Steinbeck's style makes you feel like you're in the diner right next to Al.Steinbeck's characters are simple, static,and one dimensional, but this works for this book. They are simple people, and help Steinbecks universal message of oppression.If you want to start reading great books, start here."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"I have always hated the so called 'classics' but then i started reading this and i just couldn't stop. I feel it is an amazing book. Even if you have no previous knowledge of the context or even any interest in the time period it is still brilliant in its portryal of humanity and the human will for survival. It is not simply a novel that was great it is a novel that is great and will continue to be great for a long time to come. The language is a bit hard to get into at first but after about the first chapter it becomes so much a part of the experience....i even found my self thinking and speaking using the language of the novel. I higly recommend this to every one especially those who have a vengeful hate of classics like i do."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"The Grapes of Wrath was a great book filled with both a great story line and fantastic descriptions of the land and people of this era. John Steinbeck used, what i consider to be one of teh most amazing literal stratagies in all teh books I've read. Followinbg each chapter of dialoge involving the charcters, he places a discriptive chpater descibing both the land, and other situations invloving characters who help to reinfoursce teh changing and diverse lifestyles at the time. This book is amazing and i am glad it is part of the curiculem reading for my school."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"* * * * *The Grapes of Wrath by John Steinbeck is a great read. It's worth sticking with all 619 pages. With this book John Steinbeck discusses the Dust Bowl migration. It may seem as though this may be a boring topic for a book, but this novel is actually very interesting. Plus, it is a great read when studying about these hard times during history class. The book looks at the situation from two different angels. It first looks at the migration from the west to California from the eyes of the Joad family and then it looks at the situation from the eyes of any person who has lost everything and has to travel from the west to the east. The Grapes of Wrath touches on many different themes such as the suppression of man, and how man can pull together though hard times with wrath. Once you begin to read you really do get into it. I would have to recommend this book for teenagers on up. This is because there is some light language and I feel that a young adult would better be able to grasp all of the symbolism and meaning that this book encompasses."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"The Grapes of Wrath is one of the most informational and interesting books I have ever read. It dates back to a time in which recent generations may not understand. The 1930's were a difficult time for a lot of people. The Joad family demonstrates the struggles of some of these people on their quest for life.The main character in this book is Tom Joad. He and his family leave their home in Oklahoma because they are pushed out by the banks and forced to move west. Their journey is like no other as they struggle to stay on the road and find money for food. Like the Joad's, thousands of other families are compelled to do the same. These families move in hopes to find a better life.The Grapes of Wrath is a one of a kind novel that widens a person's outlook on life. It shows the audacity and strength of families that have nothing to rely on, except each other. It demonstrates both sides of man; the cruelty and the love. John Steinbeck has filled this book with unforgettable characters that can only be seen through the eyes of the reader. The Grapes of Wrath is an outstanding book that brings to life the courage of mankind."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"This is the reason many people feel he is one of the best American authors of all time. This book is fantastic, there are no other ways around it. This is probably one of the best books he has put out in my opinion. The story is really good and it is really engrossing. The characters come to life and stay with you almost like old friends. He is such a good author that he describes the environment with such skill that you see everything. Once you start you will not want to stop."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"Some books are better read, and some are better heard. The poetry of Steinbeck's Grapes of Wrath takes on even greater depth with the Okie dialect of Dylan Baker. This is probably the greatest American novel of the last century. Despite the condescending attitude of academics, this book lets us all in on our own history. Steinbeck doesn't tell us who we are, he shows us who we are by showing us what we have been. As Samuel Clemens dug up our essence in the disease of slavery, Steinbeck confronts us with the violence of our economic system. Also like Clemens, he shows how religion tends to compound injustices. But what makes this a truly great novel is that all this understanding of the world and how it works is communicated by the lives of characters so real and complex that they have become part of our personal history. We experience the depths of our own emotions and capacity to love. The final scene is perhaps the most powerful depiction of human love in all of literature."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"I've always thought the best measure of art is how it moves someone emotionally. The Grapes of Wrath is a work of art that irradiates such movement. A story set in during the Great Depression in a part of the Great American Dust Bowl, Oklahoma; the humanity of man in utter and total destitution is presented in a very interesting way. It also has a VERY gripping ending. Highly recommended classic."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"I've never known poverty. Every day I have had food, every night I have had shelter and all of my needs have always been fulfilled. After 28 years on God's Earth, my understanding of poverty has now become clearer. Grapes of Wrath is timeless. When a 60 year-old novel can move a grown man to tears that is powerful. I won't spoil the ending, but I will simply say it is the most touching ending that I have ever read in a book, seen in a movie or heard in a song. I had to read the last page three times to really get the full effect. I have young children, this will be one of the first novels I will want them to read as teens. I think I would have been more compassionate and understanding in my teens and twenties if I had read this earlier. For years I have listed To Kill a Mockingbird as my favorite book. Hats off to Steinbeck, I've changed my mind and Grapes of Wrath is Simply the Best!"},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"The first 16 pages of this novel really knows how to put a person to sleep. If you are in to analyzing characters in text to Biblical figures (aka Jesus Christ) then you'll like the preacher J. Casey. From their journey until they arrive in California is fairly accurate in giving you a description of what the life was like for these displaced farmers. You can see the developement of Ma Joad as she takes center stage in the family. As for the ending, it was rather odd how Rose of Sharon gave of herself after showing such selfishness and wistful dreaming. Overall, a very good piece of American Literature."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"well, i think there could not be enough said about how good the story is. Steinbecks classic is one that will make you feel emotions: sadness, pity, relief, and joy. The story based on the worker migrations to california is beyond a doubt a classic novel that MUST be read... enough about the book...the audio book is excellently read by david baker who reads with great clarity and pronunciation. it is unabridged so the listener will get the whole thing as it is. i had read the book twice already and was well on my way during my third pass through when i ran into the idea of listening to this. i had high expectations of the book's content, but was wary about the readers interpretations being thrown upon the reader. baker does a good job of not throwing out too much of his own interpretations/feelings into the words as he speaks them {and when he does they coincide with my interpretations/feelings}.the unabridged audio book is well worth the price. only thing is that audio books cannot compare to actually reading the book for yourself. even with the audio book, i often went back to the book to reread certain parts, and i recommend that everyone pick up the book too and read it... but the book being around 2 inches thick, and if you do not have time sometimes for reading it, the audio book is a good alternative!"},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"The Grapes of Wrath is John Steinbeck's classic novel about the Joad family of Oklahoma and their journey to California in search of a new life. The Joads are forced from their family farm due to the Dust Bowl crisis of the 1930s. Once their farm becomes unproductive, it is foreclosed on by the bank and the Joads are left homeless. Steinbeck's classic is a depressingly honest look at the poorest socioeconomic class of the Depression. As the Joads move West to California and then try to assimilate themselves into a land where their kind is unwelcome, Steinbeck often pauses to observe the larger picture of the desperate circumstances of life for the common American of that era. The Grapes of Wrath is a beautifully written novel about an ugly side of life. While it is heart-breakingly sad, readers will appreciate it as a classic because it is so vividly real. I think most will come away from this story with a deep appreciation of where the United States has come from."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"After being assigned a novel project in Language Arts, I decided to read The Grapes of Wrath. This book is about a family, the Joads. They get kicked off their land and set out to California to look for a job. During this book you follow the Joads journey to California. They have to go through many obstacles on their way to California. As you read this book you will learn about the things that they have to go through. They have determination, and are very brave people. This book was a good book but sad because of all the thing that the Joads had to go through, and how hard that it would have been to live back then in the Great Depression. If you are looking for a good book to read about the past I recommend The Grapes of Wrath."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"Amid the desperation of the 1930s Dust Bowl, drought and changing agricultural practices force a family of Oklahoma sharecroppers to leave their home and join the great migration to California. Piling their broken-down Hudson with the few possessions they can carry, the Joad family sets off for what they believe will be a paradise of bountiful fruit and plentiful work. When they arrive, enduring one hardship after another along the way, the California they find is not at all the one they imagined.Though a work of fiction, \\"The Grapes of Wrath\\" is a painfully real story of what can happen when profit is placed over concern for one's fellow human beings. Like the Mexican migrant workers of today, the Joads flee desperate circumstances in search of a better future, only to find exploitation at the hands of wealthy farm owners and resentment on the part of the people already settled there. Enticed by handbills telling of the need for workers, the Joads discover that the farm owners are merely flooding the market so the starved migrants will fight for the lowest wages. There are constant attempts to keep the migrants in a state of helpless docility: their cardboard Hoovervilles are periodically burned (under the guise of \\"public sanitation\\") to keep them from settling down, and any attempt to assert their rights can result in being blacklisted as a \\"Communist.\\" Meanwhile, they watch with simmering anger as perfectly good fruit is thrown away in order to keep prices up. The locals have little but fearful hostility for the people they derogatorily label \\"Okies,\\" whom they view as less than human.Despite their unending hardships, the Joad family pushes on with dogged perseverance, never losing their dignity. Even when the reader is tempted to lose hope, the Joads find the strength within themselves to push on.One of the strengths of the novel is its characters, who are simultaneously flawed and admirable. The protagonist, Tom, is on parole after unintentionally killing a man in a fight. He can only make the journey by breaking his parole and must not be discovered, which creates an undercurrent of tension. When Pa's status as the head of the family is weakened by his inability to support the clan, Ma emerges as the family's indestructible backbone and one of the strongest characters. Along for the journey is Reverend Casy, the reluctant preacher and a kind of Christ figure, whose philosophical ruminations provide much of the book's social commentary.It is ultimately the pregnant young Rose of Sharon who most embodies the story of loss, resilience, and renewal. Throughout the novel, she is an immature and emotionally fragile girl who seems defeated by the dashing of her dreams: her teenage husband, Connie, runs away, and her baby will be born into unbearable poverty. However, at the end she shows a tender heroism, and her actions in the book's final scene are powerful and unforgettable.This is a deeply moving book. You will grieve for the Joad family's tragedies, all the more because these tragedies are largely the result of human folly and greed. But you will also dream along with them, and find hope in their resilience and will to survive."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"As a former resident of California, I was often shocked on how the locals treated the Mexicans. After working all day, some were paid virtually nothing, and some were actually paid nothing. And because they couldn't complain to the government they were just \\"out of luck.\\" This book addresses that very issue, if only dealing with the white \\"oakies.\\" The point of this novel makes about migrant workers is just as valid today as it was 80 whatever years ago.Steinbecks writing is occasionally criticized, but I cannot figure out why. Steinbeck takes a quasi-journalistic approach to his writing, flawlessly fusing fiction and reporting throughout the writing. This is a book that is simultaneously interesting and informative. Its like a newspaper thats also entertaining. The writing is very fluid, and despite the novels length (my edition was over 600 pgs) its actually not a boring, slow read. The characters are well developed and interesting, if in some cases a tad unbelievable.A great novel. The only people that probably object are middle and upper class conservatives that can't accept that anyone should be able to speak out against those less fortunate than themselves"},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"Lin Bentolila, a dear friend, gave me this book for my birthday 08 and I finally finished it and also saw the DVD movie version. Both gave me a rare view into a time in America that I knew little about. Published in 1939, the Grapes of Wrath is about the brutal and sad time people had to live... shall we say struggle through... and for the lucky some... survive during those days.I learned that back then people entered into agricultural agreements where they did not own the land but were allowed by the owners to use the land in return for a share of the crop produced, and as times got really bad because of the lack of water, the \\"dust\\" storms and the inability to produce, they could no longer afford to pay the agreed share and were therefore, run from their land... even though they had worked it for over 70 years seeing many family generations come and go on the land which they called home...How incredibly sad... simply horrible... The story centers on a family with the last name of Joads and it is so hopeless at times that I felt the pain and sorrow of these characters daring to hope for a better life.Desperate times, children left without food and without care because parents earned miserable wages and had to go to find whatever work was available. Labor contracts were not respected, conditions were oppressive, and the spark of an attempt to correct the situation was seen as a crime and punished as such.The emotions are deep and while the family undergoes many trials and desperate moments, they continue to have pride, human dignity, and the willingness to share whatever little they had. The road trip that takes them from their home in Oklahoma to California is at times exasperating because we suffer right along with these characters. The scenes at a road side diner where they buy bread... only able to pay for a 10 cent loaf is heart rendering and it is with a certain sense of trepidation that we realize that times in America today are again desperate for many. Never learning the great lessons from the past, we seem to repeat history over and over again, and between the housing market fiasco, the home foreclosures and the price of gas, let's hope we do not see Americans brought to another period of depression.This is a must read and must see, while it is depressive, at times shocking, it poses fundamental questions of humanity. How can we live our lives in peace witnessing those who have so much and yet others not being able to eat? How do we ensure that our social systems protect our people from ever having to endure such harsh living conditions? At what point do we stop being human if we stand by and do nothing to change and bring opportunity and the right to work and earn a living to every person willing to work to make a living?"},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"This book will make you look around with open eyes. I highly recommend reading this book, even if you hated it in high school. A person cannot appreciate hardship if you are a young adult that has everything you need, and a lot of times whatever you want. As an adult, I was able to absorb much more of the true meaning of this book. The Grapes of Wrath will change your way of thinking about what is truly important in life."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"For the last few years I've been on a quest to read the one hundred greatest books ever written. Unfortunately I've discovered that there doesn't seem to be any consensus as to which books deserve to be on that list. Out of the three lists I've come upon only two books were even listed more than once (\\"The Grapes of Wrath\\", and \\"Of Mice and Men\\" both by John Steinbeck), so I've been forced to read as many books as possible from all of the lists to try and compose my own.Based on the listings I suspected the \\"The Grapes of Wrath\\" was going to be a special book so I wanted to own the hardback copy of it, but since it has been out of print for so long I finally broke down and just bought the paperback. Let me just say that this is one of the best novels ever written and certainly will make my final listing. It definitely was deserving of the Nobel prize it received.Written in 1939 this book captures the story of the Joad family during the Great Depression when thousands of families left their farms in Oklahoma and moved out to California to try to improve their fortunes, only to find sorrow and death waiting for them there.The story opens with Tom Joad being released from prison on parole for a charge of murder he committed in self defense. He returns home after being away for several years only to find his family packing up and moving away. The crops hadn't been good for several seasons and the banks were foreclosing on the loans. Small farmers were being squeezed out by the big corporations and people were forced to try to find a different profession.When handbills arrive declaring that there was plenty of work out in California picking crops the people took it as a sign of hope. They sold most of their possessions, packed whatever was left up in a broken down truck and headed west on route 66.The Joad Family consisting of fourteen people and friends plus one dog, along with all of their belongings set out for the trip in just one truck that they bought from a very charismatic salesman and had customized. (I'm sorry but this was one of the few things in the story I had a problem with, since I just couldn't picture it. I'm one of seven kids and the nine of us could never fit in a station wagon. How did fourteen people and a dog fit in one truck with all of our belongings?) There was Mr. and Mrs. Joad, Grandma and Grandpa Joad, Uncle John, Casy the former preacher, the boys Noah, Tom, Al, and little Winfield, and then there was the daughter Rosasharon (Rose of Sharon) who was pregnant along with her husband Connie, Rosasharon's younger sister Ruthie, plus the dog...While home on the farm when there was work Mr. Joad and the men ran the family, but when they got out on the road without any work Mr. Joad became a lost without his purpose in life, and Mrs. Joad had to take over as the head of the family. She made all of the tough decisions on the road and showed her strength to keep everyone going. Uncle John is a dark soul who had never forgiven himself for not being able to do more for his wife when she got sick and died. He fluctuates in the novel between being a drunk and someone who gives away all of his possessions to the kids to try to make it up to the world. The oldest son Noah I believe is mentally challenged due to a birthing accident and is kind of lost with all of the changes. Tom who is the next oldest son represents justice and truth throughout the novel. Al is a tomcat who's always out looking for girls, but wants to settle down some day and be a mechanic. Rosasharon and Connie are a young couple who dream of owning their own home with a white picket fence and raising a family. Casy used to be a preacher but lost his belief in God. Out in California he discovers a new calling. The kids Winfield and Ruthie I believe just represent innocence.Along the road they live day to day, dollar to dollar with the belief that all they need to do is get to California and they would find salvation. They meet many adversities along the road which they struggle to overcome. By working together and making some new friends they manage to survive. The whole country seems to be moving and change is in the air. Route 66 is perfectly described, from the truck stop restaurants, to the broken down gas stations, we are shown different levels of haves and have nots. The Joads do a little better job than some in maintaining their moral standards and beliefs but they see the road take it's toll on the people.After many tragedies and tribulations they finally arrive in California only to find that they were mislead. California may be beautiful and the land fertile but it is all owned by greedy men, who don't want to share any of their wealth.A great number of people have been lured out west in order to produce a cheap labor force to pick crops. With thousands of people fighting for just a few jobs they would accept lower wages just to keep from starving. The people tried to turn to the government for help only to find more greed and corruption. The government would only grant assistance to people who had been in the state for more than a year and the police were all either related to or paid off by the wealthy land owners who wanted to maintain the cheap labor force, so they kept the people moving so they couldn't obtain any lasting residency.People were living in make shift homes on the edge of town called Hoovervilles (after Herbert Hoover, president 1929-1933), until the cops came and forced them out.Even in desperation the people still tried to ban together to create their own rules and maintain their basic morals for what was acceptable, but they were being plagued on at every turn. They still acted as men, but you could see their tolerance reach critical levels.Each chapter you could feel the tension rising as the people were beaten down and mistreated. It was hard to believe the level of cruelty. The rich were afraid of the poor people and thought they were going to take everything they owned so they treated them as less than human and gave them nothing. The poor could only turn to other poor people for help since no one else seemed to care. Throughout the book as the people reached a greater and greater level of desperation you wondered when they were going to break, but the human spirit seems to persevere.After all that transpires you are just amazed at the ability of these people to keep fighting and go on, and that gives you a little bit of hope.I'd highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"An incredible tale of the aftermath of the Great Depression coupled with factory farming.Definitely in the top quarter of books I've read, my only complaint was in the ending - I'm not saying it should be different, it fits the story very well, but darn it I wanted to see a little more happiness in the end for a family that had struggled so.One of the top American novels ever."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"The next time somebody asks me what the Great American Novel is, I'm pointing them right here. I love Steinbeck and have for ten or so years since I first read East of Eden (still my favourite by him), and I purposely avoided Grapes because I felt there was no way it could possibly live up to the hype that it always gets. Guess what! It does more than live up to it - it surpassed my wildest expectations!!!"},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"\\"Ya gotta eat...\\" Dad used uto say if we thanked him for taking to the local hamburger stand; he could have, just as easily, been stating the obvious theme of Steinbeck's The Grapes of Wrath. One can easily imagine Tom Joad or, more to the point, his sister Rosasharon saying it in her \\"sharing\\" scene in the closing pages of the book. I read this book, the first time, in sophomore study hall just before lunch in small town Wisconsin; largely as a result of the wretched deprivations depicted in the book, I remember rushing home, sure I would starve to death if I didn't immediately ingest the bowl of soup and sandwich my mother had waiting for me. As the Joad family move out of Dustbowl Oklahoma toward the promised land of California, the Joads must survive on fried dough and unripe fruit (from which they are warned they may \\"get the skitters\\"); Along the way they meet tragedy and, in most cases, their dreams of a better life are smashed like last year's fallen fruit...And, yet, they still hope for the best. Maybe the next Hooverville will be different, maybe the next fruit ranch; if they could only make it there. Government offered little or no help. Long before the rest of the nation hit the skids, farmers were getting the short end of the stick; they never saw any of the prosperity of the 1920's, and the Dustbowl didn't help either. But Tom Joad sees hope in numbers, \\"Wherever a guy is hungry, I'll be there...\\", he says, urging the readers to come along, to fight injustice wherever they can: a challenge as urgent today as when Tom made it in this wonderful book."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"First introduced to John Steinbeck via \\"Grapes,\\" some thirty years ago, I've found myself a fan of his work ever since. This is no short read, but it is easy to follow and a great record of a period in American history when everything was falling to pieces.Basically the story of the Joad family as they migrate from the dust bowl in the thirties to California, it is intricate in its telling. The character development is especially rewarding and it would be impossible to read this great novel and not be moved by the extreme hardships that this family endured.There are only a handful of \\"great American novels,\\" and this is certainly at the top of the list. The only other Steinbeck that I enjoyed more was \\"East of Eden,\\" with its themes of family dysfunction and turn-of-the-century turmoil.Whether you're a fan of long novels or not, this is a must read book for anyone interested in great literature and seeking to know more about a period in American history that shaped our country. And finally, the ending, you simply won't believe. It's an incredible image of hope that will stick with you long after you've closed the covers on this incredible book."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"'The Grapes of Wrath' is off the charts. I'm not qualified to review this book, but I'd like to make one observation. This masterpiece is the only book I've ever read that builds and builds until the very, very last word. Three words before the end I had no idea of the unutterable tenderness that followed. I will always remember how I felt at the moment I finished reading that last word. It was \\"Huh? No. Oh my God. That's it? Of course it is. I need a drink.\\""},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"I get personally offended when I read reviews accusing this masterpiece of being &quot;boring.&quot; I suppose if one is extremely uneducated, this towering drama of American restlessness can seem boring, but if one is that uneducated, one should stick with Mary Higgins Clark. Steinbeck isn't difficult stuff, people. The language is far from that horribly stuffy Charles Dickens crap; rather, it's closer in style and elegant simplicity to the pinnacle of 19th-century American literature, Mark Twain. The dialogue is NOT trite, it's sparse. The descriptive passages are NOT monotonous, they're stark and yet detailed. The plot is NOT far-fetched, it's based on a journey undertaken by thousands of discontented pilgrims.I will not go so far as to call this work the Greatest American Novel, or even the Greatest American Novel of the Twentieth Century. It's up there, without a doubt, if only because of its social influence and the underbelly that it exposes. But in addition to being one of the GREATEST books, it is also one of the BEST books. It's genuinely interesting...gripping...engaging. I read it a few years ago, I think during the summer between the 10th and 11th grades, and I could barely put it down. It's one of those rare novels: a page-turner, yet with prose sometimes delicious enough to roll through your imagination a few times, savoring the language composition. And after you've finished reading, you find that the novel has left you profoundly affected.So it's not just a Great Book; it's a really really good book as well. It's powerful, it's enjoyable on every level. Read it and be changed."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"I will never forget how this book captivated me in so many ways. An American classic that will stand the test of time. I got the pleasure of being assigned this book in 10th grade as part of literature class. I was forever changed by this book, and helped fuel me to read more challenging books.John Steinbeck helped me to realize the poverty, the trangressions, and some hope of the Depression. It helped put me in focus with the pride problems that the family had during the collapse of an entire society during America's most trying times. It is well written and very captivating. It had me in tears more than once. It also reads much like The Bible at times, in its prose and style. It catalogs a family's journey from farmers to migrant workers that is easily readable and a classic that helped define a generation.A great book- and a must have."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"I hungrily devoured this book, and yet, several times, I had to stop to digest the depth and import of a few simple words. Steinbeck is commenting on industrialization, big business killing small business, environmentalism, family, the extended family of the human race...all in an allegory of Exodus and Jesus Christ's life. I can't think of a more timely message for the modern world. The symbolism was a bit obvious at times, but there were also more subtle areas in which he left you with just a hint of import until you were able to analyze it more fully. The ending gives new meaning to the Milk of Human Kindness. I absolutely recommend this, but at least a basic background in the history of the Dust Bowl and Depression are recommended."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"A Review of The Grapes of Wrath by John SteinbeckI am not an economist so I am not even going to try to understand the economic mess were are in as a nation - but I cannot help but think about The Grapes of Wrath and the odyssey of the Joad family when I think about our current financial times. Massive debt. Budget shortages. Home foreclosures. Business failures. Bankruptcies. Job losses. In some ways I feel that we are all (well many of us) Joad's now - trapped in a financial system that we do not understand, trying to make a daily living, but always feeling that we are taking one step up and two back.My favorite scene in The Grapes of Wrath was early in the book, when a tenant farmer is trying to stop his home and land from being plowed over by tractor-operator hired by the bank. This is a man he knows, a local, who has taken a job with the bank to gain a regular salary and some stability for his family. But, this stability comes with a huge price. His job is to repossess the land of his friends and neighbors and ready it to be turned over to the banks. How many of us would do the same? Life is a struggle and when money is tight we would do most anything to pay the bills and feed our own - but where do we draw the lines? The tenant wants to shoot him - but the man explains the truth - it's not him, not his fault - it's no one's fault - we are all ghosts in the money machine. This is a slice of that conversation:\\"It's not me. There's nothing I can do. I'll lose my job if I don't do it. And look -- suppose you kill me? They'll just hang you, but long before your hung there will be another guy on the tractor, and he'll bump the house down. You're not killing the right guy.\\"\\"That's so,\\" the tenant said. \\"Who gave you orders? I'll go after him. He's the one to kill.\\"\\"You're wrong. He got his orders from the bank. The bank told them: \\"Clear those people out or it's your job.\\"\\"Well, there's a president of the bank. There's a Board of Directors. I'll fill up the magazine of the rifle and go into the bank.\\"The driver said: \\"Fellow was telling me the bank gets orders from the East. The orders were:\\"Make the land show profit or we'll close you up.\\"\\"But where does it stop? Who can we shoot? I don't aim to starve to death before I kill the man that's starving me.\\"\\"I don't know. Maybe there's nobody to shoot. Maybe the thing isn't man at all. Maybe, like you said, the property's doing it. Anyway I told you my orders.\\"The financial machine we live inside often challenges our morality, our faith, our ethics in exchange for a paycheck. Think Glengarry Glen Ross, think sell or be fired, think it me or you and its not going to be me. So we take a nice long trip to Disney to forget all about it. Maybe we have a food drive at school - help the less fortunate. How are we supposed to live? Is this really it? Work your butt off, get as much as you can, hoard as much as you can - every man for himself. Really? The Joad's are not bums, not lazy, not moochers. They are simple folk who want to work - an honest days work for an honest days pay. But the fruit growers of this novel are the factories of Mexico, China, Vietnam, and every other \\"third world\\" country that produces our clothes, shoes, food and products. They are in a race to the bottom - pitted against one another for jobs - always pushed to do more for less. Why? So we can buy three dollar T-shirts at Wal-Mart.Don't get me wrong - I shop at Wal-Mart - we all do - we have to make our money stretch. We are all stuck. But can it change? As the tenant farmer went on to say:\\"I got to figure,\\" the tenant said. \\"We all got to figure. There's some way to stop this. It's not like lightning or earthquakes. We've got a bad thing made by men, and by God that's something we can change.\\"I think the beginning is within each of us - within me. We (I) made this mess - we (I am) are part of this mess. We (I) can change it by waking up, beginning to care and changing how we (I) live, think and treat one another - today. We (I) need to begin to want less, expect less and need less. This concept is antithetical in a society based on consumption - but will help forge a world that is more humane and loving. It is time to withdraw from the \\"Grand Illusion\\", to unplug the television, cancel your (my) subscription to all your (my) magazines, especially - \\"You're Not Skinny Enough\\" Monthly, \\"My House is Perfect - What's Up With Yours\\" Weekly and \\"Look How Rich I Am\\" Daily - shut it off - go outside, appreciate what you have, love one another, seek God and be what he has commanded us to be in this life - witnesses to his Word, not buyers of more garbage. As Americans we need to see ourselves for what we are - from a global perspective - we are the rich oppressors. Our want's, needs, desires, and struggles impact the world. We need to heed the following:\\"Now listen, you rich people, weep and wail because of the misery that is coming upon you. Your wealth has rotted, and moths have eaten your clothes. Your gold and silver are corroded. Their corrosion will testify against you and eat your flesh like fire. You have hoarded wealth in the last days. Look! The wages you failed to pay the workmen who mowed your fields are crying out against you. The cries of the harvesters have reached the ears of the Lord Almighty. You have lived in luxury and self-indulgence. You have fattened yourselves in the day of slaughter. You have condemned and murdered innocent men, who were not opposing you.\\" - James 5: 1-6Although The Grapes of Wrath is a story about the Great Depression, it is a story of our lives - today. Many in this nation are doing very well - their houses keep getting bigger, their cars more expensive, their travel more extensive and their luxuries increase- but what about the rest. The Joad family represents \\"the rest.\\" All those people who have been foreclosed upon; laid off - forgotten. Where do they go? What do they do? Do we care?This is not a political perspective - politics do far more harm than good - nothing has been changed through legislation. Problems such as this require a change of the heart. It requires us to look each other in the eye - see one another as fellow humans - a mother, father, husband, wife, sister, brother, son, or daughter - not as a number or a servant. I believe that we as a nation will reap what we sow - it is for us to decide what that will be. Our final reward will be contingent on how we treated the least among us - every day. I am far from doing this - my eyes are just opening to my personal greed, narcissism and selfishness - but all change begins with the decision to change. What is your decision?"},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"This is an absolutely fantastic book illustrating the difficulties of many Americans during the depression (and the strength of a family to stick together and fight for each other). Though it is definitely not a page turner, and frequently slow, this is perhaps the only book I've read that I find myself frequently telling people they should read.I had a difficult time appreciating the book while reading it; however, I greatly appreciated it upon completion (about 4 years ago) and my appreciation keeps growing. I find the book to be very relevant and a good reminder of how life was for many just 80 years ago, especially when I hear people talking about how difficult or unfair things are today in the US. It's a sad reminder that, although I wouldn't wish the Joads' life on anyone, our society is far removed from the difficulties that instilled strength, resiliency, and a code of honor that made both that generation and this country great.I'm tempted to give this book 4 stars because it's slow and sometimes difficult to get through (though I am a fan of the chapter structure where Steinbeck alternates between long chapters involving the Joads and short anecdotes not involving the Joads but showing further insight into life during that time), but due to its impact on me and my continued frequent recommendation to others to read it, giving it less than 5 stars would be an injustice to this book. Also, I'm not sure who I would broadly recommend this book to, but I would not generally recommend it to younger audiences (who may lack sufficient insight into life and history) as I didn't read it until I was nearly 30 and still needed some time after reading it to fully appreciate it."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"Who am I to review one of the greatest literary works of all time? Could I possibly give this book anything less than the maximum rating it so richly deserves? Should I even commence? Those were just some of my private thoughts as I finally put down a copy of this book - read. This is the book which stirred the American conscience, caused political reform and brought about change when first published in 1939. This is the book which described how families were starving to death because of corruption. This is John Steinbeck at his exceptional best. For those people who never got around to reading this engaging and absorbing account of the Joad family, may I suggest you actually purchase a copy (any copy!) and finally read it.Today the world is either in recession or emerging from the dark grip of this latest financial catastrophe. Whilst we may live in a time when millions of families are no longer allowed to starve to death - well, not in the developed world at any rate, I earnestly believe there are lessons to be learned from this book about the rich and powerful who care not for their fellow man but only for personal gain. More importantly, those lessons are as relevant today as they were in 1939.Another similarity also failed to escape my notice; In this book we see how US police and other officials use their positions of authority to threaten and even blackmail the many thousands of American migrants who were simply looking for work in order to feed hungry mouths. These people had not arrived from any foreign country and were not even black - something which would have made their persecution much easier. No!, these ordinary white American folk were honest farmers who had been forcibly evicted from their homes and the land they had worked for generations. Seventy years on, here in the UK, we are besieged by TV programmes depicting our different police forces undertaking their various duties around the country. Yet more cheaply produced \\"reality\\" television! Significantly, however, I have occasionally noticed how some police officers deliberately provoke a hostile situation where exists. Whilst not on the scale portrayed in this outstanding work, it is interesting that I should recognise that underlying attitude of arrogant superiority.Whilst some may find the book slow going at the start, Steinbeck quickly gathers in those loose strands until they suddenly pull together to assume a story, reveal a mental photograph and produce a relevance into which the reader becomes fully immersed. I promptly learned local words and understood the dialect in which they were spoken as the Joad story unfolded. I could hear those southern accents as hardships are endured and explained through the actions of those who lived them. This was the organised, legalised daylight robbery and exploitation of the poor by the rich who were actively supported by the law enforcement agencies. A week's work for 1,000 fruit pickers paying 50 cents an hour is advertised to 3,000 hungry people who then pass on the message. Consequently, 5,000 starving workers arrive in search of that employment. With so much competition, the rate is lowered to 30 cents - take it or leave it! It was a deliberate ploy repeated time after time. Anyone attempting to organise his fellow workers is photographed, black-listed and branded a communist. Now feed that to your children. Then the banks insist the farmers reduced the rate to 25 cents and any landowner who questions that decision is swiftly reminded of his own vulnerability as a mortgagee! In short, either you pay them 25 cents or you join them! My own immediate reaction was to recognise a similarity between then and now - specifically with those modern banking practises which preyed on the sub-prime market. Anyone who cared to consider precisely what \\"sub-prime\\" meant, knew it was a policy destined to fail. And fail it did in spectacular fashion - and yet, the fat cat bankers still draw bonuses based on \\"personal performance\\" and not on their company's overall profit or loss...I note from some of the comments appended to certain editions of this book, that various issues have been produced in which, apparently, Steinbeck's prose are changed to make the work an easier read. Please don't take the easy option, take the version written as it was intended to be read - i.e. the version written by Steinbeck. If not, you cannot claim to have read this book at all - instead you have the equivalent of, say, a Romeo and Juliet story - set in Manhattan in the 21st Century - and there are plenty of those...In closing, I would urge anyone (indeed everyone) who has not already read an original version of this book If to go out and buy a copy - any old copy and then simply read it. Having done that, you too will draw parallels with our modern age and understand what I mean. You will also be richer for having done so - as would those fat cats who, unfortunately, will probably never bother. Having finally finished reading this outstanding work, I wonder how many of you will still be wondering whatever happened to that perfectly matched pair of Bays! I do...NM"},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"I am a resident of Kern County, California, where half of the story takes place.

Because very little internal dialogue is presented, the Joads and other characters seem just plain stupid. However, by their actions one realizes they have a dignity and intelligence that is not obvious at first. They struggle against misfortune as best they can. In depicting the life of the Joads, the novel offers a vivid portrayal of the lives of many who suffered through the Great Depression. On a broader level this work also provides a commentary on government, religion, and politics. The climactic scene is meaningful but does not flow from the preceding chapters, and the ending is odd and will make you wonder what the message is.By the end of the novel, one may realize that this story is not just about the Joads, but a story of all Americans, no matter what the background. This is truly one of the greatest novels of American literature."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"My wife and I read this book while Hobo-ing around America picking fruits and vegetable in the 70's. We both really liked it. We saw the movie also.I'm am one of those who considers this to be Steinbeck's best. I've read several others by the author and I feel that this was far and away the deepest and the most dramatic. The ending I'm sure some would consider more appropriate in an ancient Greek tragedy but he made his point - one that I have always found very traditional and very difficult to swallow. But it is fundamental.This is without any doubt and American classic. In my opinion nothing that Mr. Steinbeck wrote after The Grapes Of Wrath is in the same class. I know that there are plenty out there who disagree but nevertheless that is my opinion.In this novel, everything is centered on the characters. There is little blatent philosophizing - the story tells the tale. There is no Steinbeck filler material. He had a story he wanted to tell and he told it. It was great.Richard Edward Noble - The Hobo Philosopher - Author of:\\"Hobo-ing America: A Workingman's Tour of the U.S.A..\\""},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"Life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. These are the values upon which our country was founded. Yet history has shown that this has not been the case for many people living in the United States. Americans have been restricted from these rights because of unalterable circumstances such as race, sex, religion, or in the case of Grapes of Wrath, because of economic status. The Grapes of Wrath by John Steinbeck takes place during the 1930's, a time of nation wide economic hardship. Many books have been written about the great depression but this book is unique in its focus on another great tragedy effecting the country at the same time. The great dust bowl caused the migration of thousands of people from the Midwest US to the state of California in search of a better life for their families. This book addresses the hardships suffered by those families. This book is very effective in portraying these struggles both generally and personally. Steinbeck chose to alternate chapters between general descriptions of the country's struggles and the story of one specific family by the name of Joad. The general descriptions display the widespread difficulties people everywhere were suffering by describing the people as a general, family unit, &quot;And the man, the leader of the family, leaned from the car. Can we pull in here an sleep?&quot; (Steinbeck, p268) These chapters addressing the &quot;big picture&quot; were followed by chapters that brought the issue to life by displaying the struggles of the Joad family. This alternation of big picture, small picture story telling resulted in a well-rounded image of a time period in American history. So much can be gained from this book it is a definite asset to anyone's reading list. Not only is it a great chronicle of history, it is a story about the American dream, and the quality of life. The length of the book shouldn't provide an obstacle for a reader seeing as how it is neither exceptionally long nor short and it maintains a good amount of excitement and adventure throughout the novel. The only thing that may be distracting to some readers is the periodic breakaway from the main story line. However, if one can see this as a valuable literary device instead of an obstacle, it will actually provide a greater understanding of the time period. The Grapes of Wrath provides a great insight into a period of history. By reading the book, the reader is left with greater understanding and empathy for those who lived during the dust bowl of 1930. The bravery and strength that is demonstrated by the Joad family is both phenomenal and inspiring. It is a good example for people today who are suffering through difficult times. When these people where faced with hardship, they did not roll over and die. They picked up their lives and their families and they set out determined to find a way to protect and provide for themselves. At a time when everyday people in our country are turning to drugs, gangs, or crime as solutions to their problems, a great lesson can be learned from these families: The world is not perfect but that is no excuse to give up on life. And life was the picture John Steinbeck was trying to relay in his book. A raw, honest look at life during a time of great hardship and trial. The Joad family was an excellent portrayal of a typical family from the Midwest in search of the better life they had been promised elsewhere. Steinbeck characterized the family through dialogue that depicts both the diction and accent of a typical Midwest family in the 1930's, &quot; 'You jus' goin wes'?' 'Jus' on our way.' 'You ain't never been in California?'&quot; (278). Choosing to maintain the dialogue in this natural state adds to the authenticity of the novel and creates a better picture for the reader."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"You know it's an American classic, and everything that has been written about it being a great book that depicts an era in American history in a phenomenal way is true. I will just point out two things that I think the person who reads this book should know (especially if the reader is anything like me):1. The book starts out sort of slow. I read the beginning and wondered what I had gotten myself into. In fact, it started out so slow that I would have put it down had it not been required reading. I urge you to keep reading! The book is a classic for a reason, and it is good. Eventually, it turns into a real page-turner, and you want to find out what happens next to the Joad family. Later, you will want to check out what other people have said about this book. I never would have gotten all of the Biblical allusions or other symbolism without reading and discussing this book with others.2. The ending will surprise you. It shocked me. I definitely won't spoil it, but the ending of this book left me, quite literally, jaw wide open. WHAT? I thought. Oh my gosh! I was glad I had someone to talk about it with, because even in today's world, I'm sure most people would find it shocking. And it is nothing like the movie.That's my two cents. This book is a great addition to your literary knowledge, and if you haven't read it, I highly recommend it, from both the literary angle and the historical perspective."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"Between 1936 and 1938, Steinbeck wrote a series of newspaper articles for the San Francisco News and the Monterey Trader about the horrendous plight of the migrant workers in California, many of whom arrived from Oklahoma, Texas, and beyond, seeking work during the \\"Dust Bowl migration\\" of the 1930s. (Earlier, he had written and published a novel \\"In Dubious Battle,\\" about labor unrest among those same migrant workers.) The fruit of Steinbeck\`s years mingling with these workers and investigating their conditions, \\"The Grapes of Wrath\\" is a powerful and sympathetic fictional portrayal of one family's horrific odyssey across America in search of work after losing ownership of their farm.There is certainly more than one way to read this novel: as an incendiary historical document that galvanized the country (Eleanor Roosevelt and various politicians took up the cause of the migrant workers, while conservative-leaning groups and towns banned--or burned--the book); as an epic about human perseverance, survival, and dignity (reflected symbolically in the much-maligned \\"turtle chapter\\"); as a political manifesto unflinching in its condemnation of the insensitivities of corporate capitalism (for which Steinbeck was accused of Communist sympathies). Readers who find the novel unrelentingly depressing or unrealistic in its portrayal of the Joad family's fate should understand that the Joads were actually quite lucky. (Very few migrant families, for example, were fortunate enough to live in government camps.)The first hundred pages or so proceed rather slowly, in part because Steinbeck alternates the chapters about the Joad family with prosaic interludes describing the difficulties facing the migrant workers in general. But the pace of the novel accelerates (and the interludes become shorter), as various members of the Joad family experience frustration, sickness, brief periods of success, and death--never letting go of their dream of settling down somewhere and living in a house. The various members of the family are astonishingly realistic, and their motivations, if simple, are always believable. (The two children are, well, just like children). The ending, which must have been scandalously shocking in the 1930s, is still electrifying; it forcefully shows the desperate lengths the poor were willing to go to help each other when most of America didn't care about their plight.This is my second time reading the novel, and--although I again found it gripping and moving--I was not as impressed as the first time I read it two decades ago. (I was much more idealistic then, I suppose.) One of the novel's greatest weaknesses is that Steinbeck overstates the evil machinations of the \\"bad guys\\" and the good-natured intentions of the \\"good guys.\\" All the police and the bankers and the landowners are thoroughly malevolent; all the displaced migrant workers and the sharecroppers are faultless (or their shortcomings are unsophisticated, understandable, or well-meaning). As a result, the novel reads in a few places like agitprop rather than fiction.Of course, that was Steinbeck's intent: he wanted to wake up the country. Yet, as a work of art, this style doesn't date well. Nevertheless, only a cynic or a monopolist could be unmoved by the story of the Joad family. It is truly a classic proletarian novel."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"When I was first assigned to read John Steinbeck's book The Grapes of Wrath in English class, the first thing that I noticed was how huge it was. Over 600 pages! I was afraid it would be a story that wandered all over the place and didn't really have a point. Even after I had begun reading, it seemed that this assumption was correct since all book seemed to be doing was telling a very detailed and slow-moving story about a family in Oklahoma. However, as I continued reading, I began to realize that the very way the book portrays the life of these people so realistically and what the reader learns from their situation is itself the point of the book. The Grapes of Wrath is the story of the Joad family, an Oklahoma family of tenant farmers during the Great Depression who are kicked out of their homes because they cannot make a profit on their crops. As more and more farmers are kicked off their land to be replaced by men on tractors, over 300,000 people migrate west to California in hopes of earning a living picking fruit, cotton, etc... for owners with larger farms. Hardship follows them during the long trip to California. Even once they get there, they're divided against themselves as they compete for work so they can just feed their families. Throughout the book the family encounters opposition from all sorts of people, including land owning farmers who must pay extremely low wages in order to make a profit, cops who cause more trouble than good, locals who are afraid of the massive influx of people, and a government that seems unable to help. In the end it's sheer will that gives them the strength to continue to fight as the Depression relentlessly tries to break the people's determination and the family bonds. The Grapes of Wrath gives a very realistic view of the Great Depression and tells it from viewpoints you don't see from just reading about it in a history textbook. The book is divided into narrative chapters that tell the story of the Joads, and, every other chapter, the inter chapters that give information about the situation in a style that's part documentary, part editorial. Throughout the book, especially during the inter chapters, Steinbeck uses symbolism to convey ideas. In particular, there are many allusions to the Bible, including the title. Due to its realistic portrayal of the life of the migrants, the book has also come under considerable controversy for its profanity and sex, since those things were parts of the lives of these people. Also, Steinbeck uses the inter chapters both to make people aware of the problems and to give suggestions for how to deal with them, and many of his beliefs could be seen as Communistic. I have really found The Grapes of Wrath to be a difficult book to rate. On the one hand, it's a slow-moving book that contains a whole lot of talk that people who aren't really into reading books for fun will likely find boring, and it's just too long to hold some people's interest. On the other hand, however, the character interaction is very realistic and human, being based on actual migrants Steinbeck knew. Because of this, we get to feel like we really know the people in the book. The seemingly excessive length of the book is actually needed to give us a real understanding of how these people lived their lives. When the characters get into intense situations that threaten the physical and psychological well-being of the family both as a group of individuals and as a single unit, the book reaches hights of drama and emotional intensity that is almost never matched today in movies, books, video games, music, or any of our other forms of art. I often found myself just sitting there thinking about what I'd just read for a while after I finished with the required reading for the day. There's not really space within this 1,000 word limit to fully discuss my thoughts on this book, but what I can say is that it will draw you into the world of the migrants in the 1930's and show you plainly and truthfully just what it was like. I can understand the opinion of people who hate this book because it's all a matter of taste, and some people just would not be able to forgive the many parts they consider agonizingly boring. Although I give this book four stars overall, there are parts of it that I'd give 10 stars if I could. I highly recommend this powerful book to anyone."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"The first thing that came to mind when I read Steinbeck's classic The Grapes of Wrath was its parallel to Upton Sinclair's The Jungle - the downward spiral of a migrant family who find themselves in a struggle to subsist in abject poverty. (Fortunately, where Sinclair rams Socialism down our throats in The Jungle, Steinbeck merely offers us a spoonful here.)Steinbeck provides wonderful development for each character in this story; though none of them could be called bright, each figure possesses a unique depth and personality. Tom Joad is the angst-ridden main character who has just been released from serving a long prison sentence. Ma is the family matriarch who provides strength and optimism even in the worst times. Jim Clancy is the fallen preacher who joins the Joad's on their sojourn. (Clancy is certainly the novel's most over-analyzed character - he has been likened to a metaphor for Jesus Christ, but I just didn't see it.)This now classic tale takes place during 1930's, and is about a family of Oklahoma Dustbowl farmers who, like countless others, migrate to California after losing their farm. But they don't give up without a fight, leaving only when the bulldozers come to raze their home. Packing up all of their possessions in the family jalopy, they make their way across a Depression Era America that has little pity on &quot;ignorant Okies&quot;. Along the way they meet other Okies fleeing back home from California after finding only starvation in the so-called promised land. (One of the most heart wrenching figures in the novel is the Okie who is returning after helplessly watching his child die of starvation). But, just like the Rudkis family in The Jungle, the Joad's are sure that, with some hard work, things will be different for them. Though the family does find work picking fruit, it is not the Garden of Eden they'd hoped it would be. Even the children must endure twelve hour days of backbreaking work in the hot sun under the cruel eye of their supervisors at their slave-labor-like work camps. They are forced to live in infested wooden shacks called &quot;company housing&quot;, and to buy their food at the &quot;company store&quot; whose prices are exorbitant and which comes out of their already paltry pay. The most horrifically ironic part is that while their meals usually consist of gruel &quot;with bacon grease for strength&quot;, they dare not eat the fruit they pick for fear of swift and severe punishment. Forced to flee the camp after Tom assaults a would-be rapist, the family is all but lost. The final scene is heart wrenching and unforgettable - and proves Ma's claim that the poor are the ones who can be counted when somebody is in need.The Grapes of Wrath is considered one of this century's greatest literary masterpieces, and with good reason. Its many layers are deeply thought-provoking - and provides insightful social commentary which could address many issues we deal with even today. Read it!"},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"Over the years I've read and heard from many people about The Grapes of Wrath. The comments ranged from, \\"it's overrated\\" to \\"it's the best book ever written by an American author\\". I will not try to make you believe either. However, this is the most powerful writing that I have ever read. There are passages in this book that just make you stop and sit back to think a bit. One that hit me very hard was midway through the book: \\"Pray God some day kind people won't all be poor\\". This line was written in response to the destitute tenant farmers scrabbling for work with nearly no money putting a few coins each on a pile in front of a tent where a little boy had died of malnutrition so that the family could have him buried.Throughout history the American dream has had many speed bumps or as in the case of this novel, barriers. But the spirit of the American people in every instance has overcome all. This is a book about that spirit, nearly broken, but not ever completely. There isn't much that can befall a family that the Joad family did not have to deal with. It's a story of persistence and overcoming all odds without losing your own humanity. When everything is against you and you can still look at the other person as someone in more need, then you will begin to understand what made these people.Seventy years later, this story has as much or more relevance than the period from which it came. The world is absorbing yet another economic crisis. There are many differences between now and the era of the Dust Bowl and Steinbeck brings these to the foreground with his typical prescience.The family unit is front and center in this work. The mother and father were so over matched by the elements of nature, progress and technology and just plain happenstance that every member of the family stepped in and picked up the entire group on their shoulders when it was needed. Looking back at this particular element of the story by way of 2011 makes me think that as a culture, we have lost some of this most fundamental building block of society.As liberal and progressive a thinker as John Steinbeck was in presenting this story, I cannot help but think just how conservative his thinking by today's standards. His use of ostracizing the children at croquet and then using a similar method on adults at the government camp would be thought to be draconian today, but in fact these were commonly used forms of punishment to protect the whole of society from those that wanted to break it down. Are we missing this element in today's society?In The Grapes of Wrath, several years of dust storms and drought have brought on major changes in the way farms and farmland are owed and operated. The big, bad corporations and banks take over the land when the tenant farmers are not able to make their payments. Is today's economic crash much different? Are we substituting housing for farms? How many of those subsequent bankers lost their jobs to a different but very real economic stress in 2008 as many large banks had to downsize and re-organize?The relevance is real, the emotion palpable, and the understanding that it could happen to anyone is scary. Yes, The Grapes of Wrath is as terrific as it is terrifying, real as it is relevant, and is as American as Apple Pie. If you haven't read it before, please do so. Instead of ridiculous demands in our schools to read Great Expectations, The Grapes of Wrath should be the book of choice. There is just so much to be learned from this great book."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"When I first moved to Los Angeles, the majority population was White with fairly large Hispanic and Black minorities. Now the majority population is Hispanic, and I frequently find myself communicating with them in Spanish.Look in any newspaper. All around the world, large masses of people are on the move: Albanians to Italy, Serbs to Hungary, Rwandans to Zaire, Pakistanis and Bangladeshis to Britain, Algerians to France, and so on. Every year, the number of people in refugee camps grows; and the resources of nations are stretched to the limit to accommodate the influx.In America, we've had our own migrations: from the original 13 Colonies to the West, Blacks from the South to Northern industrial cities after World War II, and the Okies to California during the Depression.My point is that Steinbeck's GRAPES OF WRATH discusses a very contemporary phenomenon with compassion and great artistry. His Joad family can just as easily be Mexican \\"Wetbacks\\" looking or a better life in the same places where the Joads went (Arvin, the site of the FSA's Weedpatch Camp, is mostly Chicano today). How Steinbeck, a native Californian, came to side with the Okies against the corporate farmers and their hired deputies, and the townsfolk who supported them, is an interesting story in itself. Suffice it to say that no one was more sympathetic with the plight of the poor than Steinbeck, who at times comes across as an American Gorky.There are other books that show equally great compassion. Steinbeck in this novel, however, rises to heights of poetry he was never to reach again. Tom Joad in this passage explains why he decided to become a labor organizer:\\"Says one time he [Jim Casy, the preacher] went out into the wilderness to find his own soul, an' he foun' he jus' got a little piece of a great big soul. Says a wilderness ain't no good , 'cause his little piece of a soul wasn't no good 'less it was with the rest, an' was whole. Funny how I remember. Didn' think I was even listenin'. But I know now a fella ain't no good alone.\\"There are scenes, such as the description of the progress of a turtle seen by Tom as he walks down the long road home after being paroled, where you see as if in a magnifying glass the progress of untold thousands of farmers fleeing the drought of the Dust Bowl.This is a book which will make you feel different about your fellow man. It takes the side of the hated, misunderstood outsider and sees poetry, goodness, a rough justice, and a tenacity that can move mountains."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"If you are looking for slick plots, witty humour, or fast paced action, don't bother looking here. Steinbeck trancends society's 2 minute attention span to deliver a work so thought provoking, so fundamentally touching and heart-wrenching, that the reader cannot help but ponder its effect long after having put it down.The novel follows the dust bowl migration of the Great Depression, alternating between the desolate struggle of a migrant family - the Joads - and more broad depictions of a people forced to the threshold of human tolerance and survival.The language is especially brilliant. As one less than ecstatic reviewer exclaimed,\\"this book was about dirt, poor people and dirt.\\" Exactly, and one could not craft a more beautiful picture out of such material. The imagery is wonderfully crafted to perpetuate exactly what Steinbeck wanted: gloom, anger, and a paradoxical will to keep faith and move on.\\"Our people are good people; our people are kind people. Pray God some day kind people won't all be poor. Pray God some day a kid can eat. And assosiations of owners knew that some day the praying would stop. And there's the end.\\""},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"Who am I to review one of the greatest literary works of all time? Could I possibly give this book anything less than the maximum rating it so richly deserves? Should I even commence? Those were just some of my private thoughts as I finally put down a copy of this book - read. This is the book which stirred the American conscience, caused political reform and brought about change when first published in 1939. This is the book which described how families were starving to death because of corruption. This is John Steinbeck at his exceptional best. For those people who never got around to reading this engaging and absorbing account of the Joad family, may I suggest you actually purchase a copy (any copy!) and finally read it.Today the world is either in recession or emerging from the dark grip of this latest financial catastrophe. Whilst we may live in a time when millions of families are no longer allowed to starve to death - well, not in the developed world at any rate, I earnestly believe there are lessons to be learned from this book about the rich and powerful who care not for their fellow man but only for personal gain. More importantly, those lessons are as relevant today as they were in 1939.Another similarity also failed to escape my notice; In this book we see how US police and other officials use their positions of authority to threaten and even blackmail the many thousands of American migrants who were simply looking for work in order to feed hungry mouths. These people had not arrived from any foreign country and were not even black - something which would have made their persecution much easier. No!, these ordinary white American folk were honest farmers who had been forcibly evicted from their homes and the land they had worked for generations. Seventy years on, here in the UK, we are besieged by TV programmes depicting our different police forces undertaking their various duties around the country. Yet more cheaply produced \\"reality\\" television! Significantly, however, I have occasionally noticed how some police officers deliberately provoke a hostile situation where exists. Whilst not on the scale portrayed in this outstanding work, it is interesting that I should recognise that underlying attitude of arrogant superiority.Whilst some may find the book slow going at the start, Steinbeck quickly gathers in those loose strands until they suddenly pull together to assume a story, reveal a mental photograph and produce a relevance into which the reader becomes fully immersed. I promptly learned local words and understood the dialect in which they were spoken as the Joad story unfolded. I could hear those southern accents as hardships are endured and explained through the actions of those who lived them. This was the organised, legalised daylight robbery and exploitation of the poor by the rich who were actively supported by the law enforcement agencies. A week's work for 1,000 fruit pickers paying 50 cents an hour is advertised to 3,000 hungry people who then pass on the message. Consequently, 5,000 starving workers arrive in search of that employment. With so much competition, the rate is lowered to 30 cents - take it or leave it! It was a deliberate ploy repeated time after time. Anyone attempting to organise his fellow workers is photographed, black-listed and branded a communist. Now feed that to your children. Then the banks insist the farmers reduced the rate to 25 cents and any landowner who questions that decision is swiftly reminded of his own vulnerability as a mortgagee! In short, either you pay them 25 cents or you join them! My own immediate reaction was to recognise a similarity between then and now - specifically with those modern banking practises which preyed on the sub-prime market. Anyone who cared to consider precisely what \\"sub-prime\\" meant, knew it was a policy destined to fail. And fail it did in spectacular fashion - and yet, the fat cat bankers still draw bonuses based on \\"personal performance\\" and not on their company's overall profit or loss...I note from some of the comments appended to certain editions of this book, that various issues have been produced in which, apparently, Steinbeck's prose are changed to make the work an easier read. Please don't take the easy option, take the version written as it was intended to be read - i.e. the version written by Steinbeck. If not, you cannot claim to have read this book at all - instead you have the equivalent of, say, a Romeo and Juliet story - set in Manhattan in the 21st Century - and there are plenty of those...In closing, I would urge anyone (indeed everyone) who has not already read an original version of this book If to go out and buy a copy - any old copy and then simply read it. Having done that, you too will draw parallels with our modern age and understand what I mean. You will also be richer for having done so - as would those fat cats who, unfortunately, will probably never bother. Having finally finished reading this outstanding work, I wonder how many of you will still be wondering whatever happened to that perfectly matched pair of Bays! I do...NM"},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"It wasn't that this had some exciting story that kept the reader glued to the pages. No shocking climax (although there are a number of shocking events portrayed throughout), no personified villian... none of that.The Grapes of Wrath is phenomenal not for the unforgetable cross-country trek of the Joad family in the post-depression years, but for the essence of humanity which Steinbeck so perfectly captures in every chapter. Steinbeck demonstrates how people who are just barely getting by on what they have sometimes have more to give to their fellow man than the wealthiest citizens our society has to offer. He draws a vivid picture of struggle during hard times for the most disenfanchized Americans, yet shows the emotional side of poverty and disolutionment, and reveals how genuin humanity can often be most prevalent amidst the most inhumane of living conditions.It has been said that Steinbeck had a socialist agenda when he came out with The Grapes of Wrath, but I couldn't disagree more with that assessment. Steinbeck isn't so much jabbing at a political/economic injustice in this novel as he is striking at the lack of humanity that can be brought about when business efficiency and profitability are thought to trump human decency.As I write this review the American financial system is once again in peril, and themes from Steinbeck's The Grapes of Wrath are suddenly becoming more meaningful than they had been when I read this book in high school. I am amazed at how true and applicable Steinbecks points still ring today, and I recomend this book to anyone who hasn't read it in years or who has yet to read it for the first time."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"Steinbeck's &quot;The Grapes of Wrath&quot; is a scathing look at the Dustbowl era, with its mass migration of displaced farmers out of the plains and towards the vague promise of the Californian coast. The chapters of the work alternate between long episodes detailing the journey of the Joad family from Oklahoma to California, and short sections written from a more abstract point-of-view, about characters un-named. Though the work is over six-hundred pages, it roars through your head as fast as any book can, with Steinbeck's fury over the plight of the migrants bursting from every page.I doubt anyone can read this work and not feel pity for the Joads, and the real men and women that Steinbeck drew these characters from. On the other hand, I felt that Steinbeck did not adequately explain the situation from the other side. It too often seems that the troubles of the migrants stem from the greed of some heartless monster, rather than a honest person who has troubles of their own. Sometimes, bad things happen and no one is to blame. Steinbeck seems to forget this.Overall, this is still a classic work of American literature, both for its beautiful prose and intensely important reminder of how things were not all that long ago, and how far we have come since."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"Quite simply, The Grapes of Wrath is THE Great American Novel.This is the powerful story of the Joad family, &quot;Okies&quot; who are forced from their bank-foreclosed farm during the depression.John Steinbeck's writing is sheer literary art. There is beautiful description, incredibly realistic dialogue, and a compelling story that captures the heart and seeks out the very core of one's conscious. And the beauty of it is that it's thoroughly understandable. The eloquent writing and flawless story can be savored by anyone from a junior high school student to a PhD.The book is also innovative, intertwining short chapters that capture the plight of the dispossessed with longer chapters that follow the long road traveled by the Joad family to California. This is accomplished without at all disrupting the flow of the story.No wonder that this book won the Pulitzer Prize and was the key work cited for Mr. Steinbeck's Nobel Prize.It's a mighty piece of literature."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"This is one of the few works of fiction that is truly heart-wretching, that is capable of bringing people to tears. Not only that, but although it is a work of fiction, it is a truly believeable story, and not only COULD it happen, but it DID, many times over. Many families went along a similar route to the Joads during the depression and the Dust Bowl. That is why this book leaves such a profound impact on people, it tells us a little bit more about ourselves than we maybe want to know.Being from Oklahoma, this story really hit home for me. There is a part where the Joads are trying to head North, away from Hooverville, and they are stopped, the policeman tells Tom &quot;We don't want you goddamn Okies here&quot;. Tom wants to hit the man with a jack, but Ma won't let him, and he, stone cold Tom Joad, cries. This is a moving scene, and there are many such ones in the book. This is highly reccommended.Also, DO NOT READ THE EDITORIAL REVIEW AT THE TOP OF THIS PAGE OR THE INTRO AT THE FRONT OF THE BOOK IF YOU HAVE NOT ALREADY, THEY GIVE AWAY THE ENDING, AND A LOT OF OTHER THINGS TOO!"},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"This book is as wonderful to read now as it was when I stumbled across it some 20 odd years ago.If you want to experience what Wilco, Woodie Guthrie, Pete Seeger and others were singing about, this book will bring it all to life through Steinbeck's timeless words. Steinbeck makes the life of migrant farm workers come alive for us, while revealing the prejudices they were up against in the 30's.Sadly, it is timely because it seems to be part of human nature to separate ourselves from those who are in need. If we can convince ourselves that our own wants, needs, desires are different, or that we are more deserving, we can rest assured that nothing bad will come our way.A thick juicy book, with every word necessary and perfectly placed."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"I must have read Steinbeck's &quot;Grapes of Wrath&quot; a half dozen times since I first picked it up as a high school student. The story of the ongoing hope and determination of the displaced migrants, pitted against the disdainful land-owners, highlights a 20th century conflict between traditional values of inherent virtue and the interests of business, economic efficiency, and the profit-seeking wealthy. The first few times I read this story, I saw only a tract that promotes centralized state authority and socialist constructs as a solution to injustice and poverty, as also appears in Upton Sinclair's &quot;The Jungle&quot;. In my later years, however, I have seen Steinbeck's prophecy against the hypocrisy of those who would call themselves &quot;Christian&quot; and &quot;righteous&quot;, then ignore the essential tenets of their faith to serve their own interests, the minute they've left church on Sunday. The book continues to speak to our own age, when the well-to-do in the &quot;winner-take-all&quot; competition of the modern marketplace find it all too convenient to neglect the poor that remain. Although history has since proven the value of a free-market economy, its &quot;winners&quot; are just as human as its &quot;losers&quot;, and cannot in good conscience brush them aside, discounting them as products of their own failings."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"Oddly, I first read John Steinbeck's classic tale of the 1930's depression, Grapes of Wrath, as a result of listening to Woody Guthrie's also classic Dustbowl Ballads. In that album Woody sings/narrates the trials and tribulations of the Joad family as they get the hell out of drought-stricken Oklahoma and headed for the land of milk and honey in California. After listening to that rendition I wanted to get the full story and Steinbeck did not fail me. His tightly-woven story stands as a very strong exposition of the plight of rural America as they tried to make sense of a vengeful God, unrelenting Nature and the down-side of the American dream. For those who have seem Walker Evans's and other photographers pictures of the Okies, Arkies, etc. of the period this is the story behind those forlorn, if stoic, faces.The story line is actually very simple. The land in Oklahoma was played out, the banks nevertheless were pressing for payment or threatening foreclosure and for the Joads, as for others, time had run out. In classic American tradition they pulled up stakes and headed west to get a new start. With great hopes and no few illusions they set out as a family for the sunny and plentiful California of their dreams. Their struggle along the way is a modern day version of the struggles of the old Westward heading wagon trains-including the causalities. But, that is not the least of it. Apparently they had not read Frederick Jackson Turner's thesis that the frontier was gone- the land was taken. The bulk of the story centers of what happened when they get to the golden land-and it is not pretty. Day labor, work camps, strike action, murder, and mayhem-you know, California, the real California of the day. Not the Chamber of Commerce version. In short, as Woody sang, no hope if you aint got the do re mi.Grapes of Wrath was made into a starkly beautiful film starring a young Henry Fonda as Tom Joad. On a day when you are not depressed it is a film you want to see, if only for the photography. So here is the list. Listen to Woody sing the tale. Watch Henry Fonda to act it out. And by all means read Steinbeck. He had an ear for the 1930's struggle of the Okies and their ilk as they hit California. What happened to those people later and their influence on California culture and those who didn't make it are chronicled by others like Howard Fast and Nelson Algren. But for this period your man is Steinbeck."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"You have to read this book. It has been one of my favorites for the last 10 years and I often re-read it.While the Joad's story is definitely moving, I think the best parts of the book come from the narratives between the Joads story.Most people look at this book as a history of the Great Depression and how it affected the Dust Bowl in the 1930's in terms of the Joad family. I hope that people can remove themselves from the Joad story long enough to realize that Steinbeck's narratives exemplify the history of EVERY CLASS STRUGGLE THAT HAS EVER BEEN.Anyone who has ever studied revolutionist theory, be it the American Revolution, Civil Rights, Women's Right's, Gay rights, etc. cannot NOT appreciate the insights that John Steinbeck gives in the alternate chapters. It is unfortunate that most people won't bother to read this book because,a. it's a classic, and classic means \\"boring\\" andb. it may be about a group of people that are not at all interesting to them.As an Black-American, I see the looks of people when I say this is one of my favorite books (along with \\"Great Expectations\\" but that is just because Estella is a the kind of woman I admire), especially among other Black-Americans. I mean, who cares, we have CURRENT struggles in our midst. But to not read this book would be a mistake. This book is very relevant to what we currently face. And with the current immigrant situation, I would HIGHLY recommend this book to anyone illegally in American as well. This book is not about just the dust bowl in the late 1930's, it's about being strong in the face of adversity. It's about going when there is nothing left. It's about coming together for survival. It's about what causes change.Many people won't care about the Joads (although I don't know how you cannot - if Ma Joad doesn't remind you of the stereotypical strong black grandmother holding the family together - I don't know what does). But even if you don't, you can at least read the narrative chapters.Particular chapter favorites are:If you are not moved by the words in the above mentioned chapters, then you have never been on the other side of \\"the right\\""},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"A thousand years from now this book book will be in the Bible, like Job. ... If you're a high school student forced to read this for a class, forget it. It won't mean a thing to you. But if you have children and parents dependent on you, only a paycheck away from disaster month after month, this book will resonate with your rage."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"After FINALLY completing the book, I realized that I did enjoy the themes Steinbeck illustrated. However, it did bother me that there was an entire chapter dedicated to the trials and tribulations of a turtle. It made a good point, but it was so long. And how long can one go on about dust? I realize it's the dustbowl, but some of Steinbeck's descriptions are a bit excessive. If you are required to read it, as many high school students are, enjoy it's themes, but don't leave reading the 600 page book to the last minute."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"In view of the Occupy movement and the tremendous number of citizens who have lost homes as a result of the greed of Bankers like Angelo Mozillo who never went to jail, the issues raised by Steinbeck seem very pertinent in 2013, almost as much as in 1939 when he published the book. It is true that there are more safety nets now for people, though some in our country are trying to get rid of these. As a result of the social legislation of the 1930's there is unemployment compensation, aid to dependent children, protection of an individual's assets in banks that fail. Why would our legislators want to allow these to disappear to save a few bucks when they continue to rent public lands for exploration to huge pick companies @$5.00 an acre, same with mining rights to mining companies, depriving the US government from receiving justified revenue, no royalty rights???"},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"I have mixed feelings on how to rate this book. The reality of it and the way it follows the depression are excellent. I give it a five on accuracy and detail. BUT.... I really believe it's only worth reading it if you don't mind horrible, depressing, sad endings. I was very dissapointed. I felt like I was reading a history book instead of a reading book because for me, a book I'm reading for fun, should at least have a satisfing, if not happy, ending. In history books anything bad can happen and in this case it did. The situation in the end was hopless."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"Let me preface this review by saying that I absolutely LOVE Steinbeck. I would consider him one of my five favorite authors. I think East of Eden is one of my favorite books of all time. I especially like Cannery Row and Tortilla Flat. I even liked The Wayward Bus.HOWEVER, having said that, I must say that I cannot handle The Grapes of Wrath. My tolerance for pain is not nearly high enough. I have to be honest - I've never actually read the entire book. It's much to difficult to read through the tears in my eyes. I am sure that it is, like most of his other novels, a well-written, fascinating account of the lives of some very interesting people. I simply cannot willingly subject myself to such abject despair. I read novels for enjoyment, and I don't enjoy the feeling of having my heart pulled apart piece by piece, page by page.Undoubtedly it is to Steinbeck's great credit that he is able to draw that kind of emotion out of a person through simple words on a page. Only one or two books have ever been able to move me in that way. Unfortunately, it is not a feeling I desire. Perhaps I'm overly sensitive. The book made me want to open up a vein, but apparently millions of people loved it..."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"In Steinbeck's novel \\"The Grapes of Wrath\\", readers are introduced to the Joad family in their miserable living conditions in Oklahoma and their dreams of a new and better life in California. All thirteen Joads pack up in one old truck and begin their journey on Highway 66 to California along with thousands of other families looking for any work. Their trip take them through the loss of five of their passengers for various reasons, bullying from cops, threats of starvation and no money, and even the death of their dog. Yet, there is some sunshine as they meet up with another family halfway through who become their travel mates for a while. As the Joads enter California, they eventually find refuge at a government camp for migrant families looking for work. However, their luck is minimal as they know they can't stay and continue on, looking for better work and wages. This brings them to their last stop in the novel which isn't any better than the last few. Steinbeck leaves the readers almost wishing they hadn't even read the book, because there is no solitude for either the Joads or the readers.I gave this novel two stars, because it did not appeal to me. The story itself was depressing; it starts out sad, gets worse, and ends even more sad than it started. The bad plot doesn't make the novel any better, either. The book is literally just about a family riding in a car, looking for work. Another big factor was the writing style. I don't know if this novel is an example of all of Steinback's writing, but only half the novel was actually about the Joad family. The chapters alternated between the Joad family story and a story about migrants in general. This approach wasn't appealing. I found the book to have a very slow start, and once it started moving along, the chapters about the migrants just seemed to be in the way, prolonging the story for nothing. I wouldn't recommend this book, unless you're a fan of Steinbeck."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"i'm very happy with this product. it shipped super fast, the book is in great shape. now on to reading!"},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"No problems with the book - great story.My issue is with the description of the condition of my copy which was purchased as a used book - this was listed as \\"Very Good\\" condition - which to me means some minor creasing on the spine and maybe a couple of minor marks on the pages.

I read The Grapes of Wrath in 8th grade for &quot;fun&quot; and re-read it this year for summer reading (i'm 16) and wasn't too fond of the book either time. I'm probably going to be lumped into the category of &quot;all the high schoolers who read it for english and didn't like it because their generation has attention-span problems,&quot; but, frankly, that's not true. I've read and loved such wordy books as The Scarlet Letter, each of Umberto Eco's tomes (essays indcluded), The Great Political Theories (volumes one and two, no less), among others.The Grapes of Wrath, though, was just boring. It's sort of like an old-school Saving Private Ryan - let's beat into our readers'/watchers' heads the horrors of a terrible time in our history. What comes from this are preachy stories without base because, ultimately, we realize they are fictional. There was no Tom Joad or Private Ryan. The Depression existed, yes, but none of these characters did.Why should this make a difference? The story is fiction, after all, right? The difference is that Steinbeck, as in almost all of his mediocre books, tries to make us, through deathly boring descriptions and symbols, that his characters really existed. Oh well. I guess people are going to keep on reading this, so what I say here doesn't really matter. Read it once, and regret you ever did."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"The Grapes of Wrath may be to many people a triumph of American storytelling, but I found it to very stale and overwrought. This may be due solely to the fact that I do not enjoy Steinbeck's writing style, but I think it is also because he pushes the story to the limit, and in essence milks all of the entertaining qualities of his characters to death way before the story is over.While the Grapes of Wrath has several 'nuggets' of brilliance (my favorite one involving a Native American chief), they are so swamped in boring sub-plots and narratives that switch back and forth that the novel can hardly be considered a masterpiece. By the end of the 619 pages you hardly care what happens to the Joad family, just as long as the darn thing is over with.In short, while I hate to discourage those who think this book is a triumph of 'American perseverance', I have to say that if you really want to know about the Dust Bowl (which is actually a fascinating period in history) read a history book, not this novel."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"This was of course, wonderful"},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"I'll give you good advice when deciding to buy this book : DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK.

It was also very hard to get in to. After I figured out how the Steinbeck was writing the novel, it became a bit easier. I thought that the Joad chapters were too long and could have been broken down to read easier. As a lover of historical/fiction, I thought this was a bad book because, although it portrayed an accurate storyline, it was just not written well. I would not suggest this book to anyone who does not have to read it."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"Sorry Mr. Steinbeck. I didn't like this one. I had to read this book for my AP English class. Now you may think, since I am a teenager, I think all classics are bad. NOT TRUE. I read a lot of plays (I LOVE the Glass Menagerie) and I've just started Allen Ginsberg's autobio. However, I HATE HATE HATE this book!Let me tell you why. First of all, these poor people have SUCH BAD LUCK. I mean, you'd think that at least one good thing would happen to them within the entire novel. Not so. I mean, if this book were just a hundred pages longer, all of them would be dead. Also, Steinbeck managed to kill off the two best characters in the entire book: Grandma and Grandpa, while Rose of Sharon, possibly the most annoying character I have ever read about, remains alive and whining till the dreadful end. Also, Steinbeck uses a lot of sexual references that are kind of weird and not very enjoyable. For example, he talks about the tractors &quot;raping&quot; the land. Lastly, you'd think Steinbeck is an insane guy or something because whenever something gross happens he really gets into describing it somewhat graphically. He spends a good amount of the book describing, in great detail, a pig eating a baby, cleaning a dead rabbit, and a dead dog squashed flat on the ground."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"I am a Junior in High School and am instinctually drawn to literature. This novel was a required reading, but that didn't spoil the story for me. The story did that itself. I have never been so bored in my life. Honestly, I'm astounded to find that so many people \\"loved\\" this book. While the story did have a great moral to go along with it, it was about dirt! Dirt and migrating. Dirt and migrating and more dirt. I couldn't even sit down to read it for more than 15 minutes before dozing off. What an awful summer read. I even think I chucked it out the balcony once.

I would recommend gum surgery over this book."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"I had to read this book this summer, and I am lucky that I got through it. It has no climax and no plot twists. Nothing to keep the reader intrested in the book. It just goes on and on.

He must be stupid to think that we don't know about what's going on during the trip to Oklahoma.

I really liked certain passages and the theme, but much of it was told in such an obtuse way and focused on such minute details that I could hardly stand it. I've read books on genetics, i.e. no plot, no characters, that held my attention far better and used words more economically than The Grapes of Wrath. Perhaps if the novel had ended 400 pages or so before it actually did, I could have stomached it better."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"The Grapes of Wrath is 619 pages of complete boredom. I am reading this over the summer for my 10th grade English class that I soon will be attending on an everyday basis once school starts. In my opinion this book is too wordy and boring. They could take this 619 page book and cut it down to about 150 pages if they wanted to. I believe that no high school student should suffer the extreme pain and boredom of reading this book. My advice to any high school student who has to read this book is get it on audio tape and fast forward through most of it you wont miss much, only a bunch of useless dialogue!"},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"The Grapes of Wrath was I great book in my opinion. It's the story of Tom Joad, out of prison and finds that his family is moving because they will push their house over because they cant afford it. Tom meets a former preacher Jim Casy and finds his parents. They head over to California picking up the Wilsons. This book showed me the Depression better than any history book could. I like the message it sent. I lke the former preacher's message of we can only believe in each other. And of course you probably know the famous speech from Tom Joad (...I'll be there&quot;). It was great, I read it during winter break of 2001-2002 in a week. Not at all boring in my opinion."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"Beyond the Depression-era stereotypes often presumed from Steinbeck's classic are the values stemming from the Everyman nature of Tom Joad's plight.What Tom Joad faced is what we face each day.Joad might be seen as just an Okie looking to make it another day beyond dust and grime. Instead, once the dust blows away, we have post-Depression Oklahoma, and WWII, and today.The struggle of Joad is not just his struggle in a hard time, but the same perseverence through adversity faced by Carl Sandburg's characters in his &quot;Chicago Poems,&quot; in Dicken's &quot;Bleak House&quot; and in Billy Joel's song, &quot;Allentown.&quot; Tough times are universal, no matter the environment.Complex situations wrought hard decisions by Joad and his family. In these contexts, things seemed complex and heart-breaking --- and they were -- but no less are our difficulties today. Hence, Steinbeck's book is transcendent of his time and culture, and worthy of reading today.Beautifully... deliciously written, &quot;The Grapes of Wrath&quot; will likely captivate you through each page.I fully recommend this book.Anthony Trendl"},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"I am reading this book for school and it is the only book I have ever read for school that didnt bore me to death.

This seminal work transcends the fictional construction of it's impoverished family, as they suffer the loss of their elders on the journey to the promised land of migrant laborers, only to find their hopes dashed in the dwindling labor markets, and mounting hatred of California's equally impoverished population. This is Steinbeck's greatest creation, and a telling piece of Americana which affirms the indomitable spirit of those who experienced the worst era in modern history."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"That THE GRAPES OF WRATH is a timeless classic is not news. It is one of those rare books that was recognized as genius from its initial publication and it has endured in popularity to this day. A staple of high school required reading lists, John Steinbeck's tale of displaced Okies hits the reader on so many levels that it bears repeated reading. The dialogue sparkles with depth and emotion.For those who are only familiar with THE GRAPES OF WRATH through the splendid movie with Henry Fonda, the book opens up even more vistas and provides a compelling view of Depression-era America. Through the eyes of Americans in a time of traumatic transition, John Steinbeck paints a lasting portrait of our culture and heritage."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"The Grapes of Wrath is a sobering account of the lives of a midwesterner family that takes place barely fifty years ago. What's even more sobering about it is that the general events in this story are true!Meet the Joad family --a hardworking Oklahomian family living happily on the farm they have lived on for years. *BAM* the Dust Bowl strikes and they are forced to sell their assets at a ridiculously low price and buy a cheap jalopy for a price twice as high as it should be. So this family does what most any families would have done if they were in this sort of situation: move to California, a place that promises great riches and prosperity. But when they get there, it quite the opposite (I don't want to give much away after this point).Really, everybody ought to read this classic. We must do everything we can to keep this part of American history from repeating itself.A great book on all accounts with great dialogue and a well-constructed storyline. A must read!"},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"This is one of the most enduring books i have ever read. The message Steinbeck was attempting to portray is just as relevant now as it was in the time the book was written. Discrimination and hardship still exists today even in this 'developed' part of the world' But, this book is more than a historic tale of suffering. It is a gripping, thought provoking and at times heart warming tale. Whilst the Joads are dealt blow after blow, the family stays together because that is all they have...quiet a lesson.

Tom- what a hunk! grapes was a good book."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"First let me say I'm a Steinbeck fan. I love the majority of his work.Also, I'm writing this review before I do research on this book. I have just finished reading it, so my opinion is fresh and mine only. It has not been influenced by what others think. I do plan on reading a great many summaries and opinions from great thinkers to try and find out why people generally think this is such a great book.I like Steinbecks ability to demonstrate the human spirit in this book. What I do not like about this book is that it starts off with bad things happening to folks and it just goes downhill for these folks all the way, getting worse off the whole time, till the end when they are as bad off as they can get. People dying left & right, thrown in jail, everyone who already lives in California are mean, pregnant woman can't get enough food, kids starve, no more work for three months, river floods, baby dies, etc. This is the most depressing book I think I've ever read. And where is the plot? There isn't one. This book could have been written in one chapter, but John drags us through this misery over and over again, round and round. This book is a statement, that's for sure. Maybe everyone thinks it's so great because it is a great statement. I do believe that later in John's life he regretted writing this book, or at least wished that he had written it differently. I have read online that this book is still banned in certain places of this country. That is wrong. I don't feel that way. I don't like the book, but I think anyone that wants to read it should be able to read it (I warn you it's depressing and a waste of time!) It's not the politics of this book that I don't like. To me, there were no surprises. None. Not like \\"Of Mice And Men\\" or \\"East Of Eden\\" or other fine books I've read by Steinbeck. Still, if your a Steinbeck fan, you must read this book. If you've read his bio you must read \\"Grapes Of Wrath\\" to understand why Californians hated him so much. In a way I feel I have to apologize for not liking this book. One friend of mine who is an avid reader told me he didn't really care for Steinbeck novels, but he loved \\"Grapes Of Wrath\\". Go figure."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"The difficult lives of the Joad family during the Great Depression of the 1930's are very relevant to the America of today. The transition of the 1930's economy in the Midwest to mechanization is similar to the current transitional economy in the U.S., where we are moving from manufacturing to more of a tech base. We are moving away from what we know to something we don't know, and people are not sure what to do or what to make of it.I have loved the Steinbeck books I have read up to this point (Travels With Charley, Of Mice and Men, Tortilla Flat, and Cannery Row), but Grapes is much too one sided for me. In typical Steinbeck fashion he puts you right into the story, but he paints with much too broad a brush here. It is slanted, and does not give equal time to both sides. The bad is too bad and the good is too good. Steinbeck seems to leave out a basic understanding of economics, perhaps intentionally, and I'm afraid lots of people just swallow the anti-corporate message without thinking. Some think companies are an unending fountain of money. They are not. Education is the problem, as it was then and continues to be.The Grapes of Wrath brought to light many things that needed changing in the United States of the 1930's, and for that I give it credit. Illegal monopolies, unfair labor practices, corrupt local officials, etc. are all effectively criticized here by Steinbeck. The immigrating Joads, as legal U.S. citizens, have rights as citizens which should be protected.The character of Al, one of the Joad's sons, is a bright spot. Al is changing and embracing the future by learning to work on cars, even after the mechanization has forced the Joads out of their sharecropped farm. The Great Depression forced people to move and to change, developing new skills as the economy changed. Al's forward-thinking adaptation made me wonder if the government relief mentioned in the book simply enables people to sit right where they are when things change and simply cash a government check each month, draining society instead of adapting to the change and contributing to the new economy in a positive way. I am afraid this type of thinking so prevalent in modern society is teaching people to become dependent on the government (in exchange for votes) instead of going out and making their own opportunities.While reading The Grapes of Wrath I lost patience with Steinbeck's rhetoric in which corporations and the wealthy got that way by unjustly taking advantage of others. Even small businesses (restaurants, stores, gas stations, etc.) in the book are treated with contempt. Small businesses create jobs. Large corporations create jobs. Individuals who gamble their family's security and future by starting their own businesses create jobs. These are positive forces in the economy. The Government taking money away from these positive forces is a drain, which must be justified in one way or another.At times the Joad family is starving, but they balk at working for wages they deem are too low. You do what you have to do however, and the Joads end up working and eating. Companies don't get ahead by cheating people for very long, and The Grapes of Wrath effectively illustrates the labor abuses of that time. Reforms were made and things eventually got better for the workers as well as for the economy as a whole. It is how the Free Market works, for better or worse. The real challenge lies in dealing with the transitional economy and figuring out how to prosper in it. It is a cycle, and The Grapes of Wrath is timely today because we are in that same type of economic cycle in the U.S. right now. Rather than looking to The Grapes of Wrath for answers, however, maybe we should look to it instead to learn from our past mistakes."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"After reading this book I found my own life looking much better.

The dust bowl was brought on by poor planning by poorlyeducated individuals, as is demonstrated by this finely crafted novel which allows the reader to follow closely the lives of many members of the Joad family and their traveling companions without the emotional involvement obtained by many novelists. Steinbeck did this for a reason; he wanted us to come away from the story able to see &quot;the big picture&quot; and managed this by layering in observational chapters between chapters of the Joad's travels. The Used Car Salesmen interchapter is a real eyeful and the allegorical adventures of the Joads and Jim Casy will resonate in today's violent world of haves and have nots.

I found this story to be a page-turner and very absorbing. Excellent local color and superb character development. You know, I think today's younger generation could take a few lessons from this story - the stocism these people demonstrated throughout their ordeal was fascinating. The simply did what they had to do and only complained periodically (with exception of Rosasharn - who bitched and whined all the time). This is also a great review of a bleak period in American history.My advice to people who haven't read it is: by all means, read it, learn something about history and the human spirit.Now for the oddities:1. Maybe this was symbolic and I just glossed over it, but several times in the book, drivers (including the protagonists) are squashing with their vehicles animals who have the misfortune of using or crossing the road they use. Well, that was kind of strange I thought.2. Why Connie left Rosasharn is sort of a mystery. She was pregnant for crying out loud. Was her constant carping about her wanting a house and nice things just driving him bug-s---?3. Noah left and was never heard from again. I suppose you could argue that this was symbolic of a family disintegrating and how they dealt with it.4. Now the really odd thing. It ended at a weird spot. Not much closure. I had to check to make sure pages weren't torn out of this old paperback. Wonder if other reviewers thought that was kind of dissatisfying....?"},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"The 1930s was a valley of despair as dictators arose in Europe; the Great Depression weakened America and the Dust Bowl and other ecological disasters swept across the southwestern states.John Steinbeck (1902-68) wrote \\"The Grapes of Wrath\\" telling the story of the migrant workers hegira from their Oklahoma and neighboring states homes westward to the California orange and cotton fields. In this remarkable novel we travel, suffer, laugh, cry, mourn and endure with the Joad family of Sallisaw, Oklahoma. The 455 page Penguin edition is nicely edited including footnotes and a useful introduction and bibliography of books about the novel and its author John Steinbeck.The Joads are forced to leave their home following a bank foreclosure. They decide to travel to California based on a handbill promising good jobs in the golden state. They ruefully discover that this is a false promise to induce hundreds of thousands to travel west so that the owners won't have to pay the workers a decent wage. The journey is analogous to the Hebrews slaves escape from Egyptian captivity as they sought out the Promised Land under the leadership of Moses in the bibilcal book of Exodus. Consider the affinities:1. 12 persons are in the Joad party as there were 12 tribes of Israel.2. The elderly grandparents grandpa and grandma Joad die before California is reached; similar to the death of Moses on Mount Horeb and the death of the exodus generation before Israel was settled.3. Water and the crossing of rivers is important in both Exodus and The Grapes of Wrath.The book has many memorable characters:Rose of Sharon-This Joad young woman is deserted by her husband Connie while she is pregnant. In the last unforgettable scene of the book she gives her breast filled with milk to a starving vagrant in a dank barn.Noah Joad is a mentally damaged Joad son who decides to stay by a river and fish instead of moving west with the family.Al Joad is the youngest Joad brother. He chases girls in all the camps the family stays in and keeps the beat up truck going down the road. As the novel ends he is engaged to be married to a fellow migrant girl of 16.The book abounds in minor characters which range from a determined turtle eager to reach his destination (much like the Joads are eager to reach the Golden State); slutty waitresses, burly truck drivers and fellow migrants suffering the slings and arrows of Depression era poverty. The language in The Grapes of Wrath is graphic, profane and based on the ungrammatical speech of poorly educated country people.The novel's title \\"The Grapes of Wrath\\" is taken from the second line of Julia Ward Howe's \\"The Battle Hymn of the Republic.\\" The book is a battle cry for justice to the poor migrants of the 1930's. \\"The Grapes of Wrath\\" is still a controversial novel since its publication in 1939. Interpretations and critical judgments vary. Read the book and decide for yourself! This is a great American classic every literate person should peruse. Outstanding in its gritty reality and compassion for the suffering multitudes!4. A dead baby is placed in a box and floats down a river in The Grapes of Wrath reminding one of Moses in the bullrushes.5. Natural disaster in The Grapes of Wrath are reminiscent of the plagues of Egypt in Exodus such as drought, floods and disease.There are other biblical resonances. Jim Casey (his initials are the same as Jesus Christ) is murdered by a mob for defending the poor and weak as Jesus was crucified on the cross. Tom Joad is a doubting Thomas figure and Uncle John with his insistence on sin reminds us of John the Baptist.The book is filled with memorable characters:Tom Joad-the prodigal son who murders a man in a fight and is sent to prison; later he will kill again in defense of Jim Casey. Tom was played with brilliance by Henry Fonda in the John Ford classic film \\"The Grapes of Wrath.\\"Ma Joad is the matriarch of the family. Tough and sentimental she holds the family together.Rose of Sharon-Deserted by her husband Connie she is pregnant. In the last unforgettable scene of the book she will give her breast to a man who is starving and needs milk.Ruthie and her brother are children.Noah is a mentally deficient Joad who leaves the family to live by a river.Tom Joad Sr. is somewhat weak and defers to Ma Joad in family decisions.Al is the young hot pants brother of Tom and Noah who is a good driver and keeps the truck going which transports the family to California.There are many memorable minor characters; destitute families, waitresses at the diners on the road; animals such as the turtle who symbolizes the determination of the Joads to cross the road and move forward; dogs and the animals of the night. The book is also exquisite in its portrait of the American landscape in the hardscrabble years of the 1930s. Steinbeck is a genius at reproducing how poor Americans talked at this time. The language is ungrammatical and laced with profanity and folk wisdom.The best place the Joads were able to stay was the Weedpatch federal camp based on one Steinbeck visited. The novel takes its title from Julia Ward Howe's \\"The Battle Hymn of the Republic.\\" This book is a battle cry for justice for the poor and the need for Americans to work together to restore dignity and hope to the millions who were devastated by economic hard times.The Grapes of Wrath is a controversial novel with many interpretations being offered. Every American needs to read this book; decide for yourself and read this essential novel of the American experience by a great author!You will never forget \\"The Grapes of Wrath.\\""},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"Simply the greatest American novel ever written, which can only be rivaled by Nabokov's Lolita.Steinbeck captured the voice of the American people, in despair and in hope. A social commentary to be read again and again, as it is as relevant in its observations today, as when it was written, some 70 odd years ago."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"It seems to me that whenever I come across a review on this website titled \\"An honest student's review\\" or something along those lines, the sentances \\"This book was so boring\\",\\"I was forced to read it\\" and \\"I can't beleive this is considered a classic\\" always pop up, with \\"If I could give this zero stars I would\\" always present at the end of the review. I, however, although a student and \\"forced\\" to read this book, beleive this novel, by John Steinbeck, to be a true classic of American literature. There are many other reviews below that give a far more indepth plot summary, so I will keep that portion of the reveiw succinct. The Joad family, suffering from the Dust Bowl and the Great Depression, strap as many of their possesions as they can to their car and head west to the purported paradise of California. However, they find their paradise to be little more than a dystopia, run by the few plutocrats who have managed to stay afloat in the depression by standing on the shoulders of those below them. Steinbeck is nothing short of a master here, splicing \\"intercalaries\\" of heartbreaking human suffering into the Joad's comparable tale of woe and misery. This juxtaposition shows the extent of which the poverty and despair has blighted half a nation of farmers.Anyone who wishes to truly understand the human condition, its depths and its misery, should read this book. However, it should be noted that anyone looking for an uplifting tale of human tenacity should perhaps look elsewhere, for this novel is unrelenting in its depiction of destruction and despair.If I could give it 10 stars I would"},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"What a great novel...i wasn't much of a reader in high school, but now that i have a child, i thought it best to see what i missed. Boy, did I miss! If you have to pick one &quot;classic&quot; novel to read, this is a don't miss. Now I see why classics are called classics."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"I got caught shoplifting makeup when I was thirteen. I waited for my mom to come to the store after security called her, imagining the anger she'd have in her face when she saw me and feeling shame, shame, shame. I didn't cry until she walked into the office and burst into tears, herself! Then I did, too. And on the way home, as I sobbed, she said things like, \\"I know, I know,\\" and \\"Shh...\\" Then she bought me a pineapple softserve ice cream cone at a drive-thru Mexican restaurant and took me home, where I laid in bed waiting for the sound of my dad's diesel engine and my impending doom.I thought of that while reading this book because Ma Joad, the strongest character I've met in a Steinbeck story, would tell her kids or her husband to hush when they started doubting themselves and their choices. She'd say something like, \\"Of course you did what you could! We all did. Everybody did what they could, so hush now, and peel these potatoes. Your pa and brothers need to eat!\\" Even her son who had killed somebody (in self-defense) was given a full pardon by Ma and told to just hush up about it! Of course you didn't put shame on the family! You did yer time, now hush!So, scrawny Ruthie Joad goes and tells a whopper of a family secret that changes things for everybody and puts an instant fear into the whole clan, including Ma, who gets wind of it from little Winfield. And Winfield says, hopefully, \\"Gonna whup her, Ma?\\" But no. She orders everyone to be quiet about it to Ruthie and not make her feel worse than she already does. When Ruthie shows up, she runs to her ma's middle and screams and cries into her belly. Ma knew, of course. Nobody can punish a person like him or herself. Just read the book and look at Uncle John, and you'll know it, too.Now, this book is not historical fiction--it's fiction from history. John Steinbeck wrote this book while all of the labor injustice was happening. Effigies of Steinbeck were burned all over California in protest over this revealing saga! He grew up in Salinas, well off, but idealistic. He spent his school vacations working in fields and on farms and listening, listening, listening to people's stories. He felt love and empathy for these people. He saw it as another Civil War for our country, but this time between the \\"haves\\" and the \\"have nots,\\" which is why he used a phrase from a Civil War ballad as his title.Books about injustice and upheaval make me feel so anxious because they make me look at myself. My students read books about Martin Luther King, Jr., or Rosa Parks, and they feel empowered. They say really lofty things about justice and rights and humanity and what was wrong, and what they would do. And I'm glad to hear them talk like that, but I get anxious during this sort of talk, too. I don't think I'd have been the one to stand up against anything. If I were there, I wouldn't have been picketing, facing violence! I'd have been hiding in my cabin, wishing everyone else would just go back to their cabins and work and stop causing trouble. People are likely to get their heads smashed in when they stand against power. And thank the Lord (Ma Joad's Lord, please, not Rosasharn's or Uncle John's) that there are people who will. Okay, enough about me and how I am no hero. It makes me feel squirmy.Though, maybe I'll find my cause. There was one thing that got to Ma Joad enough to shame her kids, and that was selfishness or self-pity. \\"It's not all about you, Rosasharn,\\" she says to her pregnant daughter. She tells her that if she were well and not with child, she'd give her a whop in the face for all that self-pity. She wanted her to understand that you can't be self-serving! You've got to give even when you've got nothing! And Rosasharn learned that lesson. I learned that she had in one of the most beautiful paragraphs I will ever read."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"This book was one I read over summer because of the length of it. Its a revealing story that depicts true poverty and the struggle for survival. Steinback does an extraordinary job on giving us a glimpse of what life would be like if jobs and food was limited. It was shocking to see what people were willing to accept for a hard day's work. Families were broken up , children were starved and put to work, it was really demoralizing. This book was basically the struggles of a family in the 1930's to make it to the West where &quot;work was plentiful&quot; , but later discover that things are not how they pictured them. It was a great book but it was a little lengthy."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"The Great Depression and the 'Dust Bowl', two of the worst disasters to strike our nation in the last hundred years. The author, John Steinbeck, takes a chance at creating a story to properly convey the story of millions of migrant farmers kicked off their land during this period in the 1930s. He succeeded through the Joad family. Trying to create a new and better life, the Joads leave their Oklahoma home and travel to the land of promise, California. The travel to and throughout the state provides the perfect setting for a story of the terrible injustices and obstacles that migrant workers of the time faced. The main problem that many will have with the novel is the pacing of the story for the first 20 or so chapters. Not without its bright spots, the first chapters although good, can be terribly slow. It took much willpower to keep reading this classic. Another contributing factor is Steinbeck's intermittent chapters, through which he giving a sort of social commentary. The chapters seem to take away from the story by destroying the pacing of the novel. Although these two characteristics didn't suit me, I am glad that I kept reading. The book is a surefire classic. While in some places overly symbolic, the novel tells such a great story, and is told in such a fashion, that you can't help but sit and think after reading the last words. I am writting this review directly after that period of thinking. I strongly recommend this book to anyone willing to think. And to dig deeply into their minds and souls to review what images and feelings that the book has imposed on them. I am a freshman in high school and the book is required reading for my class. The sad thing is that this wonderful story is lost on many of my classmates.

I am not a high school student who hated the interculary chapters (some of which were the best ones in the book...especially the one about fermenting anger). My biggest problem with this book is that Steinbeck simply takes it too seriously. The symbolism (through characters and otherwise) and life metaphors are so blatantly obvious that it leaves nothing to the imagination. Symbolism and cultural criticism works better when it's subtle and veiled behind, oh, I don't know, a plot. Yes, GoW did have a plot, just not an interesting one. It was a midly engaging story with occasional interesting points, but there were no plot twists. However, much more sadder than Steinbeck's storytelling is the reviewer who said &quot;I'll stick to Michael Chrichton.&quot; That is really, really sad. I hope they keep shoving this book down high school kids' throats if it keeps them from reading spoon-fed media hyped pulp fiction. At least GoW has something meaningful to say about society and giving of oneself."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"I have to disagree with most of the reviews on this page. The book is no great American novel but it is not piece of sh*t either. I had to read this book for my 11th grade AP English class and in general I like the book. It has strong themes, great characters and lots of symbolism. The Grapes of Wrath is more important as a political work that gives an overview of the Great Depression than as a literary one. The details do get very tedious. I had to read some chapters twice because I kept forgeting who the characters were. Once the Joads start their journey all the characters tend to blend together, especially the male characters. Steinbeck also tried to throw a few to many symbols in. It got so bad that I got a headache trying to find the deeper meaning in Tom using his own urine to heal a cut. In the end though all you can do is get through it. I doubt very much theres an American highschool student who hasn't read this book&gt; Whether you liked it or you hated you must see Dorothea Lang's pictures. They really give face to the characters."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"I have to say, it was a decent book. But, it wasn't the insanity I had hoped for. I was looking for pure, 100%, Dust Bowl action, but it wasn't there. All in all, an average work with a good ending."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"I made a resolution to read several of the greats works of literature throughout 2009, and got an early start with this moving saga.SHORT, NO SPOILER REVIEWThe novel is in one sense about the trials of a poverty stricken family of Oklahoma farmers, the Joads, who are driven off their land in the mid-1930s by the Dust Bowl, by greedy banks and by the never ending pace of modernization. Lured to California by handbills promising plenty of work at good wages, they set out on a perilous journey along that perennial American roadway Route 66. Along the way they suffer mechanical trouble, family illness and outright hostility from people who despise them and call them \\"Oakies\\" (roughly the same as \\"white trash\\" or a Caucasian variant of the \\"n word.\\")Upon arriving in the Golden State they are soon disillusioned by what they encounter. They are forced by corrupt police officers and hateful locals to move from one place to the next, sometimes not even allowed to get one night's sleep before being driven out. At the same time they are economically exploited by the same people who persecute them. They serve as cheap, disposable labor during harvest season. There is one particularly poignant scene where a farmer yells \\"get out of here, you filthy Oakies. You're not wanted! And don't come back until the cotton needs picking!\\"The strength and resilience with which the Joads endure the almost endless horror and travail they face speaks to their strength and basic decency, as opposed to the \\"respectable\\" people, who are driven by hatred, prejudice and greed. Steinbeck achieves a masterful level of social commentary in this powerful book. Highly recommended.FURTHER COMMENTS WITH POSSIBLE SPOILERSOn a more abstract level, The Grapes of Wrath is a powerful, affirmative answer to the question posed by Cain to God: \\"Am I my brother's keeper?\\"Steinbeck believes that all of us are, and he drives this point home with force.His words drip with contempt as he writes about the morally degenerate condition of the wealthy land owners. They dehumanize their workers, labeling them \\"Oakies,\\" by which they mean stupid, filthy, nearly worthless animals. They fail to see the common humanity they share with these people, and through their blindness they lay up grapes of wrath in the souls of the oppressed. In so doing they ensure that this righteous anger will one day drive the Oakies to revolt against them, raining every drop of the wine of vengenace down upon their heads.This theme is contrasted with another, more subtle one that pulses through the book: that all of humanity is one giant soul, as a character in the book phrases it, and the key to achieving justice is to act this principle out. Hence, towards the end of the book, the Joad's concern for their own family grows to envelop the other migrant farm workers. They see that they are all one, and the only way to achieve social justice is to take that truth and act on it by caring for each other's needs and standing united against their oppressors.The book ends on an inconclusive note. Steinbeck never tells us what ultimately happens to these people, whom the reader has come to care about deeply by the novel's climax. In the last scene Rose of Sharon, a migrant teenage girl who recently lost her baby, breast feeds a man who is starving to death. There is no titillation in this scene, quite the opposite. When read within the book's context it illustrates beautifully that Rose has learned the great lesson. She knows that all of humanity is one, and must act as one, caring for each person as if they were her own flesh and blood.This ending provides the weary reader with a hopeful moment to end with, after traveling with these people through nearly 500 pages of despair. Dismal, powerful, oddly inspiring and ultimately unforgettable, The Grapes of Wrath is a literary journey that none should miss."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"I can't say enough about this book or the author, John Steinbeck. \\"The Grapes of Wrath\\" is a heart-wrenching story about a family and its struggles and perseverence through the Depression.

Should Amazon have marked the photo of the book cover with something akin to a scarlet letter like \\"A\\" for abridged? Yes. The words \\"Abridged\\" and \\"For ages 9-12\\" appearing prominently in the first line of the description would have stopped me in my tracks. The reviews and \\"Search Inside\\" for abridged books should not link to unabridged editions of the same work."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"More than grapes and more than wrath, \\"The Grapes of Wrath\\" is a story about everlasting hope and compassion, despite pervasive hardship, poverty and death. The Joad family, uprooted from their 40-acre Oklahoma farm during the late 1930s by economic hard times, brought on by drought and dust storms and exacerbated by corporate greed and efficiencies of big agriculture, journey westward to California because they \\"got to\\" in order to stay alive, make a decent living, and retain a tenuous sliver of human dignity.Through strife, exhaustion and personal tragedy, the Joads maintain their faith that the sun will shine tomorrow, no matter how heavily the rain falls today. In sharp contrast to Grampa's dream to \\"get me a whole bunch a grapes off a bush . . . [and] squash \`em on my face an' let \`em run offen my chin,\\" and the family's hope that \\"it'll be all different out there--plenty work, an' ever'thing nice an' green, an' little white houses an' oranges growin' aroun',\\" California for the newcomer Joads is synonymous with difficulty finding work, menial wages when work is available, harsh living conditions, blatant animosity towards \\"Okies\\" from the local residents, constant money shortages, and always being hungry. By story's end, we are left wondering how the Joads are any better off after being flooded out of their railcar encampment next to a cotton field in central California, but we somehow find solace and comfort in the poignancy of Rosasharn's bighearted willingness to give from her own breast the precious life she has to share.According to Steinbeck (and I think he is right on this point), the most generous people are those who have the least material wealth and fewest possessions. \\"For the quality of owning freezes you forever into \`I,' and cuts you off forever from the \`we.'\\" Further, in the words of (reformed) ex-preacher Casy (whose voice is probably Steinbeck's), \\"a fella ain't got a soul of his own, but on'y a piece of a big one.\\" If only each of us, in our consumerist 21st century material bliss, could take this message to heart, perhaps our ever-so-efficient, profit-oriented, techno-mechanical world might become a friendlier, more compassionate place better fit for our one big human soul.From a stylistic point of view, I found the many interludes juxtaposed between the primary chapters of the book more distracting than informative, particularly the ones written in stream-of-consciousness form. If the reason for including these \\"extraneous\\" interludes is to provide background information to complement the \\"Joad\\" chapters, then, in my opinion, Steinbeck should have adhered to a more documentary form in these sections, doing the research to develop the interludes into a more substantive and factual picture of the historical setting, condition of American society during the Great Depression years, and ironies of California as a land of boundless opportunity."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"California, 1939: \\"The works of the roots of the vines, of the trees, must be destroyed to keep up the price . . . oranges dumped . . . The people come for miles to take the fruit, but this could not be. How would they buy oranges at twenty cents a dozen if they could drive out and pick them up? And men with hoses squirt kerosene on the oranges . . .\\"\\"There is a failure here that topples all our success. The fertile earth, the straight tree rows, the sturdy trunks, and the ripe fruit. And children dying of pellagra must die because a profit cannot be taken from an orange. And coroners must fill in the certificates--died of malnutrition--because the food must rot, must be forced to rot.\\"This is a brilliant and penetrating engagement of America's and California's cultural history, that will remain an important work as long as humans are willing to examine what it is to be human.Seventy years later, it is too easy for comfortable Americans to believe that Steinbeck's earthy and troubled scenes of people struggling to live are now removed from our present concerns. Displaced migrants for whom dignity or health is beyond reach, desperate to find enough work to feed their familial children, aged, sick and dying, being beaten and shot and driven from impoverished tent camps--we are _not_ seventy years removed. Present realities are actually worse. Trickle-down economics' trickles stay closer to the wealthy than ever before. 2.7 billion people live on less than $2/day. 1.1 billion live on less than $1/day. These are 2001's numbers, and it's not gotten better. The economic causes are global, and the people spraying kerosene on the systemic waste of food (borrowing from Steinbeck's account above), are America's largest agricultural conglomerations subsidized by comfortably disinterested Americans. US farm subsidies, instituted during the depression years to support America's family farms, are now flowing into megacorporations, providing permission, power, and position to adjust food prices to their advantage. The lion's share of today's agricultural subsidies is really taxpayer funded \`corporate welfare.' Don't expect your legislative representative to admit to this anytime soon, let alone try to grapple with it. And the reach is global. The would-be small family farmer in sub-Saharan Africa has no hope of competing with giant US food producers, brokers, and market fixers. Without any real hope for a domestic agricultural sector (excepting crops that can profitably be shipped to wealthier nations), these cultures have no light at the end of the tunnel. The tunnel has collapsed.No, expect instead that your representative is busy making sure you can buy more assault weapons, and more armor piercing ammunition too. Perhaps chumming with lobbyists for the afore mentioned market-fixers, or piously blustering about someone else's sexuality. Expect also for this representative to tell us what a benevolent people we noble Americans are. He may even interject some lovely sounding numbers in this regard. Question these numbers honestly. What percentage of a given program is for the salaries of American \`consultants'? What percentage of our GNP is this generosity as compared to the percent GNP contributions of the other nations of the wealthy west? Are wealthy and/or complacent Americans the people \`spraying kerosene' on the food that could feed the hungry? This is a very expansive issue, and perhaps I digress just a bit.Steinbeck was a wonderful writer, subversive in the eyes of the cultural status quo. We need another Steinbeck, of sorts. We could use many of them. This same basic storyline is painfully intimate in the lives of hundreds of millions today, but the scale is much larger and the distance and differentiation between the malnourished migrant and the wealthy lords of lands and foods has grown dramatically.\\"Tom stepped clear of the ditch and wiped the sweat out of his eyes. \\"You hear what that paper said \`bout agitators up north a Bakersfiel'?\\"\\"Sure,\\" said Wilkie. \\"They do that all a time.\\"\\"Well, I was there.

Well, sir, Hines says, 'A red is any son-of-a-bitch that wants thirty cents an hour when we're payin' twenty-five!' Well, this young fella he thinks about her, an' he scratches his head, an' he says, 'Well, Jesus, Mr. Hines. I ain't a son-of-a-bitch, but if that's what a red is--why, I want thirty cents an hour.

I read it over the span of about 3 days and can't say enough great things about it.Steinbeck's tale is still frighteningly relevant today, a time where they'll slash the jobs of thousands of factory workers so that top executives can get raises. The scorn and contempt that average citizens express for the \\"Okies\\" in this story is eerily reminiscent of the attitudes that many of today's more fortunate people have toward those who are forced to collect unemployment for years on end, or else settle for minimum-wage jobs that don't even come close to supporting a family.I'm so impressed by this book that I'm going to get my hands on as much Steinbeck work as possible."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"The product received was exactly as described by the seller.

Plot twists with character surprises - no. That's not what this book is about. If you've experienced a bit of life's peaks and valleys you'll appreciate this book that much more.

The Grapes of Wrath masterfully tells a compeling story of the Joad family during the Depression and Dust Bowl era. However, it is not until one digests this story that the metaphors, and contaversial themes surely erupt in the conscientious reader. The final scene in this book shows that even when driven to the most dire circumstances, good will still exists. While many see the work as an historic piece about the Depression era, I believe Steinbeck's themes in the Grapes of Wrath could have been played out in any era about social turmoil and economic ruin. But I am glad he chose the Depression era, and I am sure other readers will be too. Inasmuch as some people will see this book as a snapshot of the Depression, I think many have found it to be a study in the human condition that is timeless.

We forget this period in our history at our peril. Steinbeck creates a family&#8212;the Joads&#8212;that belongs to us all."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"Steinbeck is one of the best American author. He has a definite talent to tell a story and when you read the effort he went through to write this book, you learn to appreciate it even more, not that you won't appreciate it otherwise, but it's always nice to know the background of a certain book. The story he is telling probably happened more than a hundred times, that's why it is so powerful, because we know that it is true. That's what makes it a true American tragedy.The chapters in which he gives us the Joad's story are really compelling and interesting. But what really makes this book stand out above other is the even more powerful chapters where he tells the story without giving any names just for us to know that the Joads are not the only one in the samew situation.Even if this book is very long (600 pages or so), it is still very interesting with no straining and lowpoints. The constant switching between the3 two types of chapters helps build a unique rhythm.Definetely a two thumbs up."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"For whatever reason, I started this book several years ago and did not finish it. I think I was reading too quickly and it did not draw me in. My daughter had to read it so I got an audio version for a road trip the two of us went on. The reader nailed it. He read slowly and had far better voices than my own mind conjured up. After that, I read some chapters at a much slower pace, and what a difference that made. So, that is all I want to add to what others may have written. Over the top fantastic book."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"The crops are all in and the peaches are rotting,The oranges are piled in their creosote dumps.They're flying 'em back to the Mexican borderTo pay all their money to wade back again.My father's own father, he waded that river,They took all the money he made in his life;My brothers and sisters come working the fruit trees,And they rode the truck till they took down and died.Some of us are illegal, and some are not wanted,Our work contract's out and we have to move on;Six hundred miles to that Mexican border,They chase us like outlaws, like rustlers, like thieves.We died in your hills, we died in your deserts,We died in your valleys and died on your plains.We died 'neath your trees and we died in your bushes,Both sides of the river, we died just the same.Is this the best way we can grow our big orchards?Is this the best way we can grow our good fruit?To fall like dry leaves, to rot on the topsoil,And be called by no name except \\"deportee\\"?Substitute \\"county line\\" for \\"Mexican border\\" and \\"Okies\\" for \\"deportees\\" and Woody Guthrie's poem, later sung to music, becomes a nearly perfect summary of Steinbeck's GRAPES OF WRATH. This powerful novel vividly portrays a universal crisis of humankind, a crisis that remains as destructive today as when Steinbeck undertook to illuminate it for all those who dared to read. Massive disparity of wealth in a society is far more than an economic conundrum. It has the power to destroy self-images, families, and lives. It has the power to confuse honest laborers, to rouse them to helpless anger, and finally to sink them into abyssal despair.Industrialization drives sharecropper families from the land that they have tilled, harvested, bled upon, dropped sweat into, and been buried in for generations. Severed from the anchor they have always known, the families become wanderers, searching for a way and a place to survive. They become the \\"have nots\\" of American society, feared and shunned by the \\"haves.\\" Soulless land companies, banks, and agricultural industries are great, faceless controlling forces that exploit the landless and then drive them elsewhere. How do ignorant sharecroppers fight such exploitation? Mortals might as well take up arms against a malevolent deity. The totality of despair created by such an economic system can hardly be imagined by one who has not experienced it.Is there no way out? Steinbeck suggests that there is perhaps one hope. If the migrant poor will only stick together, cooperate and support one another in solidarity, create a union of workers, then the impersonal corporate giants must listen. If two hundred men speak as one, the voice becomes loud enough to demand fair and humane treatment. Easier said than done, especially when those who would speak of this aloud are jailed, beaten, and murdered by the giants' \\"hired guns.\\"This discussion suggests the essential difference between GRAPES OF WRATH and Steinbeck's other novels. The others paint struggles of mankind against the background of an amoral universe in which irony often distorts the outcome. This one paints struggles of the \\"common man\\" against profit-and-loss ledgers of the agricultural industry. It is brutal in its portrayal of how the \\"system\\" methodically destroys families, and it is equally brutal in its portrayal of the fear engendered in economically comfortable men by the influx of those who are in need. In the inevitable confrontation that follows, the veneer of civilization is replaced by stereotyping, then by hatred of the stereotype, and finally by repression of Americans by Americans.Yet, Steinbeck allows us to hope. After Casy, the canny former preacher who finds courage to lead a strike against inhumane treatment of workers, lies in the mud with his skull crushed, Tom Joad leaves his crumbling family, vowing to follow Casy's vision. Casy and Tom are our \\"Joe Hills\\":\\"The copper bosses killed you, Joe;They shot you, Joe\\" says I.\\"Takes more than guns to kill a man,\\"Says Joe, \\"I didn't die\\"Says Joe, \\"I didn't die\\"And standing there as big as lifeAnd smiling with his eyes,Says Joe, \\"What they can never killwent on to organize,went on to organize.\\"From San Diego up to Maine,in every mine and mill,where workingmen defend their rights,It's there you'll find Joe Hill,It's there you'll find Joe Hill!Now, who should read GRAPES OF WRATH? Is anyone concerned with the plight of the common workingman or woman? Is anyone concerned about the effects of industrial globalization? Is anyone concerned about the final impact of the \\"Wal-Martization\\" of America? Is anyone concerned when fertile fields lie fallow or, perhaps worse yet, are converted to barren asphalt-covered flats? If anyone cares, read the novel. If one is financially secure and therefore does not care about such things, then he especially should read the novel, for then maybe, just maybe, he will begin to care."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"I recently had to read this novel for highschool, and it's one of the best books I've read. It's a pretty simple book with easy to understand symbols and themes, but it is written perfectly...the general layout of the plot, the inter-chapters' poetic style, and the finely crafted characters all set this book above others. The writing is just so tightly knit that I was in awe at how the book was put together. It's just perfect and everyone should read it."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"This is an important book, I think, in the history of the American novel. It tackles firsthand the transience of American life, and the changing roles of labor, government and faith in the twentieth century. By all means, read this book.However, I don't think this is really as great a novel as its reputation alleges it to be. I had read someplace that Steinbeck wrote this in 100 days, and I believe that might be true. The basic outline of a great novel is here-- the characters mesh together well, and the conflicts are clearly outlined. But it reads like a strong first draft. The structure of the novel is too simple and brief to justify its weighty conclusions. The characters never grow beyond types, which takes a lot of the political punch out of the book. Tom, in particular, never really develops enough as a character to make his eventual departure the powerful moment it should be.It's still a good book. But compared to Steinbeck's other novels, the characterization and plot structure just seem a bit flat. In the end, it's sort of a weepy prayer for communism amid some graphic yet empty scenes of American squalor.Historically, this novel is important. But for those who love the form, its impact might seem a bit hollow."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"Whenever I revisit a classic I'm struck by how much more I get out of it now than I did when I was 24 or 19 or, God forbid, 15. Giving a book like the Grapes of Wrath to a 15 year old serves largely to put them off fine literature for the rest of their lives. The depth of understanding and compassion for the human condition as communicated by a book like this is simply unfathomable to those who haven't lived much life yet, but after you've gotten a healthy dose of living, it comes across like fine music to a trained ear.My heart doesn't bleed for the Joads today as it might have 25 years ago. Yes, it's grim and unfair, but it's no longer shocking or disturbing, and I can see now that Steinbeck didn't intend sensationalism to be the main point. What he's about is revealing the human dignity, the innate goodness and unbreakable pride of these people, and by extension the American people in general, something that still resonates today, especially with reference to the working classes. When the Joads and their kind decline government hand outs, requesting instead the simple opportunity to work hard and be rewarded commensurate with their labor (even if it means a grueling cross-country journey to a place they don't know) one can hear today's white working poors' exasperated disdain for government, insisting that they simply be allowed to keep more of their pay and not be held back in their efforts by nit-picking legalities and cultural trivialities that disapprove of their lifestyles.Sadly, most such people will never read the Grapes of Wrath. Worse yet, many liberal lawmakers won't read it again after high school and won't glean from it an essential understanding about the pride and perseverance of the American working class that could benefit them in cultivating this constituency. A book like the Grapes of Wrath should be required reading - for every American over 30."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"&quot;The Grapes of Wrath&quot; is a powerful indictment of the oppression endured by the migrant families of the American mid-west during the depression years of the 1930's. The mid-west had suffered severe drought. &quot;Dusters&quot; swept across the farmland, skimming off the topsoil, leaving behind a dustbowl, only a few sprigs of wheat surviving. The tenant farms were foreclosed and the families tractored off the land in a ruthless drive to maximise profit. Circe 250,000 migrants, &quot;refugees from the dust&quot;, pulled up stakes and headed west on route 66, the road of flight to California, golden land of dreams and opportunity, drawn by the picking work, harvesting oranges and peaches. The flowing in of rootless migrant workers centred on the San Joachin valley, California, and the huge farms there. The overwhelming glut of migrants flooding through the valley swamped the harvesting work available, driving down wages to peanuts level as they desperately scrabbled &quot;to pull, to pick, to cut - anything, any burden to bear, for food&quot;.This is the destiny that fate held in store for the Joad family in &quot;The Grapes of Wrath&quot;. Forced off their farm, truck piled high with their belongings, the Joads set forth on a journey 2000 miles haul from Sallislaw in Oklahoma through the western desert states of Arizona and New Mexico and onto the San Joachin valley. The gut-wrenching story of the Joads heroic journey is interspersed with short &quot;relief&quot; chapters on aspects of their route 66 experience, the tricks of used-car salesmen or a snapshot of life in a truck-stop diner, to cite only a couple examples; other chapters function as social on, for example, the stomach turning practice of spraying mountains of oranges with kerosene or dumping potatoes in the river under armed guard to protect market prices, at a time when hundreds of thousands of migrants were literally starving. This structure enables Steinbeck at once to follow closely the fortunes of the Joads and cast a wider eye over what is happening in society during the depression years.However, Steinbeck's narrative, in my view, is at its most powerful and compelling on the road,the Joads suffering and misfortune trucking along the endless narrow concrete miles to Bakersfield, California, revealing qualities of guts and resilience in their desperate struggle for survival in the face of death, starvation, hostility, exploitation and harassment. Steinbeck's powerful voice shows the migrants during the hard times of the 1930's depression years, the hardship and oppression endured by thousands upon thousands of families like the Joads, will resonate for generations to come. It is a voice that packs alot to say!"},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"I watch the movie whenever it is on TV, its one of my favorites from that era. This past spring, I decided to read the book, something I rarely do if I've already seen the movie. I can understand now why the movie, compared to the book, tried to put a more promising spin on the Joad's (and many Americans) situation at the time. After all, the future for the working class and the country as a whole,was very much in doubt circa 1930's America. I recently saw a documentary on the making of the movie and it mentioned how the famous speech from Ma Joad towards the end of the film,about how they are the -&quot;little people&quot; and how there's many more of them and they just keep a-coming and things will eventually work out- this dialogue was actually added by Daryl Zanuck to end the movie with some hope. The book offers none of that hope...I was shocked at just how unforgiving and relentless the book is in its outlook of despair and misery for the Joads and others like them. The final chapters truly are some of the most desperate and hopeless depictions of the American Dream gone bad that I have ever read. You can really appreciate the progress we have made over the past 60 years in assuring that the country doesn't undergo anything close to &quot;The Great Depression&quot; again(so far)...Even if you've seen this movie first, the book is well worth reading and is dramtically different in its scope and mood..Definitely one of the best of the 20th century."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"There is no denying John Steinbeck's brilliance. I feel that his best work is &quot;East of Eden&quot;, but &quot;The Grapes of Wrath&quot; is a monumental work, probably the one that captures his political sensibilities and the times he wrote about better than any. &quot;Grapes&quot; has character development, pathos, irony and social commentary, all biting, poignant and loving at the same time. Its political message is Socialist. The problem with this is that it offers great misery, packaged in the plight of the Joad family and Okies headed to California during the Dust Bowl '30s, but it does not offer solutions. Business owners, capitalists, policemen and authority figures are fairly evenly displayed as unfeeling, selfish, sometimes racist, and mean.What Steinbeck chose not to do was to see the 1930s from their standpoint. The message would seem to indicate that he advocated that the government just handle all the Okies' problems, but this creates some problems. First, the FDR Administration did more in this regard than any previous government, or any since, possibly. With this in mind, then the question devolves into the conclusion that government intervention is not the answer.The question I kept asking was, Why do roadside business owners or cops or others barely struggling during terrible times owe something to these Okies? From the Christian standpoint, they do. But the Okies had no job skills. They offered little. They were not marketable. They were willing to work, but they could not do anything other than manual labor.It is easy to criticize them for coming to California where there were more people than jobs, but they apparently were coerced into it by misleading flyers advertising fruit waiting to be picked and jobs aplenty.In the light of historical retrospect, the unsaid message of this book at its time was that the people described would be &quot;saved&quot; if they lived in Communism. Those who flirted with Communism in America in the 1930s can be excused, considering the times. But Steinbeck was an educated man, and by the time he finished this book, the basic facts about Stalin's Russia were known. Russia was in shambles, millions had already been murdered, starved and imprisoned. It was hell on Earth. Steinbeck had to know, if not every gory detail, enough to establish the fact that Communism was utterly evil.This left him, it seems, between a rock and a hard place, which was the big problem for all the Communists and fellow travelers in the West. The Utopian ideal does not adhere to reality. In the end, &quot;Grapes&quot; describes misery and plays to guilt, a powerful strategy.What history tells us is that the &quot;answer&quot; to the Okies' predicament, while not perfect, while not timely, was in the end the fact that they lived in America, which to paraphrase Chuirchill is &quot;the worst country known to man with the exception of all other countries known to man.&quot;To live in America offered more hope and more chance of success to these people than all other Earthly possibility. Steinbeck does not portray that. He does not necessarily deserve to be excoriated for it; it would require perhaps more vision than he had in light of his publication and probable editorial time constraints. However, travel the California landscape today and one will find the children and grandchildren of these Okies, and they will mainly tell you stories of struggle that ended in various forms of happiness and success for the ancestors of the Okies.Despite any political differences, Steinbeck is a writer of such talent and inner greatness that it cannot be denied.STEVEN TRAVERSAUTHOR OF &quot;BARRY BONDS: BASEBALL'S SUPERMAN&quot;STWRITES@AOL.COM"},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"Sure, this novel is beautifully written, but the propaganda aspect of the work gets in the way pretty quickly. Every aspect of capitalism is condemned as evil by Steinbeck and the characters in the book are depicted as one of three types of people: A) The Victims, B) The Helpless Tools, C) The Evil Capitalists.The victims, such as the Joads, are portrayed as helpless one-trick ponies who, despite having some wonderful skills that could have made them some money, can't seem to adjust to the changing times and are either too dumb or too nostalgic to strike out on their own. They spend the entire novel drifting toward some sort of idiotic fantasy world that they're warned off of time and time again. Do they listen to the warnings? No. They continue stubbornly, in a way that isn't really explained by Steinbeck. Why exactly is it that the Joads don't believe the various characters telling them not to continue on to California? Who knows? Apparently, Steinbeck doesn't because he offers no explanation for -- or even acknowledgement of -- this.The Helpless Tools are those who serve the monsters, the corporations, which have grown uncontrollable by the men who created them. The tools do the bidding of the monstrous companies and, though they empathize with the Victims, they're helpless to resist the will of the companies -- the companies who eat profits and die without them.Then we encounter the Evil Capitalists. These are the evil men who actually dare to make a living for themselves by making a profit. Oh, stop! What are you!? The Devil!!?!? Good, God, man. Steinbeck would have fit right in at any of the recent 'Occupy' rallies anywhere in the world. Were he alive today, I'm sure he'd be giving some magnificent speech at the Democratic National Convention -- and hosted by Hugo Chavez soon after.Despite all of this though -- if you're a writer, this book is mandatory reading. There is so much masterful technique to learn from this book that you're only doing yourself a disservice by not reading it. You're literally limiting your potential because if you have the education and experience to appreciate it, this book is a gold mine of advanced technique.Pinch your nose at the politics and read this if you're a writer -- or else I'm giving you an automatic 'C'! :)"},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"The Grapes of Wrath is a long book about the 1930's. It involves the main character of the story, Tom Joad, leaving prison and going back home to his family's house in Oklahoma, when he finds out they've left because of the dust bowl. When he catches up with them, they're packing up to go to California. A lot of the book is about them going to California, and them trying to settle down. Some of the chapters in the book are symbolic, and represent Steinbeck's leftist ideals. A lot of the people here seem to give the book a 1 star review because they can't appreciate the symbolic meaning of the turtle, and of other things.If you're intelligent enough to grasp the concept of symbols, you will definitely like this book.And yes, there is a lot of cussing in here. And know what? They're just words. Calm down.One last thing. The ending of the book is really, really shocking. Enjoy."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"So you're probably wondering, why such a downer title, and yet he gave it four stars? Well, if you're willing to be your own editor, you can turn this into a terrific novel or into a moving essay. But, Steinbeck has combined both, and in today's time, this pairing drives down the pace of both. Steinbeck's writing pattern is immediatly apparent: He alternates between an essay dealing in generalities of the situation with the tale of the Joad family specifically living the conditions he has laid out in the essay. Of course he did that, because he was trying to educate the bulk of America to the condition the migrant workers were facing in California. If he just told Joad's story, readers might think it is a situation peculiar to only one family. But, by pairing the Joad episodes with the broader essays, he shows that their desperate situation is shared by thousands of other families. Each of the essay/story telling sections are easy to dissect, so I suggest the reader who is interested in the compelling story of the Joads skip the essay segments. I read both in order, and found myself impatient with the essays and wanting to get back to the Joads. However, the essays are beautifully and powerfully written and important in their time before Caesar Chavez, so the next time I pick up this book, I believe I will just read the essay sections, then read the Joad sections. I also highly recommend the movie version of this book which starred Henry Fonda. The book and movie are quite similar in their plots with some exceptions that are interesting to think about. There are a number of minor characters and situations in the book that didn't make the movie. One of Steinbeck's themes from the book that didn't see light of the silver screen is that the head of the family was changing from a male to female as the adversities became harder to overcome. The movie ends on somewhat of a positive note with Henry Fonda's \\"I'll be there\\" speech. On the other hand, the book ends with a hell-bent-for-leather finale, none of which made the movie, including the haunting climax. And unlike the movie, the book shows no promise of a brighter future."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"The book relates the tragic destiny of one family after the great depression in 1929, when million of American workers became unemployed. this family had been abased, and went to the california to get a life better.

I can't agree completely with that. Grapes of Wrath is an important expose of the way simple people were affected by the Great Depression and industrial changes to the agricultural sector. Overly sentimental and melodramatic at times, it is true that Steinbeck exploits the sad nature of his lowly characters to elicit pity. Still, I found his style clear and the plot interesting enough to overlook these deficiencies. The narrator documents the trip down Route 66 of an Oklahoma dust farm family. They are headed toward California dreams and encounter much adversity along the way. I think the book should be read as a relevant period piece and enjoyed as an American family saga."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"Thats what it is a good book."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"I have to disagree with most of the reviews on this page. The book is no great American novel but it is not piece of sh*t either. I had to read this book for my 11th grade AP English class and in general I like the book. It has strong themes, great characters and lots of symbolism. The Grapes of Wrath is more important as a political work that gives an overview of the Great Depression than as a literary one. The details do get very tedious. I had to read some chapters twice because I kept forgeting who the characters were. Once the Joads start their journey all the characters tend to blend together, especially the male characters. Steinbeck also tried to throw a few to many symbols in. It got so bad that I got a headache trying to find the deeper meaning in Tom using his own urine to heal a cut. In the end though all you can do is get through it. I doubt very much theres an American highschool student who hasn't read this book&gt;"},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"The Grapes of Wrath is an important book because it fictionalized an important historical movement. However, it is quite dull and dismal.The story revolves around the Joad family, a group who has been uprooted from their home and decides to move to California where there are oranges and opportunities. They endure hardships including death, poverty and prejudice. The scenes are filled with dirt and barren landscapes. It is hard to like the family because they're absolutely pathetic and it is hard not to like them either for the same reason. One just rolls along the story with them not caring much what happens or what doesn't happen.The book is full of symbols that are presented for the reader to interpret any way they'd like. Steinbeck used these symbols to put forth his points about humanity in a subtle way so that one is not overwhelmed. One symbol is the dust that creates a haze over the world. It foreshadows the discomfort and irritation of a new life and obliterates view of the past. The wind that blew the dust pushed the family toward California in hopes of a better life. The highway symbolizes the journey taken by the families toward California. It is the progression of life, the never-ending struggle that all must endure. The grapes from the title of the book were referenced in a scene in which they were crushed to starve the Okies. The juice from these grapes symbolizes the blood that was shed while fighting injustice. In Christianity, grape juice and wine are used in communion as the blood of Christ. The wealthy squeezed the grapes to expel the juices into the streets so that the common people had no access to it, preventing religion and good from the migrants.Overall, this book employs tools of great writers and is certainly historically important. However, it is difficult for one to want to read this sort of book if it is not entertaining. This void is the book's major weakness."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"I remember reading this last year in high school, and everyone felt it was so boring that they couldn't even continue reading, but this was one of the few books I could actually stomach and continue to read on with. I have a natural interest with American history, and my main interest is in the early 20th century during the 20s-40s. This book does a wonderful job at portraying that time period, as well as realizing what life was like for your average working man during our countries worst economic decade. People were fired and lost their land, people traveled across the country to find minimum wage jobs to support their families, people dies and lost family memebers on the way, people broke the law and commited suicide to cope, and people were miserable on top of all this. The characters aren't too boring, and go through some of the depressions worst moments. This book also shows the brutality of the government and how they would force people out of nice camps and jail them just for voicing their opinions. In the end, nothing changes, and everyone is as bad off as when they started off, if not worse. They are without a home, job, or decent meals, and this is all shown very clearly throughout the novel, as well as how Americans worked together to support each other with humane acts to hopefully make it out of the depression and regain their homes and jobs."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"This is an astonishing book, a spellbinder like today's mysteries, but with a social conscience.

Steinbeck is one of the greats and needs to be a part of everyone's library."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"Perhaps no scene in literature is more haunting and powerful than the conclusion of the Grapes of Wrath. I finished the audio book, narrated by Dylan Baker, some 2 weeks ago, and its sad irony and humanity still resonate with me.However, this scene is just one of dozens evoking the depths of human hope and sorrow. If you haven't read the Grapes of Wrath, it's a journey like no other; not just into the human spirit, but into our nation's history, including vivid portrayals of farm foreclosure, migrant labor, and economics and social events that gave rise to organized labor.In addition to delivering highly memorable characters and scenes, Steinbeck offers an unusual but very effective structural device - narrative passages about primary characters are interspersed with passages from third-party perspectives, often resembling discrete short-stories, for example,- a property manager evicting a disbelieving farmer from his land- a salesman selling a used car to a desperate family heading West- family farms collapsing in the wake of farm-automation and vertically-integrated farm-canneries- a stolid turtle trudging along an Oklahoma dust bowl roadAll-in-all, The Grapes of Wrath is a feast for the mind and imagination, as much a must-read as say, the Catcher in the Rye.Dylan Baker's audio CD narration is outstanding. Like a great narrator, he's equally effective voicing male and female characters, conveying emotional depth without becoming maudlin, and maintain a good pace. His narration compares with some of the best efforts from the generally incomparable George Guidall."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"Over the years I have attempted to read this classic several times and failed because the first 100 pages are slow and daunting.

They are enticed as so many others were to the land of promise and opportunity - California. Unfortunately they are met with hardship, contempt, injustice, corruption, greed, prejudice and hunger to name a few.

Don't miss it.If it's assigned in school and seems too long and too boring, do what you have to do now. But by all means, return to it a few years later and read it when you can."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"The shipping for this book is really quick, and I m satisfied for the book I got. It new, no scratch, no note inside!"},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"I've only read two of Steinbeck's novels but so far I have loved his work. His writing feels very down to earth and matter of fact about large issues affecting large numbers of people. He has a very realistic feeling style and while the events of this novel have long passed it touches on larger issues that still exist today. Sad but wonderful read."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"I love this book. Many of my friends have read it and hated it. But this is one of the best works I've ever had the pleasure of holding in my hand. I read it when I was a junior in high school and I just read it again and I've been graduated from college for almost seven years and it's still just as wonderful as the first time I read it. You'll read it and feel like you're a part of the family. You'll laugh and cry with them and even get angry. But please give this book a chance. It's so worth the adventure."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"Grapes of Wrath was required reading in college. But my Book Club, some 50 years later, decided to read it again. We were captivated! Mesmerized by the strength of Ma. Swept along Route 66 in a jalopy carrying a dozen. Enlightened by the cruel methods employed by the Oklahoma, Kansas and California land owners. Wanting, at the end, to read a sequel to find out what happened to Tom and the 300,000 other \\"Okies\\" who just wanted to work hard at what they knew best, farming."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"I found this book a compulsive read. An extremely sad journey through it's pages, you just want the journey to end and the book to be over. This book is beatifully written as I knew it would be. The opening chapter is awesomely written and the tragic Joad family are of course wonderful. Despite the critical introduction I never felt preached to and never felt that dialogue from the Joad family was over and above what you'll get from semi-literate, poverty stricken folk.I don't understand why the publishers allowed such a snobby guy to give the introduction which, before I knew it, told me the ending. How stupid can you get? I'd advise you to read the book BEFORE the intro and make your own mind up BEFORE the intro. This book is one of the reasons I love books. It opened up a little world in my mind that I never knew existed in 1930's America. And I keep talking about it to people and comparing it to the world today. Hope you get it.The book is about farm labourers, small-time plot holders who's livelihoods have been taken away by the coming of the tractors and 1930's Depression. These people have been born and brought up to live off the land, ploughing, sewing etc and NOTHING ELSE. So,skill-less,homeless, hungry, desperate and financially broke they migrate West under promises of work in the West and streets lined with Orange trees. Unfortunately, there's half a million people migrating and not nearly enough work. When the family leave Oaklahoma, Buisnessmen use their desperation to bargain down the worth of their lifes belongings and, when they travel they are told early that buisnessmen use the huge numbers of people, and their hunger and desperation, to lower wages. This book made me hate certain aspects of human nature-competition, survival of the fittest, progress etc. But you will love and admire the Joad family.In all, an intense beautifully written story that had me hungry for every word."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this classic. This book was a brilliant analysis of social society and it really makes me feel sorry for the immigrants. I especially liked how Steinbeck made the novel as gloomy as possible to prove his point. The vivid images of this great book showed a farming family forced to move out for a better chance at life, and then fail at the end. It makes you feel as if you are really there. The Great Depression was a cruel, foolish discriminating event on the innocent Americans. It was also very difficult to see proud Americans being significantly reduced to nothing at all. It leaves you hanging, lets you decide what will happen. It is really a wonderful book."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"I believe it is a mistake for schools to continue to assign their students the job of reading The Grapes of Wrath. This is a book written for mature, adults, and it is obvious from reading the numerous negative reviews left by teens that they are not mature, adult readers. How can anyone expect a teenager from today's hurry up, rush rush, society to enjoy a book that develops as slowly as The Grapes of Wrath. And how can anyone expect today's teenagers to enjoy anything that doesn't have crashing cars, explosions, graphic sex..etc. etc. about every 3 pages. Teachers would be doing all of the mature readers who can appreciate a book as great as this a favor by not forcing their students to read it, and thus sparing us from their immature, ridiculous reviews. No offense to teens, but most of them are not capable of understanding a work this deep."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"I completely appreciate this novel for its historical context and realism. However it is very long and every other chapter consists of overly detailed events, such as a turtle crossing the road. It's hard to get through, but anyone that must read it will at least understand why. You may never want to read it again, although I just might someday pick it up and read it for a second time. You'll never forget the ending for as long as you live. Very well written."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"The book arrived in a timely manner, but I was surprised to find that the paperback book had absolutely no front cover on it! I ended up taping an old pizza menu to the front. It definitely encouraged me to read when I was hungry, but it would be nice to know about a missing front cover before I bought the book. Otherwise, the pages themselves were all present, which is the most important thing."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"This book showed up faster than they had said and was in perfect condition so I am well pleased with the service I get from Amazon.com."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"my brother is into all those kind of books he loves this one so I made his birthday for him lol"},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"The book came in great condition and in a timely manner. It was a pleasure doing business with this seller on Amazon.com"},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"perfect conditions. the item is extremely good. fast shiping. everyone should buy from this seller."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"The Grapes of Wrath is Steinbeck's Pulizter Prize-winning novel about an Oklahoma family, the Joads, who goes on a journey to California to look for work after their farm was taken away by the banks and the landowners. But they find out a lot more than what they thought about the promised land called California when they finally get there. they get treated with disrespect by the people who live there, calling them and many other outsiders from Oklahoma 'Okies' and being pushed around by the deputies. They started out as a big family, then lost members throughout the novel. the book also has some 'interchapters' by the author to show us what happened during the depression.To me, Steinbeck's novel was both good and boring.Good, because it was a good story, with perfect detail and well-crafted characters. It was also structured really well, with the dialect the author used for the characters to make them realistic. I think Steinbeck did a great job with this work, different from Of Mice and Men and The Pearl.This novel was also boring because of the interchapters. one, they have nothing to do with the actual story. And two, they have paragraphs that just puts me to sleep. I know they're there just to show us what's going on during the story, but still, it just loses my interest.Overall, The Grapes of Wrath is John Steinback at his finest. I was, honestly, glad to read it myself. And I think everyone else, especially high school students, should read it as well."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"This book is one of the best i have ever read...although you may have heard that a couple times already. The ending is so moving i sat for a while and thought about what it meant. its one of those endings where you want to shout at the top of your lungs to everyone in the world &quot;READ THIS!&quot; . . . although it may seem an eency (really eency) bit slow moving at times, you MUST KEEP READING!"},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"This is a monumental work on the midwesteners' migration to California during the Dust Bowl of the Great Depression. Steinbeck very movingly depicts the plight and the steadfastness of the displaced. Man versus Nature and Man's inhumanity to Man have never been better discussed. Extremely well-written, I enjoyed every word of the book even though this is the third time I've read it. Ma Joad becomes the de facto head of the &quot;fambly&quot; and her spirit is indomitable. The cruelty of &quot;the haves&quot; to &quot;the have-nots&quot; stabs one in the heart. Reading this work will leave one a better and more humble person. It will also remind one of hard times and the distinct possibilty such times could come again. Will our will to survive be as great as the &quot;Okies?&quot; I doubt it.This edition has fairly large print which makes it very easy on the eyes.I heartily recommend this towering work of Steinbeck's to young and old alike. You won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"This book is truely one of the master pieces of the 20th century and Steinbeck one of the best story tellers of our time. It is a simple book of hard times and how one family has to cope with the times by moving states in the hope of work. As we move into the new mellenium this book reminds us that we should not forget the hardship that our forefathers endured."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"This book should not be required reading for anyone. It should be sought out by those ready to enrich themselves, and those who want to 'feel' what it is like to be out of society's main stream. I would also recommend Ayn Rand's &quot;Atlas Shrugged&quot; for those wishing to understand how people on the other side of life's river view the world. We, the people, are the heros in both these novels, and my life has been enriched by having heard these stories. I highly recommend these books as valuable assets to our collective compassion and the individual spirit. There is plenty of room for both, and we can afford to lose neither... BTW - both are available on Audio for those who commute."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"The Grapes of Wrath are for those who are interested in learning about a certain group's point of view when they were forced to migrate halfway across the continent in the 1930s. It is a powerful moving story that will make you wonder if things will get better or worse. The Grapes Of Wrath is considered to be a social protest by other reviews and I believe this is true for Steinbeck portrays the conditions that a migrant family workers had to go through. There were chapters in the book that were not about the migrant family and Steinbeck might have meant to do that so that readers will see the background of the story behind what's happening to the characters in the story and this also gives readers an idea about the history behind the novel that happened more than 60 years ago."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"It is difficult to overstate the impact that this book had on the 16-year-old struggling with his identity that I was when I first read it in 1970. More so than Steinbeck's &quot;Of Mice and Men&quot;, this masterpiece did so very much to awaken the social consciousness and activism in me. As a native Californian, I had actually been called an &quot;Okie&quot; as a small child but had no context to define the word.The other reviews I read praised the book's portrayal of the Joads to maintain human dignity despite disposession and prejudice that is very tangible. But I love the book for its spirituality as well. The continual references to God are unmistakable! The injustice is easily recognizable because God put His notion of justice in us. The Preacher, the real hero of the story, is sacrificed to the injustice.Sheer poetry, the book is a towering work that loses none of its impact with the passage of years."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"This book gave me an excellent portrayal of life during the Great Depression. Steinbeck did a fabulous job of using his simple style and realistic dialogue to represent the life of a working class family during the 30's. I would suggest this book to those who are fans of Steinbeck and enjoy his writing techniques. The reason that I enjoyed this book so much was because I read it on my own to learn more about the Depression."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"Well, I am currently trying to read the classics and books that everyone says are worthwhile. This one is definitely worthwhile! I wasn't too thrilled to start this one, but was pleasantly surprised by its depth and ability to move me. I'll have to say that after I read Chapter 25, I put the book down in despair, wondering, &quot;Oh my gosh, can I go on reading this?&quot; (Not because it was poor writing, but because it was spectacular writing - read the chapter). Absolutely Recommended."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"I cannot believe anyone would call this book boring. To do so is an act of utter ignorance. As a teenager,I admit that it took me 4 tries to get past the first 5 chapters, but once I did, I could not put it down. The book is one of the greatest works of this century. If it does not stand the test of time, I vow to eat my copy of it. READ IT!"},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"There are authors who cojure wonderful plots, but lack the writing skills to tell it well, and there are authors who can grab you with their writing and need pay very little attention to plot. Steinbeck has created a vivid portrait combining both breath-taking and rough lyricism and a wonderful plot to create a master-piece of American fiction. With this book, Steinbeck has single handedly described what life was for &quot;Okies&quot; and has left no detail left out. For a seventeen year-old to be saying this about THE GRAPES OF WRATH, you know it must be good."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"I loved this book! It tells us about how life was in the depression. The symbolism is great! the American dream was a major part of Steinbeck's writing becuse it was a major part of his life. It stresses the importance to follow your dreams!"},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"The Grapes of Wrath by John Steinbeck is one of the deepest, most insightful explanations of the dustbowl period. Each chapter has a double meaning, one of the Joad family, and one of every family and the high and lows they experienced at that time. The novel masterfully shows the changes in human nature during the course of the western move, and the corrolation between the turtle chapter and the family's new way of life or Jim Casy as a Jesus Christ related figure (J.C.) was absolutely wonderful. I loved this book!!!!!!!"},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"The book is vital. It is not a book for the immature, and Steinbeck applies all the sensitive subjects that Knee Jerk Right Wingers see fit for book banning. Farming, profanity, sex, farming, immigrants, highways, farming...It is a kind of Third Testament that trash-heaps organized religion and reveals that love for humanity is nothing like the air-headed effluviam of Haight-Ashbury, but a potent, permanent and honest personality trait. It is a book of stregnth that makes you wise. It is a blessing that America produced a writer so intelligent, compassionate and courageous. In other words, it ain't the same book you read in high school. Amen."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"First of all, I'm a Steinbeck cheerleader. I can't help it. But this is true: &quot;Grapes&quot; is America's greatest novel, and nothing is its equal. I love this book for its form and style, its language, its simplicity, its symbolism, its characters, plot and dialogue and its meaning layered on meaning that never disappoints; each new reading reveals something new and profound about you, the reader; we, both as a formed society and as human beings as a timeless whole, and the forces outside of ourselves that compel us to either make choices or just hang on until the ride is over. My last reading gave me the impression that &quot;Grapes&quot; illustrates that, at bottom, human beings are both the best and worst of all creations, and that the choice is always ours which of those characteristics we will put forth in any given instant in our lives; whether or not life favors me today, I can still choose to give my best to others and myself. Our free will cannot be quashed. In this fatalistic world, I appreciate Steinbeck's demonstration of this through the Joad family, who, when the indifferent world asked them to die and get it over with, refused, and went gallantly on. This is life-affirming art at its best, a classic that fits the definition: it rewards reinspection."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"This is one of the best books I have read. It may have taken a while to read but it was definitely worth it. If u can really get into it, you realize all the things we take for granted now a days. Definitely read this book."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"That kind of review is to be expected from someone who can't even spell &quot;description&quot; correctly. Yes, to illiterate people, this book might not be so interesting, but to everyone else, it is a story about a huge part of America's history. The reason there is so much description is because Steinbeck wants to take the audience to this point in time, and show us how the family dealt with this tragedy."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"The Grapes of Wrath may be too cumbersome for some readers who demand more action and suspense, but if carefully read, you can't help soaking in the concatinations of themes. Steinbeck exploits the journey and growth themes to their full potential in the story of the Joads' trip to the promised land and the tribulations they face. Life and Death have never been painted so blatantly and thoroughly in modern literature."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"I have not read the book, but the play was captivating. I'm going to runout and buy the book as soon as possible. Ma Joad's strength was amazing. Throughout the whole play, I could hardly breath. Casey was my favorite character. The guy who played him (Tom Key) did a sensational job. I hope the book is just as good as the play!"},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"the trials and tribulations with the Joad family seemed so real. you are able to image everything that is happening as if it really could have occurred. highly recommended for anyone. may be hard to understand at first, but continue on, you will not be disappointed."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"This book, was slow reading at first but the way that John Steinbeck portrays themes through the memebers of the Joad family is an extremly fine knit work. This book was flawless, It opens your eyes to the immense desperation of the time. If a book can change you life, this one will. It makes you realize what you have, and take for granted. Even something as simple as a toilet, a place to stay and food to eat. The themes that are portryed in this novel are strong and clear, I recomend this book to anyone who has an open mind and a love for literature. But to truly understand it, you need to read between the lines and analyze it every step of the way."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"Nothing really needs to be said about this book. It is a classic. This is depression era literature at its finest."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"\\"The Grapes of Wrath\\" a true American Classic is one of the most outstanding books that I have ever read. It does not fail to leaves its mark on a reader. This serious master-piece has its setting during the \\"Great Depression\\" and gives a general view of the 1930's. John Steinbeck who may be the greatest chronicler of this cataclysm wrote this THE GRAPES OF WRATH which is about the struggles of the poor during this time. In the story, the Joad family endures many struggles on their way to find work in California and their lives are a microcosm of struggles of the poor during this time. Like thousands of other families, they encounter hunger, violence, betrayals, setbacks and despair. Yet the Joads maintained dignity, courage, and hope to recover. America was fortunate in that the poor did maintain these virtues which kept their hopes alive and made them not to rebel and throw the nation into anarchy. The nation was also lucky with the ascension to power of Roosevelt. THE GRAPES OF WRATH shows how a people with hope and a leadership committed to its people can overcome disaster to become strong again.Itrreads in so many ways like Disciples of Fortune and the writing flows in an effortless manne"},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"This is a classic and a must-have must-read for everyone with an interest in good books.

It is a story of overwhelming sadness redeemed by the courage and strength of the Joads who represented so many who actually lived it."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"I enjoyed reading this book but was disappointed in the ending. It had to end at some point I guess. After watching the documentary aired on PBS that this novel was based on, I was just hungry for more of the story."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"I wanted to read a highly acclaimed novel and picked this one. It took me a little bit to get used to the dialect, but once it came I read through it pretty fast. My family is from the Appalachian mountains in Kentucky. This book gave me a new appreciation for the poor, the destitute, and how labor organizations came to exist. I imagined my gparents going thru similar trials to feed their family. Labor unions are getting a bad rap, but now it is clear to me that greed and little respect for fellow man necessitated their existence."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"Whether you read this in high school or not, read it (again). This book has many levels and will give you a good look at the great depression, both from the Joad's story and the nation's."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"This book is just as irrelevant now as it was upon inception.

He said it was a very good read"},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"My mother is 92 years young. This was a gift for her. She actually remembered being born when some of the events took place! She enjoyed the book very much although the language was a little strong for her in some places."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"This is a novel that generated many varying reactions from me, and although I enjoyed reading it, I have mixed emotions about it.The book is undeniably well written, with Steinbeck alternating a chapter of narrative that focuses on the Joad family with a short chapter about the migrant movement of the thirties as a whole. The chapters about the migrant movement are almost poetry. Although some leave something to be desired others simply soar with excellence. At first I was annoyed by this organization, as I was drawn into the story of the Joad family and hated being taken from it, but then as the novel progressed I got used to the alternating chapter focus and I began to like it. After finishing the text I can't imagine the novel without it.The novel's strongest point is the characterization of the Joad family. Mr. Steinbeck has a wonderful gift of creating stark full characters with an economical use of prose. He \\"shows\\" us these people, he does not tell us about them. It is almost like you are peeping into their minds and lives, and accordingly there are many moments where much is left unstated. But Steinbeck has created such textured characters you know what has been left unsaid and have already filled in the blanks.I loved the character of Ma Joad and her simple philosophy of life. She swings from the heights of authority to the shadows of self doubt with such fluidity and simplicity that she reeks of reality, and personally I found Steinbeck's first description of her (on page 74 in the centennial edition) to be some of the finest character writing I have come across in a novel.Many readers are irritated by Steinbeck's overt socialism in the text, and I admit it is obnoxious at times, but I was not so bothered by it that I had to stop reading. I am not even sure that Steinbeck is extolling socialism as much as he is preaching the \\"golden rule\\". Rather, what I was more bothered by was his lazy characterization of people with money. If you are a banker, or a corporate farmer, or someone with money you are bad, period and nothing further need be said. Contrasted with the rich characterization he did with other characters (specifically the Joad family) I was annoyed by this lazy attempt at one dimensional characterization. It takes away from the humanity of all people, which I think is counter to one of the book's prevalent themes.\\"The Grapes of Wrath\\" is an astounding text, and one that I found to be gripping and human. Despite some flaws it's themes of the resiliency of the human spirit and the strength to be found in family is needed and relevant. I was so wrapped up the in the last 150 pages of the text that I had to keep reading. What I was reading was wonderful and terrifying at the same time, and this epic (almost Biblical) tale merits your attention."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"I read Grapes of Wrath for my AP English class, and it was a struggle to start, but at the end even I was swayed by its mastery.It's very depressing, cruel and harshly realistic about the Dust Bowl and Okalahoman farmers moving to California. California, to look for a new beginning, is their destination. And along the way, it's all about the struggles as humans they go through, their self sacrifices, soul searching and willingness to band together just to get through it alive.If nothing, Grapes of Wrath is moving, and heartbreaking but tedious with description and choke full of lengthy descriptions. I don't recommend this if you absolutely hate historical fiction, as it takes a certain preference of historical fiction to enjoy this novel. I liked it in the end. Maybe it's because I'm a sucker for historical fiction, maybe it's because I was forced to read it, but I enjoyed it. I don't think I could've grasped the symbolic Christian references - and I think it would be much more appreciated by a more worldly, older generation than mine.Regardless, try it. It's a classic anyway, there must be a reason for that. Maybe you'll even like it at the end like me."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"Used book in good shape, just what we were looking for instead of buying new.Book arrived quickly. Was satisfied with purchase and would use Amazon/Mass Market Books again in the future."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"There are books that you read for entertainment and books that you read because you have been told you should. This is a novel I had been told to read for years. I heard from everyone how much I would love it. So I tried several times and just could not get into it. It didn't grab me right from the start as some stories do. Then, one day, I decided to give it one last try. For whatever reason I was finally ready and wow, did I love it! The plight of the Joad family evoked such a combination of despair and hope that I felt as though my heart would burst. I had read Steinbeck before, (\\"East of Eden\\" is one of my favorites), but \\"The Grapes of Wrath\\" is so relevant to the present economic situation in this country that it really struck a chord with me. I imagine there are many American families living a modern-day version of this story. Steinbeck was a master and his vision extends into a future we can only imagine. I don't think you can rate this novel on the same scale as other works sold on Amazon. If I could I would give it ten stars, at least."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"I recently read John Steinbeck's \\"Travels With Charley\\", which I also highly recommend. Though I've seen the movie, \\"Grapes of Wrath\\", many times I decided to read the book. It is exquisite literature and the kind of writing we do not see enough of these days with formulated novels that are, in fact, screen plays waiting to happen. I encourage anyone who has reverence for words, to read this stunning novel for every word, line, and paragraph yields a poetic depth, understanding, and insight into an important part of our country's history."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"I had always thought of myself as lucky for avoiding authors like Steinbeck and Fitzgerald in both high school and college, but after reading \\"The Grapes of Wrath\\", I realize now I did myself a service. Being below the age of 18 in high school, and still being financially supported by my parents in college, I would have probably knocked the book. I think the themes in the book are so complex and so adult that there is definitely a maturity level that needs to be reached to appreciate the book.Steinbeck does an excellent job of relating to the Joad's struggles, painting a picture of the depression, and truly captures the pain and reality of the travels to the west in 1939. Just from reading the book made the depression so much more alive where I could feel the Joad's heartbreak. I was just sick reading about the treatment of the people, but relieved to see the acts of kindness done throughout the novel. My favorite character was by far Ma. She set an example of how to keep a family together and the true definition of a humanitarian. Though I wouldn't have begged to read this book in high school, or college, I am truly appreciative that I waited to read it."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"\\"Bobby, I'm tellin' ya, if'n ya read'at book it'll only make ya mad,\\" Pa said, one eyebrow raised higher than the other.\\"But, Pa, it's 'bout us and our fambly, ain't it?\\" Bobby asked, rubbing his ear.\\"It ain't 'bout our fambly in name, but it is 'bout people from Oklahoma, people like us.

It is excellent through and through. I know this is a book that is commonly read in high school. Since I did not read when I was young I deprived my self of some great reading. The begining I thought was slow, until the story hits the road, then I start to really feel their plight. My father had worked in real life in a apple cannery in California for a short time, he always said the \\"Okies\\" were some of the nicest most generous people you would ever want to meet. It is certainly ironic to read a book about oppression and discrimination by white people and to see that it is the same race of people who treat them as animals. That tells me that racism is much deeper than the color of your skin. If everybody read this, perhaps people would be more tolerent and compasionate, I know this is how the book made me feel. The end is tragic but so were the lives of many of these real Americans who were displaced by the Dustbowl."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"The story unfolded with a vivid depiction of the state of Oklahoma land. Weather was scorchingly hot and dry, land was parched and harvests were unsatisfactory. To the Joad family, their livelihood, well-being, families, and happiness - in short, their everything - all hinge on the cultivation of that piece of land. However, they were forced to move west in search of money and food when their land was taken over by the bank, symbolized by the tractor. The early chapters of the book hence gave a poignant portrayal of the encroachment of capitalism on a largely agrarian society and the resulting clash between workers and owners of the land. As the families moved westwards they encountered various problems, such as lack of food, low wages, floods, torrential rains and unreasonable policeman. Yet they did not give up.John Steinbeck ended the story with finesse (I shan't elaborate on this here, lest it spoils your reading experience), further reaffirming the central message of the book - the triumph of human dignity, determination and perseverance. The story did not end with the Joad family making big money, transforming themselves from rags to riches. The writer chose to end it in a more subtle way, leaving room for readers to imagine. \`Grapes of Wrath' also paid tribute to motherhood, as Tom Joad's mother rose to become the figure of authority in the family, giving support and charting the direction forward for the family in the later part of the book.I like the way John Steinbeck incorporated detached, short and sweet third person narratives into the story, giving it a fuller and more complete touch. I also fancy the dialogues, and the interplay between the imagery of the environment/weather and the development of the storyline. In all, I enjoyed reading \`grapes of wrath'. A very apt metaphoric title indeed, for anger was brewing in the hearts and minds of the migrant family who helped pick the grapes that were in abundance in the orchards, but yet did not get to eat them.P/s: Frankly, if not for the American names, dialogues, and locations, I would have thought that the story could have also happened in Communist China in the early 1900s. Is the writer trying to mock at capitalism gone wrong? Do segments of the story not sound like a reversal of the American ideals of freedom, liberty and equality? A reflection of the state of American society after the great depression??"},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"\\"Wow, This book is boring\\"--Thats what I was like after reading this book for 1 hour (I only got 17 pages read). The beginning of this book isn't that great, but trust me, it becomes more interesting and you start to get pulled into the book. Steinbeck does a good job of holding the readers attention after like the first 50 pages of the book. You learn history, and you get a great novel ALL IN ONE! People, I urge you to read this book, do not be afraid of the first 50 pages (they will lead you to the good part). Oh yeah, if you liked this book after reading it, read Of Mice and Men (its even better in my opinion)."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"what more can i say about john steinbeck's classic novel about the dustbowl? not much that has already been said.this novel is detailed and extensive. to sum it up.it is the joad family,circa 1939 from oklahoma,forced to leavetheir ramshackle house,on the road,heading for california\\"there might be some work there\\",meet some mean people,meet some nice people,granpa and granma die along the way,hunger,some violence,and, a still birth child andat the very end...a type of \\"re-birth\\" or at least an idea that these folks will survive as they have thatinstinct in their blood. let us hope so.this book is for older teens and adults. much of the dialog is what i would call,\\"local color\\" or in other words,it is written the way these people speak. for those who have not read it,it is a great american novel,an americanstory(our story) about the american people of the lost and lonely dustbowl era. sit back and enjoy. i think mostreaders will never forget this book."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"\\"The Grapes of Wrath\\" written by John Steinbeck is one of the most telling stories written about the migration of people from Oklahoma and Arkansas during the Great Depression. Steinbeck is truly one of the great American novelists. The characters come to life. The descriptions of the land, the journey and the people far exceeds anything ever written about this time in American History. The story holds true even today. This is a must read for everyone. I read it years ago, the the reread was even better!"},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"I don't know about other reviewers but I found this book really hard to get started. Its grim tone hits you hard in the face and it's no surprise that Steinbeck said of the book that \\"I've done my damndest to rip a reader's nerves to rags\\". But once you can adapt to the bleak tone of the book (and the narrator) it becomes deeply compelling, to the point where you will want your car journey to work to last just that little bit longer so you can listen to that little bit more.Anyhow, to let you know what the audio version of the book is like, it is first rate. Many audio books pick readers who have little to no versatility in conveying their charactors and read the book as if reading the football results. John Chancer is different as he really conveys well the 12 charactors of the family, so much so that you could swear that you've actually met the family and heard their voices!One limitation of the package is that it is a box with 16 CD's in 16 in fiddly thin sleeves. The CD case has a tendency to fall on the floor and chuck its contents all over the car, which is highly annoying when you are endeavouring to concentrate.But, aside from that, the story is excellent and the narrator creates a rich cast of voices to fit the landscape of the book.Incidentally, anyone who's a fan of the comedian Bill Hicks may be interested to know that this book was said to be his favourite. Hicks loved the book so much that he even based his 'famous last words' on Tom Joad's final speech \\"I left in love, in laughter, and in truth, and wherever truth, love and laughter abide, I am there in spirit.\\"Although Tom Joad's final speech is actually different, the spirit is the same and it's easy to see why he picked that part as it is easily the most profound part of a deeply moving novel."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"I read this thing once every couple of years.

On his way to his former home he finds a turtle that he keeps as a pet present for his little brother Noah. The turtle may stand as a metaphor for the slow but secure progress of the narrative. Tome also meets a \\"reformed\\" preacher who likes to question the goodness of baptism, and a former neighbour, Muley Graves, who has decided to stay in the land in Oklahoma contrary to the general westward pull: \\"Place where folks live is them folks.\\"As he meets them, the Joads are getting ready to sell all their belongings and move to California. But how will their sense of identity be affected by the migration? The author seems worried about the conflict between the land and the machine. Something worse than the devil seems to have got hold of hte country and thousands of people are moving West, looking for something brighter than what they have got. Is it possible to relinquish your home and survive it whole? On their way to California they learn the value of sharing and helping one another after they meet the Wilsons. One thing is sure, and these mass migrations are the proof that men can still be moved by a concept, a palpitating notion, a dream (even if such dream is reduced to the image of a white house by an orange groove).One is to fear the day when man will refuse to move about, search, project. Even if this search is to lead to tragedy and loss. The will to live and to die and to survive for a concept makes of man a distinctive being in the universe: \\"Need is the stimulus to concept, concept to action.\\" But can Paine and Jefferson exist alongside Marx and Lenin? From the point of view of the American dispossessed this seems dubious.Economic racism (\\"them Okies\\") and the ills of American capitalism work into the spirit and capacity of endurance of the worn-out families of migrant agricultural workers. These families have ironically held a belief on the myth of the American dream: a place can be found where an honest man can work steadily his way to respectability. Nevertheless the Joads only find their own progressive breaking-up in the motion. Theey learn of the prejudice and fear of the authorities and citizens of California, and of the untold speculative crimes of the big and medium farmers. The wrath of The Grapes of Wrath is the sign of hunger and frustration at the way things are made to work: unused land and crops laid to waste.The novel is a chant to family values and communal living, even if from the wrong side of the road. Tom Joad learns the importance of forming part of a larger group, even if he eventually gets separated from the people he loves because of his crimes. What is it that makes people survive under the most terrible conditions?"},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"I read maybe two books a year, and it's sometimes hard to keep up with this characters and details of a book as a result.

Heartbreaking, full and exceptionally beautiful in its scope, it is a singular American classic that is equal parts literature and lesson."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"The Grapes of Wrath is a book set during the Depression and the Dust Bowl. It tells the story of one family, the Joads, but shows the roughness and impact this time had on all people. The family leaves their farm in Oklahoma and travels to California to find work. Half of the characters die or desert the family by the end of the novel.I felt that the book was genius when it came to themes and exploring human characteristics, but the actual book length was much longer than needed to put the points across. Steinbeck has a wonderful ability of taking on a character and revealing common human weaknesses and the affects these personality traits can have on other people.The structure used in this book is unlike any I have ever seen. It reminds me of the ties on a railroad. One chapter will speak very broadly about the whole movement west, and then the next will discuss the Joad family's own problem concerning this matter. But really they are all connected to each other and continue in this repeating pattern. I feel that the most important theme in the book is mans inhumanity to man. Steinbeck wants to prove that almost all of the hardships that this certain family endures are a direct result of another person's action rather than the weather or some other inanimate object. He does do this extremely well and I highly commend him for this."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"This book is a Classic tale about the Joad Family who are on the road to California in search of a better life. The characters in this book are real and this story was based on fact as the farming fields of Oaklahoma turned into giant dustbowls. The Joad family encounter many obstacles on the their journey but their optimism reigns Supreme. This is a wonderful tale about the Resilience and Triumph Of The Human Spirit in the Face of Severe Adversity.According to his biographer John Steinbeck was once photographed with a Whiskey bottle on his workdesk which gave the impression that he was another alcoholic writer like Hemingway. The reality was and is that Mr. Steinbeck was a moderate social drinker whose only vice was cigarettes.This can be attested to in his journey across America in his most excellent book \\"Travels With Charley\\". It is also a great pleasure for me to discover a Literary Genius who do not use his writing ability as an excuse to indulge in excessive drinking , cavorting with prostitutes and ingesting illicit substances.Thankfully there are some writers who led a decent, honest and hardworking life."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"By Nicole FasolaI thought The Grapes of Wrath was a very well adapted movie, from the original novel by John Steinbeck.The movie (and book) was about Tom Joad, a man (played by Henry Fonda), whose Oklahoma based family is forced to move out after the Great Depression. Their only chance to find work was to pack up and move to California where 800 workers were supposedly needed. They then go on a long journey to California to find out that workers weren't really as needed as they thought.One of the things that really differentiate the movie from the book was that a majority of time in the book was spent actually looking for work once the Joad's were in California. In the movie, it seemed like they were in the car the whole time. I think that one of the problems with adapting such a long book like The Grapes of Wrath into a movie is choosing what to include. The screenwriter's chose to go into more detail about how difficult it was to get to California, and all that they faced going there, instead of when they actually got to California and had to search for jobs.Some other things about the movie that were different from the book were how minor characters in the books didn't have as big of roles in the movie. For example, in the book, there was a couple called the Wilson's, that actually traveled with the Joad's for a while. There were not included in the movie at all. Some other characters that weren't included were minor characters who would go to work with the Joad's, or eat with them.I thought that the cast of The Grapes of Wrath was very good. I especially thought that \\"Ma Joad\\" was very much the same in the book and movie. She had the same toughness in both installments, and also had an emotional side. I thought the transition from book to movie for Tom Joad wasn't as good. In the book, he seems more like a tough, scary kind of guy, while in the movie, he seems more sensitive, and emotional. He didn't seem like he could have actually killed a guy.The last thing that they could've added into the movie would've been the last part of the book! The movie ends when Tom leaves the family and the family packs up and moves somewhere else. They never even got to the part where Rose of Sharon has her baby. That part of the book isn't essential for the story, but it does help conclude things nicely.Even though there are many thinks that I think they should have done differently, I still thought that it was very well made. It really showed how difficult it was to get to California, how the family was breaking apart, and how difficult it was finding work. The book and movie are both worth investing time in."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"This last week I finished reading The Grapes of Wrath by John Steinbeck. If you have not found your way to this book yet, you need too. Spawning from the Great Depression era, this intriguing piece follows the downfall of the Joad family on their cross country trip to California. The age of industry and of the machine forces the Joad's off their farm, and having few options, they pile into their broken down truck towards California in hopes of big jobs and big dreams. The Grapes of Wrath is a wonderful historical piece of fiction that is a must read for every American. It brings to life every American issue; the American Dream, family, capitalism, religion, and sexuality, as well as numerous others. I recommend reading this book in the Spring or Summer as it is very dark, but it has to be. It is a long book, with a controversial ending that still has people talking."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"The Grapes of Wrath, portray a migrating family that is in search of a better future after they were brutally kicked off their own land by the \\"bank.\\" The Joads encountered several problems, not only with the conditions of the vehicles and food, but with the people of other regions. In every region people viewed outsiders as a major threat, and treated them as criminals.Steinbeck took one family and related their circumstances with many. The journey of pursuing a better future with everything at stake adds a sense of suspense to the overall theme of the novel.He was able to capture the despair of not being able to feed their children or to provide a stable household. The novel keeps the reader intrigued with what is going to happen next, a true classic."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"This moving novel captures the heartbreak of people driven into poverty by events beyond their control. Author John Steinbeck (1902-1968) examines the hardships faced by \\"Okies,\\" displaced farmers of the 1930's who headed for California and tried to scrape by as migrant workers.The story centers on the Joads, a family of destitute Oklahoma farmers that head for California in hopes of finding work as fruit pickers. Death and misery accompany their journey, and things aren't much better once they arrive. The people (and law) in California fear and mistreat newcomers, and what little work is available invariably involves long hours and poverty-level wages. The only time the Joads get respect is when they lodge at a modest U.S. Government camp for transients - the author once toured such camps with first lady Eleanor Roosevelt. The book's ending is powerfully inconclusive, reflecting the sturdy will of people to endure hardship as the Great Depression drags on.This book captured the 1939 Pulitzer Prize. It was also turned into the classic 1940 movie starring Henry Fonda - a movie that was often filmed in secret due to lingering resentment against \\"Okies.\\" I gave the book just four stars because in places it lags a bit, but it remains a powerful statement for caring government and help for the dispossessed."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"Few novels portray the Hunger of the human spirit with more compassion and talent than Grapes. This was Steinbecks strong suit. Say what you will about his leftist, \\"Socialist\\", leanings, I believe Poore said it best; \\"Steinbeck didn't need the Nobel Prize the Nobel judges needed him.\\" Poore concluded: \\"His place in [U.S.] literature is secure. And it lives on in the works of innumerable writers who learned from him how to present the forgotten man unforgettably.\\" And this, Steinbecks masterpeaice, remains their blueprint."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"I was literally blown away by this writing. I assumed, prematurely, that a 'classic' would be a dull read; however, Steinbeck's descriptive and emotionally charged dialogue is compelling and engaging. A must!"},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"The Grapes of Wrath truly is the Great American Novel. From the Dust Bowl of Oklahoma to the grim and cruel lives faced by migrant workers in California, the story captures the heartache of the Great Depresssion and the power and redemption of the human spirit. Steinbeck captures the spirit of the times perfectly through his compelling characters. This is as good as it gets.I listened to the unabridged audio edition, and it is fabulous. The narrator is extraordinarily talented and completely captures the spirit of this classic. His dialogue is perfect.If I have one complaint, it is that the primary hero of the story simply drifts off in a bit of an anticlimax. But that's probably necessary to the overall plot. Taken as a whole, the story is the most moving and inspirational work of fiction I've ever read or heard."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"This was required reading in HS which, of course, I didn't do :025 years later I decided to read many of the literary classics that I faked my way through. 'Grapes of Wrath' took me about 100 pages to get locked into. Steinbeck's writing style was difficult for me to digest at first. Once I got hooked, I went back a re-read the first 100 pages. At 500 pages it took me a couple of weeks to get through. But at every sequential reading session I found myself covering more and more pages until I read the final 100 pages in one sitting.Great story based upon anecdotal evidence that probably played out in many variations, thousands of times for thousands of 'Oakie' families after the great depression and dust bowl periods."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"The Grapes of Wrath, written by John Steinbeck, is a brilliantly crafted work that appeals to readers of every class and background. It brings to life the battles of injustice and the strength of a family bond that all Americans, young and old, can identify with. Steinbeck masterfully illustrates the movement and transformation of an entire nation and the struggle of the powerful verses the powerless that accompanies this changing America.John Steinbeck's background and the events that he experienced while writing this novel helped to add realism and believability to his work of fiction. He wrote The Grapes of Wrath in the late 1930s during the Dust Bowl and the Great Depression. Drought and the Great Depression left workers without jobs, money, or food. Many people could not pay back their loans or mortgages so the banks took their houses and land, forcing them to migrate to a place where they hoped to start over. Since Steinbeck lived in California during this time of despair, he witnessed what happened to the people who migrated to his home state. He even lived with a family in Oklahoma and traveled to California with them so that his story could be as realistic as possible.The Grapes of Wrath plots the struggles of the Joads, an Oklahoma Dust Bowl family who is forced off their land and journey's to the \\"Promise Land\\" of California. Steinbeck tells the tales of their family and the millions that traveled beside them, pointing out the many injustices they all faced. People were thrown out into the elements when the banks came in like \\"snub-nosed monsters, raising the dust and sticking their snouts into it, straight down the country, across the country, through fences, through dooryards\\" (35). The protagonist of the novel is Tom Joad, the Joad's oldest son, who has just been released from prison. He returns home to find his family's farm abandoned and destroyed. Tom finds his family packing all of their belongings into a broken down pick-up truck at his Uncle John's house. They have decided to take the risk and make the long journey West to find work. This journey is filled with tragedy and struggles as the strong bond of the family begins to slowly break apart. Injustice and discrimination linger in each town, waiting for the Joads to arrive. They are viciously called \\"Okies\\" (279) and are forced to stay in dirty camps called \\"Hoovervilles\\" (234). They struggle to find work, prevent starvation, and fight for their pride. Tom tries to defend his family and people but goes too far and is forced to go into hiding. He eventually leaves his family to try to organize the migrant workers to fight while his pregnant sister Rose of Sharon uses her gift to help her fellow man. The story leaves the reader with a sense of hope that the migrant families will soon break free from their \\"slavery\\" and discrimination.Throughout his novel, Steinbeck effectively uses shifts in point of view to completely develop his ideas. He uses a narrator that is omniscient and all-knowing for a majority of his book. This gives the reader insight on the thoughts of all the characters as well as society. At some points during the novel, the narrator describes broad, social events that an entire group of people are experiencing. Also, the narrator can take on the voice of a type of individual that is a part of this group of people (like a migrant farmer or a California landowner). Steinbeck shows the readers both perspectives to try to capture the time as accurately as possible. Finally, many times the narrator is also objective and unnamed, like a detached observer who does not assume a character's perspective. It seems as though the narrator is there watching while the Joad family's lives unfold through conversations.Along with changing the perspectives throughout his novel, Steinbeck also utilizes many different and important literary devices. He effectively employs diction, tone, and structure to develop his plot and themes. Steinbeck's unique and descriptive diction develop his own informal style of writing. He uses a mix of both middle and low diction to illustrate the lives of the farmers. He is very descriptive and applies middle diction to paint a picture of the setting and important events of the time. \\"To the red country and the part of the gray country of Oklahoma, the last rains came gently, and they did not cut the scarred earth\\" (1). Steinbeck also uses low diction and dialect when the characters have conversations to illustrate their backgrounds and to make his novel more realistic. He utilizes plain, easy to understand language so that the common man, woman, or child can read and understand his novel. He wrote The Grapes of Wrath to illustrate the plight of the lower class farmers of the Great Depression and intended that people of all economic and social backgrounds could discover his themes.Steinbeck also employs tone and structure to highlight his themes. He gives his novel a sympathetic tone toward the migrant families and at times it is apparent that he is outraged by the injustices that they face. But he knows that those injustices empower the workers and they will soon unite together. \\"Here is the node, you who hate change and fear revolution. Keep these two squatting men apart; make them hate, fear, suspect each other. For here \`I lost my land' is changed; a cell is split and from its splitting grows the thing you hate-\`We lost our land'\\" (151). Also, Steinbeck uniquely structures his novel to show the readers different perspectives and to foreshadow the future tragedies and hardships that the Joads will face. He precedes major events with short chapters that describe the state of America and that foreshadow the future. Steinbeck's use of diction, tone, and structure does an excellent job of creating an interesting plot and serving as a way to introduce his many themes.Finally, Steinbeck uses his choices in characters, plot, and setting to highlight his intended themes. He portrays a poor and struggling family from Oklahoma as the main characters of his story so that he can illustrate his theme of the powerful against the powerless. The Joads are left with nothing after the bank takes their land and are forced to leave the dry, dust-filled Great Plains where \\"it was black night, for the stars could not pierce the dust to get down, and the window lights could not even spread beyond their own yards\\" (3). Here the land is brown and dead, it has no power and no promise for a better future. So they travel to the California \\"Promise Land\\" which is full of \\"Valleys in which the fruit blossoms are fragrant pink and white waves in a shallow sea. The full green hills are round and soft\\" (346). California is green and alive, growing with opportunity and power, waiting to create brighter futures. The Joads are the stereotypical \\"Okies\\" that are forced to carry all of their belongings in a broken down truck and face the discrimination of people who do not understand their desperate situation. They do not have work, money, or food and as a result are left powerless. Ultimately, Steinbeck shows how a family's bond and the strength of women as the holding force of a family can overcome all injustice and unite people together.In the end, Steinbeck has created a brilliant novel that effectively utilizes many literary devices to illustrate the battle between those that have and those that do not. The migration of a country was filled with injustice and it brought out the best and the worst of America. Steinbeck could use his novel to unite a country, and to show people what The Grapes of Wrath can accomplish. \\"The break would never come as long as fear could turn to wrath\\" (435). Ultimately, the powerless migrant workers used their \\"wrath\\" to make \\"grapes\\" and good out of a terrible situation. Families came together and demonstrated how unity can powerfully defeat hardship and injustice."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"John Steinbeck's The Grapes of Wrath stands as the greatest piece of literature from the Depression era. No other work is as effective in portraying life at that time. The Joad family's struggle and journey are remarkably vivid to the reader, as Steinbeck makes it impossible not to sympathize with them. Steinbeck's writing style, as usual, makes for a great read, as he goes back and forth between the Joads and a kind of sweeping overview of the attitudes and effects of the Depression overall. But it is the Joads story that is really the meat of this incredible tale. I fully reccommend it to anyone; few works have had such a great influence and mark on American literature."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"Steinbeck made a living description of the live of Joad. I like some characters he created such as Tom Joad, Ma, and Casy(the preacher). I love some coversation concerning religion like Casy's self-confession. Also, when uncle John asked Casy if he was sinful or not, Casy said that a man had no right to tell another man what should do and what should not do. He also mentioned that one should not tell his sin to others so that he himself could feel better. Since I myself was in similar situation, I know better what I should do now.Now when I saw beggers and immigrants in my city, I start wondering if they led a similar life as the Joad did. I start sympathizing them. While before, I didn't like them, thinking them rude and civilisation-distroying people. Now I think everyone is equal to have a right to live better."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"The Great Depression in the 1930s continues to be regarded as the worst trauma of twentieth century America, and its scars are still felt to this day. If not for anything else, John Steinbeck will probably be regarded as the greatest chronicler of this cataclysm. THE GRAPES OF WRATH is arguably the best novel about the struggles of the poor during this time. Focusing on the hardships of the Joad family and their friends, Steinbeck gives us, in microcosm, a look at the entire population of the dispossessed of the Great Depression. The constant hunger, searches for work, violence, betrayals and setbacks that the Joads endure would have produced a grim and depressing novel in a less skilled writer's hand, but Steinbeck does not allow his characters to give in. In spite of all the calamities, the Joads maintain dignity, courage, and hope. Fortunately, for America, the poor did maintain these virtues, otherwise it would have vanished or rebelled, throwing the nation into anarchy. THE GRAPES OF WRATH, however, shows our generation just how close we came.Rocco Dormarunno, author of THE FIVE POINTS."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"I'd highly recommend this book. I've read other works by John Steinbeck such as East of Eden (not a favorite), The Pearl and Of Mice and Men (liked both), but the Grapes of Wrath is a favorite. I was deeply moved by the Joad family story. Despite their hardships, injustices, and loss of family, they press on hoping for a better life and willing to work for it. There are some good lessons learned in their story."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"\\"The Grapes of Wrath\\" was the one great novel Steinbeck was born to write. Of the authors 17 books I dear say this must be the best one. The novel won Steinbeck the Pulitzer Prize in 1940, and it was \\"a cornerstone\\" of his 1962 Nobel Prize award.From the first page I fell in love with Steinbeck's way of writing, his humble and delicate language. Published in 1939, \\"The Grapes of Wrath\\" is the story of the 250 000 American migrants who pulled up, and headed west on Route 66 - to California.Through the book we follow one of the families that headed west, The Joad family. We enter the story as Tom Joad, one of the children in the family, gets out of jail. He comes home, finding his family suffering from the Dust Bowl and the Great Depression. Tormented and forced to leave their land, the Joad's strap as many of their belongings as they can to their truck. With the truck piled high they hit the road for their journey to promise land - to California.The Joad's believe that leaving Oklahoma for California is the answer to all their troubles. California will be abundant with opportunities - work for everyone, plenty of food, oranges and peaches on every tree. Pa even has a leaflet saying they need thousands of men on the farms. Reality will soon catch up with them. The journey to California turns out to be everything but easy. They experience all sorts of hardship; loss of family members, trouble with the truck, harassment by the police and locals. When the Joad's finally make it to California, their troubles and suffering are rewarded not by work, plenty of food, and oranges on every tree, but with even more troubles. While moving around, following the different picking seasons chasing for work, the family is enduring such poor living conditions. They are living in squatter camps, government camps, and in the end shacks in labour camps.The characters in \\"The Grapes of Wrath\\" are all very well developed. They are so vivid and one cannot help but to care deeply for them all. Several of the characters have left a lasting impression; Tom Joad, Grandpa, the courageous ex-preacher, and above all Ma Joad. She is a loveable, courageous, strong woman and I admire her spirit, dignity and her determination as she struggles to keep her family together. Even facing so much testing and hardship, she still keeps perspective and hope.An experiment that works well in this novel is the \\"in-between\\" chapters. Short stories with reflections and background about the Great Depression; how a used-car dealer take advantage of his desperate customers or how farmers sprayed oranges with kerosene and threw potatoes in the river to keep market prices up while hundreds of thousands of people was starving, as well as other small stories, true literary treasures such as the first \\"in-between\\" chapter about the turtle.\\"The Grapes of Wrath\\" is written in a most memorable way. The book is no less than a landmark in American history and it is one of the absolute greatest and most significant novels of the last century. This book deserves every bit of praise and reward that it has received. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"Most of the review accurately recap the plot of this masterpiece, so I will avoid doing that in my review. I have read most of Steinbeck's work and I am most impressed by the vivid skills with which he colors reality. Steinbeck's books specialize in early 20th California. This is the centerpiece of that collection.It is true that this book can be both dry and depressing at times. In reality, life also fits that description. There is not always a happy ending. This is one of the great qualities of Steinbeck, he does not feel the need for a happy ending in his work. When the dustbowl era of the 1930's dried most of America's crops in the center of the country, many people were forced to move. California was the promised land for some. For the majority, life in California was a nightmare of discrimination and starving through poor working conditions. People suffered and died. Life was harsh, and \\"The Grapes of Wrath\\" is a perfectly painted picture of that reality.While the movie version of this book starring Henry Fonda is well done, certain things are omitted. The controversial ending of the book is too much for the silver screen. The story of Tom Joad and the rest of the Joad family is enjoyable read. The fighting spirit and sense of justice in the tragic hero Tom Joad is still very real in the world today. If only there were more Tom Joad's in the world."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"The Grapes of Wrath is a powerful, heart-wrenching story of a migrant family's struggle to find a better life in the \\"Promised Land.\\" It begins with Tom Joad getting out of jail on parole, and coming home to find that his family was moving west to get out of the Dust Bowl.Believing that California would be the land of opportunity, they left Oklahoma in search of a better life. The journey was difficult, and the difficulty they faced did not end as they entered California. Rather than finding themselves in the land of opportunity, they had to endure horrible living conditions and low wages.Throughout all of this, Tom Joad is running from the law because he violated his parole by leaving California. Although he has broken the law, he dedicates his life to doing good. The lives of the Joad family are filled with overwhelming disappointment and anguish, but there is a small spark of hope for the future and for humankind which transcends this sorrow.The story will captivate you, but to appreciate this masterpiece you must read his words, not only his ideas. The Grapes Of Wrath is not just a novel; it is a flawless piece of artwork filled with figurative language, brilliant characterization, illustrative description and euphonic, melodious words. The structure of the story is very interesting as well. There are interchapters, short stories giving some background about this time period, woven throughout the entire story, and they are reflected in the later chapters.This was the most interesting and most beautifully written story that I've read in a long time. Buy it."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"The Grapes of Wrath, I remember distinctly having to read in high school, and I hated it. Now, years later, I sat down and read it again, and had so much more of an appreciation for the book and the depth at which John Steinbeck was getting to in his portrayal of the Joads' trip to California in search of the American Dream.The story has both allegorical as well as literal elements to it. Set during the depression in the 1930s, it is the tale of the migrant farm workers from Oklahoma who leave the South for a chance at better job opportunities and life in the West. Specifically, we follow the path of the Joad family in their journey, and they use a rickety old truck that can barely fit the entire family to head westward. There are some from the community who refuse to go because of their principles, namely Grandpa Joad, who holds strongly to his belief that leaving Oklahoma is admitting defeat. Tom Joad, who recently got out of jail, and Jim Casy, a former preacher, join the family on their way west. Along the way, the Joads have several mishaps and disasters, and the family tries to stay together and maintain their hope that once they get there, everything will work out for the better.One of the more interesting characters in the novel is that of Jim Casy. He continually tells the family that he is no preacher when they want him to recite some type of prayer for them, yet, despite his protests, his role to the family and significance in the book is critical to their faith, as he represents a \\"moral\\" voice in the book. He is also responsible for the transformation of Tom Joad, the book's protagonist, who slowly begins to look at life from different viewpoints after meeting the preacher, and, by the end of the book, has changed his outlook.Among one of the great aspect of the novel is Steinbeck's descriptions of 1930s California. Some may think that this is tedious to read in a novel, as we have many chapters sole devoted to descriptions of the Central Valley and its scenery, as well as the situations of the migrant workers, but it seems to me an essential tool in establishing the context from which this novel was written. In effect, it really paints a picture of what life was like for many who made the trip west, and their difficulties along the way.Not only is the novel a testament to the situation of the migrants in the 30s, but it depicts and indirectly criticizes man's inhumanity towards others in times of need. This is represented in the plight of the Joads, who represent a microcosm of a family in need during this time. These families get shuffled around from place to place, and try to keep their dignity and hopes up despite the lack of compassion from some of the landowners.I'd say that, if you have to read this in high school and don't like it, try it again a few years later down the line. There is also a movie version of this book, with Henry Fonda, from the 1940s, an excellent film that is quite faithful to the book."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"A required book is always a drag believe it or not, but the The Grapes of Wrath, written by John Steinbeck, was a different story from the beginning. The Grapes of Wrath is the story of the Joad family, who travels to California during the Great Depression (1930's. During their trip to the great land of California the Joad family goes through sadness, happiness and obstacles all while migrating to California. Once they arrive to California they are faced with racism in their own country. The attention-grabbing novel had the Joad family face racism, while migrating from Oklahoma to California. They are referred to as \\"okies\\".The heartfelt story that may relate to many people also had a twist. While traveling to California the Tom Joad, one of the main characters is faced with his past and reflects on it while making the journey. He was faced with jail, and knows that he can't be seen doing anything wrong. Scared of being caught or thrown in jail once again he and his family move on even thought they had already found a pleasant place to settle.This book deals with issues such as discrimination. In the novel the Joad family is faced with discrimination. They are lied to when they try to get a job, they are called \\"okies\\" and they are evicted from the land they travel from. This novel isn't all negative. Steinbeck also shows how the migrating families help each other by creating communities over night and then moving on, and every night communities are set up, and everyone gets along, and no one is left in hunger.This novel may be required in High School, but it is also a great book to read on your free time. Enjoy this incredible book, while learning the struggle of families that migrated during that era and still migrate with the same hope and dream of having a better life for themselves and their loved ones. This book deserves four out of five stars.Eder Gaona"},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"Hearing this story again on tape was just wonderful. The actor is very good. I love books on tape, and this is among my top favorites ever.I loved Grapes of Wrath (read in my sophomore year). It was a joy, and often hard, to rediscover this beautiful story about the determined and downtrodden Joads. This actor does a great job in rendering the characters with sensitivity.My favorite part is when they cross into CA and Mrs. Joad makes her stand, saying \\"We're not bustin' up this family!\\" This scene was just as moving on tape as it was when I first read it long ago. It brought tears to my eyes all over again. I highly recommend this audio book!"},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"Never read it in high school. I'm glad because I don't think I would have enjoyed it as much. Perhaps the best ending of a book as I have ever read. Seriously almost made me cry, which a book has never done. Guess that's why it's a classic."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"I read the reviews for this book when I was first given the assignment to read it. Some were negative, but most were positive, so I went into reading the book with an open mind. John Steinbeck is a skillful writer, and takes great care in putting his point across.This novel was not just about the depression, and the families who moved west, it symbolized all of the groups in history who were looked down upon as less than human.Though the symbolism is way out of control in this book, it shows you how careful Steinbeck is at writing."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"This is an excellent book; I'd highly recommend it. I've read other Steinbeck books such as East of Eden (not a favorite) and Of Mice and Men (liked it too). However, Grapes of Wrath is by far one of Steinbeck's best. I was deeply moved by the story of the Joad family, their hardships and their caring for others in need. What a classic!"},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"Set in the Dust Bowl of Oklahoma, and on the long road to California, the promised land in the time of The Great Depression. The Joad family is one of many families, sharecropers, thrown off thier land when the crops fail and who must become migrant workers. There is the promise of jobs in California, so to California they must go. Piling thier trucks and cars high with what few possessions they have not sold, and heading out on the road.This is more than the story of a single family though, much more. This is the story of hundreds of thousands of families, homeless and wandering and starving while trying to maintain a shred of dignity and humanity. They must endure the cruelties of the road, the police, the foremen of the farms who will work entire families all day for only enough money for a single meal's worth of food at the company store.Though this book's length is rather daunting, I found myself so caught up in the struggle of the Joads that I read through in a short time. Through the story of the Joads, the story of the migrant workers of that era is well portraied; the struggle of many in the migration, the search for work, the pain of death, the dispair of watching the children go hungry and feeling helpless to stop it."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"Interpretation of great American literature usually requires some perspective...indeed one must have lived a large portion of life to fully appreciate it's hardships. This philosophy is never more evident than when considering John Steinbeck's &quot;The Grapes of Wrath&quot;. At once a testament to human fortitude while also a study for the historian to obtain a more humanistic perspective on the Great Depression, Steinbeck achieves a sort of literary pantheon with this timeless classic.This is the story of the everyday mid-western crop farmer during the great &quot;dust-bowl&quot; tragedy of the Depression. Forced by economic and personal factors to disband their farms and land (leaving generations of family history behind), they head to California to start anew with the promise of economic stability. Alas, this notion is soon discovered to be false as life there becomes even more destitute than the one that they have just left. Steinbeck's fictitious Joad family most assuredly mirrors the many similar groups that actually made this treck across a suddenly barren mid-western United States. Hardships and sorrows accrue as their savings run out and the promise of work becomes an ever lengthening ideal. Steinbeck presents a tome that emphatically enforces this personal sorrow while maintaining a fast paced novel thats unique in literary circles. Historical accuracy is never compromised as Steinbeck keeps the State and Federal governments' skewed Depression Era's economic policies at the forefront of the story and shows how these mis-guided actions indirectly become the driver for Franklin Roosevelts &quot;New Deal&quot; policies.The overriding virtue of this work, however, is Steinbeck's ability to take the reader along and make him a part of the story. Time and again, I truly felt the compelling sadness and overwhelming desperation of the Joads plight and when this is coupled with the incredible &quot;readability&quot; of the story, one can see why this work has long been considered &quot;the great American novel&quot;. Having half-heartedly read this in high-school, I'd submit that it should be re-read by those who now have families and responsibilities...a new appreciation will most assuredly be gained and I give this my highest recommendation."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"I hadn't read this since high school. Purchased it after watching a special on the Depression and was not disappointed!"},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"Is it within Amazon's power to ban all \\"I had to read this book for class and it is sooo boring\\" reviews. Children, when you are assigned classic literature, be thankful for the opportunity."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"I admit I love Steinbeck. Fell in love with Of Mice and Men in high school (one of the few I actually read) and my all-time favorite book is East of Eden. So I kinda hoped this would be another love. I did like it, but it's a lot more depressing than anything I've read. It deals with real life, real emotions, and real poverty. You will definitely feel more empathetic to immigrants and the impoverished after reading it. I would certainly recommend this book and now know why it's a classic and required reading in many schools."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"Grapes of Wrath is historical work of fiction. Covering the migration of tens of thousands of tenant farmers from the mid-west to the West of America. The book is half-fiction and half historical narrative.Amazing and absorbing are two words that initially come to mind when recalling the story. We follow the Joads, a family of tenant farmers, from Oklahoma to California. The mid west has become a dust bowl and the crops are performing badly. The land owners are heavily indebted to the banks who call in their loans. The land owners have to bow as industrialization thunders down on them and tractors and massive earth moving machines plow and turn the land. The tenant farmers are evicted and slowly but surely, reality sets in. They have nothing but each other. All the work is out west they hear. Our story starts as they point the old jalopy west and set off for better days.Steinbeck writes the story from 3rd person perspective and writes using the vernacular one would hear if one were a fly on the wall. Only becomes On'y, something becomes sumptin, every becomes ever', family becomes fambly. After reading for a while, the voice in your head takes on a Southern drawl as you read over the exchanges of the family. Conversation is scant yet, succinct. Articulation is nonexistent but the emotion leaps from the page. It truly is amazing the amount of feeling Steinbeck manages to get across to the reader. You truly are in the wagon, tents, camps, fields with the Joads as their personal Odyssey develops.There are 30 chapters and every other one is a historical perspective that Steinbeck uses to color in the hurdles and forces working against the migrants who were headed West. These folks were treated with contempt, condescension, abuse, left to starve and physically abused by law-enforcement yet, they continued on their way with hope. The hope was eroding from within yet, onwards they went. Tight family units looking out for each other and helping others along the way.The characters all add their \\"something\\" to the story. One of the more interesting ones, for me, was the character Casey. Casey, an ex-preacher, is somewhat like the phone in the old movies. Someone would grab the phone and use it to fill in some parts of the movie. Casey has that role in some places. He's a thinker and we find him thinking and explaining things to the Joads as they come to terms with their predicament.This work is a classic, no two ways about it. It's an American Odyssey during the great depression. Down home, heart of the Nation people uprooted by progress and forced to adapt to a world that didn't want them. Excellent work.6 stars."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"As a student of History I had to read this book again. The old adage \\"There's nothing new under the sun\\" applies to the current economy and the main theme of this book. The careless disregard for fellow man in the quest for material wealth fueled by greed. This theme should be taught as a subject in American schools."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"The great depression was an unrelenting harsh time in American history where many families starved to death just trying to provide for their families. The Grapes of Wrath is an excellent book that depicts one families struggle during this time. John Steinbeck executed and wrote this story very well. He truly is an amazing author, descriptive and precise, capable of creating mood and atmosphere that makes you feel as though you are a member of the family throughout the entire story. Steinbeck is not only socially and politically observant of the times; he also adds depth to his story by depicting the conditions that the people lived in, and describing the desires of not just individuals, but the nation during the struggle of the great depression, after the dust bowl. The story is an epic tale of one Oklahoman family and their forced migration west. After having their farm and home foreclosed on by the bank, the Joads are forced to leave the only home they have ever known. With word that there is work out west they are forced to make their trek across the country to survive. Even though it happened almost eighty years ago, The Grapes of Wrath is reminiscent of what is happening now in politics. With such a large gap between the wealthy and the poor there is a sense that all people want is a fair chance in this book. I would recommend this The Grapes of Wrath to anyone who has interests in politics, history, or social sciences. John Steinbeck has a very good understanding of these and even makes a few suggestions on ideas that he thought were good and later came to be( Like rotating crops in farming, the formation of unions, and other regulations that were put into place after the great depression). John Steinbeck demanded that a full copy of \\"The Battle Hymn of the Republic,\\" be put in the first edition of his book. It contains the line \\"He is stomping out the vintage where the grapes of wrath are stored.\\" Which Of course is where he got the title for his book; also it captures the essence of his writing. If you are looking for a good fictional read, that is informative about the way people lived during the great depression, then this is the book for you."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"An oldie but one of the best.

Step back in time with Steinbeck's novel about early American life and the way people fled to California for greener pastures.The way of life before the Joad's packed up all their belongings and left, to the long hard trip out west and what they encountered once there, will keep you turning page after page.One of the top 100 novels of all time. Don't miss out on a excellent story about our American past that Steinbeck portrays in one of his finest works. A work of art."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"This brilliantly written, poetic, profound and highly political book suffers terribly from its status as \\"classic\\" which, unfortunately, frightens away many readers who would enjoy it immensely if only the writer were new or unknown.With millions of Americans again thrown out of their homes by banks, those great inhuman \\"monsters\\", the themes and plot of Steinbeck's immense reflection on the violent changes wrought by capitalism - and man's enduring struggle to retain his dignity and humanity in the face of repeated disaster - speak more directly to us now than perhaps at any time in the past fifty years.Read or reread it. Give it to your children. (Tell them it's by some guy you've never heard of but think is really amazing.)Above all, forget that it's a classic. That smells of dust - while this book, powered by rage and poetry and astonishing humor, pulsates with life."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"\\"The Grapes of Wrath\\" is truly a masterpiece of American fiction. Steinbeck is a gifted writer, and his talents are on full display as he chronicles the upheaval and trials of the Joad family, a band of 'Okies' who leave Oklahoma in hopes of a better life in California. Their story isn't specific to the Joads alone; it is the story of the dispossessed whose dreams continued to float away from them despite their best efforts to achieve them.The Joad family is forced to leave their home and believe a better life awaits them in California. Steinbeck chronicles in unflinching and bitter reality the travails of life on the road. He poignantly describes the hatred and greed of the rich against the poor, and the effect that mass-farming will have on the land. He captures the migrant life with vivid detail and touching observations.Steinbeck alternates between the Joad family's quest and the quest of all the dispossessed - the alternating chapters filled with descriptions of life during 1930s America, the depression and greed that collided when the have nots met those who had. The characters in \\"The Grapes of Wrath\\" continuously search for a better life, a life that is just as continuously denied them, as their family and their willpower breaks down. Steinbeck leaves the reader wondering what will become of the Joad family, and the others like them. And although we can guess what their plight will continue to be, the astute author leaves the reader with an indelible image of hope, however bittersweet."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"\\"The Grapes of Wrath\\" tells the story of the Joad family, small tenant-farmers from Oklahoma, who lose their home and livelihood to the twin disasters of the Dust Bowl and the Great Depression of the early 1930s. Like many others in a similar situation, they spend their meagre savings on the purchase of an old car to take them to California, which they believe to be a land of plenty and opportunity where they will be able to make a good living as agricultural workers. When they arrive there, however, they find that they have been misled. California, its population swelled by thousands of migrant workers from other parts of America, already has a surplus of labour. Unemployment is therefore high, work difficult to find, wages low even when any work is to be found, and decent accommodation unavailable.The novel tells the story of a journey, and there are echoes of two other well-known stories about journeys; the Biblical book of Exodus and the true historical story of the nineteenth century American pioneers who opened up the West. Like their ancestors, the Okies, as the migrant workers become known, travel westwards in search of a better life. Like the Children of Israel, they journey out of what they perceive as a land of bondage towards what they see as a Promised Land. There are other echoes of the Bible in the book. The very title \\"The Grapes of Wrath\\" is taken from a line in The Battle Hymn of the Republic, a poem which uses Biblical language and imagery to convey America's vision of itself as a land of freedom. Several of the Joad family have Christian names taken from the Old Testament (Noah, Ruth, Rose of Sharon). Their friend Jim Casy, a former preacher who has started to doubt his former religious beliefs, nevertheless takes on an increasingly prophetic role as the story progresses. (He significantly has the same initials as Jesus Christ).In the Bible, of course, the Children of Israel did indeed reach the Promised Land after years of wandering in the wilderness, and many of the pioneers, despite dangers and hardship, did succeed in making better lives for themselves. In the novel, there is no such happy ending for the Joads or for the others who travel the same route. Steinbeck alternates between longer chapters, narrating the story of the Joads themselves, and shorter ones commenting on the general situation of the Okies. These shorter chapters are often used as vehicles for the author's left-wing political opinions, as he attacks the various individuals and corporations who have contributed to the plight of the dispossessed. The banks and landlords, in their desire for profit, force the tenant farmers off their land. The big Californian landowners lure them with misleading advertising promising abundant well-paid work, hoping to create a labour surplus and thereby keep wages down. The motor dealers exploit their desperation to get to California by selling them overpriced, unroadworthy vehicles, which they can only afford by selling off their few remaining possessions. When they try to dispose of these, however, they find that the dealers in second-hand goods are not prepared to offer anything other than rock-bottom prices. In California itself, the agricultural employers try to keep wages as low as possible, and vigorously resist, aided by a brutal police force, any attempts on the part of their workers to form unions or to combine to raise wages. Neither the State authorities nor the ordinary people of California welcome the newcomers in their midst, seeing them as a threat to either public order or to their living standards. The result is that the Okies lead a life of great hardship, living in squalid accommodation, desperately seeking work, however low-paid, in order to keep themselves from starving.As I said, there is no happy ending for the Joads, or even a hopeful one. Indeed, there is not even an unhappy or tragic resolution to their situation. The final image of the novel is the striking one Rose of Sharon using her breast milk, after giving birth to stillborn child, to feed a dying man. There is, however, no definite conclusion to the story of the family as a whole. We do not hear what becomes of Noah, who leaves the family shortly after their arrival in California, or of his brother Tom, who has gone on the run after killing a man, or of Rose of Sharon's husband, who has abandoned her. This lack of a definite ending is not, in my view, a fault. In other works of fiction, such as \\"The Pearl\\" or \\"Of Mice and Men\\", Steinbeck showed that he was well able to write logical, satisfying endings to stories when need be. His failure to provide such an ending to the \\"Grapes of Wrath\\" was quite deliberate. There is no conclusion to the story of the Joads because there is no conclusion to the story of the Okies. Their tomorrow will be the same as their today; a desperate struggle for the basic necessities of life.In some ways- his indignation, his social concerns and in the clarity of his prose- Steinbeck reminds me of his British contemporary George Orwell. Certain passages struck me as particularly fine pieces of descriptive or polemical writing- notably the opening chapter, which describes the harsh drought which led to the creation of the Dust Bowl, and Chapter 25, in which the author contrasts the beauty and fruitfulness of the California landscape with the inhumanity of the big landowners, wilfully destroying their produce to keep prices high while other men go hungry.Criticisms have been made that not all economic migrants to California during the thirties suffered the same hardships as the Joads and that many of them actually did manage to find well-paid work and to raise their standards of living. It has also been claimed that not all Californians were as unwelcoming or hostile to the newcomers as those shown in the book. There may be some truth in these claims, but to dismiss the book on these grounds is no more reasonable than to refuse to read Dickens on the grounds that not all Victorian boarding-schools were as bad as Dotheboys Hall and not all factory owners as stony-hearted as Mr Bounderby. There can be no denying that the Depression was a time of poverty and hardship for many, and Steinbeck's novel is possibly the most powerful and memorable fictional evocation of that era. Its place as one of the classics of twentieth-century American literature is a deserved one."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"Steinbeck's &quot;The Grapes of Wrath&quot; is a fictionalized account of the plight of migrant farm workers in California during the Great Depression. Dust storms and poor irrigation have turned large areas of farmland in the prairie states into a Dust Bowl. Tenant farmers, unable to grow crops and pay rent to their landlords, have been forced off their land by the banks. The starving farmers are lured to California by the promise of plentiful fruit-picking jobs, only to find it an unattainable paradise.The novel follows the pilgrimage of an Oklahoma family named the Joads and their friend, a former preacher named Jim Casy. When the novel begins, Tom Joad has just gotten out of prison and returns home to find that his family is one of the many that have been dispossessed by the land-owning company. They are preparing to drive to California to seek better farming opportunities. The road to California is a wasteland of unfriendly cops, opportunistic salesmen, unemployed drifters, and lonely souls, all seen from the vista of the Joads' rickety truck. The chapters alternate between the Joads' specific experiences and interludes that give a sort of large-scale third-party perspective to the general plight of the land and the people.Once in the fertile valleys of central California, the Joads learn the reality of the job situation: The farm owners have lured many more people than necessary to fill the available jobs, so they get to hire those who are willing to work for the least money. The surplus of migrant farm workers group together in encampments called Hoovervilles and wait desperately for news about new jobs, while they are forced to face the hostility of the locals who call them &quot;Okies&quot; and consider them wage-deflating scabs. The living conditions are deplorable and the Joads can barely afford the most meager of food.The Joads eventually find work picking peaches at a large farm that operates almost like a labor camp, with armed guards stationed around to ensure there are no worker uprisings. It is here that Casy, who has been rallying for worker unionization, is martyrized when he is killed by a goon trying to break up a worker strike. Towards the end of the book, in Tom's &quot;farewell&quot; speech to his mother, Steinbeck conveys his message of the importance of worker organization and unionization to prevent exploitation by employers.&quot;The Grapes of Wrath&quot; is thoroughly depressing to the very end. It has been accused of being too didactic and heavy-handed, but it's a book that needed to be written and one that took a lot of guts to do so. Who else but Steinbeck could have treated the downtrodden with so much dignity and sympathy without being condescending? Who else could have invested so much detail in even the seemingly least important characters, such as the one-eyed man in the junkyard, the storekeeper at the peach farm, and the fervently religious Lisbeth Sandry, making them unforgettable symbols of humanity? This book is an education. After reading it, everything else seems shallow."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"This book brings one of the most inaccessible disasters of the 20th century, the Dust Bowl, into focus. What a mean coincidence that it had to happen when banks were going through tough times. This book, perhaps Steinbeck's best, brings the personal melodrama of Of Mice and Men on the road with a family of 14 Oklahomans. Meet the Joads, who have lived on the same land for many generations. They have killed for the land and have died for it. The bank has forclosed on the home loan, and they have been pushed out. Now they gather all they can carry with them, sell all they can't, and hit the road in a rickety car and with only about a hundred dollars and wild hopes. Grandma and Grampa are the stern, traditional voice of the family, Ma and Pa lead the family in their oddysey west, Uncle John is a booze hound with strength and grit, Noah is a strange individualist, Al is the testosterone filled young man, Tom is an ex-con who just happens to be the pragmatist and clearest thinker, Ruthie and Winfield are the wild kids, and Connie and Rose are newlyweds. I know I am forgetting someone. The book is divided into two parts: the journey to California and their heartbreaking quest to make a living. It just happens that they are members of an outcast society despised by everyone. Throughout the book they are run out of settlements, antagonized and harassed, and mistreated. A member of the oddysey is Jim Casy, a former preacher. Casy turns himself in for beating a deputy to keep Tom from getting turned in and in prison meets a man who wants to end the victimization of migrant workers. He wants to form unions. While protesting against a peach orchard (that the Joads just happen to be at) he is killed by corrupt deputies. The book is shattering in so many ways: the way the Joads are treated, how the migrants at large are treated by the cops and by the rich malevolents, and how the general people allowed themselves to be blinded by bitterness and hate. There are several deeply affecting passages: one where a bunch of oranges are dumped in a vacant area behind a Hooverville (where 'Okies' lived), then kerosene was dumped on them so that the impoverished Okies couldn't eat them; the part in which the deputies send in a starving guy to start a fight in a government camp so they can break it up (because the government camp is treating Okies like humans), one man owning a million acres and not even farming it, just owning it so he can say he owns it. These concepts of gluttony and cruelty are more than the poor migrants can take. I absolutely loved the book and think every person should read it: it shows what happens when ordinary people are hated, and how devastating and frivilous that hate can be."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"Who am I to review one of the greatest literary works of all time? Could I possibly give this book anything less than the maximum rating it so richly deserves? Should I even commence? Those were just some of my private thoughts as I finally put down a copy of this book - read. This is the book which stirred the American conscience, caused political reform and brought about change when first published in 1939. This is the book which described how families were starving to death because of corruption. This is John Steinbeck at his exceptional best. For those people who never got around to reading this engaging and absorbing account of the Joad family, may I suggest you actually purchase a copy (any copy!) and finally read it.Today the world is either in recession or emerging from the dark grip of this latest financial catastrophe. Whilst we may live in a time when millions of families are no longer allowed to starve to death - well, not in the developed world at any rate, I earnestly believe there are lessons to be learned from this book about the rich and powerful who care not for their fellow man but only for personal gain. More importantly, those lessons are as relevant today as they were in 1939.Another similarity also failed to escape my notice; In this book we see how US police and other officials use their positions of authority to threaten and even blackmail the many thousands of American migrants who were simply looking for work in order to feed hungry mouths. These people had not arrived from any foreign country and were not even black - something which would have made their persecution much easier. No!, these ordinary white American folk were honest farmers who had been forcibly evicted from their homes and the land they had worked for generations. Seventy years on, here in the UK, we are besieged by TV programmes depicting our different police forces undertaking their various duties around the country. Yet more cheaply produced \\"reality\\" television! Significantly, however, I have occasionally noticed how some police officers deliberately provoke a hostile situation where none exists. Whilst not on the scale portrayed in this outstanding work, it is interesting that I should recognise that underlying attitude of arrogant superiority.Whilst some may find the book slow going at the start, Steinbeck quickly gathers in those loose strands until they suddenly pull together to assume a story, reveal a mental photograph and produce a relevance into which the reader becomes fully immersed. I promptly learned local words and understood the dialect in which they were spoken as the Joad story unfolded. I could hear those southern accents as hardships are endured and explained through the actions of those who lived them. This was the organised, legalised daylight robbery and exploitation of the poor by the rich who were actively supported by the law enforcement agencies. A week's work for 1,000 fruit pickers paying 50 cents an hour is advertised to 3,000 hungry people who then pass on the message. Consequently, 5,000 starving workers arrive in search of that employment. With so much competition, the rate is lowered to 30 cents - take it or leave it! It was a deliberate ploy repeated time after time. Anyone attempting to organise his fellow workers is photographed, black-listed and branded a communist. Now feed that to your children. Then the banks insist the farmers reduced the rate to 25 cents and any landowner who questions that decision is swiftly reminded of his own vulnerability as a mortgagee! In short, either you pay them 25 cents or you join them! My own immediate reaction was to recognise a similarity between then and now - specifically with those modern banking practises which preyed on the sub-prime market. Anyone who cared to consider precisely what \\"sub-prime\\" meant, knew it was a policy destined to fail. And fail it did in spectacular fashion - and yet, the fat cat bankers still draw bonuses based on \\"personal performance\\" and not on their company's overall profit or loss...I note from some of the comments appended to certain editions of this book, that various issues have been produced in which, apparently, Steinbeck's prose are changed to make the work an easier read. Please don't take the easy option, take the version written as it was intended to be read - i.e. the version written by Steinbeck. If not, you cannot claim to have read this book at all - instead you have the equivalent of, say, a Romeo and Juliet story - set in Manhattan in the 21st Century - and there are plenty of those...In closing, I would urge anyone (indeed everyone) who has not already read an original version of this book to go out and buy a copy - any old copy, and then simply read it. Having done that, you too will draw parallels with our modern age and understand what I mean. You will also be richer for having done so - as would those fat cats who, unfortunately, will probably never bother. Having finally finished reading this outstanding work, I wonder how many of you will still be wondering whatever happened to that perfectly matched pair of Bays! I do...NM"},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"When I was a kid Steinbeck was one of my favorite authors. His observations always touched a nerve with me, and his characters always came alive, as the clich&eacute; goes. His stories were simple enough, the masterpiece Grapes of Wrath included, that the story enthralled me at the time, even if the politics somewhat escaped me.As most know, GOW is the story of undeserved poverty come to rest on an undeserving family. On the injustice of a capitalistic and bureaucratic society and the probable indifference of a not so loving God. Whether you reach Steinbeck's conclusions, and I personally don't, you can't escape how real the stories are themselves, how well told and entertaining and even humorous the most pointless and melancholic of human events can be.I remember as a high school kid being most disturbed by the government's attempt to battle the depression in the government's anti-common-sense way. With people literally starving to death the government, at the same time they gave handouts, were pouring kerosene on oranges and even shooting illegal \\"harvesters\\". It is hard to fathom today, the starvation I mean, not the logic twists of bureaucracy.There is a little something for everyone, for those who hate big business especially, but the government is not portrayed as much of a savior, either. If you need a happy ending this is not the book for you, but if you want one of the great American epics and a gritty slice of American history, this is a must read."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"Although it is a little slow going at the start, once you have met all the chraracters, and the main story starts, it is actually painful to put down. John Steinbecks vivid writnig keeps you engrossed in the story, and gives the reader a clear mental picture. Having also read Of Mice and Men, I expected to get that mental picture and to be severely moved by the story. All my expectations were met. He also has a writing style that lets one get close to the characters. He has a way of making the reader really care about them. He makes the reader feel as if they are actually there, feeling what the characters feel. Although The Grapes of Wrath left me feeling quite sad and angry, I was thankful for having read it. It was very well written and an influential story. It had a positive impact on me. I feel very thankful for what I have, for everything the characters knew and cared about was taken away, without question or concern. I would really enjoy reading John Steinbeck's other works."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"I had never read this book while in school, but have been trying to read some of the 'classics' on the Top 100 list. This book chronicles the plight of a midwest family as the dust bowl sets in. The famliy is forced to leave home and under the expectations of a better life and unlimited work, head west to California.The story is fascinating. The hardships that the Joads and the other displaced people is horrible. As a reader you start to sympathize with the 'Okies' and my animosity towards the Calfornia farmers grew. That is until you read a brief chapter on the issues that are driving the farmers. The state of the US economy is driving the farmers to let produce rot rather than be harvested. For the people who are starving this is another slap in the face.In reading this tale, I wondered how I would have dealt with trying to provide for my family. I can not imagine watching your child starve and not being able to do anything about it. This book gave me a greater appreciation for the depression era and what people had to go through to get by. This book should be on everyones 'must read list'."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"john steinbeck belongs to that small group of american writers able to capture a wide array of emotions and issues within a novel. 'the grapes of wrath' is certainly no exception. some readers may be put off by the book's length, or its decidedly 'okie' dialect. sure, it can be a bit tough to follow sometimes, but a couple dozen pages into the novel it's not too difficult to pick up on the dialect. and the book is quite simple to read and follow. it takes a master to keep is simple, yet profound.in 'the grapes of wrath' steinbeck once again proves he's the master of the moral dilemma--yet he doesn't dare presume to offer any answers. he puts his characters in situations and lets them succeed or fail (and they often do fail). it's one of the beauties of steinbeck's writing. while we tend to pull for his characters, we know they're as deeply flawed as they are--and perhaps that's why do we care as much as we do.the novel opens with tom joad jr's release from prison for homicide, continues through the joad's departure to california and their ultimate arrival in california and all the accompanying trouble. steinbeck, perhaps better than anyone before or since, captures the essence of america. what does it mean to be an american? what did it mean to be an american during the depression? how do we, as americans, treat our fellow citizens? what are our rights and obligations as citizens of this great country? as i mentioned earlier, steinbeck offers no answers--but eloquently poses the questions (as any good literature worth its salt will do). in many ways the joads are the quintessential american family, warts and all.what surprised me most, however, about 'the grapes of wrath' is that it's very much a story about matriarchy and the power of women. ma joad is one of the strongest women i've read about in literature. her's are the most heartbreaking scenes (when they're stopped at the border; when rose of sharon gives birth; when tom jr repeats his crime), yet she always comes out stronger and wiser. it's ma joad who herds the family. it's ma joad who looks after the men in her family. it's ma joad who understands why her husband and children behave the way they do. she's literally the glue that keeps the family together. i applaud steinbeck for writing such a profoundly wonderful, complex, and postive female character during a time when a lot of writers seemed to treat women as afterthoughts (hemingway?).there's much to admire in steinbeck's writing. as a writer, he's nearly unmatched. as a social commentator, he's peerless. as an advocate for the underpriviledged, displanced, and desperate, he's the master."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"When was the last time you read The Grapes of Wrath? I myself had not picked it up since I first read it, more than thirty years ago. I remembered the bare outlines of the plot, including the famous last scene, but little more. This time, I was struck by the force of many scenes: the brutality of the tractors that tear through the homes of tenant farmers, the plain rendering of the little caf&eacute; on the road to California, the small luxuries at the government camp in California. The characterization of Ma Joad as she struggles to feed her family is unforgettable. Most of all, I admired Steinbeck's handling of tone. The novel interweaves chapters of more general socio-economic observation into the story of the Joads. These chapters are angry ones, but Steinbeck does not permit his anger to warp his story. A lesser writer might have sentimentalized the Joads, but Steinbeck never does it, and that's what makes this a novel you should pick up once again."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"This is my new favorite book! I think it should be required reading for everyone who calls himself an American. At first, I'll admit I was intimidated by its size, but I wanted to read it because of its &quot;classic&quot; status. It earns its honored position from the start. One can compare the trials of the Joads to those of Holocaust victims or Civil War participants. I am not saying their experiences are as horrible as those of the Jews and soldiers, but it is amazing that we (as a country at the time) could care so little for our own brothers. These people were not leeches before the Bank takes over the land. They made an honest living and worked very hard for it. Then they have to force themselves to rely on the kindness of strangers when they move West. Pride is broken sometimes, but it is ultimately restored, as the &quot;reds&quot; realize they must take care of each other to survive. Also, I have never been so moved as I was by the ending. If you've read this before, you know what I'm talking about. If you have yet to be so blessed, you'll find out soon enough. Do NOT miss this awesome novel!"},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"This book is a &quot;must own.&quot;When you think that your own life is unfair or when you feel that you're doing more giving than taking and that the American Dream has passed you by, read this book.I also recommend Bruce Springsteen's &quot;The Ghost of Tom Joad&quot; (the name of the main character) as background music while and even long after you read this ...(from the CD): ...&quot;Tom said, 'Mom, wherever there's a cop beatin' a guy; Wherever a hungry newborn baby cries; Where there's a fight against the blood and hatred in the air; Look for me Mom and I'll be there ...Where there's somebody fightin' for a place to stand; A decent job or a helping hand; Where there's somebody strugglin' to be free; Look in their eyes Mom ... and YOU'LL SEE ME'&quot;."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"The Grapes of Wrath, written by John Steinbeck, is a non-fiction book, story about the Joads' family during in time of 1930's. This book can be simply described as story of a tenant's family who struggles to maintain their lives, but there's more than that. What makes this story beautiful is the author's intention to tell the readers a message called love through the story of them. The love in the story isn't romantic, but it's love within families and neighbors. The family in center of the story is about to kick out from their land. They have a son who just came out of the prison. Also a pseudo priest had joined in the family. Their occupations and situation they're in are worthless, but their love to other members is enormous. Each family member shows love and faith to the others, and it ties them all as one. They dream to have stabilized life in California, but they end up losing every thing they had. Still love remains in their heart. The family shares their love to the strangers. They offer what they could give even though they end up in a situation of barely feeding themselves, which hardly can happen. The family thinks of others who are in worse situation than them first. In the story, the love they shows to the others is big enough to revive the society where obeys nothing but money, power, and egoism. After reading this book, you'll be able to think how big the love of your family is. You also might get a chance to think about egoism, whether you weren't selfish at all. Then you'll learn that love still remains in this world even though people are becoming more world lings. Probably that's what the author wanted to say.The author's message was love to the family and others, but he also intended to give deep emotion to the readers. Therefore, he had set the characters' situation as worth as it could be, and still showing love to their neighbors. This gave the story less reality. When people lose their house, car, and got nothing left to eat, they don't have extra time to think about the others. That's how people are like. The author might want to change basic thoughts of people being selfish, but it made the story unrealistic. If I were the author, I would end the story as happy ending, such as reunite of the family, so the family got what they have deserved for sharing their foods and love to the others. That's more realistic.The theme of the story is love. Love is the one that makes every life in the world work properly. It isn't money or power that people satisfy with, but it is love that makes people satisfy, through their hearts too. This book shows this fact well, and is recommended to read at least once. This book is recommended to teens and older who lived to be financially rich or be famous. Once those people read this, they may get a chance to look back the life they had lived. Also they'll learn being financially rich isn't the best life, and there is nothing happier than giving and receiving love from others."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"This book is a major classic. The story flows and leads the reader into the depths of the Great Depression. Amazingly accurate and increasingly personal, the story about the Joads is very emotional.The book starts out with Tom Joad getting out from prison and expecting life to be as it was. But it isn't, instead his family is about to get kicked off the land by &quot;the monster bank owners in the east&quot;. As the story progresses, Steinbeck tells of their journey to California. The place where all their dreams will come true. But dreams aren't always reality. When the Joads finally reach California, their fantasies and visons are all shattered as they slowly realize and witness the evils of humanity.The ending is so profoundly emotional. After I finished the book, I sat there with the book in my lap, just thinking about the ending. So amazingly written. Touching and beautiful. Definately Recommended."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"I started reading Steinbeck in Middle School with The Pearl and Of Mice and Men, both which were really good. The Grapes of Wrath is a compelling story that reads very easily. Steinbeck uses great language and symbolism. I recommend reading the book and then looking at cliff/book notes. I'm a very good Eng student and understood most of the themes. But the notes help to tie together loose ends, which saves the time of re-reading the novel over and over.Read this book"},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"After all these years and many readings, this is still one of the most astounding and humanistic books in existence. Steinbeck's mastery lives on."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"At 42 years of age, I read the &quot;Grapes of Wrath&quot;. I was so moved by this book that I can't quit thinking about it. The magnitude of unconditional love which Mrs. Joad displayed for her family was second to none. The world would be a better place if all women were as good as she. This book leaves a lasting impression on its reader. A &quot;Classic&quot; it is!"},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"See how spoiled we are. I know I heard this was one of the Great American Novels, and never read it till now, and found it to be an enormous eye opener to the capatilistic bureaucracy. I became a part of the journey, and I felt the families struggle all the way to California. I was marveled by this book...and recommend it highly."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"I chose to listen to this on audio, not because I thought it looked like a good book, but because there wasn't alot to pick from. I'm glad I did, though, as I loved the story. We hear all the time about the dirty 30's and all the hard times (like walking 3 miles to school uphill in a raging blizzard) but this really makes a person appreciate what these people must have gone through. The story tended to move slowly, but that let the reader get to know the Joad family well, especially young Tom Joad. They managed to make do with very little in the way of money or food and yet wouldn't hesitate to share what they had with someone else. It makes a person feel kind of ashamed to think we look into a full refrigerator and still think there's nothing to eat. I was hoping the story would end with a happy Joad family finding a home and work, but that was left up to the reader's imagination. I don't know if John Steinbeck just got tired of writing or what, but the ending left a little to be desired. I was sure they would meet up with their son again, but that probably wasn't a realistic look at how it most likely was then. The book will definitely make me think differently about migrant workers that come into our area. Things may not be quite as bad now as back then, but they probably face many of the same circumstances."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"I bought this book on a whim, drawn by the attractive binding and it's reputation as a classic. My friends thought that I was crazy to read it on my own will, and, to tell the truth, I was somewhat hesistant myself to begin such a daunting book. Going in, I was expecting it to be boring.However, as I started to read I found that it was hard to stop. It's not that the story is compelling, but I truly loved the style of writing. Sure, the story is not fast, but from the start I felt as though I was a member of the central family, suffering in their misfortune and rejoicing in their joys. The abundant dialog allowed me to truly discover the character of everyone in the story.I admit that if I were forced to read this for classes, as well as having to contend with 4 other subjects, I would become frustrated at the slow pace. However, for never one moment did I regret my decision to read it. I highly recommend it to anyone who can enjoy the writing stlye."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"So, I'm only on page 478 of 619, but I've been disgusted at the amount of profanity. So far I've found more than 500 uses of profanity! On average every page (with relatively big writing, even) has more than one swear. Yikes!I'm never going to read Grapes of Wrath again, and won't be recommending it to anyone.If you don't like profanity, be careful."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"Excellent piece of American literature. Well written and thought provoking."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"I am a high school student, and i had to read this book for my english class. This book is very accurate in depicting the events that occured when the great depression was at its peak. It is easy to read, steinbeck does not use big words :) . I would recommend this book for any american reader!"},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"The first book on my summer AP English reading list came highly recommended, and I was excited about reading it. However, as I read more and more, I grew tired of fate's relentless assault on the Joad family.The book contains oodles of sex imagery, to the point I worry about Steinbeck's sanity while he wrote the book. An example of imagery run wild is given in chapter 5, where tractors and farm equipment are described as &quot;raping the ground methodically&quot; and many other sexual references. It's a TRACTOR for God's sake!!!! Continually Steinbeck dwells on sex whenever he can draw a metaphor.Another problem I have with the book is the constant bad luck of the Joad family. Murphy's law is proved countless times as every possiblility of good fortune is systematically destroyed. I believe if the book were three chapters longer, there would be no surviving Joads to write about.In short, while I agree the plot is rather solid, the book is a depressing saga of a family's misfortune in a time when countless other families were experiencing hardships. I recognize the historical importance and the statement this novel makes, but if I had had the choice I would not have read this book. It took me a week to get over the depression and disgust of the human race that The Grapes Of Wrath instilled in me."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"The historical part of this book is very disturbing. Things like the bulldozer going across the open plains plowing everything under was very difficult to understand from the point of view of the individual families, but from the banks view it was the only way to turn a profit or break even in the hard financial times of the Great Depression. The author also puts in the small things that add a sense of verisimilitude to the story, examples like the prices of the fruit and cotton, and the wages the pickers got for their work."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"I thought that the most significant thing in this book was when Tom was telling his mother about what Casy had said to him. Casy had said that, &quot;a fella ain't got a soul of his own, but only a piece of a big one.&quot; I think that this is significant because after Tom says this he then says that he wants to stay around and try to help the small farm farmers. In some way or another we are all connected like it says in the book, we need other people and they need us."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"great book about a family's tough journey..you won't be able to put it down. 5 stars!"},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"&quot; Her fingers moved gently in his hair.

The themes of universal and personal chapters interwoven with eachother and the theme of water, the lack of it in the beginning and the deluge in the end, the diaspora of families and the congregation of a movement."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"I admit to approaching the reading of &quot;The Grapes of Wrath&quot; with some preconceived negative notions. Having it be a &quot;required&quot; read was also not encouraging. However, about 100 pages into the story, I became captivated by the Joad family---particularly Tom, a man of great moral integrity, and the strong-willed but loving Ma Joad who provides the family's source of strength and courage in the face of overwhelming adversity. While some parts may make you flinch in horror, others will make you sad to realize these events really happened in the land of plenty.&quot;The Grapes of Wrath&quot; is an engrossing tale of one Oklahoma family seeking not their fame and fortune, but just the hope of putting a few scraps of food on the table. Join them in their clunker of a truck as all 12 of them pile in to make the long and arduous drive west to California in the hopes of finding work picking fruit. They lose family members along the way, some by death and some by choice, but they learn a lot about friendship and taking care of not only their loved ones but also the strangers who find themselves in the same dire straits as the Joads are in. Steinbeck's descriptions of the hunger, the hardship, the futile search for work, the disappointments, the hostile environment the migrants faced in California, all make for an eye-opening read. This is a great source of information on how it was for one group of people during the Depression.It may not be one of the great novels of the twentieth century, its characters are often overly-sentimental, and its theme is relatively simple, but it is a landmark of literature for the way it portrays the Depression in the western United States. This book has been proven to be an accurate portrayal of the victims of the Oklahoma Dust Bowl.Steinbeck alternates plot-driven chapters that feature the story of the Joads with chapters that focus on the large-scale problems of the economic history of California and the psychology of groups of migrants and of the landowners. These large-scale chapters provide background information and a broad world view that gives weight to the Joads' struggle, while the story of the Joads gives the large-scale chapters a sympathetic human face.Whether you love or hate the book, you will probably never forget this story of one family's valiant fight to survive while the world around them collapses and disintegrates.The novel was made into an excellent film in 1940 which starred a very young Henry Fonda as Tom Joad."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"Hello!I'm Betti from hungary, I need for a help.

I think George Orwell was a great writer (1984 especially), To Kill a Mockingbird was excellent, and I absolutely loved Les Mis, just to name a few. This book definetley has an interesting background plot, and the writing style is very good, but like another reviewer commented, it seems half-finished. Almost like Steinbeck got the idea in his head and then half-way through developed writer's block. It was a pretty good story, but it just didn't have that deeper kick to pull me in."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"This book is incredibly boring. This review is coming from a teens point-of-view. It is based in the 1930's during the Great Depression. The story flips from the Joads-a family that is moving from Oklahoma in search of work in California-to little social commentary chapters that discuss the whole situation in general. I found this to be sort of like a modern day bible for it has the Joads made up of 12 people like the 12 deciples who are being pushed out of their homes like the jews. There is a character who plays the Jesus Christ role, another who symbolizes Judas, and an unborn baby who represents Moses. Don't get me wrong this book definately makes you think, but i found my self getting annoyed with this family because of their ignorance. I don't want to reveal to much in case you want to read it but personally i advise you to give spark notes a visit. This book is also very slow so if you have a short attention span then i suggest not reading it. If you enjoy Steinbeck novels then go for it, otherwise, just buy the cliff notes. It's not worth the time."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"You'll want to use this thick boring book as a nice pillow after reading it for 1 minute."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"Unfortunately i had to read this book for my american literature class. it went on and on and on about absolutely nothing!yes mr. steinbeck is very descriptive, by he goes completely overboard in almost every chapter. i mean, does it really take a whole chapter to describe a turtle! as for the characters i thought that they were all dumb and unsympathetic. and he wrote them with such a strong dialect that i had to re-read most of it just to understand what they were saying. there was nothing that kept me interested in it or even made me want to finish it. i could have cared less if they bought their &quot;littl' white house&quot; in California. my advice to other people in my situation: buy the cliff notes. the only people i would recommend this book to is insomniacs, it is better than any sleeping pill on the market."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"Stupid socialist themes almost always bore (look at the last third of &quot;The Jungle&quot;) and this book is no exception. Unless you're a high school teacher who is hell-bent on warping young minds into America-haters, this book is not worth the time, money, or energy to read. Did Steinbeck think that a sleezy political opportunist like himself (remember, he was a big proponent of the Vietnam War when it was being run by Democrats) can actually produce work of quality? Come ON.Think about the values of this book--irresponsibility is rewarded (who asked the idiot Okie farmers to borrow from the banks in the first place?), immorality is scoffed at, at the same time religion is put down (&quot;I was 14, randy as a billy goat&quot;), and capitalism gets the blame for an economic system that was anything but capitalistic (why else have oranges and potatoes thrown into rivers other than to prop up prices pursuant to a command economic policy?). Gradually this book i! s coming to be seen as nothing more than a product of the proto-&quot;Hate American First&quot; crowd, which is why it will continue to be popular among high school teachers."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"They say a picture is worth a thousand words. Steinbeck will use a thousand words to paint a picture. He goes overboard with the detail, making it boring by modern standards, encouraging the reader to skip over entire paragraphs. It does, however, paint a very detailed picture of what life must have been like during the depression. His research was quite good. I can just see him wandering around Oklahoma and California with notebook in hand, jotting down endless details to give the book a realistic flavor. One time he used two full pages, and entire Chapter in this case, to describe a turtle crossing the road! The result is an often dull, but educational experience, if that's what you read it for. Most people buy novels for the suspense, because they are page turners. That's modern fiction, geared to readers that spend too much time watching car chases on TV. This book, however, is literary.One big problem I have with this book is the profanity. Over and over, several times a page at times, Steinbeck take's the Lord's name in vain. I read Christian fiction most of the time so that was a real turnoff. Still, I gave it three stars because it was educational and it gave me a deep appreciation for the blessings God has given me, compared to the plight of the Joad family and so many like them. Maybe if they didn't take God's name in vain so much they would have had an easier time!"},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"Simply put: I didn't like this book. There was too much description and too little plot. The characters were not appealing to me at all and I couldn't get into the story."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"Want to fall asleep? This is the book to read"},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"There have been many negative reviews for this book, but unfortunately most of them have been less than eloquent. Some of you who enjoyed this book seem to have noticed that. Well, I'm going to start this review off more than eloquently.\\"The Grapes of Wrath\\" is an utterly pointless, sneering exercise in self-importance. It seems as though Steinbeck wrote this thinking, \\"This is the single greatest piece of literature ever created by man, and I am the most amazing human being to ever put pen to paper! All will bow to me!\\" I'm so sorry to point out how wrong you are, Mr. Steinbeck.This is a story about the Joads. Fair enough. The Joads go to California in search of work because the big bad capitalists blew their house down. Fair enough. There's a great deal of not-so-subtle Christ imagery with Reverend Casy. Not entirely necessary, but fair enough. The point to all of this is, \\"The Grapes of Wrath\\" isn't so much a novel as a published mishmash of themes.The book has no plot at all. It simply follows this family as they migrate across the country while Steinbeck tells us how fantastic Communism is, and we should all do it. The author stands high on his pedestal and preaches to his readers, while failing to actually tell an engaging story.The characterization in the book is horrid. For some reason, critics find it a fabulous idea for Steinbeck to have created a group of one dimensional characters. I don't know where they studied, but to me, that's bad writing. Most of these cookie-cutter characters are hardly paid any mind during the book, and a good deal of them depart from the family by some means. The handful of characters Steinbeck does choose to focus on are in desperate need of deeper personalities. As it stands, I found it very difficult to actually care about what happened to any of them, and so I lost interest. This loss of interest makes it very difficult to read this book, because the reader must trudge through, at a snail's pace, hundreds of pages about characters he could care less about.I have a thought that the term \\"anti-climactic\\" was somehow spawned by this book. As if to prove to us that the novel does, indeed, go absolutely nowhere plotwise, Steinbeck ends the novel with Rose of Sharon offering her breastmilk to a starving full grown man. Oooh, racy, John Steinbeck, you must be a good author now! ...Well, no. After devoting several hours of my life to this monster of a book, I expected to fell a trifle more satisfied by the conclusion. Hell, \\"rah-rah communism\\" is a better ending than what is currently there.So, I really can't find a reason to like this book, and a lot of that stems from the fact that I can't bring myself to like or respect Steinbeck. Get off your high horse, already. Most people have stopped caring."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"I read this book for a report and found it really dull. I felt like it dragged on forever and ever. Yet, this is only my opinoin NOW. I'll probably reread it in a couple of years and like it."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"This book was rather long and boring then adventerous and fun. I have read many books written by John Steinbeck such as: The Red Pony, Of Mice and Men and etc. If you want to read this book then go ahead but I would rather recommend Of Mice and Men or The Red Pony."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"I've never understood why Grapes of Wrath is so highly acclaimed among the Steinbeck works. I was forced to read it the first time in a high school English course. I believed, then, that I hated the writing of John Steinbeck. Later, after I'd come to know his other works I went back for a re-read, thinking I'd been jaundiced by an HS English teacher presentation. I still didn't care for it. Of the Steinbeck works it's the only one I've never read repeatedly as I aged."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"This book demonstrated the cruelty that we, as human beings, can demonstrate on one another. But, it also shows the perseverance of a strong family to maintain the family life. Steinbeck brought out the reality of life in this book that we can still find going on today. This book could easily be held up as a major reason for the downfall of the human race."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"First it goes w/out saying that yes, I am a high school student who was required by her teacher to read this book. And although that put s me at a somewhat biased opinion I am still entitled to it and it is a valid one regardless of what some of the older generations who like to lable all teenagers as having ADD. The book has many flaws but one saving grace. It's important in the sense that it gives a great insight to a period in history that many prefer to ignore or forget. But that's it. The story line is as dull, unengaging, and and long as you could possibly imagine. And if anybody has a problem with my opinion, tough. Like I said before, it's mine and I'm entitled to it."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"Although Steinbeck did a great job getting the reader into the sensation of the Depression, I really did not like this book because it was too depressing. I found the plot to boring and slow as well, to me, it was just one depressing event after another. However, the repetition and drowning effect that Steinbeck created was good in the sense that it made me feel as if I was traveling West to California in terribly difficult circumstances. Yet, I prefer reading books that are a bit lighter more optimistic."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"As I read these reviews, I came upon two that disregarded the finest book of all time as &quot;boring&quot;, and &quot;without a point&quot;. I was saddened to realize that the crucial message so eloquently produced by John Steinbecks' fine pen, was lost on so-called &quot;AP&quot; students. (For starters, &quot;real&quot; AP students would have developed more profound literacy arguments than those stated.) I was first exposed to this jewel of literature as a freshman AP student in high school. As a senior in college now, the depth of this story only grows with each reading. Perhaps most disheartening in the disdain of these readers, is the ignorance to the storys' ending, the very crux of Steinbecks' message.Despite the grevious hardships endured at the hands of her fellow human beings and the stunning death of her infant, Rose of Sharon offers her breast to a dying man without hesitation. This clarifies Steinbecks' hope; not just for the dying man or the Joad family, but for humanity itself. A poignant symbol such as this is obviously lost on a few young reviewers, but valued by others. My suggestion for the young readers who so obviously do not understand or appreciate this moving piece of literature is to start out with something more at their pace; Hardy Boys perhaps?"},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"Steinbeck wrote some good novels, some that are even almost great (East of Eden comes to mind); this, however, is not one of them. The Grapes of Wrath is little more than bad communist propaganda.It isn't that the kinds of things he describes didn't happen, but the way he presents them---without looking for the deeper cause (rather than pulling out the tired old scarecrow of \\"greed\\", an abused and vague term anyway) or offering a real solution but rather simply pushing for a (dubious at best) political program---is not only unrealistic, it isn't artistic either. About the only time it approaches the level of genuine literary expression is when Casy goes on about how his idea of holy is for every man to be harnessed, not even to every other man, but to Mankind as a whole. That's a horrible thought, but at least it's a somewhat deeper one.Even Tom Joad's famous \\"Whenever you seen a cop beatin' a guy...\\" speech is all about the insignificance of the individual, and as if to prove his point, Steinbeck continues the story for quite a while after that but Tom (despite having been the main character up to that point) does not reappear.And stylistically, this is one of Steinbeck's worst...it could be described as faux-Hemingway---lots of awkward sentences, unnecessary repetitions of words rather than using pronouns, etc. But it actually reads more like Socialist realism than anything else. It has a lot in common with some stuff put out by the Union of Soviet Writers under Stalin around that time. East of Eden is much better written, though Steinbeck is still using some techniques he seems to have learned from writers like Kataev.I did a bit of research after finishing this, and it looks like Steinbeck actually joined and had further involvement with the League of American Writers, which was set up by the Communist Party USA in 1935 in sympathy with the Union of Soviet Writers putting its policy of controlling and censoring the output of authors into effect the year before. Anyway, enough was known here about what was going on under the Soviet system by the time he wrote The Grapes of Wrath that he couldn't have had any honest excuse for glorifying it like that.I suspect that the only reason The Grapes of Wrath is considered such a great classic is that it was heavily pushed by the press which was highly sympathetic to communism in this country at the time of its release, and because of the movie version with Henry Fonda. People like to pretend that Steinbeck wrote books like this for \\"the common man\\", but the truth is it's incredibly patronizing and condescending; he really wrote it for wealthy intellectuals like himself to feel better about themselves. As someone who's in the working class himself (but doesn't intend to stay there his whole life), I think if I ever met Steinbeck I would have slapped his face, because The Grapes of Wrath is basically a slap in mine."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"I ordered this beautiful book, and received a blue hard cover from Reader's Digest. Definitely not 1st edition, 7th printing"},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"The literature is great. But the pages are not well cut. I bought one, asked for a change and good the same quality. Finally, resigned and read it like that."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"It has been a long time since I have read Steinbeck, but boy have I been missing something great! I grew up in Oklahoma, so this story hits home. I couldn't really call myself an Okie without the knowledge of our history and just what that name means to those few souls who are still alive that remember the hard times and forced migration of many of our people.Mr. Steinbeck illustrated just what happened when large corporations came in and took over the farms of the \\"little man\\". My heart really identified with small time farmers being attached at the soul level with their land, something large corporations could never do.I wonder how things could be a rough and poor as the dust bowl days, I try to imagine the people of American enduring. We have really become very soft, with even the poor having such extras that couldn't have been imaginable by the migrant workers described by Steinbeck.Never before have I been graced with the prose that describes the haves and have-nots in such a dark and colorful way. The main characters, the Joad Family, learn what it means to be feared and hated by anyone who \\"had\\" something. The people of California that owned land or stores knew the face of desperation, because they had experience the lengths humankind will go to in order to feed their loved ones.Being a liberal and a supporter of labor unions I felt incredible compassion for the Joad family and all the workers just looking for a fair days wage, but I also saw how the establishment could put a sterile (it is not my fault) corporate face to the practices of the farmers who would exploit the plight of the migrant workers.Reading the book one probably find it hard to think this was done to our own people. Even though it is not right, it is easier to stomach such actions being levied upon outsiders who come and take our jobs, but can one imagine the same feelings towards truly desperate Americans willing to undercut each other to extreme measures just to put the very basic nutrients on the table for their families. We have moved several generations from the likes of this type of desperation, which would tear apart the fabric of the crowded, interconnected and interdependent nation that we live in now.Finally, I thought it was amazing how the police and union busters used tactics of counterinsurgency. I'm a military officer and found the subject very timely and see how well Steinbeck understood the strategies and how powerful the hearts and minds of the locals are to strategic success.The only thing I didn't like about the book was the ending. The final few pages were a huge downer, but maybe that was the point. I couldn't grab onto any light or happiness to lift my spirits, but maybe that is just the point Mr. Steinbeck was looking for in the tale."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"If you want to get started by reading the sample, don't waste your time downloading it. The sample consists of the introduction, written within the last 10 years. It is not the beginning of the book. Disappointing."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"The Grapes of Wrath is a tremendous story, set in the depression of the 1930's. Whilst a great book, it is not an easy read by any means. The dialogue of the characters is embedded in local accented English, where words are shortened and abbreviated with apostrophes.The Joad family's struggles as they are cast out from their home and search for a better future in California is heartbreaking, as they are just a small, insignificant dot amongst the hundreds of thousands of other souls trying to do the same thing. Be prepared to suffer with them, as you are drawn inexorably into their world.If I have one complaint about the book, is that it is never fully resolved. Then again, it never can be, as to do so would take many books. So, as a result, the book concludes at the end of an episode in their lives, so it is left, in my opinion, incomplete."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"I recently finished this book in an attempt to fill in the gaps of my \\"classics\\" of literature. A lot of people read this book in High School or early in College, but for some reason my HS skipped it, probably because it is a little longer than most of the other books we read. That said, I'm very glad I took the time to read it, and also find a certain amount of serendipity in the fact that I read it as the effects of the 2008 financial meltdown are still reeking havoc on careers of so many people. The book in of its self is great, but the timing of when I read seems to give it a little extra kick.Grapes of Wrath is often labeled as a work of socialist fiction. Personally, I didn't really get that from my reading of it. There are workers that are treated unfairly, they are often harassed or oppressed by their employers, they theorize that if they stand together they could demand more, and they find that they are often better off when they are left to fend for themselves. If you look at these, you will find that there isn't much in the way of propaganda here. Workplace bullying by those with any level of authority is a fairly well-known and well accounted fact of life. Your boss is a jerk and the company will do anything it can to suck every bit of effort out of you for the lowest price possible; maybe this was not well known in the 30's or people were more ashamed of it then, but now it is what it is. Which leads to the next point about workers sticking together. I don't think it is particularly socialist to realize the practical fact that there is strength in numbers, which can be leveraged against businesses that go to far. I know what Marxism is, and that isn't it. Finally, the characters often remark that they are better off taking care of themselves or enforcing their own laws. That sounds like a small government libertarian's dream to me.The pleasant surprises I found in the book involved the well developed characters, accept for Noah (pointless), Connie (plot point but nearly pointless) and Uncle John (broken record.) I was able to create a solid visual image of this tight knit family that shared so much together. You had a real sense of each person's place in the Joad family, that could be alternately openly loving or mechanically efficient. I also found Steinbeck's use of different literary tools interesting, with him moving (although not very smoothly) from immersive local color, to disjointed stream-of-conscious, to poetic prose. He uses these tools to help bring more texture to the parts they are used in without being too heavy handed, although his jumping from different perspectives or suddenly going head first in the mile a minute mind of a used car salesman, can be jarring.Some readers complained that this book is slow. That is true; it is a little slow, but I believe it is probably supposed to be. This isn't an action packed thriller or romantic drama, its a yarn about simple people trying to live their lives in a world that is far from simple. If the story didn't take the time to set up the atmosphere, to really set the scene, I don't think the book would be half as good.Finally, given the ago of book, there has been a lot of time for people to over analyze its historical accuracy. This is a work of fiction set against a series of events that happened in history; so looking further than that is merely an academic exercise. Its in the Literature section of the book store not the History or Non-Fiction section, so you would have to be a fool to put too much stock in the writer's interpretation of events.Pros:1.) Steinbeck does a wonderful job of capturing the mindset of a farming family. He waxes poetic about the cultivation of land in a way that I wouldn't have thought possible, which in turn gave me a real sense of how much love farmers can have for their life's work.2.) The fictional Joad family lets a 21st Century urbanite like me look into a world that I have little connection to and no experience with. A good writer engages the reader in a way that makes them feel like they are sharing the story with the characters, and Steinbeck does exactly that. I really wanted to know what happens to the characters after the all too open end (see con below.)3.) Some may disagree with Steinbeck's personal reasoning behind writing Grapes of Wrath, but it's hard to argue with his economics, especially since we are seeing a model of it in action now. As the demands for jobs go up, workers are willing to work for increasingly less out of fear and desperation. Just as Steinbeck's farm owners pit workers against each other to lower wages and work conditions, so do the managers and presidents of business today. Don't want to work overtime? There is a line of applicants that will. Want $50k a year? I have 10 resumes from people that will do it for $40k a year. You've got a retirement plan and pension? I should get rid of you because you cost too much and hire a college grad for the half the money and don't have to offer them any kind of benefits because they will be happy just to be working. This is real and I see it happening every day.Cons:1.) Like most good books, Grapes of Wrath isn't for the casual reader. It's long, slow and thoroughly depressing; as well has needing a little bit of historical context. I think it was worth it, but I know not everyone will get a lot out of it.2.) If I was looking to edit the book down to make it easier to read, I would tie up some of the dead ends or eliminate them altogether. What was the point of Noah? Do so many animals need to get hit by cars? Why did Casey play such an important role, just to vanish for a quarter of the book and then meet an inauspicious end suddenly.3.) The book ends very abruptly. There is a complete lack of finality that makes you wonder if the author really knew what was going to happen to his characters when he started writing. To just end the story in the middle of a sort of hairy moment, after suffering so much with the Joads, it almost seems like a waste. Steinbeck closed on a pretty, albeit odd in a modern context, visual, but I think it was a very unsatisfying ending.Conclusion:A great book about the American experience for some in the 1930's that is a little long, but for me should have been a little longer if only to give the reader a sense of what the future would have in store for the Joads."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"Seeking a masterful work for our \\"One Book, One Community Reading\\" project, and deeming the economy the significant issue of the day, we selected John Steinbeck's The Grapes of Wrath for our focal read. Steinbeck's novel, which depicts the plight of migrants during the Dust Bowl era, elucidates topics as current as this morning's newspaper-- bank foreclosures, hunger, poverty, immigration, collective voice. Steinbeck's book earned a Pulitzer Prize when it was written. It remains the most shocking book I\\"ve ever read. Read it again for the first time."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"I'm fifty years old, I've read literally thousands of books, and I'm not aware that I've ever read a novel written by John Steinbeck. Recognizing this deficiency, I ordered a Steinbeck collection, seven of his most celebrated works including The Grapes of Wrath. I vaguely recall seeing the film starring Henry Fonda, and am well aware of the plot and the historical backdrop, but nothing can take the place of reading the work itself.As most know, the book details the westward migration of the Joad family, as they are uprooted from their Oklahoma homestead by the evils of the Great Depression, the Oklahoma dust bowl and the advent of mechanized farming. The family harbors visions of milk and honey awaiting their arrival in California, or so they are assured by the numerous handbills promising plentiful work and bountiful riches. What await them instead are rapacious labor recruiters, unfriendly natives and slow but sure starvation.Steinbeck certainly succeeds in painting a vivid and stark picture of the hopelessness faced by the migrants. His chapters alternate between \\"big picture\\" overviews and the particular heartbreaks and hazards faced by the Joads in particular. The story is an education in economics, labor relations, politics and human nature. In this day and age, it is difficult to conceive of children literally starving to death in the shadow of the most productive agricultural land in the country, much of it lying fallow and off limits to those that were capable of growing the food to nourish their own families.This is a very powerful novel, both with regard to the emotions that it taps and the beliefs and conceptions that one holds. It provides a sharp contrast between a period when so many were desperate to work for as little as something to eat, to one in which so many demand so much without having to lift a finger. There must be a happy medium."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"This was a great book, I enjoyed reading this very much, and believe that every high school student should read this for their history class. It makes me think of what my decision would be at that time, to leave and hope for the best, or stay and wait it out. I have always wondered what your decision would have been."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"I firstly started this novel as a schoolwork, but when I finished it, I knew that I was living with the Joad family with my heart. The Grapes of Wrath by Steinback depicts the life of Joad family as a microcosm of the immigrant workers during the Depression era, and Steinback ingeniously describes the workers' plights and ensuing 'wraths'. The novel was so impressive toward the end; Steinback imbues great metaphors such as the baby, rising rain, vineyard, and so forth, and he powerfully portrays the scenes, especially the final one. I, as a student fond of reading, have to say that the novel was one of the few living novels that I have read."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"Beautifully written, but very depressing account of one family's struggle through the depression. Clearly shows both the bad decisions of farmers who lost their land during this time as well as the injustices thrust upon them as they traveled to California, the land of milk and honey, that turned out to be anything but. Steinbeck alternates chapters of atmospheric description with the tale of the Joad family who face death, starvation, police harassment and their own ignorance, struggling to stay alive with limited resources. Not a light read, but worth the time."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"I read a lot of fantasy and non-fiction. I've been averse to classics since I hated lord of the rings, faulkner, and most of hemmingway. However Steinback stands in a class of his own. The sheer ease of reading alone should be enough to keep eyes fixed, let alone the sure-and-steady plot, textured characters, and every other chapter that emanates emotion, experience, plot, and thick smell of the times.I'd recommend this to anyone mature enough to enjoy something not written by James Patterson or Nora Roberts."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"This book isn't for everyone. People I know who haven't liked it say that it was too slow, or \\"What's the deal with the turtle?\\" and didn't get past the first couple chapters. Some say it's just too sad.For me, this book meant everything. \\"To the red country and part of the gray country of Oklahoma, the last rains came gently, and they did not cut the scarred earth.\\" When I read this first line, I remember feeling like it was a line that I would always remember. I had the sense that I wasn't reading a story that some guy named Steinbeck came up with. I felt like the true feelings and experiences of a very real group of people were simply being funneled to me via Steinbeck's pen.The story felt very relevant to early 21st century America in that Fear seemed to be at the root of all evil. The Grapes of Wrath showed how Fear could be used to control and exploit people on a huge scale. It also depicted the human experience as profoundly intertwined with the earth. The characters' lives were turned upside down by nature, first by drought and later by flood. The very last scene showed how all of us are on this earth, in this life, together, like it or not and I found comfort in that.I had goosebumps and a pounding heart. All this for a book where the main characters speak in dialect about the \\"Fambly\\". Somehow John Steinbeck managed to fit what, to me, is essentially the meaning of life into a short novel about sharecroppers in the 30s.An amazing book. Please read it (all of it)."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath","review":"If you have not read this timeless classic yet in your lifetime, you have missed out on beatiful literature and amazing adventures.

This book is basically a collection of quotes by Jefferson that are organized by subject. Each chapter opens with Larson's notes that provide some context for the issue. Each chapter has several quotes, usually drawn from Jefferson's own personal correspondence. Each specific quote is labeled with a reference to the source so that the reader may locate the statement in the original text.Topics include Americans vs. Europeans, foreign policy, the Constitution, slavery, monetary policy, religion, and relations with Native Americans.

Derossa's work (highly recommended), this deeper than usual western drama is very pleasing. Discussing it and the movie made from it - with western veteran Joel Macrea and Veronica Lake - is an interchangeable exercise. The movie, with the exception of three minor changes, was word for word what Short wrote.Lake's character is a scheming rancher who attempts to twist Macrea's wandering saddlebum around her finger to gain control of more land. In an era when most female characters eventually swoon into a man's arms and give up their evil ways, Lake's character (I forget the character names) gets darker. Even after she is the cause of a man's violent death. She is affected by this, she's even shocked a little by what she has done, but she does not sway from her goal.This is a strong female character operating in a hard man's world. The problem is, she has learned how to be hard but not honest. She lies and cheats to get what she wants, and eventually this does her in (that's not a spoiler by the way - the good guys still have to win, after all!)The story is taught and the motivations honest.

The novel is a subtle study in human character and Short expertly details each of the novel's characters with a deep understanding of the human psyche that makes an ordinary range war tale more interesting than it should be. The common threads of human behavior are on display, the noble and the ignoble, as the story unfolds towards its inevitable denouement.

But I know it will feel to my children like we are not reading it start to finish, or not using it in the way it was intended.For instance, it will say &quot;Games... for CAMPING,&quot; &quot;Food... when you're CAMPING,&quot; &quot;Animals may share your CAMPSITE,&quot; &quot;I like to pick up leaves... at our CAMPSITE.&quot;I think the title should say CAMPING.But if you are going camping, it is very nice :o)"},{"Title":"Farthest north;: Being the record of a voyage of exploration of the ship \\"Fram\\" 1893-96 and of a fifteen month's sleigh journey by Dr. Nansen and Lieut.

It is more than just facts. Her descriptions of the state make one want to go to Oklahoma!"},{"Title":"Oklahoma Off the Beaten Path: A Guide to Unique Places (Revised & Updated)","review":"Oklahoma doesn't get much tourist attention, so a guidebook to the pleasures of traveling there is most welcome. This is far from a complete guide, but rather a potpourri of places to visit, eat, and stay.The book divides Oklahoma into seven regions and covers the attractions of each region, especially in small towns and rural areas. Down-home, long-established restaurants and bed-and-breakfasts are well-described. Sidebars sprinkled liberally through the text provide a historical overview of Oklahoma, especially of its cowboy and Indian heritage.There is no Grand Canyon or Yosemite in Oklahoma. The natural attractions are modest. For those from more congested states, the charm of Oklahoma is open empty country and friendly people, clear blue skies, and weather that is pretty good on the average -- but the weather in Oklahoma is rarely average. \\"The immensity of the plains can exhilarate or overwhelm travelers,\\" says the author. That's about right. Oklahoma is a good place to take a random drive down a country road. Amidst the endless prairie, the oil wells, and the wheat fields, there's usually a valley oasis of woodland, a rocky mesa, one of Oklahoma's big man-made lakes, or an old town with a restaurant that features chicken-fried steak and mashed potatoes. This book will give you some ideas on places to go and things to do.Smallchief"},{"Title":"Oklahoma Off the Beaten Path: A Guide to Unique Places (Revised & Updated)","review":"This is a well-written book and worthwhile for what it contains, but what it does not include is inexplicable.

Using full color photographs and diagrams, the book's 360 pages offer fairly comprehensive groupings of nouns with appropriate verbs and some idiomatic phrases for the different categories of People (body parts, expressions, family) Appearance (clothing and grooming), Health (ailments, exercise), Home (house, workshop, decorating, gardening), Services (emergency, banking, telephone etc.), Shopping(markets, florist, pharmacy, etc.), Food (fruits, vegetables, dairy, etc.), Eating Out(restaurant, breakfast, lunch, dinner, etc.) Study (school, science, math etc.), Work (office, computer, farm, etc.), Transportation (roads, cars, trains, buses, planes etc.), Sports (Soccor, basketball, hockey etc.), Leisure (arts, music, games, outdoor activities, camping, etc.), Environment (Space, the earth, landscape, plants, animals, etc.), and reference( time, numbers, weights and measures,maps, useful phrases etc.). The book also includes a full index of Italian to English and English to Italian words cross-referenced with the page number where they appear in the book.My only complaint about the book is its failure to be Italian specific. As I also have the French English Bilingual Visual Dictionary published by the same company, I can say with some regret that the format and the pictures are identical in both books. In the Food section, for example, there is no section that introduces specifically Italian cheeses, concentrates on depicting Italian desserts or gives some rudimentary introduction to the Italian amero or digestivo. I would have liked to see specific Italian brand names depicted so that when I do go to the market or the coffee bar in Italy, I would already have an idea of what the packaging or product looks like as well as the correct word because I was using the book as a primer prior to my venture. In addition, in the building section, I would like to have seen Italian specific buildings i.e. Il Colosseo along with the generic buildings of the church, the mosque etc.Although not absolutely necessary, I would like to see the edges of the pages color-coded or indexed like a dictionary with fingertabs which would enable the user to better find the appropriate section with less skimming through the entire book.As I think this is a great reference for the traveler, I would have loved to have brought it along on a recent trip to Italy. More importantly, as a student of Italian, I fully appreciate the visual cataloguing which jumpstarts any essay writing or conversational skills building in Italian on any of the detailed subjects.Recommended as a concise, attractively formatted book in the style of other easy to read Eyewitness publications."},{"Title":"Italian English Bilingual Visual Dictionary (DK Visual Dictionaries)","review":"I can't say this is a pocket-size book, it's actually quite large and very heavy, so probably not ideal for travel.

It's got beautifully colored pages and virtually any item you'll ever need to reference in Italian, from food, to vehicles, animals, household items, plants, etc. It's excellent for all those in general who want to expand their Italian vocabulary, as well as for pre-trip preparation. AN IMPORTANT NOTE: As much as there are over 6,000 words and phrases, there is no writing on how they are pronounced!

It enables a reader of any religious or non-religious background to grasp the message contained. Modern man is no closer to the truth than the ancient philosophers, even with all the advanced technology; science still cannot prove or disprove the answers to the mysteries of the universe.The reader will find the truth as it is written and provides some strong arguements in favor of faith, hope, and love...

Imagine if a mind like Socrates could come back to see how much modern man had advanced!In addition Mr. Kotselas is very descriptive in his handling of Socratic thought. Having tired of dry, technical reading, it was a pleasure to see the images of the wild horse of chaos and the tempered horse of justice and the cave of illusion clearly in my mind as I read this book.I know you will find it thought provoking (and maybe a little scary) as you find yourself looking at the world around you a little differently but I know you will enjoy it.

Three men discover who they are and have a conversation with them. These three men are Ron a simple man with not many belifs, Professor an intellectual man who never thinks he is wrong, and Dr. Lattison a doctor who is an athiest going through a ruff time in his life and is willing to listen to anything. These five men converse back and fourth their views on Justice, Freedom, Illusion, Love, Divine Love and Divine Justice. Socrates quickly dumbfounds Ron and is slowly getting the professor to listen but he is stubborn so he will not listen. In the end Ron becomes a man with many questions and he finally has a cause in life, it is finding the truth. Professor quits his job and goes back to school to study greek philosophy, and Dr. Lattison is converted to the Jewish faith by Philo and he eventually becomes a Rabbi years later. This book is influential to me because what Mr. Kotselas says through Socrates changed my belifs back when I believed in Anarchy. Beofre I thought this would be a boring read but I have the privallege of knowing Mr. Kotselas personally because he is my friends dad, and he convinced me to read it and i spent one and two days without sleeping reading the book five times to fully grasp it.

It's like going to a mental chiropractor.Other books of interest may include: &quot;Between Heaven and Hell&quot; by Peter Kreeft. All of Kreeft's books are engaging in style and hearty in substance. To see the interaction between Christianity and classical culture, see &quot;Christianity and Classical Culture&quot; by Jaraslov Pelikan. Mortimer Adler's books are also helpful in discussing how to think about God, Life, Truth, etc. A short little book &quot;Does God Exist?&quot; by Moody is written in the trialogue style and is great at rejecting the silly, yet popular, arguments against God and gives the reader much to think about. In a more Christian line, the works of C.S. Lewis are great, and the classic by Bishop Kallistos Ware, &quot;The Orthodox Way&quot; is a great place to start if your interested in historic Christianity. &quot;The Mystical Theology of the Eastern Church&quot; by Vladimir Lossky will certainly reshape the old brain, too!

Easy to read and understand, the illustrations are childlike and appealed to my daughter. She says she will read and re-read this story again and again. To me that is the true test of a book, we have many books that sit on our shelves having been read once, but few stay in our bedside pile of books she will read again and again.Jennifer Ragan's SHADOW'S WALK is sure to find an audience with those who like Dr. Seuss's easy rhymes and sense of humor."},{"Title":"Vietnam","review":"The history of Vietnam is obscure to most Westerners, at least prior to the Indo-China war of the fifties. This book attempts to fill that gap, and provide a short overview of the history of the nation over the last thousand years or so. Given that it's a short book (text runs to just over 200 pages) it does a good job.Vietnam has been wracked by wars and conquests during most of the period covered by the book, and make no mistake, that's the author's focus. There's nothing about culture, literature, art, science, or ordinary life in this book: it's about politics, and warfare. The author spends one chapter dealing with the period pre-French conquest, and a second covering the period of French colonialism. The rest of the book covers the Vietnam Wars from 1946-1975, with a brief chapter after chronicling the country's history since the end of the war.This is a good book, given its limited scope. The author has much to say about the war, most of it critical of American and South Vietnamese leadership. Hey, they did lose the war! The book also doesn't flinch from recounting atrocities by both sides, recounting them judiciously, and not taking sides.If I have a criticism of the book, it's that it's too short. Two hundred pages doesn't do justice to the history of the war at less than an overview level, and trying to fit the last thousand years in there too was perhaps a bit much. I found myself wishing for more."},{"Title":"Vietnam","review":"As someone who grew up during the Vietnam era, I wanted to read a book that would give me some understanding of what went on during the Vietnam war. I was a bit too young to really comprehend the current events as they were happening but too old for the Vietnam war to be covered in the history books I studied in school.This book provides a good, succinct overview of the military aspects of the war. While there are allusions to events outside the military realm (the protests back in the U.S., Kennedy's assasination, etc.) the focus is definitely on the war itself. While the main focus is on the period in which the U.S. was involved in Vietnam, a significant part of the book is devoted to setting the context for that period (wars in Vietnam during ancient times and, especially the French Indo-China wars). There is also a short section on what happened after the U.S. left Vietnam. This context is interesting since the author points out how many of the mistakes made by the U.S. had been made by others during earlier times.The book is quite brief (204 pages), so the author does not go into great depth on anything. For example, the My Lai massacre takes up only a very brief paragraph. If you're looking for an in depth analysis of the war, you would probably be better off with another book. However, as a brief overview, I thought the book was quite well done."},{"Title":"Rand Mcnally Virginia Beach: Easyfinder (Map #1013)","review":"This is my 2nd and last Rand McNally plastic fold-out map.

Rather than mythology, the stories in the book would be more appropriately described as folktales or perhaps even fairy tales. Most involve a fair maiden in distress who is rescued by a \\"once-was-a-peasant-found-a-magic-belt-or-met-a-troll-and-became-a-knight\\" type of hero.Nevertheless, I greatly enjoyed the book. As the author says, the folktales in _Popular Tales from Norse Mythology_ are overall good reading. They are full of excitement and adventure and a great deal of humour. These factors probably made it possible for the stories to survive as Scandinavian oral tradition until they were finally written down in the last century.Although the book rarely mentions Norse gods directly, a number of characters can be identified as one of the old gods, particularly Odin, slipping into an overall Christianized story. I found that interesting."},{"Title":"Life's Treasure Book on Friendship","review":"This is indeed a very small treasure book made up of pieces taken from other H.

Peter David's story is just a rolicking, good adventure with great characters from Madripoor - Archie Corrigan, his wealthy, but way-too-eccentric brother in San Francisco (who thinks he's Indiana Jones!), O'Donnell running the Princess Bar, Spider Woman Jessica Drew, Captain Tai (\\"...Tai dyed!!\\"), and the corrupt Prince of Madripoor - along with a cast of slavering pseudo-vampires, and their leader, an evil entity of Bibilcal origins - all trying to gain control of a powerful stone.It opens with a quote from Rudyard Kipling - \\"Whether down to Gehenna or up to the throne, he travels the fastest who travels alone.\\" Immediately followed by one of my favorite corny, old jokes - \\"What do you think of Kipling?\\" \\"I don't know. I've never kippled.\\" So there - it had me right off the bat.The artwork by John Buscema features expressive characters and moves the action clearly and fluidly. Although, I'm sure both the writing and the artwork's probably considered dated today in that the story moves briskly, there is not a lot of navel-gazing on the part of the characters, and the art is not \\"artsy-fartsy\\" murky and confusing. This is just a lot of fun dialog and action -- with a little mystery about Wolverine at the climax.One other point, even though he's a tough little runt, Logan does take his lumps and lets you and his pals know he's feeling the pain even as he tries to stay in the game. After one fight, Jessica says, \\"He can barely stand!\\" To which, Logan, being helped up, gasps out, \\"I'm...m always like this before I've had m...my first cuppa coffee...\\" During a fight with the evil entity, Ba'al, Logan thinks, \\"I smell meat burning and hear screaming. Then my mind gets around to telling me that I'm the source of both!\\"A jab is made at \\"Patch,\\" as one by one, all of Logan's pals let him know that they knew and have known he is Wolverine, all along. At one point, Logan says, \\"Everyone must think I'm an A-1 loon!\\" to which O'Donnell tells him, \\"Well, you are and A-1 loon!\\" Even so, Logan's not stupid and he's not the poor, mind-controlled victim of some shadowy manipulator. He's using his brains and skills to again be the best there is at what he does...and it was simply refreshingly fun to go along for the ride."},{"Title":"Easy Does It For Christmas (Art To Heart #519B)","review":"This quilting/applique book is fantastic!

No, I am not going to spoil the stories by telling you ANYTHING ELSE.Thank YouDavid Morris"},{"Title":"Wild Country","review":"All right, the disclaimers first. The narrative voice in this book is definitely male. There is machismo everywhere and a lot of excess in the characters. The Texan accent is very accurate and (given that it's set in a post-apocalyptic future) very strong.This the third book in a three-part story covering the life of Ted Quantrell, a man with the most incredible set of reflexes in Wild Country (the Southwest United States). Set in the years after a dictatorial regime had been removed from power, Wild Country is quite capable of standing alone, but I recommend Systemic Shock and Single Combat, as many stories in the series come to a resolution in this book.In short, illegal drugs are being funneled into the U.S. by a mastermind skilled not only in the world politics of drug running, but also in self-preservation. Old Rule 1: the good guy is only as interesting as the bad guy, this guy makes the hero look good. He is efficient and ruthless, and utterly charming. Taking parts of the ride from the nemesis perspective is not only enlightening, but entertaining.Ing does a magnificent job of capturing the essence of many Texas legends, creating a cast of players that are not only entertaining, but utterly believable (if you've ever lived in Texas, that is) and lovable. The action scenes were very clear, giving me a great visual of the events and clearly defining what was happening.There are moments of philosophical discussion, done in plain ol' Texas talk, that aren't at all tasking to read. The overall tone of the book is a rough-hewn western that happens to have science fiction elements built into it, and never does the science take a front seat to the story.If you like Louis L'Amour, Robert Jordan's Conan series or just enjoy an action-read now and then, I recommend this book for you."},{"Title":"Wild Country","review":"The last in the series, unfortunately, Wild Country is a well written and tight story of cultural adjustment, near anarchy, and the heavy hand of government and its effects on America after a national near death experience.Our hero, an early super soldier, converted into a Texas Ranger substitute, is everything you want in a guy to watch your back in a bar fight or other festivities. The bad guys run the gambit: spooks, smugglers, careerist lawmen , and even old fashioned Western desperadoes. This book is not so much technothriller as a genre busting modern Western set in another timeline. There are even strong female characters and significant wild life......Heck, there is even a reasonable discussion of drug prohibition and its effectsIng must have spent some time around Texans and what Texans' call the Hill Country. He gets the culture right and shows the good and bad in the codes that some of the old ranching families still try to follow today and how that culture might transfer or perhaps revert under pressure.The background of drug smuggling and counterintelligence makes this book timely. If you can adjust to the changes in technology that occurred during the time Ing set this trilogy, and if a hefty dose of old West virtue and vice backstopped by modern gunfight or two appeal to you, then this well written page turner might just fit your holster, pardner. Read the entire series."},{"Title":"The Dawn of Universal History: Selected Essays from a Witness of the Twentieth Century","review":"Raymond Aron, a witness to the twentieth century, only lived from 1905 to 1983, and was most famous for being a French professor, if not the greatest French professor, as noted in the Introduction by Tony Judt, (See the first note at the end of the Introduction on page xxv). Judt himself has written books on the French left and French intellectuals. I wondered how often Aron might have left France, and Judt reveals that his sense of timing was pretty good. \\"A Jew and a socialist, he left France following the establishment of the puppet regime at Vichy and joined Charles de Gaulle's Free French organization in London.\\" (p. vii). Like a government that temporarily did not have a country, he must have made a lot of plans for things to do when he was home again. \\"Upon returning to France Aron served briefly in Andr&eacute; Malraux's post-war Ministry of Information before returning to the university world to teach sociology, at the same time taking up what proved to be a lifelong parallel career as a journalist and political commentator.\\" (p. vii).The essays in this book were originally collected in 1996 in France for publication of a history, and were translated into English for this 2002 Basic Books edition. The first footnote on page 31 has an additional note revealing \\"All footnotes in this book are Raymond Aron's own notes to his texts,\\" translated from the French 1996 edition. The book has an index, in which there are many entries for Vietcong, Vietminh (League for the Independence of Vietnam), Vietnam war, Johnson and, etc., which lead to a strange footnote on page 362:\\"Johnson did not tell the senators that U.S. torpedo boats had been attacked by North Vietnamese gunboats while the South Vietnamese were carrying out commando operations in the same region.\\"This confusing mix of covert activities is not offered as clarification for the famous resolution of August, 1964, but as an explanation of the American attempt to devise a strategy for Vietnam:\\"Like the French colonels in Algeria, many of the president's advisers believed that the techniques of subversion and persuasion could be effective in any circumstances. The commando operations ordered by President Kennedy in May 1961, by way of a riposte to infiltration, then resumed on a larger scale* by Johnson, had nothing in common with the organization of parallel hierarchies. Then there was the conviction, sincere in many cases, that the United States would jeopardize its role all over the world if it accepted defeat in any part of it: This theory was proved by events to be a self-fulfilling prophecy. Last, we must take into account the perhaps inevitable corruption of the men who conduct high politics. . . . To be able to order such bombings in cold blood, and then enjoy a good night's sleep, calls for a kind of transformation. Such a transmogrification may be necessary, but it takes place so easily that it always amazes me when I encounter it in men I used to know before they went into public life.\\"This is from an essay, \\"The Imperial Republic,\\" that attempted to understand \\"The United States and the International System,\\" which was originally published in French in 1984, well after the reunification of Vietnam, the death of former President Johnson, the humiliation of Nixon's efforts to keep anything secret because it was a matter of national security, as he imagined the (expletive deleted) Vietnam war was in a recorded conversation with John Dean that had long been public. But Raymond Aron was dead by then, too, and this publication was actually prepared then by Jean-Claude Casanova, Pierre Hassner, Stanley Hoffmann, Pierre Manent, and Dominique Schnapper. (p. 503, Provenance of Texts). Publication of someone's work after death might allow others to emphasize something which borders on the incredible. In such instances, the crazy bit seems to be the assumption that anyone was getting \\"a good night's sleep,\\" while artillery was being pounded out for H & I, ambushes at bridges, trails, roads, and rivers had to have some guard up at all hours keeping watch over the kill zone, and people expected to find a newspaper at their front door when they got up to start their day in other parts of the world. Even professors must be up at all hours to find time to put words on paper and keep track of whatever secrets they have been able to discover.The confusion surrounding the footnote on page 362 has been so great at all times since August 1964, that it looks like a great mistake when a truth slips out in this book: U.S. torpedo boats had been attacked by North Vietnamese gunboats. The gunboats had been directed at a covert operation that was directed on a large scale by Johnson, and the North Vietnamese had expected to run into U.S. destroyers because Johnson had ordered two destroyers to cruise in the Gulf of Tonkin when the undercover operation was also approved, but small swift boats that had attacked a radar installation were able to slip away while the American destroyers were shooting at targets (phantom blips on a screen) that were miles from nowhere. The South Vietnamese were not involved in this operation, in spite of what McNamara told senators off the record. French historians are much more likely to base their accounts on information received from the North Vietnamese, who would be the only Vietnamese who had any knowledge of what happened that night in August 1964, and \\"U.S. torpedo boats had been attacked by North Vietnamese gunboats\\" was precisely what the North Vietnamese were saying.Reading the PENTAGON PAPERS, Aron was unable to figure out Kennedy's policy. \\"But he refused to send in units of GIs.\\" (p. 361). 15,000 advisers from the Pentagon seems to be about what Bush expected to leave in Iraq before 2003, and he is still trying to make that work."},{"Title":"Minimization and control of hazardous combustion byproducts","review":"What you see is what you get with this book,and that's plenty. It's a great aid to teaching science,because it helps students more easily and quickly visualize when and where and to a small degree, how various scientific discoveries were made.What I like most about it is that the book doesn't make the assumption that science existed only in the West. Discoveries in the East,Middle East and even the Americas are mapped in &quot;Timetables&quot;. To be honest I wouldn't have bought this one for private use but it's invaluable in a classroom setting."}]`),j={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:W},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:x,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},q={class:"card-container"},J=["disabled"],C={key:0},D={key:1};function M(n,e,s,c,r,i){const f=g("PoemCard");return t(),a("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=o("div",{class:"top-banner"},[o("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[o("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),o("div",q,[(t(!0),a(y,null,w(i.visiblePoems,(h,m)=>(t(),p(f,{key:m,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),i.hasMorePoems?(t(),a("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>i.loadMore&&i.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(t(),a("span",D,"Loading...")):(t(),a("span",C,"See more"))],8,J)):b("",!0)])}const H=u(j,[["render",M],["__scopeId","data-v-d68882f0"]]),O=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"quotes/16.md","filePath":"quotes/16.md"}'),G={name:"quotes/16.md"},B=Object.assign(G,{setup(n){return(e,s)=>(t(),a("div",null,[v(H)]))}});export{O as __pageData,B as default};
