This book had all of the elements that make it hard to put down while giving the reader a good look at what it was like to be a homesteader. Give yourself a few hours and read it all in one sitting - it was intense. Unlike many reviewers, I loved the ending, but its not what you expect!"},{"Title":"The Diary of Mattie Spenser","review":"This is terrific story told from the perspective of a young pioneer bride settling in Colorado territory. I call this amazing since it IS amazing that people could survive and thrive under such hardships, harsh weather, Indian attacks, and above all the isolation. It is infuriating because not only does Mattie have to overcome the elements... her worst enemies are her 'friends'. It is no secret that humans are and have been throughout history, bigoted, racist, & misogynistic. Mattie deals with these issues, and rises above...A terrific story. 5 stars."},{"Title":"The Diary of Mattie Spenser","review":"This will be the next book turned into a movie. Strong supporting characters enhance the plot between the main characters of the story. I purchased 4 copies and gave to friends."},{"Title":"The Diary of Mattie Spenser","review":"I had high expectations for this book, and the author, but both fell short in the end. I did somewhat enjoy the story of Mattie & Luke Spenser, but was disappointed in the continual references to sex. While they were veiled in language of the day, the fact still remains that nary a chapter passes without a reference to sex, which is a sad commentary on literature in our times. I mean, really. Is it necessary to pepper every single book with sexual references? Can't a story stand on it's own merit?"},{"Title":"The Diary of Mattie Spenser","review":"Like other reviewers said, it seemed like the author was trying to cram the experiences of many settlers into the story of one. I know people who settled the west had hard lives, but this was ridiculous. Even the love story was depressing."},{"Title":"The Diary of Mattie Spenser","review":"Sandra Dallas tells good tales. The Diary of Mattie Spenser has intriguing turns. New Mercies has southern charm. Unfortunately, Dallas succumbs to decorating her books with the bric-a-brac of pseudo research--without integrating it into the tale. It glows like Mattie's silver spoons in a sod house. Dallas demonstrates no mastery of letting her characters speak --choosing rather to sprinkle the dialog with newspaper headlines and abrubt colloquialisms. One does not have to include every historical figure, building, or event in a book. Dallas has the talent to write well; it is unfortunate that she chooses formulas which no doubt drive and satisfy publishers but do not create good writing. A warning to readers--positive reviews can indicate that others have abandoned a book because it was not worth reading. Before you waste money on Dallas books, sample her writing from the local library."},{"Title":"The Diary of Mattie Spenser","review":"I choose this book for my book club and I am so glad I did!! This is the wonderful story of Mattie Spenser, a woman who endures the hardships of living on the Colorado prairie, with a husband she barely knows but loves. So much happens to her during the 3 years she writes about in her diary. I could not put this book down, I highly recommend it. Also a good choice for book clubs."},{"Title":"The Diary of Mattie Spenser","review":"I absolutely love Sandra Dallas's books. Nothing could ever compare with Alice's Tulips, but this book is outstanding just the same! Mattie herself is surprised that the &quot;catch of the town,&quot; Luke Spenser, proposes. Everyone thought he was for the lovely Persia Chalmers. So, with Mattie as the new Mrs. Spenser, the two newly-weds set out to the Colorado Territory to live. Not only does Mattie have a funny personality, but more excitement is in the book - Indian Battles, frightening neighbors, community scandals, etc! I loved reading about her life on the prairie, with her children, and her secretive, but handsmome husband. Of course, every book has it's heartaches, and man, this one sure did! Miscaraiges, deaths, kidnaps, and un-faithfulness are very depressing, but keep you literally glued to the page. I myself, was really dissapointed in the ending, but that didn't stop me from loving this sepectacular book."},{"Title":"The Diary of Mattie Spenser","review":"I won't waste space with a summary of the story, as several reviewers have already listed it. However, this quickly became one of my favorite books (the other being very similar &quot;These Is My Words&quot; by Nancy Turner). The hardships Mattie and her family faced seemed realistic to me, although I would have like to get more detail on how they built the soddy house, how she prepared a meal, etc. However, since it is in diary format, one would assume that these details would naturally be left out by the fictional author. I hope to find more books similar to these. They are a great way to get lost in another point of history."},{"Title":"The Diary of Mattie Spenser","review":"Oh, if only they could all be like this. This book was completly enthralling. It took me days to even have the heart to pick up another book for fear it could never measure up to this one. The characters become so real that you are sure you have spent your whole lives together. I cannot say enough about it. Please DONT hesitate to buy this book. It is truly a treat you find only a few times in a lifetime."},{"Title":"The Diary of Mattie Spenser","review":"If you like reading stories about 1800 pioneer's and their life and struggles, then read this book. But please make sure all you housework is done. I loved this book and hated when it came to an end. Mattie took us along on the covered wagon from Iowa to Colorado. I felt like I was right there with her all the time. Through the marriage to the man who didn't love her, through the covered wagon ride over the plains where they had to deal with the indians, through her and Luke setting up their little sod house on the plains, through delivering her baby, and the friendships she made in a not very friendly country. The sacrifices she made for the man that did not love her. And the friendship she shared with the men that did love her. The ending has a little surprise also. I will definetly read more of Sandra Dallas' work. Enjoy!!!!"},{"Title":"The Diary of Mattie Spenser","review":"After finishing the Persian Pickle Club, I immediately had to have more more more of Sandra Dallas. I like the diary format, and the story introducing us to the diary was nice, but not as exciting as the story itself. I could not believe all that happened to Mattie in her lifetime, and wanted more of a what happened later type &quot;sequel&quot; after I finished this....but, it was a marvelous read and none of the events that happened seemed a bit contrived, since no doubt this is what happened to people in that generation....maybe not as frequently as it appears in the diary, but we must remember that in fact, a lot was true. The births, illnesses, and even deaths of small children, young mothers and old alike is a fact. I loved Mattie's diversion with one of the bachelors and probably wouldn't have been so kind and forgiving to her husband as she was, but life in those days was so different. I could not in my wildest imagination have endured what she did. As a character she was real and I admire her greatly for what she survived. Sandra Dallas did it again. And I look forward to her latest since I'll be needing it after finishing Buster Midnight's Cafe!"},{"Title":"The Diary of Mattie Spenser","review":"An interesting way to learn of the difficulties pioneers had in settling the Colorado Territory. Mattie is an admirable character who meets the challenges of prairie life and marital disappointment with courage and integrity. Despite some contrived events, overall this is a heartwarming memorable story."},{"Title":"The Diary of Mattie Spenser","review":"Dallas strikes paydirt with this wonderfully told, and genuinely touching tale. So many &quot;historical&quot; novels place a contemporary woman in long skirts and bonnets, then ignore what society dictated, what life was truly like for them. . . but not Dallas. Her research is beyond reproach and her characters are true women of their times -- which is what makes &quot;Mattie&quot; such a touching tale. Tears ran down my cheeks at the end of this one. Bravo, Ms. Dallas."},{"Title":"The Diary of Mattie Spenser","review":"This is a great read for those who enjoy historical fiction and have an interest in the life of a pioneer woman. The characters were engaging and the plot interesting. It was somewhat reminiscent of The All True Travels and Adventures of Lidie Newton, by Jane Smiley."},{"Title":"The Diary of Mattie Spenser","review":"A friend loaned this book to me and simply because of the cover I moved it to the top of my &quot;to read&quot; pile! I couldn't put it down. I truly loved Mattie Spenser and in reading her story, felt so many of her emotions...her love and joys, fears, terror and much of the pain! I think Sandra Dallas is a fabulous author and I can't wait to get my hands on everything else by her! I do hope they make this a movie!"},{"Title":"The Diary of Mattie Spenser","review":"I am 13 and I read this book in a day. It was really good and I came to feel for the narrator, Mattie Spenser, a young wife helping her husband to carve a new home out of the prairie. She writes of the sorrows and joys she experiances. Mattie's voice is authentic and the author conveyed the attitudes of the time towards Native Americans, foreigners, and others. A short but captivating read."},{"Title":"The Diary of Mattie Spenser","review":"I read this book in two nights, which is really fast for me.... It really draws you in! I loved it!"},{"Title":"The Diary of Mattie Spenser","review":"Oh, how I enjoyed this book. I was \\"there \\" with Mattie Spenser as she made her way to the Colorado Territory with her new husband. The hardships she encountered - and the novel way the journal was discovered so that it could be read.I couldn't put this book down, in fact I read it again and savored every minute of it. I have read a few of Sandra Dallas' books - Prayers for Sale was another hit for me. I have found a new author!"},{"Title":"The Diary of Mattie Spenser","review":"THE DIARY OF MATTIE SPENSER is unlike any book I have read in quite a while. It is the tale of a twenty-two year old woman right after the Civil War. Lacking good judgement, she marries a man spontaneously before heading off to the Colorado Territory. The story takes place over the first three years of their marriage.it is a historical romance but with dark sides. Both gritty and exhausting, it is also mesmerizing. She tells of their journey with excerpts from her diary. You need to know that she pulls no punches.At 219 pages I could have polished this off in one day but it took me three. I would read a chapter and have to digest everything that went on. At times I found myself hesitant to go forward because I didn't know if I wanted to find out what my gut was telling me just happened. Still, I did.Ms. Dallas did such a good job that I wondered at times if Mattie's adventures really did happen. The secondary characters drove her story. I think it would be unfair to tell you what I personally thought of Luke and Mattie. I want you to be the judge. By the end of the book I was drained but their story will stay with me for a long time."},{"Title":"The Diary of Mattie Spenser","review":"I just really enjoyed the book starting from the first chapter ... looking back in history and seeing how life has changed over the years and a story about loving someone ..."},{"Title":"The Diary of Mattie Spenser","review":"Good old fashioned read about the pioneer times, when marriage took you places and away from places. Easy to read."},{"Title":"The Diary of Mattie Spenser","review":"Loved the writing style, read it for book club. highly recommended for book club reading. Will probably read more of her books."},{"Title":"The Diary of Mattie Spenser","review":"It's an ok book, just not on a par with the Prine books. Sorry. Ms Prine is the BEST! More words? Ah, enough."},{"Title":"The Diary of Mattie Spenser","review":"I picked this book up expecting a light, heartfelt read. And it was light, in the beginning, with occasional intensity that can be expected of a hard pioneer life. But towards the end, what I got was a twisted heartache. I must say, not may authors can do that to me.The premise for this book is excellent: the prologue introduces us to Mattie's granddaughter, who is clearing out her house. There, we find a very old diary. And so Mattie's story begins. I appreciate that this was written like a diary, not like a novel broken up into dates that most \\"diaries\\" are now-a-days. We are given the vernacular of the time, Mattie often calling her person \\"Self,\\" her husband Luke \\"Husband\\" and her child \\"Baby.\\" It took a little time to get used to, but once you begin to tune into Mattie's unique voice, it flows like honey. And boy does she have a great sense of humor! Every other page I nearly burst out laughing. Mattie is shrewd, and has a great way of depicting ordinary things, or things that I would never pay attention to.Her diary is her staunch confidant; it sees her triumphant highs (which often center around Luke giving her a small praise) and often sees her lows (which are painful). We experience the hardships of prairie life, the struggles she faces as a new wife who still has yet to bond with her husband. Because it is filtered through her eyes, we think like Mattie and don't quite realize what is happening until we discover the dark secret right along with her. I felt her pain as if it were my very own; gosh, there were times I wanted to rip the book apart in my hands, I was so furious.I won't give away any spoilers, but the last half of the book is a hard read. It's hard in the sense that your heart is, by this time, very close to Mattie. I nearly wanted to quit reading this, but kept going, because I had to know how Mattie ended up: what did she chose?This novel is excellent for those interested in the history of the pioneers, but this is no Little House on the Prairie. I would also recommend this book for those interested in women's histories. It truly is a powerful story of one woman's life."},{"Title":"The Diary of Mattie Spenser","review":"An eloquent and exciting diary of life in the Colorado gold country. Just when you think it will be another ho-hum account of struggle and strife, the author throws in a surprise ending with shocking scandal. Love this author!"},{"Title":"The Diary of Mattie Spenser","review":"Sandra Dallas' novel about Mattie Spenser's diary is very well written and reminds me of the wagon adventures of Laura Ingalls Wilder. Story opens out in present day when an older lady is moving and her neighbor is helping her get things packed. They discover a family diary and thus begins the story.Mattie is a young newlywed to Luke Spenser and the two are heading to Colorado Territory to begin their life together. While the union is iffy in the beginning, you will learn their rhythm as the story goes on.Mattie keeps a journal which her dear friend back home, Carrie, gave to her. The diary is most informative and provides the reader with interesting tidbits of the journey, including the other homesteaders they meet and the Indians they see.Some of the passages were disturbing but then it echoed a life most real for Mattie and her husband. The two have children and lose children; it is a tender tale. Don't miss out!"},{"Title":"The Diary of Mattie Spenser","review":"This is a great book. It has everything, joy, sorrow, love, hate...all of it. Mattie is a true heroin in this book. It may be a bit of a stretch believing just how MUCH Mattie had to endure out on the prarie, but it was a good story nonetheless, not as good in my opinion as Alice's Tulips, but close behind. I highly recommend!"},{"Title":"The Diary of Mattie Spenser","review":"I have only given a five star rating to 3 books in my life. Therefore, receiving four stars from me, a very tough critic means a great read. I dont think I will read this book every summer, as I do to some of my favorites. However, its message and heart-warming story will stay with me for a long while. This stoy's main theme is faith and courage, and how much of these gifts women had in the years when Colorado was just a territory and Andrew Johnson was president. The story's prologue and epiloge really make you feel as if you are picking up someone elses journel and intruding in their most secritive thoughts. I have read this book in a single day, and was not dissapointed at all with it."},{"Title":"The Diary of Mattie Spenser","review":"I have read all three of Sandra Dallas fiction books. This is by far the best. I loved the diary format, I really felt like I was living in Colorado in the 1800's. Although I was somewhat dissappointed by the ending, I realise it is probably the most realistic. Hopefully there will be more books like this from Sandra Dallas soon."},{"Title":"The Diary of Mattie Spenser","review":"Courage is the main theme of this wonderfully readable book. The historical aspects of the book seem very believable. This story of a resiliant young woman who is patient, forgiving, strong, and stubborn when stubborness is needed was refreshing and inspiring. Hopefully there will be many more Sandra Dallas books to come."},{"Title":"The Diary of Mattie Spenser","review":"A young pioneer woman inhabiting a sod house on the frontier discovers her strength and experiences the nuances of love and romance with the same emotions as a woman of the 90's. Only the customs, conveniences and external details differ. The internal questions and fears are the same. With fewer options, our heroine elected to bake another rhubarb pie in effort to win Luke's affection. What Mattie lost was herself. Bit by bit she gave up parts of herself and her possibilities for real happiness. Giving in to mores of the day and opinions of others, she lived out her life shut off from her feelings and in the absence of joy and fulfillment. Luke was brought to his knees only after awakening to the the atrocious reality of his thoughless and self-serving behavior. After 3 years of calculated deceipt, he shapes up but it's too late. For Mattie, in her grief, is devoid of love. An all too real outcome. This is either the ultimate experience of forgiveness or the tragedy of leading an emotionally isolated life. Keeps the family together at a great personal price. This book in its straightforward simplicity was a great read from start to finish."},{"Title":"The Diary of Mattie Spenser","review":"I enjoyed this even more than Persian Pickle Club. I will share this with many friends. It's nice to think that women have always been the strong ones, even when they had to keep silent. Good job taking me to a time long ago and making me feel at home there!"},{"Title":"The Diary of Mattie Spenser","review":"A story within a story, the meat of course being the personal diary of a young frontier wife, Mattie Spenser, setting out with her husband to settle the wilds of Colorado. In the three years chronicled by the diary, the strong yet plain Mattie deals with failed crops, Indian attack, childbirth, and multiple deaths. The crushing blow is the betrayal of her husband, Luke, a man she's come to love though she knows the feelings are not reciprocal.It's a compelling story, but disappointing. Unfortunately I smelled the trap of the &quot;romance novel&quot; as it was set. And sure enough, when it was sprung, it was a dull snap.This book lacked the surprise twists that mark Sandra Dallas' other novels. Perhaps the romance intrigue just mentioned was intended to fulfill that design, but it seemed too &quot;formula&quot; to me."},{"Title":"The Diary of Mattie Spenser","review":"This is a wonderful work of historical fiction. Vivid in its imagery and replete with period detail, it is a page turner of a book. I simply could not put it down! The book gives a first person narrative of what life was like on the frontier from the perspective of a young woman.In 1865, twenty-two year old Mattie McCauley is living in a small community in Iowa with her parents, when the town catch, Luke Spenser, suddenly proposes to her. No one is more surprised than Mattie, when he does so, as she always thought he would be marrying Persia Chalmers, his longtime sweetheart. Not giving it more than a second thought, Mattie accepts his proposal, and before she knows it, finds herself headed to the Colorado Territory with her new husband.Mattie records in her diary details of her trip by wagon train to her new home, as well as what happens once she gets there. Along the way she makes friends, learns some hard facts about her husband, as well as her marriage, and forges a life, one that reader will find to be of interest. Those who enjoy well-written historical fiction will love this utterly engaging book!"},{"Title":"The Diary of Mattie Spenser","review":"Sandra Dallas did an excellent job with the subject matter. The book has uplifting circumstances and low areas of concern and sadness. Unfortunately, it does not have a \\"happy ending\\", but it does have a realistic ending. Life was, after all, not idealistic on the plains of Colorado."},{"Title":"The Diary of Mattie Spenser","review":"Was a very good read & insightful to the hardships & lives of that time of our history. I enjoy knowing what our founders had to do to live!"},{"Title":"The Diary of Mattie Spenser","review":"I really enjoyed this book, along with 'These is my words', couldn't put either one down once I started readiing."},{"Title":"The Diary of Mattie Spenser","review":"I have read every book written by Sandra Dallas and this is one of my top 2 favorites (the other one is \\"True Sisters\\".) The book has adventure, history, romance and drama. Ms. Dallas hit it out of the park with this book. It is one of those books you just can't put down until you finish!"},{"Title":"The Diary of Mattie Spenser","review":"Not my favorite of Sandra's books, but definitely an easy, enjoyable read. The story flows well, but I wish I could learn more about what happened to Mattie after the diary part concludes. Overall, though, I'd recommend this for a quick, light read."},{"Title":"The Diary of Mattie Spenser","review":"Have really enjoyed previous books by Sandra Dallas, but this was truly a disappointment. It was so lacking that I didn't even want to pass it along to the free library!"},{"Title":"The Diary of Mattie Spenser","review":"I bought this book because I loved Sandra Dallas' new book \\"True Sisters\\", so I decided to try another of her works. After I began reading this one, I purchased five more Dallas books from Amazon and eagerly await their arrival. Reading Mattie's diary kept me up at night because I just didn't want to put the book down. Being such an avid reader, I cannot believe that I skipped Dallas' work for so many years, but now I am glad I did because I have the distinct treat of reading them all, and they are new to me. First of all, I really enjoy books written in diary form. This one is about a young woman who marries and within a month is on her way from Iowa to the Colorado Territory, and it takes place directly after the Civil War. The story depicts the people, the way of life (living in a soddy), the weather, the sparse group of neighbors and their stories and personalities, the difficulties of child birth (no doctors), illnesses, hearbreaks and triumphs. Most importantly, Mattie's strength really shines through. She was one incredible woman, and this is an amazing work from Sandra Dallas. Her historical research, written into the story's events, is awesome in its scope and very interesting. In comparing our lives today with theirs in this time period, it is a wonder that any survived. Do a good deed for yourself, and purchase this book."},{"Title":"The Diary of Mattie Spenser","review":"I loved reading this book. \\"Mattie\\" even talked about my home town in a way I had never heard about it.

Gives me a new appreciation for the ladies who traveled west to seek a better life in the 1800's."},{"Title":"The Diary of Mattie Spenser","review":"I was very excited about this book and enjoyed the first half of it. It then became unrealistic. The number of deaths even for that time period was too high. I spoke with an historian about it and he agreed, while times were indeed difficult and health care virtually nonexistent, people did survive.Also the plugging in of momentous historical events in the diary was just that, they were plugged in and didn't fit in with the flow.The writing was good and it was a good read."},{"Title":"The Diary of Mattie Spenser","review":"Although THE DIARY OF MATTIE SPENSER is a work of fiction, the author did seem to do extensive research into the history of the settlement of the Colorado frontier. This story has a wonderful realistic quality about it and I felt that the characters were real people. Mattie's diary entries rang true to me!The story begins in Iowa when Mattie accepts a proposal of marriage from Luke Spenser. She's surprised and delighted since Luke is a handsome man and also very likeable. He had been the beau of another girl who was quite a beauty, but a very callow person. Mattie and Luke head to the Colorado territory soon after their wedding to start a new life on the frontier. From the beginning, Mattie does her best to be a good wife to Luke, but he often seems remote and unapproachable.Frontier life was difficult. It might seem simple to take a bath, but first you had to carry the water in from a distant pond. Living in a sod house was dark, dusty and snakes were all around the property. Mattie was not a complainer and had always been know as a person who was a hard worker. So she rarely complained.There are many delightful passages in the book; one, is the following description of a kind lady that Mattie met on a trip to Denver. Mattie says, \\"I have become very fond of Mrs. Chubb. She is a jolly, fleshy woman who spends her time reading romantic novels. She said she had been unable to cure herself of the vice and feared it would excite her passions unduly, but I replied I thought the greater harm in novels was exciting the purse.\\"Mattie's life is filled with highs and lows, but I don't want to give too much away. This is a wonderful story and worth reading.Judith Miller"},{"Title":"The Diary of Mattie Spenser","review":"This book is one of my all time favorite reads!

Mattie is not someone you will soon forget."},{"Title":"The Diary of Mattie Spenser","review":"I love the covered wagon and old west days and I loved this book. This is the story of Love, marriage and traveling to find a better life in the 1800's. This is a sweet book. If you could survive childbirth and the simple illnesses without vaccine and live...you were lucky.I emailed Sandra Dallas after I read this and she was so sweet to return my email. I told her how much I enjoyed the book. If you think you have it tough...Go back in time with this book....We have a good life. Great book"},{"Title":"The Diary of Mattie Spenser","review":"My friends and I loved this book. What trials poor Mattie went through! Dallas certainly knows how to get inside the minds of her characters. When this one ended though, I wasn't sure Mattie hadn't created some fiction to fill lonesome days on the frontier. Reading the letter written by Mattie's husband at the end of the novel causes my uncertainty. I don't know if Dallas meant to leave that kernal of doubt, if she meant to portray the difference in the way men and women perceive events, or if the ending was just a little weak. At any rate, this fictional journal is certainly worth reading if you enjoy stories about frontier life."},{"Title":"The Diary of Mattie Spenser","review":"I didn't want to put this book down or for it to end. Sandra Dallas combined both a wonderful plot in a fascinating time period with the unique character of Maggie Spenser. I usually do not like books in a diary or letter format b/c there is so much skipping around and it feels like the flow is interrupted. And I sometimes feel that I am missing out on some aspect of the novel, such as setting or other character's personalities. This book proved me wrong. The story flowed so well and through Mattie's insightful observations, we as readers, understood the landscape and the lives of these settlers.This book made me laugh at loud during certain parts like Mattie's thoughts about the marriage bed. Mattie is a wonderful character. Even though she acted the part of a loyal, subserviate wife (as those times had dictated), she always had a spunky nature. Her individualism is apparent in her diary entries.And this book made me feel sad during the hard times of sickness, death, and betrayal. Despite such hard times, this novel has a happy tone. It ends realistically which I am glad for. Instead of running off, she decides to stay and it seems that Luke and her turn out to have a wonderful life."},{"Title":"The Diary of Mattie Spenser","review":"This is another excellent historical tale from a true master of the form. Sandra Dallas captures period dialog and detail brilliantly."},{"Title":"The Diary of Mattie Spenser","review":"I've recommended this book to everyone in Colorado who shows the least amount of interest in our history. Forget that! Sandra Dallas blends perfectly scholarly knowledge of the Colorado Territory and the lives of the people who came here with a dream.

Mattie Spenser is my hero!"},{"Title":"The Diary of Mattie Spenser","review":"I couldn't put this book down! I love historical material and even though this is a work of fiction it was so beautifully written it seemed that I was reading about very real people. Sandra Dallas must have done a great deal of research of the people in this era for I felt as though I were living in the \\"soddy\\" with Mattie, \\"your darling boy\\" Luke, and \\"baby\\" Johnny or \\"boykins\\".

When I came to the end of the book I was sad to be done with such a great read!"},{"Title":"StarList 2000: A Quick Reference Star Catalog for Astronomers","review":"This book has three parts: the Starlist, the visual binary stars (includes drawn orbits), and the variable stars (includes graphs of maxima/minima). Excellent ephemerides.The first part, the Starlist, has been an indispensable source of information. Stars are listed by constellation and includes: RA/Dec, spectral classification, absolute magnitude, apparent magnitude, distance (in light years), parallax, proper motion, direction of apparent motion (disregarding precession), space velocity, radial velocity (where known), size (in solar diameters), luminosity, and Henry Draper Catalogue star reference number (HD). There are many remarks/comments throughout, on various stars. These remarks are concise and helpful, and show Mr. Dibon-Smith's love for the field. Think of it as a one volume condensed Burnham's Celestial Handbook.The second section of this book, visual binaries, includes the combined magnitude, apparent magnitude of each component (with a few exceptions, only the brightest pair of a multiple system), PA/Sep, and orbital information. At the end of the section is a graphic representation of the orbits of binaries with periods of 300 years or less.The third section, variable stars. They are listed by subgroup: pulsating, eruptive, rotating, peculiar, eclipsing, and type uncertain. The first part has graphs of the maxima/minima of Mira type stars, and some semiregular variable stars. Part three also lists type of variable, maximum range, epoch, period, and best viewing dates.That's not all this book offers. There is a section on computer programs (in BASIC) to find: day of the week (given the Julian date), Julian date (given the calendar date), calendar date/day of the week (given the Julian date), position of a star (given the RA/Dec and latitude/longitude of the observer), RA on the meridian (given the calendar date), midnight transit of a star (given the RA), and the approximate date of maxima of a long-period variable. Another section lists stars by RA. Another section identifies star names (fun if you had no idea where Zubenalgubi is...it's Sigma Librae). The bibliography and indices are also helpful.I learned that this book is also tons-o-fun for the science fiction buff, too. So, the space ninja chased the nasty asteroid pirates all the way to Phi Eridani, did they? Well, now you'll know that Phi Eridani is a B8 V, and 180 light years away.Seriously, this book has been indispensable.

You would be hard pressed to find any other business that could survive the sort of gross arrogance and incompetence in the way it bills and collects from its customers.If you assume that everyone--hospital administrators, doctors, and insurance companies alike--would genuinely want their bills to be correct and accurate, you are very very wrong.This little book shows you through the experience of others, how you too can get your pocket picked, but even more important, it shows you how to protect yourself.The author shows you how to: how to get a detailed itemized bill, how you can learn their language, how to recognize and reduce excessive charges, how to recognize and remove duplicate charges, how to recognize and reveal hidden charges, how to recognize and reject undocumented charges, how health insurance works today, how to fix some problems before they arise, how to recognize and reverse insurance denials,Also included, are very helpful chapters on: helpful websites, and a directory of people who can help you get your money back.The author is a leading consumer advocate for patients, and she gives you the knowledge that you need to fight back.

When the bill comes, it's overwhelming. I spent 3 weeks in the hospital and received a 20-page bill when my insurance tried to deny my claim. Using Pat's advice, I scrutinized my bills and medical records. I found billing errors (totalling almost $11,000) a huge medication error (we're filing a lawsuit about that one) and other &quot;fun&quot; surprises. It's amazing that they can run a business like this!Some of the writing is pretty sensationalistic, which is annoying, and sometimes he takes 3 pages to say what he could have said in two paragraphs.

However, it is probably one of the few recent books I've seen which focuses on the plight of homosexuality exclusively in the Catholic Church. The author discusses several of the Vatican documents(1975, 1986,1992)on homosexuality as well as the American Bishops letter of 1997-8. What is most striking in his approach is Jordan's breakdown of the rhetoric of the Catholic Church. In order to better understand what the Church's statements themselves mean, Jordan enables the reader by breaking down the layers of 'silence' by the church: their background, and the rhetoric used to maintain the status quo. Stylistically, parts of the text seemed fragmentary. It did not help that almost every paragraph was separated by little ____ dividers, which distracted this reader to the overall thought process. Jordan borrows and builds on several notions from Sedgwick's &quot;Epistemology of the Closet.&quot; I found the chapter on the 'Liturgy Queen' and Clerical Drag quite amusing. For a book focusing on 'catholic' issues with homosexuality, the last chapter offers the most promise by describing the possibilities of living as a lesbigay Catholic. Overall I'd give the book between 3 and 4 stars (3 and a half, if there was the option)."},{"Title":"The Silence of Sodom: Homosexuality in Modern Catholicism","review":"Mark Jordan breaks rank with D.S. Bailey, John McNeil, S.J., and John Boswell, who preceded him in writing about homosexuality and the Roman Catholic Church. His keen analysis of homoeroticism in the life of the church, specifically among the clergy, has more in common with Raymond de Becker, who, in The Other Side of Love, wrote convincingly on the latent homosexuality of Christianity. Jordan also writes convincingly on the homoeroticism that continues to attract so many young men to join the Catholic clergy. The church's liturgy, music, and art continue to offer outlets for expression that are acceptable among a celibate clergy. There is probably no other religion so disturbed by homosexuality. Echoing Michel Foucault, Jordan states that the homophobia of recent church pronouncements is a new, modern phenomenon adopted from the modern state's need to control sexuality. This position supports that of Garry Wills, who, in &quot;Papal Sin,&quot; shows how the modern papacy has become obsessed with the need for absolute authority. &quot;In the last few centuries,&quot; Jordan writes, &quot;Catholic life has been ravaged by the requirements of absolue obedience. Whether seen from the inside or outside, the distinguishing mark of modern Catholicism has often seemed obedience and nothing more. The theological virtues are no longer faith, hope, and charity, but submission, sumission, submission.&quot; He quotes Nietzche's description of Catholicism as &quot;a continuing suicide of reason.&quot; Jordan writes, &quot;Nietzche is astute to single this out as a distinctively Catholic pleasure--the protracted, the deliciously painful self-mutilation of a magnificent mind undoing itself in obedience.&quot; We wonder, if Jordan rejects the authority of the Pope, how is he different from a Protestant, and why does he fret so about finding a place for homosexuality within the Catholic church? In rejecting the concept of gay identity as an oppressive role that is a function of homophobia, Jordan follows the prevalent consensus of sociologists, who have confirmed Kinsey's assertion that there is no such thing as a homosexual. &quot;We should feel contrition,&quot; Jordan writes, &quot;for having pretended to have a sexual identity, when what we had were desires, memories, and loves.&quot; Yet, why does he persist in labelling people as if there were two kinds of people on earth, &quot;gay&quot; and &quot;straight.&quot; In failing to perceive the term &quot;homosexual&quot; as too large an umbrella to tell us anything meaningful about a person's behavior or feelings, he missed a unique opportunity to clarify our language about sex. Jordan calls for a new language, but what we need is not a new language about gay and lesbian lives but about how all people can accept and integrate homoerotic pleasures and feelings into their lives and their faith."},{"Title":"The Silence of Sodom: Homosexuality in Modern Catholicism","review":"In the recent media feeding frenzy around the topic of priests and minors this important book has rarely been quoted. Has it been totgeschwiegen? I found it far more instructive and thought-provoking than Donald Cozzens's cautious and rather preachy work, which has been referred to again and again. Habent sua fata libelli. Jordan is a distinguished scholar of historical theology, so one of the high points of this book is his commentary on the style of recent Vatican pronouncements on sexual ethics. Every moralist, pastor, counselor should read those pages -- the most telling analysis of the mentality behind current Vatican teaching that I have ever read. One thinks of Soviet dissidents doing an analysis of official communist jargon. Jordan writes with more than usual openness and vulnerability -- an edge of anger. But his writing also has a ludic, witty dimension. Even the much-derided comments on liturgical camp have a flair missed by those unaccustomed to literary ironies. He quotes French authors such as Pierre Klossowski, certainly a tactical error in dealing with the American public. I would say that Jordan lacks the common touch. As to his accusations against the Catholic clergy, I do not think they can be easily dismissed. In fact they are profoundly unsettling. The recent scandals are only the flip side of a great betrayal of the flock, especially its gay members, by priests who have gone along with the \\"Don't ask, don't tell\\" policies imposed by Rome since 1968 (Humanae Vitae). Garry Wills said the same thing in his study of the \\"structures of deceit\\" shaping Catholic lives. But Jordan's indictment reaches deeper, probes more intimately. The gay priesthood is a vast, unexplored universe, simply because those who know don't talk. Jordan has shone a torchlight into the dark jungle. Perhaps he might think of writing in a happier, more celebratory style the next time."},{"Title":"The Silence of Sodom: Homosexuality in Modern Catholicism","review":"This book offers an answer to the question of why homosexuality is such a repeated theme on Catholic internet discussion lists on the net.Jordan's book is *not* another example of the efforts to discuss the fallacies of &quot;natural law&quot; arguments used in recent Catholic documents (although, in passing, Jordan -- a specialist in the thought of Aquinas -- does quite spectacularly explode current uses of such language); nor does he discuss the by now absurd use of &quot;proof texts&quot; by the Catholic bureaucracy.Rather Jordan addresses the huge number of official Catholic documents about homosexuality since 1975 (not just from the Vatican, but from bishop after bishop, and so forth). He also considers the rhetorical strategies of such documents, and especially the extreme violence of the language used.He sees the rhetoric and the strategies of the Catholic bureaucracy (which arrogates to itself the meaningless term &quot;Magisterium&quot;) as an effort to impose a standard of silence, above all about the intricate interconnection of homosexuality and Catholicism, a truth which must not be stated, and if it is stated, must be opposed &quot;by all means possible.&quot;I am not always in agreement with Jordan's arguments (I positively dissent from his dismissal of the possibility of history), and I do not like his adoption of an aphoristic style, but this is a new approach to this subject. More than that, it is an essentially more profound work than Helminiak's _What the Bible Really Says about Homosexuality_ or John McNeill's _The Church and the Homosexual._Other authors have tried to argue with the church bureaucracy: Jordan shows why such argument does not work. Not because the arguments are wrong, but because those who are presented the arguments are not allowed to think."},{"Title":"The Silence of Sodom: Homosexuality in Modern Catholicism","review":"Mark Jordon's book does an adequate job of discussing the systematic Catholic language that does now allow for disagreement or dissent. Beyond that Jordan reveals how homerotic the liturgy and the beauracracy of the Church is. Jordan then challenges to begin a new Catholic community. Not a community such as Dignity, but one in which a new language and a new way of saying homosexual can become the foundation of a new teaching.For some Gay Catholics, who wish to stay within the church, this may seem like whistling past the cemetery. But it may be the only way one can move the Catholic Church, albeit probably through another milennium, into not only the recognition that its basis is homoerotic, but to embrace it as well.One wonders, though, how this community begins. Where are the writers, the liturgists, the theologians? The only other answer for gay Catholics is to find another denomination or marginal quasi Christian group.Jordon's idea may be quite exciting."},{"Title":"The Silence of Sodom: Homosexuality in Modern Catholicism","review":"Relying on poor biblical exegesis and translation, this book tries to sophist its way around justifying why homosexual acts are actually quite moral and in line with natural law and divine teaching while all the while proclaiming the supposed ignorance of a Church who, for lack of a better term, are supposedly in the closet.This is not serious scholarship and is rather just a sophistic and illogical attempt to circumvent Catholic teaching for the sake of moral relativism."},{"Title":"The Silence of Sodom: Homosexuality in Modern Catholicism","review":"The author has one convincing claim in this book. He argues that the percentage of homosexuals in the Catholic priesthood is higher than that in the general population. He's probably right. So what? The same is also probably true of the Protestant and Jewish clergy (both married and unmarried). The same is probably true of men in the helping professions generally: social workers, teachers, nurses, clergy.But the author leaps from this truism into an assault on everything Catholic: vestments, incense, Mary, the teaching on chastity, papal authority. The hysteria only dies out at the end when the author takes on Focuault, an author he clearly doesn't understand. Focuault was a philosopher. This book is a bumper sticker written in red ink.Yes, it's hard to be dispassionate on sexual issues. But the sophisticated teaching of the Catholic Church on sexual questions deserves better than this."},{"Title":"The Silence of Sodom: Homosexuality in Modern Catholicism","review":"This book is truly a scholastic masterpiece.

It is an exercise in rage---rage that the Church still proclaims the value of chastity in the midst of the bourgeoisie's ongoing sexual revolution.The author sees signs of homosexuality everywhere in Catholicism. Incense, Marian devotions, vestments---they all show occult signs of homosexuality. The signs, of course, are so occult that most us can't see it. I never realized what an erotic thirll chasubles secretly are.The poor author can't quite figure out where his rant will go---although he's certain that John Paul II is the enemy. On the one hand, he yells about the alleged predominance of homosexuals in the clergy and in the seminaries. But that sounds too homophobic. So he then rants that the Church isn't homosexual enough. It's too straight, too pro-family, too traditional.Poor scholarship, another sad screed from the anti-Catholic Catholic."},{"Title":"The Silence of Sodom: Homosexuality in Modern Catholicism","review":"OK, so it isn't a review, but it has been puzzling me for some time.

This book is pure anger, but the author can't quite figure out whether Catholics or homosexuals are the object of his anger.The author claims on flimsy evidence that the Catholic Church is run by a group of homosexuals and that it always has been. The evidence is not very persuasive. It comes down to the Catholic taste for flowers, decorations, fancy dress. By that criterion, the Rose Bowl Parade is a gay conspiracy.The author rants about this imagined scandal. But what does he want? Sexual orientation tests at the seminary door to keep the clergy straight? The College of Cardinals meeting at the Stonewall?Anything with anti-Catholic rage will sell these days, but the rage here would make Act-Up wince."},{"Title":"The Silence of Sodom: Homosexuality in Modern Catholicism","review":"The Catholic Church does not acknowledge \\"homosexuality\\" as a matter of identity; there are men and women, and some people are living chastely and some are not. The only holy expression of human sexuality is between one man and one woman within marriage, period. And, some people are afflicted with a mental, emotional, spiritual and sexual disorder whose origins we don't entirely understand, and which results in their being attracted to the same sex. Some of these people still manage to live chastely and some do not. Any one who acts on same sex attractions is committing grave, mortal sin, period. For this author to claim that \\"homosexual lives have to audible\\" in the Church is to ignore that basic truth that there is no such thing as a \\"homosexual life,\\" just as there is no such thing as an \\"alcoholic life\\" or a \\"adultery life.\\" People are people first, and their identity is not determined exclusively by one or another of their sins or vulnerabilities to sin. I have a tendancy to lose my temper, but that does not mean I am a \\"temperist,\\" or should somehow be indulged whenever the urge to lose my temper occurs. The Church exists to help me become calmer, to not become angry as often, and to learn how to control my behavior like a grown up. This is the same purpose the Church serves in the lives of people with same-sex attraction problems. There is no circumstance whatsoever where anyone who commits homosexual acts is not guilty of grave, mortal sin, period and end of discussion."},{"Title":"The Silence of Sodom: Homosexuality in Modern Catholicism","review":"In this book anti-Catholic scholarship reaches a new low. The book claims that the Catholic Church is secretly run by a cabal of homosexuals. But it's so secret that there's no public evidence for it. The author tries to stretch anecdotes, rumors, and guesses into an argument. It really got fun when he breathlessly quotes the &quot;evidence&quot; of former friends of a former chauffeur who claimed to drive an unnamed cardinal to trysts in the night. But the fact that there's so little evidence just shows that there's---you guessed it!---a terrible coverup of the evidence. The National Enquirer does better than this.I am sure that the grammatically challenged Mr. Jordan will soon entertain us with the tale of how the College of Cardinals planned the JFK assassination and shot down that airliner off Long Island. This hysterical anti-Catholic McCarthyism has become par for the course. But how did a serious press like U.

This book gives a brief lesson in Puerto Rican history and the complexities of race, class and gender relationships.This novel tells the story of two wealth Puerto Rican families. The tellling of the stories leads to disagreements between the main characters, husband and wife, Quintin and Isabel. Their disagreements beg the reader to decide which one is telling the truth and who is more believable. It is a fascinating journey which challenges the reader, which is exactly what a great book should do."},{"Title":"The House on the Lagoon","review":"I read this book on the recommendation of a friend who is a Puertorriqueno-Americano. He read it in Espanol and loved it. I read it in English and truly enjoyed the beauty of the writing and extremely well crafted characters. Three houses on the lagoon was a stretch of the imagination. I learned at least one woman's perspective of Puerto Rican history and culture presented in a highly palatable form. I have no idea of how well it represents reality (which -- as the book illustrates -- is highly dependent on the eye of the beholder). As a fan of detective novels I ended up thinking that the author killed off more characters than the average thriller. I concluded that Quintin knew the number to the Swiss bank account -- just a strong impression. The book made me want to take my next Caribbean vacation in Puerto Rico. My friend warned me not to expect to find the house on the lagoon which seemed so real to me. Accepted for what it is, this is a fine book."},{"Title":"The House on the Lagoon","review":"Rosario Ferr&eacute; is without doubt a formidable writer with broad literary formation (holding a doctorate in Latin American literature) and impressive versatility in genres: short story, poetry, essay, novelist. She joins that welcomed and exciting cadre of Latina writers who skillfully articulates profound feminist concerns in their respective societies. In THE HOUSE ON THE LAGOON, Ferr&eacute; presents two of her constantly recurring themes that form the core of her literary trajectory: Puerto Rican reality past and present ... the agonizing socio-psychological consequences produced by the unique historical-political-economic link to the United States; and Latina feminism accompanied by society's ugly prejudicial response. This story offers a highly critical view of Puerto Rican society with a bold reinterpretation of her island's history. As in all her tales and essays (as she herself has revealed) there is a thinly veiled autobiographical reflection. Ferr&eacute; crafts a stunning literary language that expresses itself via surreal images similar to those that characterized the vanguard writers and visual artists of the opening decades of the twentieth century. In Spanish we call the technique &quot;desdoblamiento&quot; -- the exposition or unfolding of images to narrate the events afflicting her protagonists. It perhaps functions more intensively in the original Spanish. But what results in essence is a mystical fusion of fiction and reality ... magical realism. This is a mesmerizing work by an extremely talented writer and is highly recommended.Alan CambeiraAuthor of AZUCAR! The Story of Sugar (a novel)"},{"Title":"The House on the Lagoon","review":"Like most of the reviewers here, I was totally absorbed by this book and its exquisite vision and representation of a racially separated Puerto Rican world. I wasn't blind to the stereotypes that Ferre employs, just accepting of the fact that her fictional characters have a factual basis in reality.But what sets this book apart from the other Latin American authors I have read was the marvelous intertextuality of the story--both husband and wife writing and rewriting history while remaining silent with each other. Quintin's contributions to Isabel's story were every bit as fascinating as the family saga she was weaving. But there's not enough of his point of view, as Ferre takes a turn from his perspective to finishing off the story.The obvious issue at stake here is whether history or fiction has more merit--and whether written family histories MUST be faithful to facts. This ideological debate is one that has polarized academics in the humanities before, and its treatment here was utterly fascinating. Unfortunately, Ferre couldn't sustain that premise, and the novel quickly deteriorates in the final chapters towards its overly Hollywood-ish ending. But up until the last third, it's a marvelous read, and as thought-provoking on racial issues as it is on the themes of revenge, family loyalties, and money."},{"Title":"The House on the Lagoon","review":"I became a fan of Ferre after reading her collection entitled, The Youngest Doll. Present in all of her tales, is the story of an island immersed in a constant struggle between race, language, religion, ownership, and histories which involve three continents. Intertwined within this struggle for identity, Ferre brings a woman, equally intertwined, and equally struggling. The House On The Lagoon is about one woman's attempt to understand and redeem the history of herself, and all of the women in her family, by writing a historical account of their lives (How accurate becomes an issue in the plot, however, it is her bravery in attemptng the rediscovery that is significant). It is also about a husband who is terrified of his wife laying claim to herself. Through this tale we are told stories of several generations-Spaniards, Africans, Corsicans, and Puerto Ricans. We are also given a sense of how the debate as to the island's independence or dependence on the United States has shaped every generation born in Puerto Rico this century.

I thought it was a fine novel, but not such a memorable one. &quot;Eva Luna&quot;, &quot;House of the Spirits&quot;, &quot;The Infinite Plan&quot; and others by Isabel Allende have resurfaced in my mind from time to time ever since I read them. I think every reader experiences some discomfort after reading a truly superior writer and then finding that other writers are bland in comparison. &quot;The House on the Lagoon&quot; is a good book, but it is not on the same level as Allende or Gabriel Garcia Marquez... I think that readers expecting storytelling and magical realism akin to Allende and Marquez will be disappointed."},{"Title":"The House on the Lagoon","review":"After reading all of the positive reviews by Anglophone readers excited to read about the Puerto Rico of Rosario Ferr&eacute;'s The House on the Lagoon, I just had to respond. ough she is often praised for her realism and for not succumbing to the &quot;magical realism&quot; of other Latin American authors, this novel is quite full of &quot;magic&quot;. The white characters are all &quot;realist&quot; in their world perspectives, but the book is full of absurd stereotypes of Puerto Rican black people. Almost every black character is a &quot;santero&quot; and a servant to a white person. While the story is a tired re-telling of Puerto Rican history through the story of an upper class family, everyone who doesn't fit in that family is therefore relegated to a backseat in this vision of the island's past and present. A clear move away from her previous writings in Spanish, this book is too obviously a stereotyped view of a Caribbean island designed to engross (white) North American readers who wouldn't know better."},{"Title":"The House on the Lagoon","review":"Otherwise I would have been quite lost - so many angry husbands and long-suffering wives. I liked the conceit of having the main male character (Quentin) &quot;discover&quot; the book as it's being written by his wife (Isabell). It highlighted the differences the author suggests between the male and female conceptions of history. I thought the structure sort of broke down at the end as real events took over and the central dialogue was left behind. I assumed that we, the readers, would satisfyingly uncover the truth at the same time as Quentin, but he never got to read the last pages. And perhaps I missed something, but what did happen to that Swiss bank account?"},{"Title":"The House on the Lagoon","review":"I am always on the look-out for hispanic female authors, so when I saw Rosario Ferre's books, I looked forward to enjoying them. But Ms. Ferre's writing is always just a little too convoluted, the stories too complicated, too involved. This book is a book within a book. The title character is trying to be an author, and her husband, also an author, takes apart her book, which she is hiding and he is finding. She knows he reads it and looks for his notes in her margins. He hates the book. She's angry with him.Toward the end of the book, I got so confused regarding just what was happening to whom - was it Ferre's character, or her character's character? I actually went looking for the original Spanish to try and figure it out.Too much work."},{"Title":"The House on the Lagoon","review":"Many have praised Ferre for her style of realism that doesn't fall in the much re-used &quot;magic realism&quot; of the latinamerican literature of the past decades. However, this story is about a Puerto Rico from a privileged point of view that sadly reinforces social stereotypes. The story is very interesting but truly unbelievable and too fictional to effectively portray a realistic view of the puertorican society during this ce ntury"},{"Title":"The House on the Lagoon","review":"Ferre's novel documents the life of a prominent family in Puerto Rico shortly after the end of the Spanish-American War, and although she tries to write in a style similar to that of the great Isabel Allende, she doesn't even come close to it. There are many reasons this book never did well among the eyes of critics and reaaders. They include(1) The book was written in English. Upon its' release, the book stirred controversy in Puerto Rico, due to that nation's use and respect for Spanish. Ms. Ferre's political connections (her father, Luis, was a former governor of the island who favored statehood) probably had a lot to do with this, and one thing writers know is not to mix a book's imminent success with cultural nationalism.(2) The book's references to Spanish colonialism seems very negative and crtical. Again, Ms. Ferre's leaning towards everything Pro-American can't undo the 400 years of colonialism Spain has left on the island, especially when it comes to its' language. As a Puerto Rican of Spanish descent, I found it both insulting and disturbing that although the Spanish were not perfect, Ms. Ferre decided to put down the country that gave Puerto Ricans many things that we can't erase or deny. Surnames, religion, place names, history, and culture are contributions that can't be undone.(3) Ms. Ferre's characters seem to be out-of-touch with the common Puerto Rican. Although there are social elites who wield money (statehooders) and the ideologically elite who possess great knowledge and love for their nation (independence seekers), she really has never written about the &quot;jibaro&quot; and other traditional rural characters that gave Puerto Rico her identity. Truly this is her greatest mistake.Ms. Ferre is no Julia de Burgos, nor she will never be. She is no Esmeralda Santiago who has written novels that are relevant to the Puerto Rican experience. She is no Julia Alvarez, the Dominican writer who is possibly the greatest Latina writer to come out of the Caribbean in recent years. Ferre is unique, and in my opinion is that unless she gives un-biased, apolitical accounts of Puerto Rican life in her future novels, she might as well pack up her typewriter and put it in the closet. Overall, a disappointing novel."},{"Title":"The House on the Lagoon","review":"This book drew me in with the author's style, reminiscent of Isabel Allende (even the title seems to be a variation of &quot;The House of Spirits&quot;)...Ferre's writing style is superb, the descriptions vivid and she held my interest throughout...granted, she did present an upper class Puerto Rico, but I think it was never the author's intention to present the Puerto rico most of us know...I do agree that ending was a bit overblown and holywoodish; however it did not take away from my enjoyment of the book. I am glad that Puerto Rico is producing writers like Ferre, because she is a notch above many best selling authors today...I have both the English and Spanish versions of this book and I think that both are very good...my wife is reading the Spanish version and prefers it...if I'm not mistaken I did not see any translator named in the book thus I assume Ferre herself produced both versions...if she did, it was an admirable piece of work, because both versions carry the same great flavor of her excellent writing; despite the linguistic differneces... y por ultimo, este libro me ayudo re-descubrir mis raices puertoriquenos en un tiempo de auto busqueda, porque el libro es sobre todo acerca de lo que es definirse a luz de la historia de la familia...todos tenemos nuestros historias y todos tenemos nuestras percepciones de esa historia, lo cual nos auto-define... this book is a discovery of life against the backdrop of a family history...this book has helped me, in a way, to look at my own life... I hope more authors like Ferre come out...and Ferre herself I wish to say &quot;gracias&quot; for this work...."},{"Title":"The House on the Lagoon","review":"This is the story of Puerto Rico and a prominent family seen through the eyes of a husband and wife with violently opposing views of life. The characters are rich and passionate with a few appropriately larger than life. The history of the island as well as the history of the family impels the reader to rush to the end of the book which is a huge surprise and very appropriate."},{"Title":"The House on the Lagoon","review":"For the most part, this novel is an excellent review of high society in Puerto Rico for the period. It's representation of racism, patriotism, and greed is superb. I felt as if I was part of the cast, although as an observer."},{"Title":"The House on the Lagoon","review":"Although I feel that Ferre's ability to write in English has improved since she wrote The House in the Lagoon (still not comparable to her elegant and beautiful skill with her native tongue), my review responds to some comments made by Mr.Luis Hernandez in his review: &quot;Close but not even close to Isabel Allende&quot;. First things first. Mr. Hernandez, comparing Ferre to Isabel Allende, Julia de Burgos (por Dios!) or the INFAMOUS Esmeralda Santiago (eek!) is neither here nor there. A writer, I believe, should be taken into consideration based on his/her own merits. But I guess that is not my biggest problem with this review. Actually, I think Mr.Hernandez, with all your travels and experiences in the small island of Puerto Rico, you seem to have only a very dim perception of the intricate diversity and complex make-up of the island's ever changing social, economic and racial dynamics.Mr. Hernandez,you are all upset because Ferre's book deals with rich land owners and not the dirt poor barrio/slums communities, therefore, the book does not deal with &quot;The Puerto Rican experience.&quot; The Puerto Rican experience??? Are you kidding me?If anything Rosario Ferre brings to life another side of the island. You think it's fun reading about stereotypical dirt poor socially disadvantaged jibaros ALL THE TIME? I mean, that's fun for a while, I'm for that whole &quot;learn from your history and your roots&quot; and all that song and dance, but, COME ON!I'm a young educated white upper class female from Puerto Rico, so according to you, Mr. Hernandez no one would EVER want to read a book I write. I'll have to keep that in mind so I don't even bother.Nevertheless, I do believe every individual's experience is unique, valuable and worth the read if their style and content is pleasing to an audience. Ferre obviously has it. People have responded well to her books, she is a successful writer and, although being an independentista I may not always agree with her political biases, I'm absolutely PSYCHED her books have already been translated in seven languages and she's coming up with new stuff! So, bring it on!It's really disturbing when people like Mr. Hernandez insist on categorizing and confining individuals to ridiculous generalizations: statehooders / rich, independentistas/poor. Apparently this guy knows very little about what is going on in the island and has obviously NEVER touched a history book! Ok, so let's play a game, dear readers,... only those who've had what Mr. Hernandez labels &quot;The Puerto Rican experience&quot; (whatever that is) raise your hand... Ok, only you guys can write successful books that people will read, respect and relate to, the rest of us may shut up now.And by the way,those of you who CAN write, make sure you write like Julia de Burgos and Isabel Allende...So to all of you, open minded souls out there, read about the rich people in the Caribbean, get mesmerized by all the political turmoil and marital struggle amidst the bewitching landscape of a place like no other on earth. It sure is a lot of fun! At the very least, a refreshing change of pace!"},{"Title":"The House on the Lagoon","review":"This book has a floppy ending. It feels like Rosario Ferre rushed to get it done. I enjoyed reading about the island in the old days, and the author does a good job describing customs and philosophies. Although the story has some flaws early on, the historical details kept me quite entertained. When the story started to center more in the current family events, i became disappointed. Quintin had been a voice early in the book, but at the end he is mute, and it would have been really nice to have heard what he had to say. And Isabel, who is supposed to be such a strong person, concedes defeat several times, and weakly justifies her actions. I would recommend it only to those that want to learn more about old PR."},{"Title":"The House on the Lagoon","review":"When this novel was originally released, I was a college student taking a compendium course in Latin American Literature in the Twentieth Century. The professor, a struggling writer who has since managed to become one of the main voices in contemporary Puerto Rican literature, panned the book because of Ferre's attempt to market her work in the United States by publishing it in English. I was impressed with her reasons to oppose Ferre's book, so I decided not to read it. For a long time it remained \\"that\\" unread book you think about from time to time.A couple of years ago I decided to read it, but in Spanish, which was the original language the writer used for her story. Ferre has said that she didn't trust her English enough to say exactly what she wanted to say, so she wrote the novel in Spanish first and then translated the whole thing herself to English.Like other reviewers, I was kind of disappointed by the last third of the book. It felt rushed and sprawling. There are multiple racial and class stereotypes, but I think this has more to do with how the characters' view others than with any subconscious leanings on the writer's part. Many things she writes about the history of Puerto Rico seem to be directed at a foreign audience, an audience that knows nothing about Puerto Rico's history or political struggles.The writing is wonderful, vivid, intense, elegant, all at the same time. I still remember a few scenes in quite some detail, and it's all thanks to her use of language. But just as her control of the story seems to falter at the last third of the story, her vivid and tight use of language unravels a bit after the first half of the novel, and the second half doesn't feel as wondrous and elegant."},{"Title":"The House on the Lagoon","review":"Dr. Jeanne Shutes chose this fine book, together with four other excellent works of fiction, to explore around a theme during one of her semesters of Self Awareness through Literature--the longest running book group known (>40 years).

All her choices are in paperback and available at Amazon or locally."},{"Title":"The House on the Lagoon","review":"As indicated in the title, the novel has everything. It has a historical perspective in terms of a women's beginning of her marriage. She weaves us through the love story and the family background's of both her and her husbands origins in Puerto Rico and what brought them there. Right away we are made to see the society that struggles with their legacy of the Spanish colonial occupation all the way up to the American intervention and the effects on the communities of both the poor, the slaves and the elite landowners. We get to experience what it is like to be a slave, the mixed marriages, rapes and abuse. The novel comes full circle as the author brings us back to the beginning when her grandmother warns her she will regret marrying because when you get married you also marry your husband's family background and legacy. Her experiences early on that she regrets outright comes back to haunt her in the end. I couldn't put the book down and have read it several times. A definite worthy book for an historian and for anyone wanting to learn about a people in their search for their identity and voice."},{"Title":"The House on the Lagoon","review":"Lately I have been reading a lot of North American women authors who are of Latin American (or Caribbean) decent. When I picked up The House on the Lagoon, I thought that I was going to hear a similar voice but I was quite wrong. Ferre's voice is distinctly Puerto Rican from the construction of her story telling to the mettle of her characters. The magic in the story is subtle (not as loud as the ghosts that haunt both Marquez and Allende), but still ubiquitous. The story came alive for me in a way that few others have. As I read, I KNEW this place (the House on the Lagoon)--so much that I could see it, feel it and smell it. Really, you've got to go see for yourself...."},{"Title":"The House on the Lagoon","review":"If you've cleaned the bookshelves of Garcia Marquez and love the magical reality that only a few writers can sweep their readers into, pick up this book. It has all the elements for the great read and bad movie of The House of Spirits. My only warning is that the book, in my opinion, has a terribly sad and unjust ending. But it's all part of the magic, even if the magic lets you down. I am looking forward to reading more works/translations from Ms. Ferre"},{"Title":"Untold Valor: Hidden History Of The Air War Europe In World War Ii","review":"If you're a World War Two aviation buff fascinated by the American bomber offensive in Europe, Untold Valor is a must-own book.The author, Rob Morris, a WWII historian and longtime Idaho school teacher, made sure his new nonfiction work would be popular by interviewing Army Air Force veterans across the nation over a five-year period. The recollections of aerial combat come from 60-year-old memories. Yet, amazingly, they are as clear as the Waterford wineglasses surviving B17 crewmembers used to toast their victories after blasting Nazi Germany.Morris relates their adventures in 15 exciting chapters. One of the most unforgettable tales involves Herman Goering's nephew -- ironically, a B-17 aircraft commander who flies missions over Berlin. As one might expect, his copilot keeps a close eye on him in ways you might not imagine.Also fascinating are action-packed stories about B17 ball turret gunners, undoubtedly the bravest airmen in WWII. Hanging beneath their Flying Fortresses at 20,000 feet altitude in sub-zero temperatures, they swivel rapidly back and forth, up and down, shooting at wolf packs of German fighter interceptors screaming in for the kill.Readers of Untold Valor will learn about Jewish airmen who are shot down over Germany and become endangered POWs in a nation dedicated to their extinction. More fortunate aircrews blasted from the sky parachute into neutral Switzerland where they sit out WWII, guzzling beer in bistros not far from downed German fliers in other city bars, also lucky to be alive.Morris tells about two enlisted B17 crewmembers who help change U.S policy after VE Day in regards to the handling of displaced concentration camp survivors in liberated Germany. While doing so, the men incur the fury of their boss, Allied Supreme Commander Dwight D. Eisenhower.Two other B17 crewmen, twin brothers, both gunners, meet different fates on their missions, then are miraculously reunited in London after Germany surrenders. In another poignant story, Morris tells about a captured B-17 pilot who starts a war-protest novel in his Nazi Stalag that will take five decades to finish.Untold Valor is best summarized by Ian Hawkins, world-renowned military writer, author of \\"B-17s Over Berlin: Personal Stories from the 95th Bomb Group.\\" Hawkins writes in the Introduction to Morris' book that his compendium of first-hand accounts by B17 crewmembers is a \\"major contribution to the history of the Second World War.\\""},{"Title":"Handbook of Laboratory and Diagnostic Tests with Nursing Implications (4th Edition)","review":"Every nurse and nursing student should have a copy of this reference. Laboratory and diagnostic tests are presented in separate sections, with material in each listed in alphabetical order. Each entry gives reference values (normal ranges or findings for adults and children); description of the element being tested and consequences of deviations from normal range; purposes of the test; potential clinical problems related to deviations, including drugs that may influence values; procedures for specimen collection and/or preparation for the test; related nursing diagnoses; and detailed nursing implications. In an era of rapidly increasing breadth of laboratory and diagnostic tests and related responsibilities of nurses, the nurse's role has become critical for optimum efficacy of such tests.

This is up from about 400 a couple of years ago. Most are just the same old exercises with pictures of different people. This is not a book about bodybuilding per se. There are bodybuilding exercises and much information -- such as exercise safety, tempo, adjusting the rest between sets depending on the training objective be it hypertrophy, strength, or muscular endurance -- that bodybuilders will find useful. The book's bigger audience includes many others who routinely train with weights. For the athlete or the coach, or for the trainee whose objective is fitness for a particular sport this book will be a valuable resource.Current buzzwords in the field athletic training are \\"core training\\" and \\"functional exercise\\". Aabergs's book is an excellent introduction to core training and functional exercise.As in his earlier book MUSCLE MECHANICS Aaberg lists sources of further information. It's probably nitpicking on my part, but some of the texts listed in the bibliography are a little hard to come by (they are not sold by amazon). A search of the internet was necessary to track down sources for purchasing some of the texts. That said, the bibliography alone is worth the price of book.For the average new trainee this book will probably seem overwhelming. And maybe it is too technical for someone who just wants a routine and a description of how to perform the exercises. As a personal trainer I have clients who are not iterested in why an exercise is chosen or what it does. All they want is someone to lead them through the exercises so they can get the results they want. Such exercisers would not read past the first page of this book. For others, such as myself, the information is critical for program design. However, anyone who wants to should be able to look at the illustrations and read the accompanying exercise descriptions to find many new exercises that will enhance their athletic perormance. Getting the full benefit of this book will require studying the entire book.

It has been all over the net as the GO-TO book for programmers.

At this level of detail, they should be brought up to date."},{"Title":"The Pragmatic Programmer: From Journeyman to Master","review":"I have to admit that I'm happy I got this as a hand me down from a friend. I agree that this is a classic, but also that some of this information has become so etched in to the programming community as a whole, that the experienced programmer/reader will already known the concept. That said, it was amazing to think that they were on top of these concepts in 1999.It's a fairly thin ~250 page book, and since I wasn't too worried about preserving it, I was able to tote it along in my gym bag and read while suffering through cardio workouts. Of course that prevented me from doing most of the exercises but I don't think that mattered. I'm also close to completing Code Complete 2 which is pretty similar in spirit so I found myself comparing and contrasting a lot. Both great books. Code complete 2 is too big IMO but I'm still forcing myself through it because there are so many nuggets. TPP on the other hand is a book you could read in the number of times you go to the toilet over the course of a month.

The subtitle \\"From Journeyman to Master\\" is not a joke, however; notice that beginner is not included in that range. Much of the book will not make sense if you do not have a decent amount of experience with programming.The best thing I can say about the book is this: If you are not already following the advice in this book you are not programming up to your potential. If you read, understand, and implement the practices in this book you will write better software. It's not some load of theoretical crap, either; it's real advice for solving real problems.

Now following it and putting all that knowledge into practice is another thing--but once you do, you'll be ahead of the game. The book is non-language specific although there's tidbits of code that somehow explains the logic behind some concepts.The author explains in the beginning that this book doesn't go from chapter to chapter in successive order but you can rather jump around each one. Although this might be true once you finish the book, I still believe that each chapter builds up one after another. Each chapter provides insights and strategies that will solidify your programming structure and mindset. I found new knowledge that I've wished I knew right when I first started programming and techniques that I can apply to how I currently do things.I believe that beginners and more advanced programmers alike can equally benefit from this book, as well as project managers. The author presents mistakes and programming pitfalls that they've encountered throughout their career--and shows how to tactically avoid them. They also provide solutions to common mistakes as well as tips in order to keep up with new programming trends.Overall, this is a great refreshing reading as it introduces new and not-so-new concepts that programmers of any level can benefit from. It is also a good book to have in the book shelf in case you need to get a good refresher on the concepts later on. It's one of those books that I'd wish I've read before but at the same time, it's better late than never."},{"Title":"The Pragmatic Programmer: From Journeyman to Master","review":"I've been doing software for 35 years and have always considered myself a student of the \\"art\\". Most of the recommended practices in this book are things I've either learned from others or arrived at myself. However, if I had read this book 35 years ago, it wouldn't have taken so long.Simply put, this is the best book on software I've ever read. Not only does it cover the various tricks of the trade, it does so in a narrative style that is easy and fun to read.All software developers should read it, but I'm also going to strongly recommend it for non-technical software managers as many sections make compelling arguments for the sorts of investments whose value might not have immediately seen value to non-technical types.Again, best book I've ever read on the art of software."},{"Title":"The Pragmatic Programmer: From Journeyman to Master","review":"One of the classical software engineering books I never read until recently. Even though it was originally published in 1999,most of the content is still true today. It explains most of the good design principles that are still true like DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself), decoupling, don't live with broken windows, Law of Demeter and many others. Also professional tips for your career if you truly want to be come a craftsman like learn at least one new language every year to get fresh ideas which I agree with.It also comes with a small quick reference guide of good principles to keep handy without having to learn the book. I highly recommend the book for anyone that truly is interested in becoming better at his/her craft much like tips 1 in the quick reference: Care about your craft - why spend your life developing software unless you care about doing it well?"},{"Title":"The Pragmatic Programmer: From Journeyman to Master","review":"This book is similar to \\"Coder to Developer\\": Gives advice on a lot of topics to improve your skills as a developer (to stop being a simple developer and get into the path for an analyst or software architect). One difference though is that this book doesn't even talks about .NET, using C++ or Java examples instead (if you work with C# that shouldn't be any problem!).Overall, the book has an inspiring, motivating speech. The authors have fought a lot of battles when developing software and most of the tips are really useful and will make you avoid common (and not so common) mistakes.In each chapter, small tips and advices are given to the reader, even with small tales and metaphors to make you understand easily some concepts or problems.In some advices they are a bit too extreme, like \\"learn one new programming language each year\\" (a bit hardcore), or ttrying to have 100% of your code uncoupled (performance, or customer requirements to give two examples may force you to tightly couple some components). But this are the minor ones.It gives a lot of intersting principles, like the DRY (don't repeat yourself), WYSIAYG (what you see is all you get), \\"design to test\\" or the very interesting \\"testing saboteur\\" (place someone in the project to brach the source and place bugs to see if the test batteries catch them or not).I like the \\"tracer code\\" concept. Instead of prototyping (throwing away code and redoing it), making a framework and adding code in tiny bits, with constant feedback to change what is wrongly implemented. Looks like saving future effort, and we sometimes do it unconsciously. It just requires having a clear view of the overall system.The book has chapters about prototyping, estimations, \\"basic tools\\", code coupling, code structure, the Law of Demeter, multithreading, design patterns (including the now so famous Model-View-Controller), testing, using use cases in requirements definitions (I actually did this recently at work!), web-based documentation ...Touches multiple ways of doing \\"defensive programming\\": Design by contract, knowing when the impossible has happened, assertive programming,...Another nice point is that along the whole book the message for the reader is \\"you're not just a developer, think!\\"Some topics lack a bit more of depth, but the starting point given is more than enough for becoming a \\"pragmatic programmer\\"."},{"Title":"The Pragmatic Programmer: From Journeyman to Master","review":"This book is a must read for all developers. It is filled with so many good points. Most of them you probably already know, but don't know you know until they point them out. Others you may already know but just never thought about them a certain way. This book just makes sense."},{"Title":"The Pragmatic Programmer: From Journeyman to Master","review":"This book is the perfect way for a novice programmer to become familiar with the broad concepts involved in many good programming techniques. It introduces concepts such as programming by contract, testing assumptions, testing in general, and model-view-controller architecture. I see this as an introductory text, or something to use to refresh yourself on good techniques. It really doesn't delve into detail on any given topic, so if you want to know more, you'll have to look elsewhere.Another good thing about this book: It's concise. The authors don't repeat themselves in their text, unlike many programming book authors. Maybe they took that from their programming practices. Don't Repeat Yourself is tip #11 in the book.Finally, the book offers some advice on being good at any job long-term: Keep reading, keep communicating with your users and stay involved with other like-minded professionals.The one shortcoming I thought the book had was a somewhat short list of references."},{"Title":"The Pragmatic Programmer: From Journeyman to Master","review":"As an experienced programmer, project manager and an MCSE, I valued all of the tips and advice in this book. It is written for the seasoned professional to the novice, it is a valuable book for all computer professionals."},{"Title":"The Pragmatic Programmer: From Journeyman to Master","review":"The preface says \\"this booked is aimed at people who want to become more effective and more productive programmers\\", but after reading this book, I think the book should be required reading for all junior programmers. In around 300 page, this book isn't heavy reading like code complete 2, but it gives a brief overview of almost every philosophy which every programmer should embrace, ideas such as DRY, lower coupling, MVC paradigm. I strongly recommend this book to every junior programmer (if you're an experienced one you should already know everything this book talks about)"},{"Title":"The Pragmatic Programmer: From Journeyman to Master","review":"There is nothing worse than sloppy code! You can dress sloppy, you can speak sloppy, you can live in a pig's sty, but please don't develop sloppy code for other's to take care of.Read this book and follow the suggestions, and you will place yourself on the elite side of the bell curve with respect to your programming skills."},{"Title":"The Pragmatic Programmer: From Journeyman to Master","review":"Some reviewers love the book; some hate it, but I think it wonderfully accomplishes its goal of getting us to really *think* about programming. I'm a former professional woodworker and I got a little tired of the woodworking analogies (it really is best to stick with what you know), but this is mere quibbling. I highly recommend the book."},{"Title":"The Pragmatic Programmer: From Journeyman to Master","review":"It's undeniable that this book is full of good values, principles, and techniques that programmers should strive to follow in order to delivery good software. In spite of it, almost none of the topics covered by the authors go deep into the subject, what opens space, in my opinion, for future improvements."},{"Title":"The Pragmatic Programmer: From Journeyman to Master","review":"If you want to develop a sound practice when developing, this book may be worth your while."},{"Title":"The Pragmatic Programmer: From Journeyman to Master","review":"This book will make you a better developer; there's no question about it. It's divided into well defined units which could be read independently. This is great because you can pick up the book and read a random section and absord something each and every time.The topics in this book are all over the map. From Testing to Automation to Source Control to Communication, Dave Thomas and Andrew Hunt cover the essentials of how to be good developer (not just programmer).I strongly recommend this book for Computer Science majors who have not yet joined the professional software industry. Many of us are taught how to do some code and other theoretical things that we might never end up using, but when it comes down to it, we do not get taught anything about software development; these are things we have to learn on our own accord. For example, source control is essential in any project, but I have worked with a CS senior who just refused to use CVS because it was 'too complicated'.This book is a great starting point for such aspects of development. Get it. And read it more than once."},{"Title":"The Pragmatic Programmer: From Journeyman to Master","review":"I can only repeat what most other reviewers said: it's an extraordinary book, a real treasure. On a scale of 1 to 5 stars, this book would deserve 6 -- but I must draw one star for the bulky design ;)Information density is high and actually the book could be a small pocket book ideal to take along everywhere. But unfortunately the publishers preferred to use big typefaces, thick paper and include a lot of empty space. They probably blowed up the book to make it heavier and look &quot;more important&quot; in order to sell it for a higher price. For me, they didn't hit the target because I didn't buy the thing. I swear I would spend $40 rightaway if it would be as handy as it could but for now I stick to the electronic version."},{"Title":"The Pragmatic Programmer: From Journeyman to Master","review":"The reviews I read about this book are pretty accurate, except this book is too wordy. It could be 1/2 the size it is if the authors would have gotten to the point faster. A lot of explanations go on and on and I am left wondering when am I going to get to read what the point is?! Get to it!The two authors are certainly qualified to author this book, judging by what their backgrounds are. For the most part, the chapters are interesting, informative, and thought provoking. Most of the ideas are not what the average, or above average programmer would think of.Some of the ideas though are not worth the paper to print them on, and many of them are not explained well enough. Given the amount of words for explanations, this should not have been. Therefore, I can only give this book three stars. Overall I feel that the book is too drawn out and not to the point enough."},{"Title":"The Pragmatic Programmer: From Journeyman to Master","review":"Pros: well written, 100% valuable pragmatics, great analogies (comparing programming with gardening), useful, pleasant exercises, with well explained solutions.Cons: Any serious developer going through a couple of serious projects already knows most of this. In that sense I see this book more as a tutorial for the \\"rookie\\" (pragmatic) programmer. And when it comes to design rules and pragmatics I found much more solid, universal and valuable: \\"The Art of Unix Programming\\" by Eric Steven Raymond, amazingly enough available on-line at: [...]"},{"Title":"The Pragmatic Programmer: From Journeyman to Master","review":"I like this book for the most part. I find it falls short in describing a good (appropriate) use of Architecture Specifications, Design Plans, etc. This is especially true for those who are self-taught or went to school years ago and may not have been exposed to this kind of development process. While the author's approach may be great for some, experience has shown me that whether I'm working in a large team environment or by myself, having good requirements, architecture specifications, and development plans do a lot to kill programming bugs before they occur, and more importantly, serve as a compass for the code-writing portion of the development process, no matter what the size of the coding team. I think readers will probably benefit more by reading \\"Code Complete\\" 2nd Ed. (2004) by Steve McConnell."},{"Title":"The Pragmatic Programmer: From Journeyman to Master","review":"As most other reviewers, I was drawn in by the glowing commentaries here on Amazon.As background, I've been programming professionally for nine years now, on a variety of projects, but generally high-performance embedded stuff. I'm interested in improving my software development & management skills, and have read a number of other, better books (listed later) about these topics.My first criticism is that the collection of 50-odd tips are simply too shallowly presented to be very interesting. Generally, if you agree, you say, \\"yeah, duh,\\" and if you don't, there's no discussion of the point, and no attempt to address known difficulties with \\"good\\" practices. There also seemed to be no attempt to balance some of the points. For example, the authors repeatedly talk about writing your code so it's flexible. In general, a good idea. On the other hand, they really seem to think you should be writing everything, regardless of what sort of application it is, to run on different machines, under different operating systems, with and without concurrency, etc. This, to me, just seems foolish, extra work, extra code, extra bugs. The estimates I've seen (in other, better, books) say that just writing re-usable code takes three times more work than \\"normal\\" code, ignoring multi-platform complexities.The old school comment (and I consider myself fairly old school) is there because they very obviously come from a Unix/command line environment. I will admit, they motivated me to improve my scripting skills, something I've been planning on doing for a while. But then they have inane advice, like \\"use only one editor *for everything*\\". This is perhaps nice, if you can, but on larger projects or organizations, this probably isn't possible. I use the IDE required by the project, a different editor for documentation (also required) and a third one for doing hex & advanced search and replace. Perhaps with emacs and 47 scripts this wouldn't be necessary, but I'm not convinced it would be efficient either.All in all, the advice is generally good, but I think there are better books out there (e.g. Code Complete, Writing Solid Code, Rapid Development, The Mythical Man-Month, C++ Coding Standards). As a light book to get you thinking about your craft, it's not bad, but that's the best I can say about it."},{"Title":"The Pragmatic Programmer: From Journeyman to Master","review":"Working for a software development company, programming is life or death. I am recommending The Pragmatic Programmer to our junior developers so that they will have a great tool to be successful."},{"Title":"The Pragmatic Programmer: From Journeyman to Master","review":"The Pragmatic Programmer is a mixed bag. It attempts to cover a large number of broad topics, ranging from object-oriented design to algorithm speed to testing strategies. As a result, each topic gets a fairly superficial treatment, only skimming the surface before moving onto something else.My other reservation about the book is that the authors are &quot;Unix geeks&quot;, and view the world accordingly. They touch on Windows mostly to urge readers to put a Unix shell on top of it; other platforms like Mac OS are mentioned not at all. Personally, I am tired of &quot;real programmers use the command line&quot;, or &quot;Emacs is God&quot; posturing (despite the authors' earnest but flawed attempts to justify these), and felt it detracted from an otherwise useful book. Worse, the authors fail to discuss any tools related to building complex interactive applications, a significant omission from the stated goals and scope of the book.Those complaints aside, the book does contain useful information and ideas, especially for new programmers who often don't have a strong grasp on the bigger picture of software development. The authors offer good insights on topics like design by contract, documentation, and refactoring, which new programmers often fail to appreciate."},{"Title":"The Pragmatic Programmer: From Journeyman to Master","review":"I am a programmer that always struggles with the \\"best way\\" to layout a program. This book was very informative and immediately seeped into my daily programming practices.I will re-read this book in a couple of months just to pick up on the things I missed the first time through."},{"Title":"The Pragmatic Programmer: From Journeyman to Master","review":"I'm impressed by how well this book has aged in the years since I first read it. It is still a must-have, must-read, must-follow book for anyone serious about working in the software field."},{"Title":"The Pragmatic Programmer: From Journeyman to Master","review":"For me, 'The Pragmatic Programmer' joins 'Code Complete', 'Design Patterns' or 'Refactoring' among the books every programmer should read (at least twice). It is packed with wisdom and introduces concepts referred throughout our body of knowledge. 'Tracer bullet', 'Tell, don't ask' or 'Learn a new programming language every year' are just some of the concepts The Pragmatic Programmer implanted in my mind.Definitely a 5-star."},{"Title":"The Pragmatic Programmer: From Journeyman to Master","review":"Great great book for anyone trying to become a better programmer.It really does a great job at transmitting the general principles that can help making better software, thanks to a very easy-to-read style, lots of applied examples and exercises, and awesome silly-sounding but relevant easy-to-remember comparisons.Even 10 years after publishing, all the advices the authors offer still make lots of sense.One of the best books I've read so far ! I enjoyed it much more thanThe Mythical Man-Month: Essays on Software Engineering, Anniversary Edition (2nd Edition), which I found somehow outdated and too general."},{"Title":"The Pragmatic Programmer: From Journeyman to Master","review":"For the old-dog, seasoned software developer, this book will probably provide nothing new. Seeing as how I am young and still in my early twenties, this book is an absolute gem. It provides personal insight into the hard-learned experiences of true professionals. Learning from their experiences (and mistakes), I can grow as a person and a developer, just by reading about it. When situations such as the ones in this book became realities, I knew just how to handle them and just what to do.For the new sde, this book should be at the top of their list."},{"Title":"The Pragmatic Programmer: From Journeyman to Master","review":"This book should be required reading for all developers. It is a mix of great ideas and common sense. It is a rare day when I find myself successfully rationalizing action that runs contrary to these pages."},{"Title":"The Pragmatic Programmer: From Journeyman to Master","review":"Andrew Hunt and Dave Thomas present what are humbly referred to as \`tips' towards better software development. In principal, these two guys present a well put together argument that software development is a craft meant to be honed by craftsman (thus the secondary title, \`from journeyman to master'). Truly, these two understand what it is to be an egoless developer destined for greatness and have captured the essence in a concise set of rules to follow.Most notably is the DRY axiom (don't repeat yourself) which, although simple, encompasses so much that is bad in software projects on many levels that it leads the book off as a key tip (and is referenced further in as well). Others including understanding orthogonal code and ubiquitous automation are equally as pivotal. These authors clearly understand their terrain and think the way you want your developers to think.On rare occasion, one of the tips provided seemed oddly out of the realm of what I would consider \\"key, generally applicable advice.\\" An example was the blackboard or clue bag concept seemed a little off base for a book on programming and didn't provide me with enough concrete strings back to the rest of the tips to make me understand why it was included.The book includes helpful cross-references allow similar subjects to be quickly found when there is topic crossover (happens a lot). The pull out in the back with the tips quickly provided for reference re-enforce how simple it really is and reminds one that we can all improve. Also, there are lots of references to other good material as a launching point for anyone choosing to make software development their profession.Overall, a must-have book for the professional developer regardless of domain or technology. Ranks up there with \`The Mythical Man Month' and \`Code Complete' as a classic."},{"Title":"The Pragmatic Programmer: From Journeyman to Master","review":"Although the book is slightly dated (2000), all of the concepts and tips within are relevant to all developers today. The wealth of reference material, the \\"soft-skills\\" topics and the pump-priming concepts bear contemplation and review. A set of programmer's mantras if ever there was one.If you are truly interested in becoming the best programmer you can be, read this book. It will serve you well."},{"Title":"The Pragmatic Programmer: From Journeyman to Master","review":"This is one of those books that you read and then come back to from time to time and reread. For those that have developed for some time, it's a great book to read for an occasional tune up. For those just beginning, it's a great way to get off on the right foot. It's by far one of my favorite books on general development practices."},{"Title":"The Pragmatic Programmer: From Journeyman to Master","review":"Provides a lot of what experienced developers would consider &quot;commonsense&quot; advice and philosophies. Also gives an excellent language for talking about this sort of stuff with others.Short and to the point. It's sometimes hard to get &quot;I'm too busy&quot; developers to read, especially the big, dense books lots of folks like to produce around the programmer management area. It's easy to find sections in this book that are useful, can be thrown at someone and be consumed by them in a half-hour (not fully digested, though!). Absolutely wonderful.What can I say? It's hard to find fault with this book. The only thing I can say that might have helped are a few stories about the risks of not following the practices, though it's questionable how much that would help things. If programmers were horses, you could lead them to water, but not until they'd suffered severe dehydration and a hospital trip or two would they convince themselves that advice you'd given around appropriate water consumption was actually useful..."},{"Title":"The Pragmatic Programmer: From Journeyman to Master","review":"Excellent book. Although having 8 years of software development experience under my belt, I still found this book enlightening. I knew almost half of what the authors said - but they said it so well that it seemed more convincing coming from them. While reading this book I knew the real meaning of \\"you took the words right out of my mouth\\".The book did have some new things that I had not known or thought about before. This is a must have book for Software Professionals. It is full of wisdom. The authors' writing style is immaculate !This book was so amazing that I could not sleep until I had finished it, and even after finishing it I still could not sleep just out of the adrenaline rush that it gave me."},{"Title":"The Pragmatic Programmer: From Journeyman to Master","review":"The Pragmatic Programmer is the book all programmers should have to read before they are unleashed onto your source base.The book is nice and terse, covering the ground it needs to cover in little over 250 pages. Clearly the authors are applying the lessons they learnt from Unix, Perl, c++ and a variety of other sources. Rather than wasting words trying to beat home their lessons, the authors have trusted that the reader has some degree of intelligence. They present each nibble of wisdom in a few paragraphs of pithy text which helps to support the 70 tips they provide throughout the book.The book covers a fair degree of ground in it's 258 pages. Testing, documentation, automation and even requirements specifications all get a look in. Most of the book however, is devoted to that part of the art which is harder to define and learn. It is usually learnt from painful experience, or passed on by a senior programmer if you are lucky enough to have one around. It is this knowledge that makes the book worth the read.It's value is not so much that you will find anything revolutionary inside the book, you wont, but that the book provides a terse and approachable font of wisdom for programmers of all skill levels. It is filled with the sort of sensible advice that stops you getting third degree burns while cooking, or cutting your hand off while doing woodshop. Managing to convey that knowledge without sounding preachy or ivory tower in nature adds to it's charm.This book will be required reading for all the programmers on my team at work. It will help them to understand the bigger picture of development, rather than focusing on the minutae of cutting code."},{"Title":"The Pragmatic Programmer: From Journeyman to Master","review":"If you're already a pragmatic programmer, this book positively reinforces that which you probably already know (either innately or through experience ... but usually the latter), while drawing out many tidbits of knowledge that lie dormant in our subconscious.If you're new to programming and lack the mentorship of a pragmatic programmer, read this book! Be open to the ideas and absorb the wisdom.I read this book cover-to-cover. I found the content well-organized, and I appreciated the inclusion of exercises (with answers in the back) which tested my knowledge and assumptions. The checklist and quick reference guide is also a nice touch. Overall: an easy read.As a final note, readers will find errata on the authors' website with the exception of the following: Detracting from an otherwise excellent book are the glaring bugs in the answers to Exercises 7 and 8; specifically, the bison/yacc grammar and Perl code don't handle a range of valid input (e.g., &quot;12:30am&quot;)."},{"Title":"The Pragmatic Programmer: From Journeyman to Master","review":"This is a decent but not spectacular book, which is written as a series of 46 five to ten page articles on various programming topics, such as &quot;Orthogonality&quot;, &quot;Design by Contract&quot; and &quot;The Requirements Pit&quot;. The segments are quite heavily cross-referenced (which I didn't find very useful).The authors dole out a lot of solid advice, which is the book's strength. I found myself disagreeing with very little. There are memorable tips and some good stories. The writing style is also very accessible and conducive to diving in at any page.The book seems a bit lightweight. The exercises are a little simple and I don't think you'll find yourself going back to this book a lot. Also, the typeface is annoyingly large.I'd recommend this to someone who has done some programming and understands the syntax and fundamentals but hasn't gotten into programming larger pieces of software. I think that if you have programmed anything significant you won't find much new in here."},{"Title":"The Pragmatic Programmer: From Journeyman to Master","review":"This book won't teach you how to program. This book won't teach you any theory. This book won't teach you any history.What this book will teach you is everything you knew was true but were afraid to hear from someone else: That you are not as good a programmer as you thought you were. Throughout this book you will encounter examples of mistakes all of us make, some that can be ignored, some that will completely turn your code upside down in no time.The good part is that it gives you hints and recommendations on how to avoid making those mistakes, and how to improve your code and make coding a little more pleasant for you and others who might work on it.Even if you already know most of what you see here, it is always good to refresh those thoughts so that you don't fall unexpectedly into a bad habit."},{"Title":"The Pragmatic Programmer: From Journeyman to Master","review":"The title &quot;The Pragmatic Programmer&quot; is very apt. Not a book written by a professor for teaching, this book is written by actual programmers to be read and used by actual programmers. There is a wealth of sound practical advice, and a gift for the memorable phrase or anecdote. I found this book to be a useful refresher, and well worth reading. The writing style is excellent - clear, entertaining, appropriate level of humour.However I've given it only three stars. My favourite book on programming, &quot;Code Complete&quot; by Steve McConnell, is equally readable, but covers similar ground in far more depth. I make Code Complete required reading for my programming teams. The Pragmatic Programmer doesn't make it past &quot;Suggestions for further reading&quot;."},{"Title":"The Pragmatic Programmer: From Journeyman to Master","review":"I bought this on a friend's recommendation, but expected yet another book rehashing the same standard rules: write comments, don't duplicate code, have plans for your projects, eat your vegetables.Hunt and Thomas vastly exceeded my expectations. This book is never dry, often humorous, and always educational. They don't always say what you expect them to say (e.g., about commenting code), and I didn't always agree with them, but every sentence is full of thoughtful analysis.One of the best features is their incredibly practical advice -- while yes, this book does teach philosophy and encourages thought, it also provides many immediately-implementable suggestions.If you aren't a programmer with 10 years experience, buy it anyway -- it is not just for experienced programmers. While you will absorb less of the book, there is still enough to learn, and it's a great book to keep and re-read.The book includes a pull-out card of the pithy sayings the authors use to sum up each section. Perhaps my mind just doesn't work the way theirs does, but I didn't find their summations to be helpful all the time -- I found myself frequently having to flip back to the section to remember what a particular phrase meant. But it's still useful."},{"Title":"The Pragmatic Programmer: From Journeyman to Master","review":"Most software engineers don't have the opportunity to spend time with their colleagues and just talk about the craft of software development. While you can't have a conversation with a book, Andrew Hunt and David Thomas will talk if you will listen--and listen you should.The Pragmatic Programmer is a collection of ideas, observations, and recommendations for software developers. Throughout the book, they highlight these notions in a set of numbered tips, about 70 of them, which are collected on a single tear-out card situated in the back of the book. Just reading the tips, without reading the text of the book, might make these gems seem trite, empty, and obvious. But, they're not!Many of the tips actually build upon previous ones, like tip 4: &quot;Don't live with broken windows&quot;, which urges programmers to fix problems and clean up messes, and tip 20: &quot;Keep knowledge in plain text.&quot; With some books like this you can skip around--but this one is better read from beginning to end.There is plenty of ideas to consider, agree with, and, perhaps, disagree with, too. You can also feel a little passion. &quot;Conventional wisdom says that once a project is in the coding phase, the work is mostly mechanical, transcribing the design into executable statements. We think that this attitude is the single biggest reason that many programs are ugly, inefficient, poorly structured, unmaintainable, and just plain wrong.&quot; Hooray for authors who take a stand and then back it up with well reasoned arguments!Reading this book isn't a substitute for having that conversation with a colleague about the craft. But, The Pragmatic Programmer is worth listening to in the mean time. It is a good, solid, fun read."},{"Title":"The Pragmatic Programmer: From Journeyman to Master","review":"This is, simply, a wonderful book. It is a book that celebrates the real depth of great programming -- something that is too often forgotten or ignored. This is not an idiot's guide to anything -- it is a remarkably entertaining set of dozens of tips to becoming better at what you do, especially if that happens to be programming.The tips are deceptively simple at times, but only a truly naive or inexperienced reader would miss the rich depth that their combination presents. In fact, that is the real beauty of this book -- it does not present some short-lived miracle-cure approach -- instead, it weaves together small bits of wisdom and practical advice into a powerful work-style.They have some controversial views -- these authors are witty and opinionated -- but agreeing or disagreeing with each individual idea is not the point -- &quot;seeing the forest&quot; is.There are numerous specific code examples, but the book is a fun and easy read -- strangely, I also think it would be a wonderful book for someone who is NOT a programmer, but who works with them, perhaps a business manager having a major system built. Even skipping all the really technical parts, it would be a wonderful set of benchmarks to assess how good your programmers really are -- much more powerful than &quot;he has 3 years of C++, 2 years of Linux&quot;...I am hoping this writing team will follow this book with some specific guides as well, but this one is destined to be a classic. These guys really know what they are talking about, and, as a wonderful bonus, they are terrific writers, as well!The book has gotten great reviews on slashdot, as well as a couple of programming magazines, including Dr Dobbs and Software Development -- they were well deserved. Buy IT!"},{"Title":"The Pragmatic Programmer: From Journeyman to Master","review":"Well, after reading most of the glowing reviews here, I was pretty interested in the book. I thumbed through it at a bookstore, and ended up buying on Amazon (kudos for the lower price). I read the book, and became confused. I made sure the reviews matched the book title. I read the book again. Quite frankly, I don't see what makes this book so great- not that it is bad and/or a waste of money (though it is on the pricey side given how little you get- big font and big line spacing, like a 7th-grade term paper)- it just isn't the greatest thing since sliced bread.The authors have compiled a list of several tips to keep in mind while programming. Ultimately, I think this is their answer to Fred Brooks' searching for a silver bullet inThe Mythical Man-Month, based on their years of experience in the field. It ends up being a lot of \\"eating your own dog food,\\" in my humble opinion. Just because they met with success using a certain method/tool (usually on financial software) doesn't mean you will. Not all programming practices transcend all boundaries and are generally applicable to all programming problems. Some people are faster and more capable (and more comfortable) with an IDE than with a plain text editor; get off your high horse. I don't agree with most of the tips. Some, however, are absolutely necessary, such as version control. Every tip is tied to an analogy or some story outside of programming- which may be nice to some, but I see it as an insult to a reader's intelligence. Every single tip? Really? Not necessary....really.The majority of the book is language-independent, which is nice. There are a few humorous moments spread throughout the book, and it is overall a very easy read- not at all like reading a technical work, despite the content. I think the book is definitely worth a read...the tips are all rooted in common sense (or pragmatism, if you will). The advice is sage-like, which to me means listen up and listen closely, but take it with a grain of salt and adapt the morals of the story to your own coding practices."},{"Title":"The Pragmatic Programmer: From Journeyman to Master","review":"...and what's the difference? I've often felt that the difference was attitude. Programmers (or &quot;professionals&quot; if you prefer) were continually thinking about what they did, why they did it and how they could do it better. And I don't just mean searching for a new language (&quot;maybe I should learn Java this week?&quot;).The rest of us are just tooling around doing the best we can and wondering why it sometimes doesn't work.&quot;The Pragmatic Programmer&quot; is clearly written by and for professional programmers. Reading it with attention will force you to think deeply about the way you develop software. If your first response is &quot;but this isn't pragmatic&quot; or &quot;I don't have time to do these things&quot; then I encourage you to think again. Perhaps the barrier is change itself. Sure, applying the practices in this book may slow you down in the short term (you always go slower when you're learning a new skill) but the benefits to establishing these practices as habits are enormous.We are working through this book as part of a weekly study group at our office. This seems to be a great way to investigate things you're uncomfortable. And I don't agree with every practice in this book, but please think about them as deeply as you can before you reject them!Whenever I interview someone I ask them what book has most influenced the way they develop software. If they answer &quot;The Pragmatic Programmer&quot; (or &quot;Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance&quot;) then they have the job!"},{"Title":"The Pragmatic Programmer: From Journeyman to Master","review":"As a programmer, I like to think of myself as pragmatic. Programming is the most precise discipline there is and justifies the cynical joke, \\"How many character changes does it take to turn \`success' into \`failure'? Answer: Only one if you are a programmer.\\" However, pragmatic is a very subjective word, so the obvious question that any reader interested in this book would ask is, \\"So what criteria do the authors use to define a pragmatic programmer?\\"In listing the criteria and explaining their reasoning, the authors show their depth of understanding of what is both right and wrong with the current state of the development art. Every keystroke or mouse click that we perform has a consequence, not only today, but in the future. When performing them, we should always be looking ahead to the future, whether that be thinking about how the code will be maintained, how the users will respond to what they find or how your current skill set is expanding or contracting. This eye on the future is the primary theme of the book.The tips are kept simple, which is effective and is consistent with the secondary theme of the book. Complex systems are what we build, but in totality we cannot comprehend them. Only by breaking a project down into manageable parts can we hope to interact with it in an effective manner. Furthermore, the inertia against changes is much less severe when they are small and simple. Whether it be Ockham's razor, Einstein's statement about the simplicity of theories or simply reciting the KISS (Keep It Simple Stupid) mantra, reducing complexity is effective.Some very good analogies are used to explain the principles, with my favorite being the broken window tale. The basic story is simple, abandoned buildings or automobiles on the street remain untouched until a window is broken. Left unrepaired, this sends a message that the object is fair game so within a very short time, vandals destroy the rest. The same thing happens in software development. Once a subpar feature is passed as acceptable, the signal to everyone is clear, and the quality of the remaining work suffers.Granted, most of us in development are severely time challenged and have little to spare to either read or perform code clean ups. However, this is a book where the interest paid over the short and long term will dominate the initial investment. Applying even a few of these principles will help reduce the load in the future as you begin spending less time in all phases of the software cycle. It takes approximately a one percent increase in efficiency to save a half hour a week. This is a book that should be read by all programmers, especially those who wish to control their own destiny."},{"Title":"The Pragmatic Programmer: From Journeyman to Master","review":"Someone said to me today:&quot;Humans have been humans for a long time now, but we don't seem to be getting any better at it.&quot;The statement struck me because it is clear, concise, and absolutely true; So is this book. What's more, this book tells you how to be a better human.The Pragmatic Programmer explains, step by step, how to master the craft of programming. It describes tricks, techniques, but more importantly *attitudes* that most people learn the hard way over several decades- if at all. What's more, it lays it all out in a neat, approachable, and immediately applicable way that is independent of specific technologies and languages.I've been looking for many years for a book like this to give students. Now I've got it. It'll go on my shelf next to &quot;The Mythical Man Month&quot; and will probably be popular and applicable for just as long."},{"Title":"The Pragmatic Programmer: From Journeyman to Master","review":"Take it from a programmer of ten years: The book was fabulous! It provides a philosophy about programming - something they don't teach you in college! The concepts extend to many different facets of information technology. All of the developers in my group are getting copies!"},{"Title":"The Pragmatic Programmer: From Journeyman to Master","review":"A friend of mine recommended this book to me a year ago and I finally got around to reading it. Not only do I wish I had taken him up on his recommendation immediately, I wish that I had read it years earlier. The book's subtitle &quot;from journeyman to master&quot; really sums it up nicely.The book contains practical advice from experienced programmers that will help you become a more effective software developer. Unlike many books which dogmatically preach a specific methodology, this book focuses on (not-so-)common sense practices that are simple yet effective, as well as highlighting potential pitfalls to be avoided. Many of them can be applied to your own development process without requiring radical changes, while others will require team- or project-wide changes. Fortunately the nature of the recommended practices is such that you don't have to adopt all of them to be effective. You can pick and choose which ones are most appropriate and gradually incorporate them into your development process.The range of topics covered is fairly broad, but the important themes are writing easy-to-maintain, reusable code, identifying and adjusting requirements quickly and effectively, managing large projects, and avoiding bad habits and developing good attitudes. Although I don't absolutely agree with everything the authors present, the justification they provide is thought stimulating and will probably change how you do things even if you don't consciously decide to adopt any of their practices.I found the exercises (and their accompanying solutions) scattered throughout the book to be extremely useful in internalizing the principles being taught, as well as gauging how well I approach problem-solving. I'd highly recommend working through them as you read the book.Finally, it's worth mentioning how enjoyable this book is to read. The authors' sense of humor and sprinkling of anecdotes make this an easy read without in any way detracting from the content.If you're a brand new programmer, you probably won't appreciate many of the ideas presented in this book, but come back after you have a year or two of experience. Successful, experienced programmers will find that this book confirms many of the things you're already doing, while providing a lot of useful ideas to become even better. Even if you're not a programmer, but manage or otherwise work with programming teams, you'll find a lot of helpful information here. If there were one book I could require all of my coworkers to read, this would be it."},{"Title":"The Pragmatic Programmer: From Journeyman to Master","review":"First, I should tell you that I did review this book... I got to read it and write a document about my opinion of the book, and it is excellent. There are many books on the market that push one technology or philosophy... this book has a collection of honed practices. It contains sections on your programming tools, code design, project management (among other topics). In short, it is a book that talks about how to become better at what you do for a living. This advice is coupled with excellent examples and stories that make for interesting and memorable reading.I can't emphasize this point enough. This book isn't a collection of stories that support the author's methodology or design technique. It isn't a book designed to sell his software tools. It is a book that will teach you to work more effectively. It talks about practical tips for prototyping projects (different ways to prototype, which is appropriate when, how to justify the time and expense to your manager), how to deal with and communicate effectively with customers, co-workers and managers.... if it sounds like The Pragmatic Programmer covers a lot of topics, that's because it does.If you work with software or manage people who do, you owe it to yourself to read this book! I've been writing code (and reading these types of books) for nearly 10 years, and this is the best one I've ever read."},{"Title":"The Pragmatic Programmer: From Journeyman to Master","review":"I often ask and keep asking the professionals how to become a good programmer. The only answer from them is just keeping writing and gathering experience from projects. Whereas I found myself grab very little in this process. With this, I got my really answer to be a real programmer, it doesn't mean I can fly or get to be professional immediately, whereas, now that I know what is going on to my code and I know what a programmer should do. Written in a systemetic approach, programmer can easily grab what they want. A MUST pick for real programmer!"},{"Title":"The Pragmatic Programmer: From Journeyman to Master","review":"Good overview of many things that need doing whilst developing software. I don't agree with everything the authors said, but on the whole it was good information.The authors come across as Unix-geeks who believe &quot;command-line is King!&quot;. Yes, command-line utilities do have their place, but please, they're not the salvation of software development! Things are discussed from a high-level, so if you want to apply much of what has been discussed then you will need to look for more in-depth information elsewhere, but for junior programmers it is useful to point out what they should be looking for in the first place. For more experienced programmers, treat it as more of a refresher-course (assuming you did learn how to do things properly once upon a time).An entertaining overview of software development - well, more entertaining than some software engineering textbooks I've read!"},{"Title":"The Pragmatic Programmer: From Journeyman to Master","review":"This is one of those classics that belong beside Fred Brooks \\"The Mythical Man-Month\\" in your library. (And your mind)The examples are in Java and C++ (ick--I am a .Net programmer), but the generic nature of the material in the book has made it useful to me in the .Net camp. In some ways, reading it from a .Net background has helped since it forces thought. This book is packed with great tips--most of which apply in any language.I highly recommend this to any software developer regardless of technology leanings. I recently recommended it in our area .Net User's Group meeting--which for a book that contains Java is HIGHLY unusual!"},{"Title":"The Pragmatic Programmer: From Journeyman to Master","review":"Incredible.

All major aspect which every programmer should follow are in the book. It's emphasized that programmers main tool is knowledge - diverse knowledge. Don't stick to one technology, neither one IDE or one operating system - be diverse. History shows us what happened to Cobol, Delphi and C++ - at one moment in time they were overwhelming, today they are quite rare choice for programming high level apps.

The tone is pragmatic and does away with scholar or theoretical software engineering concepts like the waterfall approach in favor of what just works and gets things done well. This book talks about what is usually not talked about at school and presents a &quot;way of programming&quot; that has more to do with craftmanship than science.

We often learn most from so-called tricks of the trade over time and independent experimentation. Most of which really isn't taught at universities or in certification classes. The main reasons to buy this book is that it displays your own accumulated wisdom more cleanly than you ever bothered to state it, and it introduces you to methods of work that you may not yet have considered. The book opens your mind towards a new dimension of problem solving more than I have ever seen in recent years.FinancialNeeds.com."},{"Title":"The Pragmatic Programmer: From Journeyman to Master","review":"I like how concise this book is.

You will need deeper resources to implement the recomendations in this book but it is full of very good practices. I recomend it for any programmer."},{"Title":"The Pragmatic Programmer: From Journeyman to Master","review":"This book has a lot of good advice. Here's some of my favorites:- DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself). So much unmaintainable code is written when you copy-n-paste stuff around. The pragmatic programmer goes out of his way to minimize the amount of code, testing, and documentation that is duplicated. I think if you take one thing away from this book...take this advice.- Design techniques, such as DBC (design-by-contract) that make sure that you define the pre-conditions, post-conditions, and invariants for each method or function you define. This stuff is inherent in Eiffel, but he also talks about a Java library called iContract which accomplishes the same thing in Java. Thinking about coding this way makes it easier to define tests and conveys to the caller the state the system should be in when the code is executed.- Know a scripting language. A lot of programmers see PERL, Python or Ruby as something that sys admin's use. However, these can be very powerful tools in your toolchest if you ever need to manipulate text, files, system resources, etc.- Minimize coupling. I know we all know this...but it doesn't hurt to repeat it."},{"Title":"The Pragmatic Programmer: From Journeyman to Master","review":"I've just finished the book. I love it very much!The book is full of golden sayings from the beginning to the end. Some of the principles are just in my mind, but I've never summarized them, when I found them in the book, I was very excited. Most of the tips are very short, it is impossible for the writers give more information about the tip, perhaps we can't get much &quot;knowledge&quot; itself from the book, but we can learn the way to get &quot;knowledge&quot; from the book.

The book covers a lot of ground, from work philosophy, to coding practices to testing to project management. The book offers good advice. The style is engaging. However I am still very disappointed by the book. Why? I found that most topics are better dealt with in other books and chapters are often too short to really do justice to the topics. For example, work philosophy is better handled in 'Please Don't Just Do What I Tell You, Do What Needs to Be Done', coding and testing are much better handled in 'Code Complete', patterns by the gang of four.The Pragmatic Programmer is a nice book for starting programmers or for a fun read. But the return on investment is very low for a professional programmer."},{"Title":"The Pragmatic Programmer: From Journeyman to Master","review":"Tip 15: Use Tracer Bullets to Find the Target. That's among 70 &quot;tips&quot; you'll get from Hunt and Thomas, and one of the most important. I used to think you had to plan everything ahead of time down to APIs and data structures and then go program it like an automaton. Both this book and _Extreme Programming_ by Beck explain why this is a flawed idea in the face of the plastic medium of software. You often don't know what you want, you'll often learn a lot by implementing the first module, or the customer may change their mind about what they want (especially after seeing early versions). I went from academia to a start-up, and this book was a very good outline of how to program in a real world setting. My boss, another former academic, also read it and loved it. You might not learn anything from this book if you're already an old hand at professional programming on a great team. Or maybe it'll just ring the I-knew-that-but-now-I-have-a-name-for-it bell. The discussion of rubber ducking is a good example (just nodding your head behind someone while they explain their code to you and debug it themselves). The discussion of the stone soup phenomenon is another case (read the book to see how it applies). My other favorites among the tips include: don't live with broken windows; make quality a requirements issue; don't repeat yourself; there are no final decisions (strongly related to tracer bullets); keep knowledge in plain text; use the power of command shells (but don't bother reading Neal Stephenson's book on the subject even if you love his other books as much as I do); use a single editor well; &quot;select&quot; isn't broken (think horses not zebras); design with contracts; test your estimates; design to test; test your software or your users will; test early. test often. test automatically; find bugs once; and finally, sign your work. (I wish software designers could do this a little more literally; I love how hardware designers get to etch cool logos on circuit boards.)"},{"Title":"The Pragmatic Programmer: From Journeyman to Master","review":"There are hundreds of books out there about computing - most of them so dry that reading them is like reading a dictionary, and about as narrow in scope as the manual that came with my lawnmower. Those other books usually expouse a shallow perpsective that has one answer for everything - one answer that truly works for almost nothing. This book is radically different.Andy Hunt and Dave Thomas bring strong professional histories and a sparkling style to their book. This makes for a unique viewpoint on computing - a holistic one, where there isn't one pat, tired answer, but instead there's a rich, tested philosophy. They value pragmatism, as you might expect from the title - and that pragmatism is woven with a diverse and sometimes surprising set of very practical &quot;tips&quot;. Unlike other &quot;philosophical&quot; works, this one has just the right amount of granularity - enough detail that the reader is sure to &quot;get it&quot;, but not so much as to prescribe a specific coding solution. The authors respect their audience more than that.On top of the richness of the content, the very best thing about this book is the sheer fun of reading it. They have a fantastic sense of humor, and a clever, breezy style. I laughed out loud more than once reading this book, and smiled most of the rest of the time.This book has gotten rave reviews here and on other sites (slashdot, Dr. Dobbs, etc.). It is no wonder. The only bad review I've noticed made me seriously wonder if the reviewer had even opened the book. He suggested that Hunt and Thomas are too stuck on the tired benefits of up-front design. Nothing could be more incorrect. In fact, one of their strong philosophical tenets is built on refactoring - redesigning as you go, when needed, and letting design be &quot;good enough&quot;. I seriously doubt that reviewer ever read this book - he certainly missed a great deal of its content.I'd have to agree with the vast majority of reviewers on this one - Pragmatic Programmer is already becoming a classic, and that honor is well deserved for a book which bestows a great deal of honor on this profession. Buy it - and actually READ it."},{"Title":"The Pragmatic Programmer: From Journeyman to Master","review":"I wish that every new developer we hire had read this book and McConnnell's Code Complete.

It goes through a series of best practices, going from topics like reducing duplication of all information (Don't Repeat Yourself - DRY), to the value of automation, to keeping separate systems distinct.

Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Pragmatic Programmer: From Journeyman to Master","review":"I read the glowing reviews here and then browsed it at the bookstore...where it looked pretty good...When I took it home and started reading it, a different picture evolved...Here are a few nuggets:1. Much of what the authors espouse is just common sense and would be picked up or developed by most bright developers on their own.2. Some of what the authors espouse is just wrong...we have suggestions that if your code is correct then it will take little effort to make it run on Win16, Win 32 , and different flavors of Unix or whatever environment. I disagree. This would only be true for the most trivial programs. Even using a factory pattern, as opposed to the usual compiler switches, one could build such a losely coupled and modern system to run on different environments...but it would hardly be easy to do because the different environments require separate (and hardwon!) skillsets/knowledge...not easy to find in one developer...Perhaps the authors should try their hand on some cross-browser, cross operating system DHTML...and make sure it runs on all versions of Netscape to boot.3. The authors elevating of the text editor and command line over IDE is just non-sense...and again wrong...they say you cannot configure the IDEs...anyone who has written an add-in for VB knows it is indeed possible.4. I could go on, but I will conclude with their total lack of understanding of Physics which they quote wrongly...the Universe does not split(Shroedinger's cat) after a measurement and Heisenberg said it was ,IN PRINCIPAL, impossible to perform certain measurements without disturbing the system...On the other hand, it is perfectly possible to perform debugging without disturbing the code...5. And they have the audacity to call their book &quot;...from journeyman to master.&quot;Having said all of that, there are good ideas to provoke one's computing thinking in this book...and so while I would recommend it, just be careful to examine their suggestions critically before adopting them."},{"Title":"The Pragmatic Programmer: From Journeyman to Master","review":"I have to be frank - I didn't really enjoy this book much.I fear I'll suffer a big backlash from that comment. After all, this book is well spoken of and is even revered. I bought it expecting to find a real tome of expertise and insightful comment from genuine front-line coders.Instead, I just got a collection of cutesy titles and mixed metaphors which are meaningless when listed by name. Oh, make no mistake, the author is undoubtedly an excellent coder and has a lot to offer. However, the myriad of section topics are simply named according to bad over-cliches. And, sorry, to me, this made the book painful to read and extremely forgettable. Looking at the title of contents brings back nothing; I have to re-read sections to remember just what the salient point was supposed to be.I realise Americans enjoy cliches and I don't want to sound humourless. However, it just wasn't a readable or memorable book.And, while I'm at it, I didn't really learn much either. Perhaps I'm a better coder than I thought or perhaps the book doesn't go into huge depth. Regardless, I'd rather read Joel on Software than the Pragmatic Programmer."},{"Title":"The Pragmatic Programmer: From Journeyman to Master","review":"The authors provide one with some good advice on topics that are often overlooked. There is a kind of gap that exists in the education of programmers. There are lots of academic texts and courses, and there are lots of \\"how to\\" texts and courses. There is not a lot of published works or courses in areas in between. This is actually where most the craft of programming takes place. Most of us who write software for a living have to glean the best practices of our craft from many different sources. The authors have hit the in between sweet spot.The area of the subject matter is pertinent and much of their advice is good. However, they don't back up a lot of what they say. I felt, like other reviewers, there were a lot of unsubstantiated platitudes.Another criticism I have is that their advice is very UNIX centric. The authors claim that their advice is platform neutral, but then constantly bash programming practices that evolved from the windows camp. Much of their advice tends to be more pertinent for those working in a UNIX environment. The bottom line is that a pragmatic programmer uses the best tool for the job. I didn't feel that the authors practiced what they preached.I believe that this book would be very good for younger people who are starting out in the trade, although many of the ideas are good to have continually reinforced. I think it would also be better suited to those who spend more of their time in the UNIX environs.Another author that concentrates on craft, but spends a little more time backing up his thoughts is Steve McConnell. But Despite my concerns, it is still a worthwhile read."},{"Title":"The Pragmatic Programmer: From Journeyman to Master","review":"I love this book; others have covered how great it is sufficiently.

The book features a number of illustrations and code examples presumably coded as images, and on the DXG they appear to be stretched out to fill the horizontal width 100%.This creates some very bad typography in certain cases. I prefer my font size to be the smallest, and the illustrations will sometimes stand out like a heavily pixelated 10 foot poster. See example picture here - [...]. On my Nexus One, the image will just stay centred without the silly stretching - this looks much neater and less in-my-face. I presume this was done intentionally when creating the Kindle edition, so I'd appreciate if it could be updated to let images be 1:1 up to the point of filling the entire width of the screen."},{"Title":"The Pragmatic Programmer: From Journeyman to Master","review":"I come to this book from a slightly odd perspective. Although I have some programming experience, it is very minor, and my current job is focused on strategy and project management rather than the nuts and bolts of coding. I bought the book hoping that it would give me a glimpse into the minds of the senior engineers I work with every day. This it did, quite successfully.There are seventy numbered tips divided into rough categories. The challenge for me was to distinguish those that nearly all programmers would agree with (\\"always use source control\\") from those that may represent a preference of the author (\\"design with contracts\\"). An obvious way of doing this would be to review every tip with a programmer you respected. But if you plan to do this, try to buy the poor guy a beer afterwards. That's a lot of tips.I also found very quickly that the subtitle of the book was no joke. These tips will help propel a programmer from \\"journeyman to master\\", but they are a stretch if, like me, you are a relative beginner. Nothing written here is conceptually outside the grasp of anyone who has done coding outside the classroom, but many of the implications and details escaped me until I talked them over with experienced professionals. It doesn't pretend to be a book for beginners, and by gum, it's not.There is also a very heavy emphasis on testing and automation throughout the text. While much of the time this is obviously a good idea, it is focused on a certain type of programming whose core challenges are on the back end, and not user facing. Perhaps there is a method of testing that would catch the UI errors and usability problems that crop up so often when developing for the web, but if they were described I didn't catch them.I would recommend this book to anyone working with programmers on a professional basis. It helps to understand some of their tools and processes, although not every engineer agrees with every tip presented. If you're learning how to program yourself though, I recommend you wait on this one till you're through a few more introductory texts."},{"Title":"The Pragmatic Programmer: From Journeyman to Master","review":"Very well written. It uses common sense to prove its points. I read the book in one day, and I found it to be very helpful with everyday programming practices. This book references \\"The Mythical Man-Month\\" in a couple of occasions. I bought that book as well; was not too impressed with it. This book, Pragmatic Programmer, is much better and much more reader friendly. I recommended it to all of my co-workers."},{"Title":"The Pragmatic Programmer: From Journeyman to Master","review":"This book contains useful information for novice programmers. The tips are good, but nothing new for experienced programmers. I think anyone who has undertaken more than three or four projects will know 90% of the content from experience already. I'm personally not getting enough from this book to justify the time it takes to read it.For complete novices, this book may be a good work book to keep around as they mature."},{"Title":"The Pragmatic Programmer: From Journeyman to Master","review":"A collaborative work worthy of a top-ten ranking for software development \\"bible\\".This book distills everything pertinent to real-world \\"rubber-hits-the-road\\" software development. Given that there isn't really another type, save that which is embraced in the dank halls of academia, go to this book first. Yes, even before \\"Code Complete\\".The style is refreshingly unassuming and devoid of religious side-taking (bar a modest but controlled bent towards a unixy philosophy). All sides are presented, and a final \\"we feel ...\\" proffering a very soundly backed up opinion on the subject in discussion. It's written for the reader--easy-going and coloured with industry anecdotes and graceful humour.References are ubiquitous, indicating a well-balanced text from true field professionals.Andy and Dave regularly re-inforce their modus operandi, that of pragmatic professional. Especially noteworthy is the no-nonsense style--unlike other books in this category, lip-service to the \\"fashion of the day\\" is avoided--accepted norms are questioned, but done so gracefully, and with respect.The entire book resonated with me, and I regularly found myself nodding in silent agreement. I would have to say that the most significant thing I got out of this book though was the relentless philosophy of \\"do it right\\", from uncomprisingly implementing \\"don't-repeat-yourself\\" to choosing the most appropriate tool for the job (rid yourself of those emotional attachments), all communicated in a wonderfully modest manner."},{"Title":"The Pragmatic Programmer: From Journeyman to Master","review":"&quot;Any clod can have the facts, but having opinions is an art.&quot; (Charles McCabe)By McCabe's definition, this book is very artful. That's a good thing - the opinions are founded on long experience and on broad familiarity with software development. The authors, true to their &quot;pragmatic&quot; promise, often omit the theory and case history that justify the opinions. They offer reams of advice on nearly every part aspect of industrial programming, and I think that all of the advice is good.I don't agree with all of it - good advice is good within its limits, and my work often lies outside of their limits. Take, for example, their editor fanaticism. I've been hearing for 25 years how much more efficient my work will be if I use editor &lt;xyz&gt;. First, I move between development environments so much that learning funny key-pokes for one environment just gives me the wrong reflexes for the next environment and the one after that. Mostly, though, text entry is about 5% of my problem. Suppose, after a &quot;near-vertical learning curve&quot;, that the cult editor cuts 20% off my editing time - data entry would then be 4% of my problem. The cost/benefit ratio underwhelms me. If you really love your escape-meta-alt-control-shift (emacs) editor, though, don't let me get in your way.I still think that almost all of the authors' views are good ones, with good reasons behind them. I rabidly agree with lots of them (especially DRY - Don't Repeat Yourself), and for lots more reasons than they give. The book is helpful even where I disagree. When I rethink my own circumstance, it's not that their reasoning is wrong, but that different reasoning is more right.This is one to keep, not just for the programmers in the trenches but for their managers, as well. Best, it doesn't try to dress up the -ism of the day as holy law - as the title says, it's about pragmatics."},{"Title":"The Pragmatic Programmer: From Journeyman to Master","review":"I want to give a resounding thank you and \\"thumbs up\\" to Andrew Hunt and David Thomas. The Pragmatic Programmer is absolutely great. What a terrific find! I cannot recommend this book highly enough!I was required to read this for a graduate school course, and quite honestly I was a little skeptical about reading a book written by programmers. I am not a programmer, but must communicate with \\"them\\" in building systems. I will use this book as reference constantly, and have already recommended it to others.This book cuts through all the language barriers that non-programmers and programmers have and presents information in a very readable format.I appreciate the witty humor combined with straightforward explanations.Bravo and thank you!"},{"Title":"The Pragmatic Programmer: From Journeyman to Master","review":"The Pragmatic Programmer is not going to blow your mind the way inching through a book on machine learning or functional programming or . But it will give you insight into how to be a better developer at the job you're in. Some of the information/advice is a bit dated - almost everyone uses version control, which the book argues passionately in favor of. At present, should you find a company which doesn't use version control, DO NOT WORK THERE. That said, it is interesting to see what wasn't considered matter-of-fact for development jobs when the book was written. However, most of the material is timeless in the way a book on design patterns is timeless. DRY (Do not Repeat Yourself) and orthogonal code will likely never go out of style, for instance, nor will the power of code generation. And though I say the book is for 'your first development job,' it's probably worth reading even if you're a bit further along in your career (especially given the propensity for switching jobs in this industry). The principles elaborated in this book will help you do your job. And unlike some developer books, Pragmatic Programmer is easy to read and not prone to fluff or rambling. The exercises in the book (with answers in the back) provide ways to illustrate the principles espoused by the text, which is also helpful."},{"Title":"The Pragmatic Programmer: From Journeyman to Master","review":"This book takes the reader through all facets of software development and gives practical methodologies to write better software. This book is not language specific; almost all of the concepts can be applied to virtually any language. Besides dealing with how to write better code, &quot;The Pragmatic Programmer&quot; discusses project management, team dynamics, user expectations, and a host of other topics. At only 250 pages, this book does not go in to great detail in any one topic, yet there is enough information for anyone to implement the practices suggested in the book. I recommend this book to anyone who is in the field of software development: developers, project managers, systems analysis, and even managers who want a better understanding of how the software development process should be."},{"Title":"The Pragmatic Programmer: From Journeyman to Master","review":"This is one of those books with a title that sparks your curiosity and eventually makes you get it. From the beginning, It seemed to me a bit weird because it's a kind of self-help manual for programmers. The book is well-written, easy to read and sometimes funny. However, the theme is too ambitious and that's why you feel a bit disapointed in the end. Its biggest mistake is that it promises more than it can deliver.In a nutshell, \\"The Pragmatic Programmer\\" is a rundown of best practices that must command any software construction process. Eight chapters dedicated to common mistakes you must avoid, handy tools you should use in your daily-basis, testing policies, automatic builds, source-code control and so forth. It's plenty of quotes and truths such as: \\"Prototype to Learn\\", \\"Design with Contracts\\", \\"Work with a User to Think Like a User\\", etc.In short, the book is a compilation of rules, patterns, practices, tips and tricks and lot of common sense. It could be useful for junior programmers, project managers that have never written a line of code and for all of those, so-called, \\"seniors\\" who have never read a book about software construction.Pretty handy... but it's far away fromThe Holy Bible."},{"Title":"The Pragmatic Programmer: From Journeyman to Master","review":"You will be amazed how much influence this book you will have on your approach to software development. I read this book when I just graduated from school before my first job. I am so glad I did. This book helped me each step of the way and definitely made me a more competent software developer. This will be a treasure in your bookshelf."},{"Title":"The Pragmatic Programmer: From Journeyman to Master","review":"This book is really clear, easy and fun to read. It has the potential to be a \\"Software Engineer for Dummies\\" book minus the annoyance and uselessness of a \\"... for Dummies\\" book. After reading just the first chapter, I was enthusiastic and eager to put to use the ideas that this book put forth. It makes developing projects (even Open Source projects) fun and seem a whole lot more structured. Great read for any newbie in the programming field or veterans that are looking to freshen their views in true Software Engineering (as opposed to mere hacking)."},{"Title":"The Pragmatic Programmer: From Journeyman to Master","review":"The authors of the book have a \\"light\\" writing style that makes this an easy book to read. The book is full of wisdom and insight with nothing too groundbreaking inside. The book provides plenty of solid theory that can be applied at the reader's discretion as applications and programming environments allow. As you might have surmised, the author's suggest you be practical in your approach to development. If I had to find something wrong with the book it would be that the authors get so pragmatic that their ideas almost become impractical. When I read a book like this I am always thinking, \\"Could I convince my development team of these ideas?\\" If I think I can't because the benefits are not an easy sell then I consider the idea impractical.The book is a little better than average but 3 stars was not an option. Reading the book was like going to see an OK movie. You don't think it was a waste of money, but you probably won't rent it again."},{"Title":"The Pragmatic Programmer: From Journeyman to Master","review":"Overall, I enjoyed this book. It delivered a thoughtful perspective on software development. I especially appreciated the absence of a quasi-religious methodology as well as their apparent orientation towards Unix.Why only four stars? I never really had any AHAs as I read the book. In other words, the authors make good points, but they're somewhat banal."},{"Title":"The Pragmatic Programmer: From Journeyman to Master","review":"The very first tip of this book is worth reading \\"tip 1: care about your craft\\". From there it goes down hill, never really focusing on anything in particular, it tries to be a general guide to good programming practice, but also teeters dangerously on the edge of a self-help guide. \\"tip 5: be a catalyst for change\\", \\"tip 10: its both what you say and how you say it\\".The carpenter analogy is so old and tired. Technology and software development are based on scientific research at the university level, and a lot of really smart people outside academia. If you want to be great, read what they have to say, (and not 2 dweebs who tell you to think about your editor as a plane or saw)There is something disturbing about this book thats hard to pin down. If you're a serious developer you might know the type of programmer this book appeals to. Its usually the sweaty perl programmer with a flannel shirt on in your shop with a lot of philosophies about development. They write 8 lines of impossible-to-maintain hieroglyphic and call it an application.If you're a serious developer working in a current platform like J2EE, don't get this book...its harmful, coming up with pointless new terms like \\"orthogonality\\" which just add more junk terms to the programming community. They also recommend you learn a new language every year, as if it weren't difficult enough to keep up with one enterprise level platform. This book has a very dated quality in that respect. It does get to some current development issues like refactoring, but glosses over them completely.If youre new to programming maybe its a good idea to give it a try. There are a few points that make sense, but if you're not completely hopeless you should eventually discover them on your own."},{"Title":"The Pragmatic Programmer: From Journeyman to Master","review":"This book includes a lot of obvious advice (like keep your designs simple --- the KISS principle), and is lacking in any profound insights about how to make it so. The material on Design by Contract elevates a marginally useful idea to a major breakthrough, which it is not. One wonders whether the authors have much field experience writing large systems."},{"Title":"The Pragmatic Programmer: From Journeyman to Master","review":"You can put this book into the category of books like - 'Teach yourself programming in 21 days', '20 recipes to success'. The books which don't have anything in them and just trying toseek attention. This book doesn't have a strong foundation and grabs all these universal, common sense tips and bunches them together.I would not recommend buying this book to anyone."},{"Title":"The Pragmatic Programmer: From Journeyman to Master","review":"I was planning to buy this book. But before buying, I checked it out on Google Books. This one is certainly not for the programmers but for the people who claim to be programmer. If you are a programmer, you don't do finger pointing when you or someone else discovers a bug in your program. You just get down to work with debugger. And in fact you learn a lot while debugging. So if you are a serious programmer (not just by some designation at your work), you don't need it."},{"Title":"The Pragmatic Programmer: From Journeyman to Master","review":"The foreword gives the entire meaning of the book away, \\"Software is a craft that is best performed by a practitioner [artist]\\". As a rational human being, I wouldn't want a craftsman or an artist building my car or the plane my family flies on to Disney Land. And what about the artist lovingly crafting the software that controls the car/plane?Essentially, the book is a collection of \\"lessons learned\\" from the authors' perspective.

However, if you dare call yourself a software engineer, woe betide you..."},{"Title":"The Pragmatic Programmer: From Journeyman to Master","review":"Every good book on software development mentions The Pragmatic Programmer with respect.

This book makes a good addition to the bookshelf on best practices.In the form of essays, the authors cover what tools should a strong software engineers posses, and how one should use them to their full potential. They also discuss programming constructs to solve traditional programming challenges- error handling, code reuse, debugging, etc. They also offer their thoughts on how to apply concepts, such as de-duplication, not only on the code level, but also overall in the development process, such as documentation management.The book is a well synthesized form of their experience and manages to stay involved and dynamic."},{"Title":"The Pragmatic Programmer: From Journeyman to Master","review":"I have used this book for two book studies with teams mixed with developers and QA. It stimulates great conversations and has memorable examples that come up in meetings years later. It is a fun and easy read. I recommend it highly."},{"Title":"The Pragmatic Programmer: From Journeyman to Master","review":"I found the book to be worth a read (which doesn't take long). Filled with lots of lessons most programmers learn with time/experience. It's not a book on design patterns or anything. It's more of a book explaining things like planning, how to be most productive, the difference between a prototype and tracer bullets, why code generation is powerful/how to do it, the benefits of decoupling...etc. It's quite a little gem in many ways... and best of all, easy to read."},{"Title":"The Pragmatic Programmer: From Journeyman to Master","review":"This is a good handbook for programmers who care about their craft. It serves as an good overview of many best-practices. The book provides a strong motivational force to reflect on your own techniques, habits, and mistakes, and to then go forward and improve.Many of the Tips in the book might seem obvious and well known to an experienced programmer. Indeed the subtitle is \\"from journeyman to master\\". We humans seem to learn by repetition, so even if you already understand know every single idea in the book, it's not a bad to review, reconsider, and re-align yourself from time to time.In general the quality of the tips leads me to make this a 'must-read' recommendation for any programmer aspiring to greatness. The book provides a strong focus on test driven development via several related tips, so it has quite a bit of overlap with many other books on the market, some of which I have reviewed here.Some of my favorite tips are:\\"Don't Live With Broken Windows\\" -- This one really stuck with me and comes back to mind on a frequent basis. The idea that a little bit of disorder naturally leads to more disorder (entropy) is a strong one. The example given is the well known \\"broken windows theory\\" that describes a form of inner city degradation.\\"Prototype to Learn\\" -- this is something that has really become important to me over the last few years. You absolutely must create experiments when solving unknown problems. And once the learning has been accomplished, you must be prepared to throw the code away, but keep the knowledge gained. One of the mistakes junior programmers tend to make is to believe that every line of code is precious and should be preserved.\\"Design to Test\\" -- this is of course some of the TDD overlap I mentioned earlier. However in my experience this side effect of TDD is one of the most powerful aspects of the technique. When you are planning or writing your tests from the very beginning, you are _forced_ to consider how your modules will be properly unit tested. And this consideration _forces_ your modules to be, well, modular. Testable. Cleaner."},{"Title":"The Pragmatic Programmer: From Journeyman to Master","review":"This is a great book full of good ideas and advice. Too much to take in all in one go, it's a book to keep on your shelf as you dip into time and again. For me, I loved the discussion on code orthogonality. I can imagine each programmer in an n-dimensional programming space proceeding along their own axis. The authors note that code orthogonality can lead to productivity gains. Code orthogonality equals programming power. You can almost think of it as similar to the AC power-factor. Power is all real power when the code is orthogonal; power is a combination of real power and apparent power when the code is not orthogonal. Apparent power is taking the same effort to produce but does no useful work. Anyway, I could go on, but orthogonality is just one section of one chapter and there is so many more ideas I like in this book. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Pragmatic Programmer: From Journeyman to Master","review":"If you're serious about software development, this is a must read.

You don't care that there's somebody better than you (you start admitting that there is), and you start off with a new goal: &#34;to be as good as you can possibly be&#34;, and then you begin a new journey in which you only care about improving, about being better, about making a difference every day in every little piece of work you make.Once you reach this state, this book's going to be the Holy Bible for you.

My primary hesitancy in reading at first was that it was written so long ago. Well, that was probably my biggest mistake as I find that while some of the implementation technologies mentioned in the book are a little out of date, the core concepts and ideas being expressed are very applicable to software development in today's world. A lot of the concepts and best practices (Design by Contract, Test Your Code, Continuous Integration, etc, etc) presented in the book I had learned on my own, the hard way.

While it's written mainly for the software developer, project managers will get valuable insight from the book on effective software development practice. The strength of this book is that it draws heavily from the authors' experience. Rather that promote a methodology, it promotes attitudes, values, tools and proven practices that will help anyone become a better software developer and make the job of software development more creative and stimulating. It's especially good for new software developers as it contains many lessons that experienced developers only learn the hard way.

The authors distill decades of experience through a series of good, to-the-point advice that is just indispensable for programmers.Perhaps what I liked most about this book is that it is simple (but powerful) and to the point, but still with plenty of *relevant* code examples. Instead of wandering through blah-blah-blah and making the book huge (which seems to be the case with most computer-related books these days) the authors do a great job of sticking to the purposes of the book."},{"Title":"The Pragmatic Programmer: From Journeyman to Master","review":"This book is simply exceptional book to know \\"craftmanship\\" as computer programmer. The book explains how to be \\"being a good programmer\\" rather than how to program. The authors doesn't show how to code hash-table, how to fix subtle bugs, or how to choose better data-structure or algorithms. Instead they spend many pages to exhibit good attitude, thinking-way when to be programming.Unfortunately, the book is a little expensive despite it has just about 300 pages and big letters and wide spaces. What's more, it is not well organized. The sections have many cross-references.But, the book gives us how to be simply \\"better\\" programmer, which other books don't cover. Being better programmer is not synonymous with being knowledgeable brainy programmer, but he is a man who doesn&#65533;t neglect nasty code.I strongly recommend the book for all programmers from beginners to hackers, and even someone who wants to know what's a programmer."},{"Title":"The Pragmatic Programmer: From Journeyman to Master","review":"In this book Hunt and Thomas have compiled a collection of 70 tips, thoughts, and techniques that are a must-study for every programmer regardless of skill or experience.The tips cover all programming topics.

Some of the tips in the book seem obvious, but are often forgotten even by experienced programmers. Some tips are things that I initially was surprised by, but after reading the thorough explanation the topic came to light and became clear.This is a good book that can be read off and on in sections, picked up at any time for a quick refresher on good programming.I would heartily recommend this book for all programmers, whether you're a casual dabbler in VB, a web perl scripter, or you write unix system utilities in C."},{"Title":"The Pragmatic Programmer: From Journeyman to Master","review":"Some of the items in this book are common sense, and yet I still found myself thinking about things in a new way after reading this book.

With item titles such as The Cat Ate My Software and Stone Soup and Boiled Frogs, they use humor to get across good practices in the work place. The items touch on all aspects of the development life cycle as well as some general workplace issues such as communication and maintaining your skills.

Recently I pulled it off the bookshelf and put it on my nightstand, and I am enjoying it all over again. I have a Master's degree in CS and have been coding for over 25 years. From my own experience I can promise you that the information and advice in this book goes to the very heart of the art, science, and practice of computer programming -- in any language, in any environment. Even for an old coder, such as myself, it can serve as an inspiration to return to many of the best practices you already knew, but have unintentionally drifted away from over time. This valuable resource deserves a place on every coder's bookshelf."},{"Title":"The Pragmatic Programmer: From Journeyman to Master","review":"This book is decades overdue. Whether you're a beginner or a seasoned programmer, it's not too late to learn effective and efficient ways to design and code industrial strength applications. In today's competitive software environment, one cannot risk working without the techniques presented by the &quot;Pragmatic Programmers.&quot;Andrew Hunt and David Thomas definitely know what they are talking about. Each chapter emphasizes new ways to improve and strengthen your current skills. If programming is your intended profession, don't waste another day doing things the wrong way. Start with the right frameset and place yourself among the &quot;Pragmatic Programmers.&quot;"},{"Title":"The Pragmatic Programmer: From Journeyman to Master","review":"When I first came across this book, I'd been a professional programmer for four years. In that time I adopted certain habits, styles of coding, that just seemed to make sense. But this book brought those techniques into sharp, formal relief. It showed me why they were right, and, in some cases, why I hadn't taken them far enough.After reading this book I understood my craft better. I learned to think not just about the work itself, but the assumptions I had made in diving in to it. I learned to think about and improve my approaches to the work. I was able help the team breath more quality into our software.It's a year later, and I've purchased a copy of this book for each member in my development team, paid for from our training budget. I was desparate for them to understand the idea of 'writing shy code' (a.k.a. separation of concerns), and of fixing 'broken windows' (don't let defects go! fix them before they accumulate) among other practices of experienced programmers.This book delivers a powerful dose of common sense for anyone who creates and successfully delivers software for a living. As a bonus, you get a pull-out sheet of the authors' tips and tricks. You won't regret adding this book to your library."},{"Title":"The Pragmatic Programmer: From Journeyman to Master","review":"This book is easily the best book on programming that I know. Tuck it under your pillow at night, and keep it close by at all times - I recommend re-reading it every year or so because it contains so much information.The best part is that all the advice in this book _works_, sometimes spectacularly so. After reading it, I wanted to put it to practice so I implemented a fairly large system following each and every bit of advice. It was a resounding success: I ended up with a product that had almost no bugs. Even better, the bugs that were found by the rigorous QA process were all easy to fix, benign bugs.This book will make you a better programmer, and I would recommend it first and foremost, before reading any other books on design patterns and whatnot. Pragmatism rules!"},{"Title":"The Pragmatic Programmer: From Journeyman to Master","review":"I think almost any programmer can benefit from reading this book. The book is extremely well written and inspiring. Readers of Kent Beck and Martin Fowler will recognize much of their philosophy (see xprogramming.com). Much of the wisdom in the book is condensed into a set of rules listed at the end which makes a very good summary. So even if you have only 20 minutes you will probably walk away inspired and with new insights. What distinguishes this book from other books about programming that I have read (like the Refactoring book by Martin Fowler) is that this book generalizes principles about coding in a very convincing way (many of the principles could probably be helpful for any engineer, not only programmers). Take for example the well known principle of not duplicating code. The authors generalize this principle and say that information should never be duplicated. This means for example that you should write documentation, but the documentation should not duplicate information that is easy to extract from the code (the documentation could for example present the purpose of code and give an overview). Check out the book for many other equally interesting principles!"},{"Title":"The Pragmatic Programmer: From Journeyman to Master","review":"Based on the reviews here, I bought this book . I have programmed for over 20 years, in multiple languages, multiple operating systems, from mainframes, client server environments, and on personal computers both text based and GUI based.Programming has always been a craft to me, and I have always enjoyed someone who could explain it clearly in simple terms, as it envokes a pride in the work I do. And helps everyone strive to do their best.Repeatedly reading the book, I thought, &quot;Yes, this is the way it is done, and should be done - what a great way of saying it&quot;.This book does state things that should be obvious to someone whose career has been built around programming, and it restates those understandings in a clear fashion that others can grasp and use for their understanding. They are things that need to be said, and are very practical reminders from solid experience of how to go about the craft of programming.The bias to text only systems, perhaps due to the authors UNIX background(?), left me feeling a little left out. Otherwise this book would certainly be 5 stars.The book encourages programmers to strengthen what they know and broaden their horizons and skills.Examples are in C/C++ and Java, and if someone did not have a background in those, they might be a little lost.I would say that any beginning to intermediate programmer could certainly benefit from this books message. If someone has been at the core of package development, yes, they should already know this - and this book is a great reminder of the principles of being a great programmer. Reading the book may help someone get there.I did feel that there are things I learned from this book that with the cross references helped me to explore areas that I have not been exposed to, and for me programming is a constant learning experience - which is one of the principles the book reinforces. We are always looking at new ways to be more effective - and learning what is the best of what is available is part of that. It does not hurt to have a reminder of what is a good practice.The Pragmatic Programmer is a classic programmers book for programmers of any age,language, or operating system."},{"Title":"The Pragmatic Programmer: From Journeyman to Master","review":"As an experienced software developer, I was looking for a book that I could recommend to more junior members of my team to help them improve their skills. This book wasn't it. Although this book has a lot of very good advice in it, it's mostly a mile wide and an inch deep. For a junior developer not already familiar with these ideas, there isn't enough meat here for them to gain any real appreciation or understanding of the material.In contrast, take Code Complete. It's *only* a book about code construction, a small portion of what Pragmatic Programmer tries to cover. And yet, Code Complete weighs in at nearly 900 pages, versus Pragmatic's 300 or so. The difference is detail. Code Complete really digs into each topic, explaining it completely and giving examples. It's a bigger read to be sure, but when you're done, you have truly learned something. When you finish Pragmatic Programmer, you're left wanting another book that actually explains everything you just read."},{"Title":"The Pragmatic Programmer: From Journeyman to Master","review":"I came to this book at a low time in my life. I had been working in software for over 12 years and I was beginning to think that I was an old fossil that no longer knew anything about how to write code &quot;these&quot; days. This book reassured me that I still knew what I was talking about and that my experience still had relevance in today's software environments. For that, I cannot thank the authors enough.What I liked most about the book is how it is based in the real world. This isn't an airy-fairy book about how things should be done but what the authors have discovered as they have progressed through their careers. I must admit that a lot of it strikes a resonance within me, especially the areas that I feel that I am weak on.In many ways the book confirmed many of my long-held beliefs (e.g. the command line is a &quot;good&quot; thing ... for developers). However, it encouraged me to think more about documentation (i.e. building it in) and meta-programming (to cut down on duplication and ease code generation). I have thought about this issues from time to time but Andy and Dave help you to realise that this can work for you, and cut down the overall amount of work you have to do. I had always avoided meta-programming since getting the immediate task completed always &quot;seemed&quot; more important at the time.I cannot praise this book enough. It covers the praticalities of working in software in a way the Steve McConnell's Code Complete does not. I think the chatty style is what makes the difference. Code Complete, which I admire in many ways, seems far more dry than The Pragmatic Programmer. I would recommend that a engineer read both books since CC covers so many basic issues that it is difficult to fault (expect for the positioning of braces in C code) whereas TPP is ground in the practicalities of what does, and does not, work within a wide variety of environments.I would heartily recommend TPP to anyone, especially to those that have been working in software development for a few years."},{"Title":"The Pragmatic Programmer: From Journeyman to Master","review":"This is a fantastic book, and highly recommended, if you are looking for reassurance or guidance in how to approach programming tasks with forethought. The authors touch on several methods to incorporate in the planning and design phase, as well as guidelines for daily use in how you choose the development environment or languages you should work in.This is great stuff, accompanied by excellent examples from the author's experience and eloquently written (for a technical book), interspersed with wisdom and humor.My only complaint is that the book is too high-level (but this is explained early on in the book). I found myself wanting to go more in depth in regards to specific languages or tools suggested in the book and the references they cited were not very helpful.All in all this book is very good, and I see that some people have been using it as a group study guide - what an excellent idea! This book is great for teaching good general purpose programming habits, but not for in-depth study into a single method, tool or language. Nevertheless, you'll find yourself referencing the wisdom it holds again and again."},{"Title":"The Pragmatic Programmer: From Journeyman to Master","review":"&quot;This book will help you become a better programmer.&quot; So states the very first sentence of the book's preface. Loaded with entertaining anecdotes, real-life examples, stimulating challenges, and exercises (with answers), programmers of all levels will find that The Pragmatic Programmer: From Journeyman to Master does indeed deliver on its rather bold opening statement. Managers will also find great value in the chapters dealing with project issues. The book aims for the &quot;soul&quot; without bogging down in syntactic details, so it is accessible to programmers of C++, Java, Smalltalk, Eiffel, Tcl, etc., alike."},{"Title":"The Pragmatic Programmer: From Journeyman to Master","review":"For the last year in two different companies I have been evangelizing many of the concepts in &quot;Pragmatic Programmer&quot;, but had a hard time validating my thoughts to the more skeptical people in our group.That's over now. &quot;Pragmatic Programmer&quot; has given me not only the ammunition I need to wage war against some of the more Philistine ideas that I must deal with, it has added to my thoughts and made me a better leader, better communicator and a much, much better developer. Any book that tells you to step away from the keyboard before you begin is good, but this book is a masterpiece because it tells you WHY you should take a step back.Every chapter is a gem and stands alone, but taken together with the references and extremely well-written explanations, it almosts reads like a novel. I felt guilty putting it down!If you are serious about software, serious about becoming a real craftsman and a leader in your field, then this book needs to be on your shelf, dog-eared and used."},{"Title":"The Pragmatic Programmer: From Journeyman to Master","review":"I've bought this book more than once - always keeping a copy for myself, in addition to giving them to colleagues. It's mostly things that can be bundled into the categories of either common sense or best practices, but it's laid out in a way that helps to break things down into well thought out nuggets. The information comes in easily digestable sections, with almost the feel of individual essays. At only a little over 250 pages before the appendices, it's a quick and fun read. It gets to the point while neither being preachy nor beating a dead horse. Well, it's actually 70 points, or \\"tips\\" as the author calls them, each well written and easily remembered."},{"Title":"The Pragmatic Programmer: From Journeyman to Master","review":"Pragmatic Programmer touches on many excellent software development practices and design methodologies, although there is not much depth on any one topic. If I had read it much earlier in my career, I think I would have learned a lot more from it. But I've been developing for 12+ years now, and I've already picked up on nearly everything this book had to say. I guess I already was a \\"Pragmatic Programmer\\". I found myself skimming a lot of the sections and whispering to myself, \\"Yeah, yeah, good stuff. I know this already.\\"The book is very readable, although it lacks personality. Not dry, just impersonal. It has a lot of \\"We think this, we think that...\\" but I kept asking myself, who is \\"we\\"? What experiences informed these points of views? How long have the authors been developing code, and in what subspecialties? Sure, some of this information about the authors can be looked up. But I'd rather have seen some of these details come out in the text of the book itself, in the course of explaining their points of view."},{"Title":"The Pragmatic Programmer: From Journeyman to Master","review":"book is really good and very on point. you will feel like he is almost talking to you.highly recommended for anyone who works in the software industry"},{"Title":"The Pragmatic Programmer: From Journeyman to Master","review":"This book covers so much ground, but it is a charm to read.

It does not happen to other books I have on the same Kindle just this one."},{"Title":"The Pragmatic Programmer: From Journeyman to Master","review":"While reading about things like using test driven development and Ruby in this book, I kept thinking that the book was a pretty fair summary of current trends, but nothing new.Then I checked the copyright -- it was published in 2000. This book was WAY ahead of the curve at the time.It can be read in one sitting and it's worth a skim for pretty much every programmer, even if you don't agree with everything. Highly recommended for new programmers."},{"Title":"The Pragmatic Programmer: From Journeyman to Master","review":"A massively enlightening book for anyone doing any programming at any stage of their career. Many of the principles contained in it's text transcend boundaries of programming languages, platforms, and development processes. This book has positively raised my awareness of the concepts of good programming.Hunt and Thomas express their wisdom in beautifully contained chapters; some are illustrated with an analogy, and many are labelled with an indelible mantra. The DRY (Dont Repeat Yourself) Principle, Orthogonal Code, Tracer Bullets, Soldiers and the Stone Soup - and I first read this book about 4 years ago!Refer back to this book once in a while and I guarantee a different set of chapters will resonate with something you have been bitten by since your last read. I cannot recommend this book highly enough!"},{"Title":"The Pragmatic Programmer: From Journeyman to Master","review":"This book is a great balanced perspective of how to appropriately approach software design and development. While it doesn't really focus in on any particular language, it's a great approach to becoming a better programmer over all. I'd highly recommend it for those who want to become masters at the art of software design."},{"Title":"The Pragmatic Programmer: From Journeyman to Master","review":"When I first read this book in 2001 I was burnt out. I had just spend the dot com years on a profitable, for me, death march. This book provided me with the perspective I needed to get my love of creating software back on track. I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"The Pragmatic Programmer: From Journeyman to Master","review":"...and normally, I don't use cliches. If you need to read only one book on programming methodologies - read this one.You can regard it as a \\"professional self-help\\" book. It really helps you to grow professionally. Even though it is pricey - in long range what you learn from this book will make you a better programmer (and, yes, better paid). Pragmatic Programmer is not only for coders; project leaders can benefit even more from it.The format is excellent and easy to read as well. While every claim is thoroughly explained, the essence of the advice is put in one sentence.Some of the stuff is a programmer's common sense; unfortunately, it is not taught in universities. And even though many people might think they know it - usually they don't.Seems like everyone has his own favourite part in this book; mine is DRY - don't repeat yourself."},{"Title":"The Pragmatic Programmer: From Journeyman to Master","review":"If I ever had to start my book collection over, this would be the first programming book on my bookshelf. It's not one of those books that goes over the latest XYZ buzzword compliant technology of the day. This book talks about timeless principles to apply to a career in programming."},{"Title":"The Pragmatic Programmer: From Journeyman to Master","review":"Okay, so it has been a long time since you read &quot;Code Complete&quot;. Time to brush up. This book is a retreat for road-worn warriors. Many good ideas (okay, not all of us will give up our productive IDE habits). Good presentation. I like the exercises along with the answers in the back. I especially like how the answers are presented. Typically, it is just the answers. This book has both the questions AND the answers in the back. No need to flip back and forth. Also, it is harder to get the answer to the next question by accident (typically if it is just answers, my eyes wander to the next answer).The only complaints I have are the cover. First, it curls too easily. After reading first 20 pages, had permanent curl to it. Second, the color/material is grease prone. I take good care of my books (I often sell after reading once and the buyers swear they are in mint condition). However, after that same 20 pages, the cover had fingerprints and smears on it. It may be due to the dark charcoal color. Probably more due to poor materials. So, buy it, read it, keep it on your bookshelf."},{"Title":"The Pragmatic Programmer: From Journeyman to Master","review":"I purchased this book for a love one who is a computer programmer/architect for fathers day. He has just been promoted to a new position where this book plays an important role. He has been very pleased with the book."},{"Title":"The Pragmatic Programmer: From Journeyman to Master","review":"What I liked most is the personable style of writing of the authors. I never got bored while reading this book; it goes straight to the core of what you need. You may agree or disagree with some of the topics but you will definitely get a solid point of view.This book is good as an abbreviated reference to keep right next to Code Complete 2nd edition by McConnell."},{"Title":"The Pragmatic Programmer: From Journeyman to Master","review":"This is the best text ever produced for a junior software developer. It touches on the value of almost all current developments in the software creation process and technology and most importantly, why they are valuable. It does not provide the details of any specific technology but instead describes the theory behind why a practice or current technology is popular/good. This allows the intelligent reader to apply the principle to a broad range of situations instead of one aspect of computing. Not suprizingly, the authors advocate writting code that fits that discription as well."},{"Title":"The Pragmatic Programmer: From Journeyman to Master","review":"If you actually like programming. If you don't think programming by horde is a good idea. Or if you aren't looking at it as a stepping one to management. Then you need to read this book. It will make you think about your profession in a whole new light, as a skill and a discipline. After the wave of horde programming J2EE nightmares has passed and there is still real work to be done by programmers it is people who look at programming as a life-long skill who will be left to build the interesting stuff. Get involved. Get on-board. Enjoy programming. Read this book."},{"Title":"The Pragmatic Programmer: From Journeyman to Master","review":"This book contains a good spread of techniques for making you a better software engineer. It discusses aspects of software development from refactoring to design by contract and a little about how each can be used effectively.Those who are familiar with these techniques may find the book a little simple (or, at least, a quick read), but if you are looking for exposure to a variety of ways to improve your engineering approach, I recommend this book."},{"Title":"The Pragmatic Programmer: From Journeyman to Master","review":"Invaluable guide to being a better programmer. I wish everyone I worked with read this book. Life sure would be better."},{"Title":"The Pragmatic Programmer: From Journeyman to Master","review":"I've had this book for a number of years now and skim it regularly. I've recommended it to starting and would-be programmers as well as hoary old &quot;I remember punch-card&quot; war horses. I often wish there were more books in this same vein.The only downside that I could note is that the authors often refer to their own preferred languages &amp; scripts, which both dates the product a little (more so with each passing year), and is also not so useful to those working in different environments or who have their own strong preferences.However, the nuggets of wisdom and common-sense analogies in this book are golden. If you're like me, you'll often find yourself nodding along with the book while reading a passage that describes something you've experienced or espoused first hand and grimacing when it points out a trick you wish you had thought of when working on some past project.This book really doesnt have much to do with _programming_ but is really more about _being a programmer_. It's sort of like a self-help for proggies, a mentor-in-a-book. The book's subtitle is &quot;From Journeyman to Master&quot;, and this jives with the idea of the things in the book being the sort of Guild-lore a Master Craftsman might pass on to his favored Journeymen prior to retiring back in the days of yore.I've been a professional developer now for 6 years, self taught and continuously employed at several companies during that time. This book appealed to me when I picked it up because it is true-to-life, and several of the real-world considerations mentioned jived with my own experiences. The ideas and practices that I already had were crystalized and refined by this book, and it also introduced me to ways of thinking that I had not considered.Perhaps the most significant single line in the book for me is on page 255, &quot;A project that falls below expectations is deemed a failure, no matter how good the deliverable in absolute terms&quot;. This struck home because I was once involved in a major project involving multiple programmers from multiple locations around the States, which met every design specification and delivered exactly what was promised, but which was mothballed after its completion because the management didnt understand it. Their expectation was something other than the specification which they had approved and thus we harried developers wasted the better part of a year on a system doomed to failure not because it didn't work or was a bad idea, but because the head honchos just didnt get it. I never understood why until I read that line in this book, and then it all came clear -- their expectations were not in line with the deliverable, and thus they did not want the deliverable despite the fact that it functioned exactly as planned.Since then I've made it a point to personally do all that I can to ensure that the consumers of projects I'm involved with are &quot;on the same sheet of music&quot; when it comes to understanding what all the tech-speak and specifications actually MEAN. Prototyping and &quot;Tracers&quot; as described in this book have been used to provide mockups before any real code has been written. Documents couched in &quot;Laymans Terms&quot; have been produced. Sometimes it's overkill, but at the end of the projects no consumer comes back saying &quot;thats not what I thought it was going to be&quot;. Some Project Managers dont like it, as they feel like it's stepping on their toes, but in the end no Project Manager will complain if the Project is successful -- they get to look good for a while, so kibitzing over the means isn't a priority ;) .All that aside, if you are a working developer with a grounded approach to programming, and dont have the conceit that you already know everything, I think you should give this book a read thru."},{"Title":"The Pragmatic Programmer: From Journeyman to Master","review":"The most challenging thing that I have to overcome as a developer is to make the most use of all the tools that I have acquired from reading technical books and papers. Most of the time, I find that I know how to do something, but I need a push in the right direction to show me what is achievable with my skills.This book doesn't teach you how to create X using Y. It doesn't tell you how to write sort algorithms or develop asynchronous messaging systems. It makes the daring assumption that you already know how to do all that type of stuff. Instead, it teaches you how to rearrange your skills into a more efficient and inspiring toolset.The most important thing to ask yourself is not &quot;What do I know&quot; but instead, &quot;What is possible&quot;. This book lays out a framework for thinking more in these terms without concerning yourself with the minor details that can be looked up in a book.I hate to borrow from the old &quot;Teach a man to fish...&quot; story but I have to say, I'm catching fish all over the place!"},{"Title":"The Pragmatic Programmer: From Journeyman to Master","review":"This book is a guide to parts of the software development lifecycle that doesn't refer to any specific programming language. It focuses on the requirements gathering phase, the design phase, and the testing phase of software development. The advice is practical and some of the practices they suggest overlap with Extreme Programming (XP) practices, such as coding for the easiest case and building up from there. The suggestions are practical, the writing is concise, and there are numerous examples. I especially like the way each section has a list of related sections at the end. As an example, the section on Tracer Bullets lists Good-Enough Software, Prototypes and Post-It Notes, The Specification Trap and Great Expectations. This way it is easy to skip around and read what you are interested in. A minor complaint is that the author refers to another book for more information at one point. This is useless unless you have the book or feel like spending more money. Overlooking that, this is precisely the type of book I was looking for to improve my effectiveness as a software engineer."},{"Title":"The Pragmatic Programmer: From Journeyman to Master","review":"After 10 years of programming, I have developed some bad habits. The best way to get rid of a bad habit is replacing it with a good one. This book is filled with good programming habits that you can use to replace those bad ones. Shorter methods, better names, and understandable code are just some of the things that I learned reading this book."},{"Title":"The Pragmatic Programmer: From Journeyman to Master","review":"I just recently recommended this book to a friend who's starting to learn programming. This is the one I wished I'd read first, before learning any specific language or taken any class on programming. Although not very long, this book hits lots of important topics and more importantly, approaches them in the right way.More than anything else, the reason I love this book so much is that it talks about how to approach programming in the right spirit. What do I mean by this? I mean that this book tells you how to think about that act of programming itself, from a meta-view, as an art, a craft, something in which to take great joy. I know too many professionals in the field who just view programming as a 9-to-5 job, getting comfortable and safe in their tenure, letting their skills become outdated as they write reams and reams of mediocre code. This book is the antithesis of that mindset.Dave Thomas and Andy Hunt are geniuses, plain and simple. They explain how they love writing code and inspire in others (at least in me) to love it in the same way. Their tone is such that it feels like your buddy from class is chatting with you over lunch rather than like you're being lectured on irrelevant technical details. As a side note, all of the many books I've read from the Pragmatic Programmers have been awesome. I recommend them all, but this is the one I recommend most. Buy this book; you won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"The Pragmatic Programmer: From Journeyman to Master","review":"I picked this book up in a bookstore while browsing their computer programming section and could not put it down. The book is well written, inspiring and fun to read. I really liked the tips throughout the book, i.e. \\"Refactor early, refactor often\\" or \\"Provide Options, Don't Make Lame Excuses\\". If you are involved in any type of programming this book will not disappoint. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Pragmatic Programmer: From Journeyman to Master","review":"Simply put, this is a must read for any developer/programmer who wishes to improve their individual proficiency. The material covered will be familiar to many, but the real value is in the presentation, which pulls it all together in an applicable way. The book has a clean direct style pointing out the many issues and inefficiencies that can arise in our daily work, and also provides suggestions on how to address them. The book offers a series of short easy to remember tips, albeit 70 of them, and includes cross-references between relevant sections. Topics covered range from a general philosophy of development, to tools, and suggestions on team organization. The authors do not presume to suggest specific methodologies or tools but rather qualities one should look for when selecting the tools in their toolbox. I cannot recommend this book enough; It will certainly be a permanent addition to my programming library."},{"Title":"The Pragmatic Programmer: From Journeyman to Master","review":"An outstanding book, discussing every aspect of programming that has impact on the final product. Skilled programmers have an underlying basis for most everything they do, and rarely does a book summarize this reasoned approach. While I didn't agree with every idea (using a single editor for code, documents, etc.) and some ideas could have been better flushed out (the discussion on blackboards and a workflow rules engine), the book is invaluable. Two other pluses - the ancedotes are great, and the humor is actually humorous."},{"Title":"The Pragmatic Programmer: From Journeyman to Master","review":"I've been a programmer for 15 years. This book confirms all the hunches about the right way to do things, and displays a lot of the things good practicing programmers learn the hard way. It could easily be titled 'The Professional Programmer' and is required understanding for those who claim to be one. You can learn it the hard way, or read it here. Of course, you still have to put it into practice. Great book."},{"Title":"The Pragmatic Programmer: From Journeyman to Master","review":"This book is great for those who are new to professional software development such as recent college graduates or those who have moved from other disciplines into programming. From suggestions on how to take pride in one's work to how to improve one's understanding of the art and science of programming, this book can open the doors to mastery of software development. I would recommend this book to recent college graduates, programmers who only know one programming language, and programmers who know only one development platform or operating system."},{"Title":"The Pragmatic Programmer: From Journeyman to Master","review":"I've been developing software for 10+ years - the ideas presented here are refreshing and useful and SURPRISINGLY new. Not all the ideas are new, but the ones that are - are gems. Aside from wishing that I had read this book long ago when it first came out, I'm grateful to have it now. Take it for a test drive. You'll love it."},{"Title":"The Pragmatic Programmer: From Journeyman to Master","review":"The Pragmatic Programmer: From Journeyman to Master, should be read by anyone involved with the software industry. The tone of this book is casual and often humorous making it fun, enjoyable and easy to read.As the title implies, this book is targeted towards the programmer or developer (the construction phase of software engineering). The text outlines principals and practices that are common sense, but that every practitioner SHOULD be aware of. However, in reality most of these principals and practices are overlooked. The book borders on the obvious, but keep in mind that \\"the obvious ... is never seen until someone expresses it simply.\\" (Kahlil Gibran) The authors express good programming principals, outline the collection of tools every practitioner should have, and offer priceless advice in a simple manner.I found the authors offering a lot of \\"Hows\\" and \\"Whats\\" with out answering the \\"Whys\\".Code Complete [Steve McConnell]answers most (if not all) of these questions and in doing so, is three times the size. The Pragmatic Programmer is also somewhat short-lived - a new edition should be in the making. For example the collection of tools described within the text is changing (Subversion seems to be replacing CVS, etc...).It's interesting to note that both authors (Andrew Hunt, David Thomas) are authors of the Agile Manifesto, and have a series of Pragmatic Programming books (Pragmatic AJAX, Agile Web Development with Rails, Programming Ruby, etc...).Their other texts are equally humorous and easy to read.The Pragmatic Programmer makes an excellent prerequisite toCode Complete. I can attest the \\"[Pragmatic Programmer] will help you become a better programmer\\" (Preface), but reading additional software engineering resources will make you an even better programmer."},{"Title":"The Pragmatic Programmer: From Journeyman to Master","review":"This book was recommended by a co-worker, and he mentioned that at a previous gig, his manager got a copy for everyone in the department. This is not a reference book, but it is technical in nature. As such, it is meant for programmers and those who work closely with them (analysts, QA engineers, and project managers could benefit from it as well), but it isn't dry or boring in the least.It contains quite an assortment of gems gleaned from the wisdom of very experienced coders. Although you won't find anything earth shattering, you will find a collection of concrete examples that you can use to immediately improve your skills. These are not the latest methodology fads (i.e., UML, OOP), but rather things to think about while you are writing code.As an example, have you ever gotten a program to work, and although you're not exactly sure how, you figure you better leave well enough alone, lest you break it again? This is &quot;Programming By Coincidence,&quot; Tip 31, page 172.I would strongly recommend this to newer programmers, especially. If you look at the talented coders in your organization, chances are they are practicing a lot of the ideas in this book (and most likely they own a copy)."},{"Title":"The Pragmatic Programmer: From Journeyman to Master","review":"Every programmer should be required to read this book. Junior programmers should read it (at least) annually until they fully understand it. I've been a programmer for 10 years. 1/2 of the book reinforced ideas I alredy held. The cooresponding copy should help me to educate those with whom I've typically battled over such concepts (managers, marketing, other programmers). 1/8 of the book validated some theory I've wanted to test; 1/8 seemed as though it might not directly apply to the language I program in most often; 1/4 just about blew my mind. The 15 or so hours I spent reading this book was some of the best time spent for me, education-wise over the last 2 years. I literally couldn't sleep the night I finished it thinking about implementing some of the ideas expressed within. To the authors: Thank you."},{"Title":"The Pragmatic Programmer: From Journeyman to Master","review":"I've seen this book suggested enough times on amazon and stackexchange, so finally figured it's worth a read. For whatever reason, this is the kind of book which often gets touted, and not the comparatively underrated CS textbooks. Maybe \\"professional programmers\\" are beyond textbooks.There is certainly knowledge to be found here, however sparse it may be. I would say there is more insight within the first chapter of Principles of Computer Systems Design than this book contains from cover to cover. The book can still be an entertaining read about programming, in much the same way browsing stackexchange is.To their credit, the section on making quality a product requirement was worth a read. Still, most of the book is filled with enlightenment such as this excerpt from \\"How to Program Deliberately\\":-Always be aware of what you are doing.-Don't code blindfolded-Proceed from a plan...-Rely only on reliable things.-Prioritize your effort.$35 for this, are you serious? The book requires an anecdote to explain the simplest concepts, of which there are many. This seems to be a lengthy exercise in writing about programming in analogies, metaphors, and aphorisms."},{"Title":"The Pragmatic Programmer: From Journeyman to Master","review":"This must be one of very few books I never felt like putting down. Quite a daunting task for any programming book. The reason for not wanting to put it down is probably related to the fact that it should strike a cord with every person that writes code. It effectively force you to ask: Am I writing programs or am I a programmer? If you don't understand this question becuase you think there is no difference then you should definitely read this book.The techniques and habits the authors describe are very useful. Even if you may not have a use for every single one in every single project, I am quite convinced that you may over a career find all of them useful. The author's don't propogate that this set of ideas are a complete set - what they do propogate, however, is that programmers should work smarter not harder, and that one obviously achieves by thinking about what you are doing (and learning form other - like this book).The writing style is very entertaining and thus makes a good read. I would say that this book is indespensable in your personal growth as a programmer. It may just prompt you to adapt your way of doing from being a &quot;child&quot; programmer to becoming a &quot;real&quot; (&quot;adult&quot;) programmer. If you think you are already a &quot;real&quot; programmer, like I thought, then this book should make you realize that one is never to old to learn, that one should never stop thinking about what (and how) you are doing.Enjoy a great read."},{"Title":"The Pragmatic Programmer: From Journeyman to Master","review":"This book is downright excellent. I recommend it to both novices and masters. Novices learn and masters can refer &quot;students&quot; to particular chapters when trying to convey/sell particular concepts.I have several people I work with that I consider my programming role models. While reading this book, I found myself saying, &quot;Oh, this is something John always preaches,&quot; and &quot;Here is a major philosophy Jane follows.&quot; At other times, I found myself saying, &quot;This is something I always had a gut feeling about and I'm glad I now have something in print to back me up on it.&quot;An excellent book. I read to page 86 in the bookstore before having to leave (and buy) because the store was closing for the night. Check it out. You won't regret it!"},{"Title":"The Pragmatic Programmer: From Journeyman to Master","review":"I like to consider myself a master craftsman. My craft is that of programming. I live for programming. Programming is rarely from my thoughts. I am constantly thinking of ways to improve my craft. Learn a new skill. Develop a new tool. What went wrong? How can I do better next time?Programming is a rapidly changing craft. A machinist can learn to work a lathe or a milling machine, and expect that his knowledge will stand him in good stead for the rest of his working life. Not so for the craftsman programmer. Ours is a new craft. We are still learning how to do it. Having survived in the game for a decade or two, and having learned dozens of languages, operating systems, database management systems, transaction processing managers, editors, we come to the realisation that this is a hard game. Each of us learns skills that help us cope with all that change. We learn basic programming skills. We go on learning them. We learn to see what is coming, and move in anticipation. We learn what is important, and what is not. We watch those who are successful, and try to emulate them. We watch the unsuccessful with horrid fascination, and try to learn from them also. &quot;There but for the grace of God go I!&quot;I don't know how to make an object oriented design. I can do design sketches. So I start from there. I build my system, dealing with the problems as they arise. I rely on my experience to keep me out of trouble. When I see commonality between two classes, I take the opportunity to refactor and eliminate the commonality. I am quite happy to rewrite any piece of code to make it better. You know what happens? I end up with a well-designed system despite myself. I am an opportunistic programmer.I saw the title of this book, and thought: &quot;That's me!&quot;So I bought it. What a disappointment! It is full of platitudes. It reads like a writer's style manual. It is good to do things this way. It is a bad idea to do it that way. It has no meat to it, no depth. If you want to know more about the topics they discuss, you won't find it in this book. You won't find much of it in the references either.Let me quote a typical example from the section entitled &quot;Text Manipulation&quot;. &quot;Pragmatic Programmers manipulate text the same way woodworkers shape wood ... We need a general purpose text manipulation tool ... Text manipulation languages are to programming what routers are to woodworking. They are noisy, messy, and somewhat brute force. Make mistakes with them, and entire pieces can be ruined ... in the right hands, both routers and text manipulation languages can be incredibly powerful and versatile...&quot; What rubbish! The analogy flows on, and is followed with the advice to learn a text manipulation language, and a list of things possible with such a language. There is not one practical example.This continues for section after section. In Appendix A: Resources, the authors say &quot;The only reason we were able to cover so much ground in this book is that we viewed many of our subjects from a high altitude. If we'd given them the in depth coverage they deserved, the book would have been ten times longer.&quot; All I can say is that they should have covered ten times fewer subjects, to the depth of coverage they deserved.A journeyman programmer wanting to become a master is advised to study at the side of a master. Buy Kernighan and Pike's The Practice of Programming."},{"Title":"The Pragmatic Programmer: From Journeyman to Master","review":"I picked up The Pragmatic Programmer because I was intrigued by the subtitle: \\"From Journeyman to Master.\\" As a non-professional programmer who has recently been writing more and more code in the context of my professional activities, I was eager to learn more about the \\"best practices\\" of the \\"master\\" programmers. Basically, I wanted to avoid becoming that stereotypical \\"VB guy\\" who simply slaps together some basic functionality and a nice-looking GUI and then signs off on the project without any serious testing or consideration of its maintainability.What I took away from this book was basically a philosophy of programming-a kind of professional ethic that transcends any particular language or methodology. From what I know about contemporary methods, it's evident that the authors belong to the agile camp. As a solitary developer, I'm probably not going to start writing unit tests and integration tests any time soon. However, I'm glad that I have a better understanding of why a professional developer would want to write tests before application code. The same applies to a number of the authors' other \\"tips.\\"I expect that this book has already helped many other untutored developers transition from \\"programming by coincidence,\\" i.e. just hacking something together which happens to work (at least for the moment) to a more professional form of development."},{"Title":"The Pragmatic Programmer: From Journeyman to Master","review":"Since I was young I wanted to be a programmer. I got my first development job only a few years ago, and have spent much of my free time reading blogs and the like. The problem with that was there were too many conflicting schools of thought on too many different methodologies and practices.I found this book only a few months ago, and poured through its pages. After finishing it, my approach to software development has changed so drastically that I would say it changed my life. That may be a dramatic way of saying it, but I think it certainly did. I began writing tools that would allow me to follow the simple development guidelines in this book.For instance, after reading the section about the DRY principle (Don't Repeat Yourself), I wrote a script that would read through my application's codebase and find similar chunks of code, and identify them. I ALWAYS found a case where I could refactor, writing easier to follow code, and consolidate repeated code into one area.Instead of spending tons of time trying to filter out the noise of the blogosphere, buy this book, read it, and then live it (my apologies for any \\"religious\\" connotations...)"},{"Title":"The Pragmatic Programmer: From Journeyman to Master","review":"I really did like the book.

The ones that are not may have one to a few usable recipes, almost by accident, but the majority are either based on stale ideas, or they are too heavy, due to their use of meat, fat, sugar, or other such ingredients.This book far surpassed my expectations. The recipes are original, hearty, satisfying - and low-fat. One of these soups with some bread and cheese makes for a simple and delicious weekday meal.Most of the soups we've tried from this book have come out very well. We got off to a good start with Garlicky Cream of Celery Soup (p. 39). Examples of other successes: Cream of White Vegetables (p. 15; this worked fine with Chinese white radish/daikon; turnip is unavailable in Taiwan) - very smooth, soothing and flavorful; Gingered Pumpkin-Apple Soup (p. 25) - I'm not sure I'll put the apple in next time, but we all enjoyed the complex flavors of this one; Cream of Broccoli Soup with Whole Wheat Pasta (p. 96) also wasn't bad, even with plain macaroni shells. The Moroccan-Style Vegetable Stew (p. 26), with pumpkin, chickpeas and couscous, was very unusual and quite tasty. I was less impressed with the Tomato-Rice Soup with Snow Peas (p. 93) - this ended up something like Campbell's tomato rice, but then but I did make some substitutions, like white rice for brown. And I probably should have let the Curried Cauliflower-Cheese Soup (p. 84) thicken more before serving. You can skip the Sauerkraut Soup (p. 36) - this was edible, but didn't much appeal to any of us; too heavy on the sweet and sour, and not very satisfying. Still, I'm very gung ho about continuing to try out the other recipes. Well over half the recipes look doable to me in our environment, and that's a remarkably high ratio. I have found no other soup cookbook that can compare with this one. The recipes that work - and that has been most of them so far - are excellent, and just our style.The book not only gives individual recipes but in fact teaches a *method* for making good vegetarian soups, i.e. pureeing cooked vegetables for a thick and hearty but not too rich base. Organizing the recipes by the seasons makes it easier to find a soup suited to the weather.P. 27 has a recipe for 'Squash and Corn Chower', but that's the only typo I've spotted. The pencil drawings and quotes are quite charming. I haven't yet tried the bread and other 'accompaniments' recipes in the back, but they look intriguing.In short: if you like soup but not meat, and are looking for ideas for simple but very good meals on the light side, this book is an outstanding choice."},{"Title":"Vegetarian Soups for All Seasons","review":"I checked this book out of the library and couldn't return it without buying my own.

Browsing my notes at the bottom of most of the recipes:\\"Great soup ! I made it for my parents in WR and they gobbled it up. You can double the rice.\\" (Golden Curried Split Pea, p. 59),\\"This soup positively sings; I think it's the cumin and the dill.\\" (Dilled Potato, Pink Bean and Green Bean Soup, p. 51),\\"This is an absolutely wonderful soup; and even better four days later\\" - and 5 years later-\\" A great Fall soup, the thyme is wonderful, food for the soul, and the season..\\" (Squash and Corn Chowder, p.27).And on and on.There are a couple of clunkers in there, as far as I am concerned - ones I never went back to:\\"Crappy - seemed like the sun-dried tomatoes were too much for it.\\" (Swiss Chard Soup with Tortellini and Sun-Dried Tomatoes, p 35).Ms. Atlas will often throw in an unexpected ingredient which enhances the soup's nutritive value and most times, its taste and texture in subtle ways (a can of pureed cannellini beans in Macaroni and Cheese Soup, p. 50, or rolled oats in Hearty Winter Roots Soup, p. 54.)The book itself is a nice size, about 7 X 9 inches, and lies flat, making it very easy to use. Each recipe only uses a page. Nice quotes - \\"I am a mushroom, On whom the dew of heaven, Drops now and then.\\" - John Ford, The Broken Heart (Mushroom Soup with Bok Choy, p. 72) and equally fine drawings throughout.Most of these recipes will leave you full, especially with a good bread and some cheese on the side.Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Vegetarian Soups for All Seasons","review":"I go to this cookbook all the time.

The narrators are lovers whose relationship is undergoing a test. Theo is muscular, judgmental, intelligent and sexy. Noa, much younger has delayed her growing up in taking care of an elderly father. The two live together, but there is a barrier to their intimacy that they occasionally leap over. After one of Noa's students dies while on drugs the boy's father offers to finance a drug clinic in Tel Kadar.This is not the story of a crusade, instead it's the story of two people-Theo and Noa- who find a way to talk to each other in spite of profound differences in the way they see the world.Many of the review focus on the problems in their relationship, but I wonder if Oz may have been trying, very subtly to draw our attention to the way people can manage, with kindness and tact to bridge enormous gaps.Lynn Hoffman, author of bang BANG: A Novel and New Short Course in Wine,The"},{"Title":"Resident assessment handbook,: A guide for using the minimum data set","review":"Two people, so fundamentally different, who somehow find peace and understanding together.This is, in principle, what \\"Don't call it night\\" is about.Amos Oz, probably the most famous Israeli writer and propagator of peace, wrote a very wise novel. Israel is inseparable from the story, its history and geography (the overwhelming desert) are in every sentence, but the truths emerging from this book are universal.Noa and Theo, a couple with eight years together behind them, are in a bit stagnant phase of their relationship. Theo, a man in his sixties, who achieved a lot in life as a successful architect, and saw a lot, living for years in Central America, has reached a minimalist attitude. He is very introvert, drawn in, finds pleasure in observing other people and in his daily routines. Noa, a middle-aged literature teacher at the local school in a small town of Tel Kedar, who started her independent life very late, after the death of her paralyzed father who she was taking care of, is always running around, never happy with her achievements, always setting new goals.The novel starts when they have to face a difficult situation: Noa has suddenly been asked to organize a refuge for the young drug addicts as a memorial to her pupil, who died (suicide?) recently. The boy's father promised to provide the money... Noa, an energetic, even restless woman, starts the research immediately... only to discover endless obstacles. She does not want to show her weakness and ask Theo for help, until she has to. Theo, on the other hand, does not want to interfere if he is not asked...The whole problem seems to be also a trial for their relationship... But shows only their enormous affection, tenderness and love for each other. Thanks to a formal maneuver- the chapters change narrators between Noa and Theo - the reader knows more of their feelings to each other, than they do.The language of the novel is very pure, simple yet precise without baroque ornaments and erudition shows, so common nowadays. Oz uses the knowledge of history and the Bible where it is essential for the plot. \\"Don't call it night\\" is a beautiful book, worth returning to from time to time."},{"Title":"Resident assessment handbook,: A guide for using the minimum data set","review":"Theo, a highly capable, but directionless civil engineer in his 60's, lives with Noa, a teacher in her 40's in the small dessert town of Tel Kedar. Noa is seeking more in life, and when she comes to head an effort to establish a drug rehabilitation center she sees working on this project as the answer, but at the same time this heightens her dissatisfaction with what she sees as her lover's lassitude. The story is told in their alternating voices, a device which works very well: sometimes they are talking about the same events, more often each voice moves the story along. Oz has a great appreciation for the physical environment and conveys this to the reader: the apartment the two share, its views, the desert surrounding the town. The book is somewhat limited in its plot, and in its secondary characters; also, while I was interested in the relationship between Theo and Noa, I did not find them particularly interesting people. Consequently, what is a rather short novel, almost seems too long, yet one definitely worth reading."},{"Title":"Resident assessment handbook,: A guide for using the minimum data set","review":"Amos Oz's Don't Call It Night is an understated elegy on the Zionist Dream. The wider narrative is about the loss of collective responsibility and a sense of overall duty to a culture (in this case, the Zionist dream of a Jewish state of high moral and ethical standards.) Noa, a schoolteacher who tries to establish a drug treatment center in a desert town outside of Beersheba following the drug related death of one of her students, encounters widespread apathy and obstruction from her community, and finally from herself. In one of the telling moments of self-reflection in the novel, she explains: \\"Our real tragedy is that we're not desperate to do anything. That's the real disaster. When you're not burning to do anything any more, you cool down and start dying... We've got to start wanting things. To hold on with both hands so life won't run away... Otherwise it's all over.\\" Of course this holds true for people everywhere, but in Israel even more so: For a state built upon action and creating physical facts, on molding a land to conform to a dream, cooling down can be lethal."},{"Title":"Resident assessment handbook,: A guide for using the minimum data set","review":"The title tells the whole story. It only seems like life is dark. Redemption can come in the smallest of packages. I was moved by the book. Redemption comes not from building roads or espousing ideologies, but from perservering in a relationship and getting up in the morning to make your salad just right.

At any rate, this is a very good book, although I was already a very experienced player when I read it. I did notice that some of the material is not presented in a fashion that would be easy to understand for a beginner. This would be a great book to read if you already have a slight understanding of the game. It goes into great detail in regards to the &quot;exceptions&quot; that are played contradictory to the traditional strategy. There is also a very nice history of Pai Gow, including great descriptions of the symbolic meaning of the different tiles.

But then Mike discovers a Japanese statue that was hidden on their host's boat. What was Norbert doing with it? And who is trying to steal it? But when Norbert disappears, the friends find they have more questions then answers. Can they piece together the clues they do have in time to save the wedding?I've been a fan of this series since it's initial release, and it's wonderful to have a new story staring the Accidental Detectives. I was a little startled by the additional of Rachel, Ricky's one-year-old sister. But once I got used to this new character, I felt back in the groove of the stories.As is always the case with this series, the plot is truly mystifying. The characters are well established in Mr. Brouwer's mind, and it shows in how well developed they are in this book. The only one who wasn't quite up to par was Joel, but that's probably because he had a small part in the story.Once again, this group of friends is playing jokes on each other and solving life-threatening cases.

Ricky's dad thinks this would be a great adventure for Mike and Ricky so he convinces Norbert to take the three of them along.They venture out in the small boat long before the sun comes up. In the still darkness, Ricky starts doubting that shark-fishing is such a great idea - small boat, big sharks - until a shark bites. With the pull of his line, Ricky's adrenaline flows. He envisions how it will be at school when he shows everyone his necklace of shark teeth and tells them how he caught the beast.Just when the shark is starting to calm down on the line, Mike falls overboard. Norbert cuts the line and Ricky watches as his prize disappears through the dark water. Norbert jumps in for Mike and they head back to shore.Ricky can't believe Mike was so clumsy to fall off the boat and ruin his chance of catching the shark. Mike begs him to believe that he didn't fall, he was pushed.Mike sets out to prove that Norbert pushed him overboard and in the process discovers some very unsettling things about Mr. Kidd's old friend.There's something about a buoy carrying an antique statue that a white haired man picks up from Norbert's boat and then throws it in a dumpster.

The primary instigator of this momentous transition, the Emperor Constantine, is rendered in a balanced, but somewhat muted, portrait. Beginning with an excellent explication of the root causes of Roman social and political difficulties in the 3rd century, Jones focuses quickly on the religious milieu of the times. In a few well-crafted paragraphs, he clearly illustrates Christianity's parallels and divergences from the other contemporary popular cults. This is combined with a somewhat bland recounting of Constantine's path to power and reasoned speculation concerning his famous pre-Malvian &quot;vision,&quot; acceptance or rejection of which will largely depend on personal taste. Sounds good to me, though. Where the book really shines, though, is in its detailed portrayal of the bitter fractious disputes within the Church, and how they mercilessly frustrated Constantine's wish for theocratic unity. Seventeen centuries later, the Emperor's rage and consternation are still fresh in his letters."},{"Title":"Constantine and the conversion of Europe (Teach yourself history library)","review":"in the course of Roman history, Jones aptly threads the line between historical analysis and narrative. He assuredly begins the book with a brief, yet astute history of Christianity in the Roman empire and carries through to the legal decrees establishing Christianity as the most favored religion of the empire. Yet, he does not forget to speculate on the plebeian reaction to Constantine's refusal to sacrifice to the Capitoline gods after his ascension to the throne.This book is a wonderful place to begin the exploration of Christianity's role in the Roman empire."},{"Title":"Constantine and the conversion of Europe (Teach yourself history library)","review":"A.H. M. Jones writes an admirable biography with negligible amounts of conjecture. Jones correctly states that we know little of Constantine's personal relationship with God. We possess historical evidence that outlines a vague conversion and details a somewhat sloppy and awkward evolution.Constantine who ruled an ever-growing portion of the Roman Empire until his death, in 337 AD, is best known for being the first Christian Roman Emperor, his Edict of Milan put an end to institutionalized persecution of Christians in the Empire. But, was Constantine a Christian or an opportunist?Constantine was a ruthless politician who killed rivals, subordinates and family members to ensure his own rise to power and popularity. It is his lifelong dedication to personal advancement at all costs that calls into question the legitimacy of his Christian conversion. Was he a Christian or did he simply realize that befriending the rapidly growing Christian population was a great opportunity to advance himself politically?It is known that Constantine was baptized only shortly before his death in 337. Some hypothesize that his \\"deathbed conversion\\" proves he did not walk with Christ. However, Jones points out that Constantine was merely following custom at the time which postponed baptism until old age or death.Constantine personally oversaw the Counsel of Nicea, which produced what we know today as bad theology. However, we must also acknowledge that Nicea produced better and more consistent theology then what existed at the time. A clear step in the right direction."},{"Title":"Constantine and the conversion of Europe (Teach yourself history library)","review":"In my book, \\"Astronomical Symbols on Ancient and Medieval Coins\\", I devote an entire chapter to the visions of Constantine, the depiction of these visions on Constantinian coinage, and what Constantine actually saw in the heavens. As part of my research, I read numerous books on the life of Constantine, and I found Jones' book, \\"Constantine and the Conversion of Europe,\\" to be useful.There many items of interest that added to my understanding of the history of his reign, but at times I found this book to be a bit tedious to read compared to some other books about Constantine that I read. Nevertheless, Jones' book is a valuable resource.I recommend this book to all who are interested in Roman history.Marshall Faintich"},{"Title":"How to Win at College: Surprising Secrets for Success from the Country's Top Students","review":"I love all books and blogs by Cal Newport!

Cal Newport, a college student himself, wrote these books after interviewing extraordinary students around the country who had straight A's, full social lives, and did lots of extracurriculars such as starting businesses & non-profits, and being politically involved. The point of all his books is how to study more efficiently so you can be an outstanding student while fitting in other essential dimensions of the college experience such as friends, parties and guest lectures. And unlike \\"speed reading,\\" his techniques are not smoke and mirrors; they are solid and make sense.I didn't feel there was much overlap between his books. \\"How to Win at College\\" is composed of 75 two-page \\"tips\\" that cover a very wide range of topics. This is the book I originally fell in love with and ordered copies of for many friends, and I recommend reading it first. His second book, \\"How to Become a Straight A Student,\\" focuses on a few key skills: the trap of \\"pseudo-studying,\\" time management, how to actually study, conquer exams, and write papers. However once I read it, I liked it almost better than the first one!In short, they are both indespensible, easy reads, hard to put down, and completely different from any other \\"study skills\\" books you might read. They are basically \\"myth busters\\" of conventional wisdom about school success.

I am feeling informed and inspired after the quick and easy read through (most of) the 75 blog-post-length chapters.I must say this book is not quite what I had expected. I have been reading plenty of college advice books lately (in anticipation of starting at a new school this fall) and was expecting the familiar \\"join campus organizations, go to office hours\\" spiel. How To Win At College has these things and more, but what makes it a great resource is how they are presented with an infectious attitude of ambition. It is useful to all levels of students, including the high-achievers who can figure out they should make sure not to overlook any graduation requirements without consulting a book. How To Win At College offers tips on how to be an outstanding student and how to do it efficiently and without sacrificing the non-academic college experience. The book is motivational without being self-help fluff; it is inspirational without trying too hard to achieve it. Newport has struck just the right balance between dishing out practical advice and presenting it as an invitation to success.I would highly recommend this book to students who want to stand out in college. The advise is diverse and, though it overlaps with similar books on the college experience, refreshingly original, particularly in how it is conveyed."},{"Title":"How to Win at College: Surprising Secrets for Success from the Country's Top Students","review":"While I didn't get to read this book until my senior year, I still got a lot out of Newport's succinct and useful pieces of advice (around 100 in all):Do research with a professorLead a student groupLearn to do something better than anyone you knowGo to office hoursExperience destroying the curve on at least one testand moreSome are expected, others are surprising.

A positive road map with both common sense and forward looking ideas to enter the real world."},{"Title":"How to Win at College: Surprising Secrets for Success from the Country's Top Students","review":"**UPDATED --- now 5 starsCal Newport's passion for the subject is transparent. Writing as an experienced, well-researched \\"big brother,\\" Newport avoids being didactic while imparting advice he clearly believes in.The advice is, quite simply, great. From the attitude to the study techniques, Newport covers a good majority of what a college student needs to accomplish in order to win as per his interpretation. For any freshman or sophomore looking to become one of those all-around stars on campus -- for anyone ambitious -- I highly recommend this book.Some of the advice is, at first, overwhelming. However, it is all very, very true and tested. As Cal would say about any assignment, let it simmer in the background of your mind for a while. You will realize how prescient his advice is.Thanks Mr. Newport for the great advice!"},{"Title":"How to Win at College: Surprising Secrets for Success from the Country's Top Students","review":"I bought both the books of Cal newport on college success.

Maybe coming out every now and then for some club meeting or event. And then go back home to procrastinate on something stupid ... or something I wish I was doing but wasn't out of lack of confidence, fear, whatever."},{"Title":"How to Win at College: Surprising Secrets for Success from the Country's Top Students","review":"This is a book about getting more from the college experience.Suggestions such as write for the school newspaper, volunteer, attend political rallies, advice on summer employment (he advocates getting a job in the field you are interested in working as career), etc.There are some study tips covered as well.The author has another book called, \\"How to Become a Straight A Student\\" that is very good at discussing ways to improve your grades and live a balanced life too."},{"Title":"How to Win at College: Surprising Secrets for Success from the Country's Top Students","review":"This book enlightened me.Many things I never knew, or just hadn't though of yet are here, plus a few not so important ones, but overal it has enough depth to compensate.I especially agree with the part about socializing, how it opens so many opportunities.

Now, I'm desperately devouring every publication on the topic out there to get the kind of grades that will get grad schools' attention.For someone who is really tired of the grind, or really tired of being a slacker, this is the book to point you in the right direction to turn it all around.Good Luck!"},{"Title":"How to Win at College: Surprising Secrets for Success from the Country's Top Students","review":"This book is a treasure trove of common sense advice for the college student.

I decided not to give the book after all because there were pieces of advice in it that I simply didn't want to be responsible for giving. I wouldn't tell my own child (or anyone else's child) not to read everything the professor assigns, and that is what this book advises. It also advises students to read a newspaper every day, and make your bed. While this is good general life advice, I'm not sure its all that important for college. I was looking for a book that tells students what I wish I had known before I went to college- like how to tell who the good professors are, what classes to stay away from- you know, stuff you'd rather not learn the hard way. I eventually found what I was looking for- The Secrets of College Success by Lynn F Jacobs. All my grads will get that one next year."},{"Title":"How to Win at College: Surprising Secrets for Success from the Country's Top Students","review":"Nice book! Not much detail about how to be a smart student. Hope everyone are familiar with all ideas present in the book."},{"Title":"How to Win at College: Surprising Secrets for Success from the Country's Top Students","review":"There are nowadays dozens of books written with the intent on preparing young people for the wonders of life in college or at the university. And although the purchase of any of these would provide an excellent source of advice to success at this level, Cal Newport's collection of 75 tips to excellence stand FAR apart! It is indeed true that many people will not be able to implement every tip into their experience; however, I challenge any college kid to tell me that advice such as \\"learning to listen\\" and \\"caring about your grades, not your GPA\\" are far too difficult to work into his or her busy schedule. In brief, if you are looking to merely help wear off the shock of transitioning from the environment of family and high school to one of the individual at college, then choose any college book you can find; it's sure to help. However, if you are looking at using these all-too-critical years at the next level to better yourself, then there's no argument: buying HOW TO WIN AT COLLEGE is essential!"},{"Title":"How to Win at College: Surprising Secrets for Success from the Country's Top Students","review":"To be honest, if I had just graduated high school and someone gave me this book as a gift, I would roll my eyes and never open it. I picked it up a week ago, however, now that I am almost done with my second year of university, and I really do wish that I had had it (and cared to read it) two years ago.The book is seventy-five pieces of advice, each with about two pages of explanation. The advice is pretty simple, as you can see from looking at the table of contents (\\"Dress Nicely for Class,\\" \\"Never Nap,\\" \\"Eat Healthy,\\" \\"Always Go to Class\\"). But the reason this book is effective is that it serves as a quick-reference manifesto for some of the more important (to me) advice.For example, I'm taking a grad-level fiction writing class. No due dates (except the final deadline at the end of the semester) and no class. You just write at your own pace and turn in a portfolio. This is incredibly difficult for me to do, and I'm unbelievably far behind in the work for the class. I was really quite worried about how I would ever pull it off. The whole semester, my fiction work has been priority #75, and I usually crash between priorities #14 and #20. But with some of the advice in this book (\\"Keep a Work Progress Journal,\\" \\"Set Arbitrary Deadlines,\\" \\"Avoid Daily To-Do Lists,\\" \\"Don't Take Breaks Between Classes\\"), I actually feel pretty confident about being able to finish on time. By reading this book (and [...] and Newport's more recent book,How to Become a Straight-A Student: The Unconventional Strategies Real College Students Use to Score High While Studying Less) I've adopted some strategies and habits that have actually yielded results.Before Cal Newport, I was up late every night, angrily doing my homework until I couldn't drink any more tea, without any free time. Now, I'm getting my homework done before sundown (for the most part), feeling enormously more relaxed, and regaining a good amount of the excitement that I had about college before I got here.If you're on your way to college, and you're the sort of person who can stomach (and listen to) advice, do yourself a favor and read this book. Newport admits in the introduction that not every piece of advice will be for you (for me: \\"Exercise Five Days a Week\\" and \\"Use a Filing Cabinet\\"). If you want to be more than an average student without being a \\"grind,\\" this book has a good deal of solid advice.If you're already in college, and you're looking for more in-depth and practical advice, I recommend also readingHow to Become a Straight-A Student: The Unconventional Strategies Real College Students Use to Score High While Studying Less. It has more thorough advice for confronting the terrors that you have come to know in college."},{"Title":"How to Win at College: Surprising Secrets for Success from the Country's Top Students","review":"As an admitted skeptic before I read this book, I felt like I had seen it all before. What could a 200 some page book offer me with 75 \\"secrets\\" of success in college? Even then, with at the most a 4 page explanation of why its important?Call me crazy, but I think that this book was what I call a \\"Quick shot at success\\". Although its a quick read, in terms of other overloaded \\"expert\\" college success guides, I found this to really open my mind and give me the ambition to succeed.What makes this book special is that it works two fold:First, many of the secrets I had NEVER heard before! Yet, as soon as you read it, you just want to go tell all your friends what they've been missing while they were inevitably buried beneath a stack of books! Even with the rare \\"common sense\\" tips, Cal puts a new spin on them. He explains them so you can understand them, why they are important, and what you can do to become inspired to put them into action. Best of all, he does this with EVERY tip! This book REALLY makes your college life easier and more enjoyable!Second, as I noted before, this book is a \\"quick shot at success\\". When you are done reading it, you WILL feel inspired. Even then, you will inevitably fall on some rough times in college. You may forget a few tips here and there. When you feel down, just pick up this book again and take another \\"shot\\" at success!However, i'd recommend getting his latest book \\"How to become a straight a student\\" in addition to this. Combined, you WILL see results!"},{"Title":"How to Win at College: Surprising Secrets for Success from the Country's Top Students","review":"I'm going back to school next month after having taken 2 years off after high school to find myself. I needed some tips and guidelines to help me get back on track and this was exactly what I needed. This book is full of good advice. I can't apply every single one of them cause some of the tips are more targeted to University degree students (Im really goin to college - 2 yr diploma thing) but for the most part it was full of juicy tid bits on how to get through exams, studying, organizing your time and a whole lot more. It was such a breeze to read, great for reading before bed. Of all 5 books I've bought from Amazon so far, this is the first book Ive felt the want to write a review on. Awesome! =)"},{"Title":"How to Win at College: Surprising Secrets for Success from the Country's Top Students","review":"I've got 3 Cal Newport books: How to win at college, how to be a straight A student, and how to be a high school superstar. How to be a straight A student teaches how to study efficiently so that time can be spent sociallzing. How to be a high school superstar teaches how to find your interests and to develop high-level, less-common experiences. In contrast to the other 2 great books, how to win at college is rather lame. It's a list book which give such trite advice such as \\"get enough sleep,\\" \\"exercise,\\" \\"go to class.\\" I do not recommend this book."},{"Title":"How to Win at College: Surprising Secrets for Success from the Country's Top Students","review":"There are tips in here that greatly aid the stressful student. I use this book as a reference whenever I feel stressed, and look at the tips \\"Ignore your G.P.A. and 'Have no Regrets'\\" As a perfectionist and a stressful worker, I always forget the great philosophical advice in this book. What I've learned is to lose my obsession over grades by facing the true reality that life is short. Demanding such perfection would lose that divine privilege, and youth is even shorter. Having no regrets taught me to live life with a keen eye for possibility and opportunities rather than having an obsession over success. This view makes life exciting and less stressful.Whenever I forget these tips and end up being so stressed, which I will, I will always have this book in hand to save me."},{"Title":"How to Win at College: Surprising Secrets for Success from the Country's Top Students","review":"If you're looking at reviews for this book then you're likely looking for some insight into the college process on a deeper level than surface-level advice. In that case, you should undoubtedly get this book.I'm going to college next year, and I'm the type of person who copes with things by reading about them. Books like this book are the reason I do that. It's clear and easy to read, it's direct, it's straightforward, and best of all, it's full of simple advice that can dramatically improve one's college experience. It provides this advice without being pretentious- the book's title turned me off at first, and while the author certainly has a very pragmatic approach to college life, he decries resume-padding and the like.I've recommended it to many of my classmates, and it will serve as a sort of bible for me next year. As much as it's helpful on a practical level, it's helped me in another way, too. I went looking for books because I was nervous about next year. This book helped reassure me by encouraging me to focus on the exciting aspects rather than the unnerving ones. If only I could get such a powerful effect every time I spent ten dollars.A few years later:This review actually was written by my then high-school-age son, and I have to tell you that he went on to have an absolutely stellar, meaningful career at an Ivy League college. During those four years, and since, he has frequently referenced this book, and its author, whose other books he later read, as having been his primary source of guidance about how to handle his undergraduate life."},{"Title":"How to Win at College: Surprising Secrets for Success from the Country's Top Students","review":"I never thought that a book could possibly teach me anything I needed to know to excel in college.

My grades raised, i had more fun, and I enjoyed college more because of this book!"},{"Title":"How to Win at College: Surprising Secrets for Success from the Country's Top Students","review":"Any student intimidated by the increased demands of the college curriculum should immediately read this book. The material is well-organized, focused, and always practical in its approach. In addition, many of the book's recommendations are equally relevent to developing a successful approach to life and career in the \\"real world\\" after college. Highly recommended for students and non-students alike!"},{"Title":"How to Win at College: Surprising Secrets for Success from the Country's Top Students","review":"I am a rising junior at Campbell University in North Carolina. I just happened to pick this up today when walking in the bookstore and I haven't put it down since then, I even read it while I was eating lunch. Having read and reviewed many \\"freshman experience\\" and \\"student improvement\\" books, I think I am qualified to say this is the best out there and it blows everything else to shreds. It is simple, it is true and many of the lessons taught are things I have learned myself over the last two years. I will be teaching a Freshman Honors Seminar next semester on the Becoming a Master Student book series and this is the only companion book that I think deserves to be beside it. Thank you for creating a great product Cal, I only wish I had written it first. Congratulations!"},{"Title":"How to Win at College: Surprising Secrets for Success from the Country's Top Students","review":"This book was very useful, as far as having a successful college career. There are some very useful studying tips, that were reverberated by many of my teachers. Such as review notes from each day everyday. It is the book to having a overall successful college experience. One of the thoughts was to enroll in a society or program on the first day of school. It also advises to apply for scholarships and awards everyday, it will look good on resume. This is a very useful book and is a great pocket guide. I believe it is the best on the market. But it really depends on what you're looking for."},{"Title":"How to Win at College: Surprising Secrets for Success from the Country's Top Students","review":"I bought many copies of Cal's book for friends, relatives, people I know who are graduating, and, of course, myself. To put it simply: This book is life-changing! Every single person I've given the book to has loved it (even 'unmotivated' students who I thought wouldn't read it). As a gift or for your own reading pleasure, this book will not disappoint!"},{"Title":"How to Win at College: Surprising Secrets for Success from the Country's Top Students","review":"Why oh why couldn't this book have been around when I was in college! Life would have been so much easier. I've given it to every high schooler and college friend, relation, acquaintance. I'm even trying to donate copies to my alma mater for their entering freshman. By far the best book on what it takes to be a standout in college. Full of practical advice, and all of it is within a student's reach. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"How to Win at College: Surprising Secrets for Success from the Country's Top Students","review":"Cal's style continues to reign. Very short (1-2 pages) for each point, which make it good for people with ADD (or just don't like reading) like myself. Like How to Become a Straight-A Student, this book covers many of the same topics. For those who would just want to buy one, I would recommend this book more than the Straight-A Student. But I would highly recommend buying both!"},{"Title":"How to Win at College: Surprising Secrets for Success from the Country's Top Students","review":"I am a returning student and have looked at several books for tips to get back into studying. This book has a lot of tips with explanations for why they work."},{"Title":"How to Win at College: Surprising Secrets for Success from the Country's Top Students","review":"Great tips for an incoming college freshman. I read this the summer before I started college and the advice is definitely helpful."},{"Title":"How to Win at College: Surprising Secrets for Success from the Country's Top Students","review":"This book definitely delivers. Newport puts more than 70 topics into concise chunks of information ranging from about 2-5 pages per topic. Most, if not all, of the information is down-to-earth (i.e. you don't see \\"NEVER DRINK IN COLLEGE\\" or other idealist, irrational notions) and relevant to today's student; I'm qualified to make this statement, because I am a freshman undergrad as of 2012.Be warned, however, that all of the advice presented in the book is for the ambitious. Newport presents a book on getting THE MOST out of college. He covers everything from general study advice (where, when, how long) to what to do in social situations (don't binge drink, make friends a priority). There is a lot of advice in a small book, so it may be necessary to read through once and go back periodically to derive the book's full worth as a mechanism to help you through college. Also, it may not be possible--or even desirable--to do everything presented in this book. Undoubtedly, you will find some Newport's ideas on college life to be hard to implement or undesirable to implement. Take what you like; leave what you don't. You'll be satisfied buying this book.This book is for more general college life advice. Newport has also written about specific study techniques for college students, which you can findhere."},{"Title":"How to Win at College: Surprising Secrets for Success from the Country's Top Students","review":"I will add to the plethora of positive reviews here with my praise for this book. It contains very good tips on how to succeed in college. None of them are groundbreaking, but they all carry a lot of weight and if put into practice, will help you excel in college. I've read numerous books on how to study in college (including the old favorite \\"how to study in college\\") and this was the best."},{"Title":"How to Win at College: Surprising Secrets for Success from the Country's Top Students","review":"I read this book after reading Newport's other study guide How to Become a Straight A Student and was looking forward to more of his easy to understand, quickly read nuggets of wisdom. Although I found the advice in his previous book to be more helpful, I did fine some words of advice that I will surely put to use in my upcoming semester.Among the gems I found, Newport reminds students to \\"Study in Fifty-Minute Chunks\\" and \\"Learn to Listen.\\" In these short chapters there are ideas to help the student better utilize their time by minimizing distractions and knowing exactly what to listen for in a lecture. By far my favorite and most memorable line from this book is \\"A good analogy is that writing is to a college student what shooting hoops is to a basketball player.\\" Wise advice indeed. I would recommend this book to high school an college students alike. The chapters are short and jam packed with good advice."},{"Title":"How to Win at College: Surprising Secrets for Success from the Country's Top Students","review":"In his book, Newport interviews several successful students from around the country and compiles a list of their secrets to success. Although these secrets seem like common knowledge, most people don't take the time to actually practice them. Start essays earlier, sleep on a regular schedule, study in a quiet environment--most people know they should do this but don't. But if you read this coming from a former Dartmouth graduate and other high-achieving people like Rhodes Scholars, you certainly will begin to take this information to heart. A must-read for this tiny little hints that can lead to a lot more success in college."},{"Title":"How to Win at College: Surprising Secrets for Success from the Country's Top Students","review":"Before I begin this review, I must say that every person and college is different, so it is the responsibility of the student to determine which words of wisdom apply to him/her.The best aspect of this short book is that it is written in a conversational tone that makes reading it a breeze. I think I finished the book in about 2 hours, though, I have gone back and reread some sections to refresh my memory. Many of the sections, if one may call them that, are common sense like exercising regularly and not studying in your dorm. Other sections advice you to write for the college's newspaper and start your own club. These difficult assignments may seem useless, but they are merely a method to keep you engaged in matters beside coursework and also develop life-long skills (ex. writing and leadership). There is plenty of advice is this book to make an easy buy and an essential reference for the first few months (or years) of college."},{"Title":"How to Win at College: Surprising Secrets for Success from the Country's Top Students","review":"I read this book halfway through college and really regret that I hadn't seen it earlier. It's very important to read the book cover to cover so one gets an idea as to the general behaviors - and not an isolated subset - required to do well in college.

While all of this cannot be attributed to the book, I must say that at the book played a very important part."},{"Title":"How to Win at College: Surprising Secrets for Success from the Country's Top Students","review":"I loved this book. It was full of sage advice on every aspect of college life - from drinking to all nighters, this book covered everything.

It helped me grasp a big picture about college instead of just mechanically going to class/doing assigned work and I definitely put a lot of the advice into use. The writing is down to earth and easy to absorb and although some of the advice I did not use, the advice I did implement helped regulate my life. Simple things such as keeping my room tidy, going to class everyday, not completing all my reading, becoming involved, etc really shaped up my freshmen year.Overall I felt empowered after reading this book and pushed myself to try more things while maximizing my time. The latest I slept was probably around 3 or 4 and it was never because of school even though I worked part time and was involved in extracurricular activities. I definitely recommend this book for the college student seeking to make the most of their experience."},{"Title":"How to Win at College: Surprising Secrets for Success from the Country's Top Students","review":"I think this book is just awesome. It has helped me a lot so far. I am a junior in college and I read this book 2 months ago.

I would advise everyone out there to buy this book and read it, it is just VERY good."},{"Title":"How to Win at College: Surprising Secrets for Success from the Country's Top Students","review":"I'm a senior in high school preparing for my freshman year.This book is amazing. The advice is down to earth and believable without being preachy or perfect. Newport is perfectly willing to admit that things aren't always going to go exactly as planned, but still tells his readers how to accomplish great things. I absolutely loved the advice. Some of the advice in this book is not for everyone - APPLY TO TEN SCHOLARSHIPS A YEAR can be overwhelming and unnecessary, depending on the student. That said, it's easy to see how even applying a handful of these tips would change my college career for the better. As a student who will have to balance work, class, and a social life, I think this will be rewarding. Here are a handful of my favorite tips:CREATE A SUNDAY RITUALSTUDY IN FIFTY MINUTE CHUNKSUSE THREE DAYS TO WRITE A PAPEREAT HEALTHYVOLUNTEER QUIETLYAnd the list goes on.

Overall, I think this book is a worthwhile read (why not, it's only 200 pages or so) but should definitely be a book that only adds to your collection of college strategy books and not be viewed as a collegial Rosetta Stone."},{"Title":"How to Win at College: Surprising Secrets for Success from the Country's Top Students","review":"Kindle Edition: Let's start by saying this book is very short (1717 locations as a reference). There are also some very bad formatting errors with this book, as if it was read by an Optical recognition screen from a print source. For example \\"the\\" might show up as Th he, etc. Also the Table of Contents had repeated lines, letters, brackets, and other errors all over it. I skipped over it, as I read the entire book.Other than that, the book gives good general advice. The examples that are seen in the book description are pretty much how it goes. A Tip, a few pages why, and then another.

While other college survival-type books are about healthy habits, emotional balance, how to do laundry etc., this one is for those who probably haven't needed such hovering help in awhile. In an excellent format (lots of little, very concrete tips, each of which gets a few pages of explanation), Cal Newport, himself a recent grad, lays out what separates the truly high achievers from the simply smart. The tips are not obvious or general, but precise and interesting (\\"Use High-Quality Notebooks\\", \\"Apply to Ten Scholarships a Year\\"), and well-researched (the author says he compiled them by speaking to many exceptional students, including Rhodes scholars, entrepreneurs, productive researchers and published writers, from all over the Ivy League.) The tone, unlike in many advice books by older adults, is never cute or patronizing. This is a very, very useful book if you're motivated and in for the long haul."},{"Title":"How to Win at College: Surprising Secrets for Success from the Country's Top Students","review":"After throughly enjoying How to be a Straight A Student, I picked up another of Cal's books. While Straight A focuses more on specific study and notetaking methods, this book provides more general lifestyle tips for a 1st year uni student (ie. befriend your professor, never pull an all nighter, exercise and attend guest lectures). I like in this book how he emphasizes the importance of health, self worth, good relationships and intrinsic motivation as factors in doing well. However, some tips are pretty obvious (don't binge drink, always go to class, exercise, laugh everyday, find an escape) and others are just random (volunteer quietly, don't network, eat alone, make your bed, empty your inbox).It's an okay book, there is some genuinely good advice like, ignore classmate's grades and take hard courses early on but there is a bit of fluff and while I have no doubt this stuff is from Yale, Dartmouth and other top notch students, it's vague and generic advice. Not much detail or anecdotes from students."},{"Title":"How to Win at College: Surprising Secrets for Success from the Country's Top Students","review":"my little brother is going to st. andrews next fall. he asked me, a recent nyu graduate, if i had any sage advice on how to do well. i told him 'nope. i did it the hard way. all nighters & pestilence.\\" but there's a better way. this alleged 23 year old 'cal newport' seems to have written precisely the book i should have had back in 2000 when i still had a shot at doing things right. i regret nothing but like i told my bro, read this book and take advantage of the tips you'll learn, cause you won't get them from your professors or your peers. a book for that rare kid willing to seek out advice on how to succeed in college. this book won't disappoint."},{"Title":"How to Win at College: Surprising Secrets for Success from the Country's Top Students","review":"The author says in the beginning of the book that a student doesn't have to utilize all 75 tips in order to be a successful student. This is a simple fact that you need to grow accustomed to when reading this book. There is simply not enough time in a day, nor an individual motivated enough to develop every habit he suggests, varying from exercising 5 days a week to relaxing for a good half hour before you go to sleep.I agree with essentially all of the tips he suggests. However, I think that outstanding students can indeed get away with studying in their dorms, eating with friends 2 or even 3 times a day, or getting a \\"normal\\" job just working in retail in town. While all of his tips are laid out clearly and justified in simple terms, college is a different experience for every person. Some tips will actually not apply to certain people. Some things he expressly forbids might be alright in certain situations.That being said, I think this book holds a lot of wisdom. While it was a quick and easy read, and while it is like a compendium of tips that are intended to be read like a list, the reading did become predictable. He suggests writing every paper in college like you're writing for a Pulitzer--while he does write very skillfully, and while his personality does indeed shine in the writing, the reading just became somewhat monotonous after reading 10 or 15 tips at a time.To fully enjoy this book, read it in small doses. Read 4 or 5 tips at a time and take time and ponder the things he suggests. For tips which come alive to you and really seem like they'd make you a better student, mark the page somehow. If you see a tip you don't agree with, make a different mark and go back a few weeks or months later and see if you still agree with your initial decision. Make an effort to live by the ones you agree with and see if they truly make a difference.This book holds more wisdom than just \\"don't procrastinate\\" and \\"don't binge drink\\" and all of the common sense things that most books include. While he does mention them, he doesn't dwell on them quite as much (though he drive no procrastination home, no doubt). This book comes from a man who really knows college life--you can see it in the way he writes and the things he writes. My only complaint is that reading it in a single sitting isn't as fun as reading it in small doses. This book needs time to fully blossom, which some people don't have much of."},{"Title":"How to Win at College: Surprising Secrets for Success from the Country's Top Students","review":"This book is AMAZING! Cal Newport gives wonderful rules to live by while in college. If you follow his advice (collected from stand-out students around the country) I don't see how you can be anything but successful. His rules are simple and easy to understand. For each one, he explains not only how to implement them, but exactly why they are so important. If you're like me, and you've always envied those students seem to run on all cylinders all the time, excel in all areas, and get more done in a day then you can accomplish in a whole semester, you need this book. If you've had trouble balancing intense academics and a full social life, you need this book. If you want to quickly, and easily, change the way you think about succeeding as a student, you need this book! It will change your life if you let it. I can't stop reading it over and over. It's an easy read, and it will not only inspire you to aim higher, it will tell you how to reach your new goals. After reading it, I feel like the sky is the limit for what I can achieve. Now I see college as the staging ground for all my future successes.

The best part is that it is written by an actual student to students and contains bits of advice you won't get reading an ordinary college \\"How To\\" book. And with dozens of two or three page chapters highlighting specific points, it's an enjoyable read that will get anyone thinking critically about how to succeed in college."},{"Title":"How to Win at College: Surprising Secrets for Success from the Country's Top Students","review":"I am 16 years old, a rising senior in high school. I own all of Cal Newport's books: \\"Superstar,\\" \\"Straight-A,\\" and of course, this one. Of these three, \\"How to Win at College\\" is, despite its targeted age group, my favorite. I would easily give 5 stars to the other two, but this one went above and beyond (if that could be even be possible), for these 3 reasons:*The writing is structured into manageable, 1- to 2-page chapters, and the tip-by-tip format is appealing. It's the kind of book you breeze through but isn't devoid of substance. In fact, as soon as you finish it, you want to read it all over again. (That's the same problem I had with \\"Superstar\\" and \\"Straight-A\\" -- pacing myself to read and absorb slowly -- but hey, that's a good book for you!)*The advice itself isn't banal, anyone-could-pull-this-out-of-their-head empty rhetoric. I've found that an overwhelming amount of the college life/study advice guides are wishy-washy, predictable, and contrived. Newport encourages his readers to defy conventional wisdom by not doing all the assigned reading or using daily to-do lists. He talks about the surprising psychological benefits of making your bed. According to him, napping is dangerous, you should take art history and astronomy, eat alone twice a day, keep your email inbox empty, and, most importantly, \\"don't have no regrets.\\" I've a huge follower of his popular student advice blog, Study Hacks, and of all 3 books, this one probably is least similar to the advice on his blog. Of course, that probably has to do with the way the book is structured. If you're in college, read this one after reading \\"Straight-A.\\" If you're in high school, read this after reading \\"Straight-A\\" and \\"Superstar.\\" Both of those are highly specialized, focused, and deep, while this one is more like a smorgasbord of interesting tips (some of which are not even brought up in the other two).*Newport's voice is distinct, concise, and entertaining. Even the most begrudging, I-wouldn't-be-caught-dead-with-a-study-advice-guide will treat it like their new Bible. It's good to keep by on your desk for when you need tactical inspiration.After being a Newport convert, I've picked up and am excelling at a \\"Grand Project\\" (an idea discussed extensively in this book and \\"Superstar\\"), am considerably less stressed, and cannot wait for college in one year because I think I'll have the important things under control, thanks to this guide!It's probably one of the smartest investments that you can make for you or your child's education. Worth every penny and more."},{"Title":"How to Win at College: Surprising Secrets for Success from the Country's Top Students","review":"I graduated from a top tier university and I can tell you that I agree with the information and advice in this book. This book is a very easy and quick read. It is comprised of 75 short tips on how to \\"Win at College.\\" The author does state in the beginning that some of the 75 may not apply to you so don't feel like you have to apply all the tips for success in college. Personally the sections on, studying abroad, nap time, all nighters, and political rallies don't apply to me. I would say this book would be most valuable to the HS senior or HS graduate and very valuable to a college freshman who is settling into college life. Once you are a college sophomore, I think you will have figured most of this stuff out by then.I rated Cal Newport's other book \\"How to Become a Straight A Student\\" very poorly because I felt that that title could not deliver on it's promise due to the broad subject matter. I have chosen to give this book a much higher rating because the advice is sound and succinct albeit pretty basic. There is nothing groundbreaking here but I think the information should help reinforce a lot of ideas or habits that you may have come across or considered at some point but never acted upon or applied to your own life.Honestly, winning at college pretty much comes down to motivation, discipline, time management, and maintaining your happiness. If you don't have these qualities, you will fail miserably or you will just have a rough time if you can even make it through the four years. On the other hand if you do have these qualities, college should be some of the best four years of your life. If you asked me when I was 18 why I was going to college, I would tell you \\"To get a good job.\\" That might be a part of it but my new answer today would be \\"You go to college to learn about yourself and to challenge yourself to go farther than you ever thought possible.\\" Winning at college is much more than a high GPA. My point is that winning at college is all about how you approach college. If you go to college with only job prospects in mind, you will be short-changing only yourself. However, as the author says in entry #75, if you go to college to push your potential up and beyond what you ever thought possible and to explore a whole new world in the process, then you will win. This book gives you good advice on how to get there. I recommend it."},{"Title":"How to Win at College: Surprising Secrets for Success from the Country's Top Students","review":"Definitely get his other book first.This one has lots of good advice, but most of it is obvious; less procrastination, more self care (including the much neglected emotional health), challenging extracurricular activities, balancing priorities, etc... Unfortunately, I am a non-traditional student in my senior year so half of this stuff doesn't apply. Some of it is downright weird or just not important; for example, I don't think my college success has a lot to do with what newspaper I read.Basically, get his other book, on study skills.

However, they were very good about apologizing for their error and I think have returned my money (I don't know that for sure until I get my statement) but I offered to keep the book sent and not have them return the money, but they insisted on returning the money and allowing my daughter to keep the book. (Since it was a used book it was very little money.) Unfortunately they could not find the correct book in their inventory and I have since ordered it for my daughter from another firm.As far as the book is concerned, I have read it. It is written by a Mormon scholar and a few things in it would probably only suit a Mormon, but the book itself is a very readable biography of Paul and very well documented and one of the best books that I have read about Paul.

Highly recommended as an introduction."},{"Title":"Ragnarok: The Age of Fire and Gravel","review":"Ignatius Donnelly was born in 1831 Philadelphia and became a lawyer in 1852. Married in 1855, they moved to Minnesota. When Minnesota became a state in 1857 Donnelly was elected lieutenant governor. In 1862 he was elected to Congress for three terms. He campaigned for Greenback policies and served in the state senate. Donnelly wrote \\"Atlantis\\" and \\"Ragnarok\\" which became sensational best sellers and made him wealthy. \\"The Great Cryptogram\\" analyzed Shakespeare's plays to prove they were written by Francis Bacon. Two novels dealt with a fascist takeover of America \\"Caesar's Column\\", and racial intolerance \\"Dr. Huguet\\". In 1887 he became a founder of the Populist Party, and was nominated for Vice-President in 1898. He died in Minneapolis on 1/1/1901. His politics, oratory, and literature marked his originality and talents; his writings are now out of fashion.Donnelly studied the legends and mythologies of Hindus, Persians, Britons, Chinese, Greeks, Scandinavians, the North, Central, and South American Indians, Arabians, Babylonians, and Egyptians that told of disaster by fire, hail, frost, darkness, changes in climates, and tales of dragons and other monsters. Donnelly claimed these reflected a visit from a giant comet, and the proof lay in The Drift of unstratified deposits which came from a cometic collision rather than glacial movement. Donnelly suggested a comet could have caused Old Testament events such as the destruction of the wicked cities, the sun standing still, and stones falling from the heavens. Ragnarok, the Twilight of the Gods (or Rain of Rocks), commanded the interest of general readers, and the admiration (if not credence) of the scientific world. Donnelly, a good lawyer, argued his case well with all the evidence available to him at the time. Decades later Immanuel Velikovsky would publish his version of this theory.The surface of our planet consists of layers of sand, clay, and gravel (over stratified rock). It contains no trace of fossils. The pre-glacial world saw tropical plants growing near the Arctic Circle in Miocene times. Herds of elephants and other animals lived in Europe. Donnelly says a sudden cataclysm brought severe cold, and left deposits of sand, clay, and gravel; fissures were created in earth's crust. He explains why this was caused by a comet striking earth, the heat vaporizing the seas to create clouds, rain, and snow. Rocks on the surface would be smashed and crushed. This collision was preserved in the legends of mankind. The Great Lakes suggest points of impact. Vast clouds, and debris in the sky, would create a \\"nuclear winter\\".Donnelly says myths and legends are ultimately based on some fact. Finding the same legends among different nations suggests a common experience in prehistoric times. These myths of a cataclysm imply the existence of mankind; they are in accord with the facts known to science and from deep excavations. The legends coincide in this: a monster in the air; the heat; the fire; the cave-life; the darkness; the return of light. Donnelly respectfully suggests the Book of Job is the oldest in the Bible, and gives a new viewpoint to the beginning of Genesis.Donnelly answers objections in Part IV Chapter IV. The position of certain constellations in Job estimates this time as 30,000 years ago. Donnelly suggests the fire that seemed to drop out of the heavens and set a number of fires in Wisconsin, Michigan, and Illinois on October 8, 1871 was the result of Bielas' comet. There is a universal feeling that regards comets with fear; Revelation (chapter xii, v.3) is a symbol of a comet brushing the earth. Why would God permit such a calamity? Perhaps what was destroyed was not worth preserving? It could be God's plan to punish the wicked of this world, says Donnelly."},{"Title":"Low-Fat Living Cookbook: Skillpower/Not Willpower","review":"The book was in great condition and delivered in a very timely manner.Very pleased with the service and quality."},{"Title":"Tu es si jolie ce soir","review":"This is the French text edition of \\"The Way You Look Tonight\\", a terrific novel of suspense, offering the reader a riveting, page turning read. It is hard to put down, once the reader is in its thrall. Well written in spare, clean prose, it will keep most readers guessing until the very end.The premise is fairly simple. Deborah Robinson, a young woman and mother of an adorable and precocious set of five year old twins, suddenly has the bottom drop out of her world when her husband, Steve, a prosecuting attorney, suddenly disappears without warning. Shortly thereafter, she is stunned to discover that he is suspected of being a serial killer who, for the past eight years, has been killing young women fitting a description that matches hers.Delving into her husband's past, she uncovers information of which she was previously unaware, which causes her to question just what her husband may really have been hiding. Yet, despite all that she discovers, she believes steadfastedly that her husband is not what he is suspected of being.At the same time that this is going on, the man who had fifteen years earlier been convicted of brutally beating and raping Steve's sister, Emily, causing her to be institutionalized, is released from prison and believed to be in the area seeking revenge. Does this also have something to do with Steve's disappearance?Things are not always what they seem, as the reader will discover. There are enough plausible twists and turns in this novel of suspense to satisfy even the most exacting and demanding of readers.

I found him to be both highly readable and balanced in his commentary. This book traces the history of racial and ethnic relations in the U.S. from the perspective of immigration and assimilation. It also confronts the concern for acculturation without resorting to polemics or diatribe. Above all, it makes a cogent and convincing argument for revalidating America's unique civic culture at a time when balkanization is leading us astray as a people. If read in conjunction with some of the more recent writings of Arthur Schlesinger, Jr., it will illuminate further. A reasoned counterargument to the excesses of critical race theory and postmodernism."},{"Title":"Sparrows don't drop candy wrappers","review":"Any book that is illustrated by Susan Perl is a true pearl of a book.

By relating how separate events affected each other, he keeps the reader interested and motivated to read more. Lastly, the author breathes fresh life into the American experience through educational and entertaining sidebars that support and highlight noteworthy historical events.

For the person such as myself, who is completely obsessed and loves the movie and its characters to the point of insanity, this book is absolutely necessary. For the more lukewarm fan or the person wondering whether or not they actually do like the movie, it's also an enthralling read.To say the least, this book is overflowing with knowledge. About Kill Bill, Tarantino, the actors, the other people behind the film, the music, the countless earlier film influences. It is a series of spoilers, meant to be a healthy supplement for someone who has already seen the movie (probably numerous times). The author warns us of this in the first few pages. Clearly, this book was an immense undertaking and the product is born of a deep love not only of Kill Bill, but of cinema in general. This wonderful book bespeaks loads of time and infinite patience spent sitting diligently through movies and conducting research. In these ways, the author proves to be not unlike Tarantino himself.The book is, in fact, what someone like me would want to make had I the boundless patience and time. It is worlds better than the book of pictures and collection of opinions coming seemingly from a fan with too much time on their hands I had sort of anticipated.Nearly every second, every line of dialogue, every brilliant visual gag and musical cue of this masterpiece movie in two volumes is described and analyzed in these pages. Have the DVD? Find the moments of interest at the specific times given. A thorough knowledge and understanding of the story is offered, from timeline information to details (lists of every \`foot fetish' incident, every House of Blue Leaves action), explanations, insights, plausible suggestions and theories, presented in case you haven't thought of them already. Moreover, it gives you inspiration to develop your own further ideas.My overall impression here is that if every fan of this movie read this book, there would be a dramatic reduction in the number of stupid questions asked online about the film.Every reference, obscure or not, drawn from another existing movie is outlined and often expounded upon. There's more background information here than you could ever ask for, and you come away with a new and more whole comprehension of Tarantino and his movie. You see where all the pieces come from. What else is here? Images you've never seen, color photos, posters, information on actors (with the exception, I noticed, of Viveca Fox), full credits, an interview with David Carradine, DVD differences, and a bibliography, for some things. I love the book's thorough, take-notice-of-every-single-second and find-out-everything-you-possibly-can approach to analysis. There are connections to things you may never have imagined.I did notice a number of grammatical errors and missing or misprinted words, but these have no real effect. The book is well-written, with a friendly and personal approach as if he were simply saying to us everything he's uncovered, dug up, and organized for our convenience. After reading, \`it all suddenly seems so clear.' Everything from the author's point of view is valid; no more dumb questions, comments, or remarks are necessary. The analysis is right here from a fan who is more or less just like myself.He includes the best reviews of KB out there--the thoughtful and thought-provoking ones. All the facts & secrets are here, plain and simple, from reliable sources--2 annotated movies, early draft differences, and the possibilities for a future film in the series (animated prequel or sequel, not about killing Bill, obviously, but continuing the story of these characters.)The only thing I starkly disagree with in the book is one review, included for the sake of allowing a different perspective. It does raise a few good ideas, but seems basically to be a bashing of QT, his filmmaking style, Pulp Fiction, & the last chapter of KB. I may feel that he's utterly wrong, but that shouldn't suggest that I don't respect his expressed opinion and see the merit in having another POV in this book.So, this book is a treasure trove and must-read for the diehard lover of the movie. The one who loves it above all films and wants to know all they can about it. I can't say it better than reviewer Kim Morgan: \`...Dear Lord, Tarantino even uses the music of Zamfir and his pan flute. And it's haltingly emotional. What kind of crazy voodoo is this? ...it's a beautiful, brilliant, bloody valentine.\\" The author seemed to be speaking for me when he said it's the kind of movie you want to see over and over, never stop returning to, and can't help rewatching when you're only trying to look at one small part. Again in the words of Morgan: \\"..an entity all its own, recognizable, yet wholly refreshing, and by its final scene, touching...these pieces of celluloid can take on a life of their own...that kind of movie love is raised to such an extraordinary degree here that we leave the experience swooning.\\" Indeed."},{"Title":"Kill Bill: An Unofficial Casebook","review":"After having first ordered this book last September it finally arrived today and boy it is tops.

There are much better, more informative books on this subject, e.g. the Cambrige Guide to the Solar System or The New Solar System (both also from Cambridge University Press). Nevertheless, the author does a good job in telling this history in a splendid, non-technical and 'epic' language, like a great adventure starring the sun, the planets, the comets and the asteroids, from their first beginnings in a giant molecular cloud composed of interstellar dust to the tragic death of our sun after some 10 billion years (!), leaving our earth as a cold dead world (there's a very beautiful, eery, surreal painting of this blackened dead earth in this book, with the sun as a tiny white spot flickering in the dark sky). Very impressive writing, sublime at times, as if you were actually there, floating between the stars, watching the conception and development of our solar system unfolding before your own eyes. A good book for the novice, I would say, maybe best suited to the teenage cosmologists of the world. The best thing this book has to offer is the paintings, by the author himself (he is from 1968, working for Sky and Telescope, and also an astronomer), which are truly spectacular. I suspect they are the true reason why this book was written. You can get an impression of his 'glorious realist' style by visiting his website. So, buy this book if you like a good cosmological narrative and nice space artwork. Leave it, if you're more scientifically interested."},{"Title":"Wavelength Division Multiplexing (Prentice Hall International Series in Optoelectronics)","review":"Wavelength division multiplexing has become the next frontier in optical fiber communications, and has begun penetrating the world-wide lightwave network with astonishing speed. In an environment such as this, it's not too surprising to find a text that is barely six years old and already becoming obsolete. Jean-Pierre Laude's book &quot;Wavelength Division Multiplexing&quot; offers a number of other advantages, however, and will still find a useful purpose in the fiber-optic engineer's library.This book covers a broad spectrum, but many of the chapters and subject material are greatly compressed. The book's total length is less than 200 pages. This offers both advantages and disadvantages. On the positive side, this book is a useful desk reference. It has extensive references to the scientific literature, often citing much of the most important original work. In doing this it offers a fine historical perspective for wavelength division multiplexing. On the negative side (with a few exceptions) the student is left without the added benefit afforded by even the most simple and abbreviated derivations. If you understand the material a priori, this book will serve as a good refresher course. However, if you are approaching dense wavelength division multiplexing for the first time, other sources will be more useful (I suggest Decker, &quot;Fiber Optic Test and Measurement&quot; as a good introductory text).The book begins with a summary of electromagnetic propagation in optical fibers, and gives a good summary of some of the fundamental waveguide equations and a brief discussion about geometrical approximations in multimode fibers. The author takes a brief respite to describe a broad range of multiplexers and demultiplexers of various designs. The central part of the book involves considerable detail (sometimes esoteric) regarding the specific construction of grating multiplexers. This detail far exceeds that given to other multiplexer designs, which may not be surprising since this is the author's specific field of expertise.The second half of the book deals with system-level considerations, including optical amplifiers and topologies. The book ends with some broad conclusions about possibilities and future directions.Throughout the book, Jean-Pierre Laude gives frequent examples of heroic performance in work prior to 1993 when the book was published. This focus on (what was then) current performance of devices detracts, I believe, from the underlying theoretical issues that are more time invariant. From an historical perspective, however, the information is useful.The book is well organized, but very abbreviated. The subject matter could easily occupy a book with several times the number of pages. As with the rest of the book's format, the index is virtually useless, being only 1.5 pages long. Plan on using lots of page markers to make the book more useful for future reference. I also found the equations sometimes difficult to read because of the typeset.Am I glad I took the time to read the book? Yes. It only took a week, and was a worthwhile summary of what is arguably the most important technological innovation to come along since the development of lightwave communication systems.Duwayne Anderson"},{"Title":"Language in action: A guide to accurate thinking, reading and writing","review":"A Must-Read for all those interested in language and people skills.

Since most people learn visually the concept seems interesting. The best desription I can think of is a classroom in a book. If you were taking a class to teach you Dreamweaver 3 your instructor would more than likely show you screenshots to walk you through the lesson. That is what this book does, walk you through the lesson visually.Unfortunately, the visual concept seems to be light on explanations, especially when there are exceptions. Also, in a classroom setting you have the luxury to ask an instructor any questions, you can't with this book.This is a great book for the absolute Dreamweaver beginner.

If you would like to learn Dreamweaver by yourself, you should definitely check out this book first. Good Luck!"},{"Title":"Teach Yourself Visually Dreamweaver 3","review":"I HATE reading tech manuals or training manuals that are full of text and very few screen shots.

I read the book through in one day. By the end of the week-end I had created and uploaded the basic format for my web site. The visuals and step-by-step instructions make it very easy to get started. It is very basic, so if you are already fairly familiar with Dreamweaver this book would not benefit you."},{"Title":"Self Condemned","review":"While I've always been a great admirer of the eccentric painter and author Wyndham Lewis, I find most of his fiction frustratingly unsatisfying. As George Orwell wrote in 1945, \\"Enough talent to set up dozens of ordinary writers has been poured into Wyndham Lewis's so-called novels... Yet it would be a very heavy labour to read one of these books right through. Some indefinable quality, a sort of literary vitamin... is absent from them.\\"That's not the case with Lewis's oddly gripping masterpiece SELF-CONDEMNED. Here, for once, Lewis tells a story that engages your emotions and involves you with the fate of his protagonist. The plot is simple and terrible. Rene Harding, an icily forbidding Oxford Don, decides that history is bunk and, to avoid becoming entangled in the upcoming war with Hitler, immigrates to an utterly dreary Canadian town with his feeble-minded wife Hester. There they suffer extreme poverty and neglect, which Lewis depicts slowly and remorselessly, in Dreiserian detail. There is no relief for the reader, no feel-good ending, but there is genuine catharsis.Nobody would call this novel perfect. There are many aimless digressions and longueurs. But Lewis's vision is so original, and his descriptions are so vivid, I have no hesitation in giving SELF-CONDEMNED five stars. Highlights include a surreal, horrifying portrayal of a hotel burning down in the Canadian winter and creating a \\"fiery iceberg\\", a satirical encounter with one of those foolish Johnsonian professors who \\"roll towards their interlocutor heavy carefully picked words, reminiscent of those which thundered in the small talk of the formidable Lexicographer\\", and a funny scene in which Harding flings a copy of MIDDLEMARCH into the open sea.I'm so glad this great novel is now available as an eBook. Hopefully it will encourage other e-publishers to release more of Wyndham Lewis's work."},{"Title":"The Human Brain and Spinal Cord: A Historical Study Illustrated by Writings from Antiquity to the 20th Century (NORMAN NEUROSCIENCES) (Norman Neurosciences, No 2)","review":"The Human Brain and Spinal Cord es un libro que nunca deber&eacute; retirar por obsoleto del armario de la oficina.

This book is designed to plant the right seeds of belief within its readers.Faith enables an individual to get in harmony with God. It is through trusting Him that the supernatural is manifested. He emphasizes this point by encouraging us to continually fill our minds with possibility thoughts. Replace doubt with expectancy.A familiar theme that he drives home in this book and other works is that what you visualize in your mind is produced in the physical dimension. Consider the statement he makes on faith and results when he says, &quot;Think big, and powerful forces are released.&quot; Planning for inspiration is essential to the achiever's lifestyle. &quot;Travel, music, art, stimulating friends, and good books contribute to inspirational living,&quot; he reminds us.Some profound thoughts on God's perfect timing are also included.

If they ever do a movie, I hope they don't butcher it like they have other Dean Koontz books turned movie."},{"Title":"Forever Odd: A Novel","review":"The book arrived promptly and was in excellent condition. I would highly recommend this to others."},{"Title":"Forever Odd: A Novel","review":"After reading Odd Thomas, which I didn't find scary, but it was a page turner and being saddened by Odd's loss of Stormy I was hoping for another good book. This book started off slow to me. You jump in right away to searching for Danny. In the time it took Odd to leave the Grille and finally get to Danny I was bored silly. In this book Odd seems to ramble and ramble and this bored me to tears. When the villan was introduced I was seriously let down. She is just plain stupid crazy, no scary or thrilling factor here. I cannot picture the casino this all took place in, there's just too much rambling. About 3/4 of the way through this book I had to force myself to finish it. I finally was just skimming the paragraphs looking for the story tryng to skip the ramblings and paragraphs that just didn't have a bloody thing to do with the storyline. The ending was not pleasing, it ended just like the entire book was, boring. I'm very disappointed in this book and in this author. Koontz, according to my mother, is a excellent author who nevers ceases to scare the pants off her. I feel he's killed Odd in this book, enough so, I won't be reading the next in his series."},{"Title":"Forever Odd: A Novel","review":"Odd is certainly lovable and unpretentious with a pragmatic philisophical view of life and death who is also endowed with a keen sense of humor. He can see dead people and does not always know why they are there. He wants to help a close friend who has been kidnapped and whose father has been murdered. Along the path of his pursuit he visits one of his friends, P. Oswald Boone who has a cat named Terrible Chester. The description of the interaction between he and Terrible Chester and the dialogue exchanged between he and his friend is witty and entertaining. Forever Odd is thrilling and suspenseful as one wonders if he can save his friend and himself from the evil souls of the physical world and the violent anger of the spirit world."},{"Title":"Forever Odd: A Novel","review":"Although a fair story about the humble fry cook from Pico Mundo, who Koontz introduced in his previous novel, Odd Thomas (2003), Forever Odd is not nearly as compelling or imaginative. The first novel was certainly a page-turner, a modern supernatural thriller that entertained with humour, horror and a collection of simple though very likable characters. As a result, the expectations for the sequel were quite high, and unfortunately, these expectations were not met. This novel is not nearly as good as the first. Interestingly, I believe the author feels the same way, because in one of the last chapters, the character Odd Thomas comments that Ozzie, his literary friend, \\"...would have liked it less than the first, but maybe a little.\\" This about sums it up, the first novel was excellent, however, Forever Odd does not stack up, but still remains a good story.There is a gruesome murder in the neighbourhood, and the spirit of the deceased appears to Odd, directing him to the scene of the crime. In Odd Thomas's case, the dead cannot speak, but must use pantomime and emotion to communicate. When Thomas arrives, the murderer is still in the house and attacks Thomas with a Taser gun, electrocuting the boy to unconsciousness, and leaves the crime scene. There has also been a kidnapping, Danny, the son of the murder victim has been taken, and it is up to Thomas to use his gift to track the killers and save his friend.It is here that the narrative tends to bog down a bit. There are several chapters describing old drainage tunnels that Odd travels through in pursuit of the kidnappers. One or two chapters would have been enough, but Koontz's goes on and on. When Odd Thomas finally arrives at an abandoned casino, destroyed by an earthquake, the descriptions of the setting carry on for another several chapters. This became tedious, as the setting could have been described in a few words. As this reader finally decided to skim these chapters, there was a distinct impression that the author was uninspired and simply needed to fill space. After many unnecessary descriptive chapters, we at last get to meet the villains.Datura has a lot of potential - a beautiful siren with the soul of a demon. She's charming, dangerous and superficial. So much more could have been done with this character; instead the author chose to describe dark hallways, abandoned tunnels and dark basements. Datura's cohorts barely get a mention, two-dimensional thugs without a past that will do Datura's every bidding - why? The author hints at an explanation, but nothing ever pans out, and we're left wondering.Though generally an entertaining novel, in the end, however, it comes across as uninspired, lacking in enthusiasm and that energy that Koontz is known for."},{"Title":"Forever Odd: A Novel","review":"It was a good story, both uplifting and pleasant to read. Although I wouldn't say it was my favorite Koontz book, I would recomend it to any of his fans."},{"Title":"Forever Odd: A Novel","review":"I found the premise of this book completely unbelievable. I was looking forward to reading more about Odd... however I was not looking for a story that seemed so unlikely that while reading it I kept saying - is that all there is?This book I would consider fluff while the first was terrific.However, compared to other authors at least he gives us a good ride."},{"Title":"Forever Odd: A Novel","review":"As others have said, this one was't quite as good as the first, but it is still enjoyable spending time with Odd, his ghosts, and his friends.I think the weakness in this book is all the time in the tunnels. Odd is at his best interacting with ghosts and people. In this book too much time was spent just discribing the scenery. But it is still a good read!"},{"Title":"Forever Odd: A Novel","review":"Ok, don't get me wrong, I liked this book, but it doesn't hold a candle to Odd Thomas. The story wasn't as good or as horrifying as Odd Thomas. I feel the reason for that was the total exemption of the Bodachs (other than a short reference to them). To me, the Bodachs are what made the first book. That and the black room (which was totally left out of this book also). I also didn't hate Zatura like I hated fungus man. Her and her goons, I felt, were under-developed and just empty.I'm not really that worked up about it because this series is far from over. There are still things in the first book that are still unexplained. For example: why was Odd tied to two bodies and thrown into Malo Suerte Lake? What was the other time that he saw the chief sweat? (he mentions that he's only seen the chief sweat twice...and the current time was one of them)Hang in there guys. I don't think this series is over yet."},{"Title":"Forever Odd: A Novel","review":"Sequel to Odd Thomas a novel that hit the spot in reader and made them beg for more. However the parasites of the literary world dissected and analyzed this work of art and came up with what they thought made the book a success.

Of course I missed Stormy, and i hate that Dean saw the need to kill her in the first book, this \\"hero\\" should be given a chance to be happy.but anyway, everybody knows that sequels are always risky, and not always the best, unless of course you are thinking of Terminator 2.

Book one is Odd Thomas, book three is Brother Odd.So, if this book looks interesting to you, read Odd Thomas first, it will make Forever Odd that much better."},{"Title":"Forever Odd: A Novel","review":"I quite enjoyed Koontz's first Odd Thomas book, but found the sequel to be quite poor. \\"Odd Thomas\\" had a strong story, strong characters (long live Oswald Boone) and a strong ending. \\"Forever Odd\\" has none of these going for it.The first several chapters of \\"Forever Odd\\" continue in a simlar vein to \\"Odd Thomas,\\" filling in the blanks as to events in Pico Mundo and reintroducing characters such as Boone and Terrible Chester. But the book starts to turn south pretty quickly. None of the characters from the first book play any significant part in this one (barring Odd of course). Also, many of the things Odd did in the first book which I quite enjoyed were gone in this story. For example, he is no longer a fry cook, he obviously isn't in a relationship with Stormy anymore, and there is no mention of his ongoing relationship with his neighbor who fears she is no longer visible.The basic plot of \\"Forever Odd,\\" as described in the title above, is lame and hard to believe. Working from what is already a very shaky foundation, Koontz introduces one dimensional characters who are neither interesting nor thrilling. The primary victim of the book, a character suffering from a chronic illness, is so underdeveloped that I didn't really care what happened to him. In fact, I didn't much care for Odd in this book either, as I became sick of his preaching, moralizing, and his ad nauseam discussion of \\"psychic magnetism.\\"The ultimate letdown in this book is the fact Odd succeeds not by ingenuity, but by sheer luck. For the most part it is one long, slow-motion chase through a burnt out casino. Though even using the word \\"chase\\" makes it sound more exciting than it is. Mostly it is Odd sitting in one spot, offering his philosophical opinions and making flippant comments which only dilute what little thrill there was in the first place. When the villain of the book was finally conquered, I simply shook my head at how weak it was.I love Koontz, but this is the best he could come up with? Lame."},{"Title":"Forever Odd: A Novel","review":"As one of the few people who thought Odd Thomas was an average and abundantly overhyped book,I may be in the minority here.But where the first book was at least moderately entertaining and moved,this story just stagnates and progresses with the reader feeling zero concern for it's characters(after all the brittle bone diseased character is not sufficiently fleshed out to actually sympathize with him...it doesn't even seem like he fits in Odd's world...obviously a cheap ploy for the plot)and about half the book is taken up describing how dusty and dingy the burnt out casino is.When the villains are introduced and there is actually dialog between Odd and the witchy leader of the group things liven up for about... 15 pages!?! that's right there is one scene where Odd and the villainess trade quips and semi tension..then it's more wandering through sooty environs looking,seeking,SEARCHING for anything to happen.Big surprise nothing does!So in summary what we have here is a book with no plot progression hooked on the thinnest of thread using a paralyzed character as a cheap sympathy vote getter and the most anticlimatic showdown involving a deus ex machina.Devoid of the first book's eccentricity and seeming to have been produced for no reason but to make a quick buck,it seems like the plug should be pulled on the Odd Thomas character.Knowing Koontz is a cash mongrel and the zealotous zest with which his fans flock to his every writing endeavor,there will no doubt be a third book.GOD HELP US ALL!!!"},{"Title":"Forever Odd: A Novel","review":"Not a deep story line to this novel at all.

Old, new, if it's Koontz, I WANT IT! The man is that good. But I also am one to form my own opinion, and you won't always find me going along with the crowd. But I noticed a lot of things about the reviews of this. I found myself reading the reviews as I go, saying to myself one of three things: #1: \\"Hmm, yeah, this is true.\\" #2:\\"What? Get outta here!\\" and finally #3: \\"DUH!!\\" Like I see reviews saying, \\"Well, this was definitely NO Odd Thomas.\\" Let me let you in on a little secret, ok? Come a little closer. (it wasn't meant to be!) Did you read that ok? \\"Forever Odd\\" was never meant to be \\"Odd Thomas\\" all over again. Hey, you want the original, pick it up, read it again! Don't state the obvious. So that's what I'll be the first to say \\"DUH!!\\" about. My \\"What? Get outta here!\\" is a response I give to a lot of recent Koontz releases. These people who think they might deter you or myself by saying something to the effect, \\"THIS WAS HIS WORST! I'm never reading Dean Koontz again!\\" So don't read him again, and get outta here while you're at it! We'll read him if we want, and I could personally care less. If you HATE Koontz's latest stuff, OH WELL! You're not that important! I usually LOVE IT!! But then I came across a remark that I agreed with, and it goes something like this... \\"I enjoyed it, but I was expecting more. So I'm a little let down.\\" Yeah, that's kind of how I felt. Let down a little, but not beyond 3 stars. It was a decent read.I felt that this had a very good beginning. But then again, when a dead person shows up immediately, it is expected! But then you get to the thick of it. Odd's best buddy is in trouble, and it is up to Odd to save him. Yes indeed, Odd Thomas to the rescue! And so after a big hearty breakfast, his hanging out with Elvis, and his chat with Chief Porter, Odd is on a mission. Save his best buddy, Danny. Save him from the demented kidnappers, of course. And the antagonist makes quite the worthy opponent. Let's just put it this way: Unless you are Odd Thomas, you don't mess with this chick! And basically, Odd is running the rat race to save his friend's life.This was probably one of the darker Koontz novels I've picked up. But all in all, it served a purpose. I just wish like anything that it served a somewhat bigger purpose. But there is more of Odd Thomas to come in the future. Yeah, I gave this a mere 3 stars... BIG DEAL! I'm still going to read Koontz, and regardless of other opinions, he continues to be a best seller, so pooh on everybody else! I personally CAN'T WAIT for \\"Brother Odd\\" to haunt the shelves. Because I'll STILL be expecting more, and maybe then I'll get it.I'm still greatful to have spent some time with Odd. After all, it was HIM that introduced me to Koontz, not the other way around"},{"Title":"Forever Odd: A Novel","review":"Each year, Dean Koontz publishes a book near my birthday; and each year, it is at the top of my wish list. Absolutely wonderfully written book about an almost-ordinary guy. I'd like to think there is a little 'Odd Thomas' in all of us if we just open up our minds to things. As always, Dean Koontz's writing draws me into the story. It never fales to be funny, quirky, exciting, thought-provoking and leaves me with learning much more than I could have imagined. Thank you, and another 'Odd Thomas' book wouldn't be too much to ask for, would it?"},{"Title":"Forever Odd: A Novel","review":"Ignore the negative reviews, folks. \\"Forever Odd\\" is worth reading.It is rare for any sequel to live up to the original and I will agree that \\"Odd Thomas\\" is a better novel than its seqiel, but in \\"Forever Odd\\" you do not get the enjoyment of getting to know Odd and Stormy like you do in the original.What you get is another thrilling read and a return to Pico Mundo and our friend, Odd. We miss Stormy, as does Odd, but we meet his friend, Danny, and once again we get to cheer for the wonderful Odd Thomas as he rises to heroics as only he can.By all means, do not read \\"Forever Odd\\" before \\"Odd Thomas\\" or you might wonder what all the hype is about. One builds upon the other and the only way to maximize your enjoyment is to read them in order.Koontz has set up his next sequel to take place outside of Pico Mundo with Odd Thomas and Elvis set to face their next adventure. Personally, I look forward to it a great deal."},{"Title":"Forever Odd: A Novel","review":"This book is quite different from the first book that Dean Koontz wrote about Odd Thomas, which was titled with the main character's name. In the original book Koontz had to introduce Odd Thomas and his personal characteristics, including his ability to see the dead. I had to understand just who this rather unusual person was, and whether he really was as he seemed or was self-deluded. As it turns out, Odd Thomas is every bit as na?ve and unusual as he seems. Odd's characteristics are fortunate for us, because he makes for a fascinating protagonist.If you have read \\"Odd Thomas,\\" then the beginning of the book holds little confusion for you. You already know about Odd, and his observance of a dead man is, while not unusual, a portent of things about to come. Odd knows Dr. William Jessup, the dead man, and goes quickly to his former domicile on this earthly plane hoping that his friend Danny Jessup has not met a similar fate. Danny is 21 years old and suffers from osteogenesis imperfecta, colloquially known as brittle bones.Odd discovers Danny is missing, but he also encounters someone in the house. After a harrowing escape, Odd puts his special talents at work to track Danny down. A mysterious phone call from a woman with a sensuous voice confuses Odd, and us, but she seems to have something to do with the death of Dr. Jessup and the disappearance of Danny.Odd plays cat and mouse with this rather bizarre woman and her henchmen for the remainder of this tale. There came a point in this book when I was unable to put the book down because I wanted to see how Odd would escape. I was generally pleased with the ending, other than one small weakness.Sequels inevitably invite comparisons. This sequel seems to have polarized readers. I vote in favor of this novel. I thought it was interesting and fast-paced. I am unable to tell you whether you will like this novel or not. This novel was simpler than the first novel, which has made some reviewers call the writing lazy. I thought the first novel was just a little too complicated, and I welcomed a simple chase story. Perhaps these observations will give you some guidance for your own decision to buy. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Forever Odd: A Novel","review":"Two things: The end of the duel between Odd and the main villain is absolutely ridiculous. I was actually angry that it was so bad.ANDThe climax had occurred, and Odd is sitting down having a couple of beers, talking with everyone, like time doesn't exist. Wait...my supposed great friend is still locked in an elevator--ah, who cares, I'm having a beer. Ridiculous."},{"Title":"Forever Odd: A Novel","review":"I rate this book three stars simply because it is Odd Thomas and he and I have a love affair going on in my dreams. I am hoping that Jake Gillenthal plays Oddie in the movies someday. That said, this book does not compare to others in the series. If you have not read the others, please don't read this one first, as you will be scratching your head even more than those of us who know Oddie well. As others have mentioned, the characters never develop and I do wish Koontz would have spent as much time developing Annamaria, Blossom, Birdie and Haas as he did on describing the underdeath parts of the pier. I thought the Frank Sinatra ghoulie was fun but DK gave us solemn and detailed moments with Elvis so that he endeared himself to us. Sinatra was just a silly character in this book. By the end,I just wanted to shout \\"Thank you, God, for putting me out of my misery!\\" Some questions: If Annamaria has a glass stone, why not develop it's purpose? Why let the moving swing, soul snatching mirror, grate in the road, mysterious white flowers and the coyotes drop into thin air? Why does Blossom say she is meeting up with them later? Could he at least have a beginning and an end to this book before going to another? I felt like it was Part 1 of a book that should continue within the same binding. The ending was anticlimatic, but I do have a theory about the next book. Since Koontz has done a lot of writing on quantum physics in other books, I believe that Annamaria is actually Stormy's mother and is pregnant with Stormy. The last line says, \\"...and in the mother, I also saw the daughter, there above, beautiful and bright, for all eternity, her timeless light shining upon me, until one day I at last stepped out of time and joined her.\\" So, I feel Oddie will \\"time travel\\" back in the next book to be with his beloved Stormy and Blossom can return to before she was burned by her father. We shall see."},{"Title":"Forever Odd: A Novel","review":"This is an amazing book. Once I started reading this book I couldn't put it down just like all the other books by Dean Koontz. He keeps you on the edge of your seat throughout the whole book. Love the perfect balance between love and action. I think this is such a good idea. I love how Dean explains his ideas for his books thoroughly and do not just leave you hanging. Every time I finish another one of his books, he has me thinking...it could happen. Odd Thomas is my favorite character that Dean has created.

I miss stormy but I understand that she is no longer with us. I think a lot of it was the very apparent absence of the rest of the cast. I love the Chief, Ozzie and even Elvis.

I started it immediately after finishing the first book and was pulled right back in to the life of Odd. Then it all went down hill.....the character Datura could have been a great villain, but she wasn't. Parts were so confusing I don't even know what was going on, where did that mountain lion come from? Why did Robert not attack Odd? And that chase scene with Andre was right out of a corny thriller movie. It left me not wanting to go out and get 'brother odd' the next book in the now 5 book series. Maybe I'll just leave them on my wishlist and maybe I'll get them in December but I'm not seeking Odd out at this time.The first book left you wanting more Odd, wanting a movie of Odd.

I had some expectations on how the 2nd book was going to build off of the 1st books plot but that really didn't happen as i thought it would.With that said, i still enjoyed the read and i am still excited about reading the full series of Odd books. This book picks up the plot very quickly with one of the dead contacting Odd within the first few pages. The story sticks with the same plot the entire book and does not deviate at all. Odd is a tremendous character and i love the way Koontz tells his story.I am still hoping the books will develop into something more than just another tale of Odd's adventures but i also wonder if i should let go of my hopeful expectations for this charater. We shall see.Worth reading just dont set your expectations too high."},{"Title":"Forever Odd: A Novel","review":"This whole series has been a Odd exploration in the human experience. Odd Thomas in ways is the anti hero, or rather the un-hero hero. Koontz's character brings to life that humble aspect of the human experience where we transcend our own suffering and allow it to enable us to see the vulnerability of others without pity. Odd's insights into life are serious yet fascinatingly humorous. Turn by turn in Odd's world we find ourselves faced with the transcendent, yet it is not unfamiliar it is the all to real part of our human condition, death, sadness, longing, fear, a horribly torn past and lastly the bravery to be more than those and extend ourselves to the breaking point to save others.I look forward to each page, without the desire to skim past the tedious parts, because in Odd's world there is nothing tedious.Forever Odd (Odd Thomas Novels)"},{"Title":"Forever Odd: A Novel","review":"Publishers Weekly calls Dean Koontz a master storyteller, and in my view, they're right on target. I've read him for over 30 years and was hooked with \\"Whispers\\", absolutely one of the creepiest books ever written - and I mean that in a good sense. I still get goose bumps over that one.Odd Thomas is exactly what his name implies. Why? Because he can see dead people. Although they can't verbally communicate with him, Odd manages to figure out what's troubling these spirits who, for whatever reason, choose to stay behind. In this installment, Odd has taken a leave of absence from his job as a fast-food cook and is grieving the death of his girlfriend, Stormy. Elvis Presley's ghost is still hanging around and Odd can't figure out how to help him. When Odd is visited by the spirit of Dr. Wilbur Jessup, he immediately goes to his house, where Odd's best friend, Danny, lives. There, he discovers Dr. Jessup's battered body and that his friend is missing. Danny has what is known as brittle bones disease and is deformed because of this, and Odd fears for his friend's life. Suspecting that Danny's biological father has taken him, Odd employs what he calls psychic magnetism to guide him toward his friend. He is lead to a fire-damaged casino, where Odd faces off against Datura, a mentally deranged woman, and her two powerful male companions who kidnapped Danny in order to draw Odd to them. Datura is fascinated by the occult and suspects Odd is a witch doctor. Before the day is through, she means to steal his spirit.That last sentence is probably an exaggeration but that's the point I took from the book. As always, Koontz gives the reader a compelling story, which takes place over one day. His ability to vividly and realistically portray evil characters does not falter with this book. Odd is an engaging character who accepts his \\"burden\\" with grace and tries to encourage those spirits he encounters to cross over into the next life. I look forward to more in this series."},{"Title":"Forever Odd: A Novel","review":"In Pico Mundo, California lives a man with two powerful paranormal gifts. He can communicate with the dead and using psychic magnetism that can visually hone in on whoever he is looking for. One night Odd Thomas sees Dr. Jessup; he knows that the man is dead and that his adopted son Danny is in terrible danger.When he reaches the Jessup home, he finds the battered body of the doctor on the floor but Danny is nowhere around. His psychic magnetism leads him to the tunnels of the Maravilla Flood-Control Project where Danny and his kidnapper traveled. He eventually finds the trail that leads him to the destroyed Panamint Resort and Spa Casino where explosives are taped on Danny. The ringleader Datura used Danny as bait to get Odd to the casino because she wants him to produce a ghost for her. As back-up she has two strong men under her spell to do her bidding. Odd saves Danny hustling him into a safe place while he plays with these vicious hunters in the hopes that a plan for getting Danny and him free of these psychopaths will come to him.This novel takes place a year after the events in ODD THINGS and readers find the vulnerable, likeable, and emotionally drained Odd Thomas still working with the authorities to put the bad guys behind bars. The villainous woman whose beauty hides an ugly heart and soul will creep out the reader with her perceived belief that she does the right actions.

Unlike so many sequels that just don't live up to the prequel, Forever Odd might be just a little bit better than Odd Thomas. I'm always in awe of the characters that Koontz provides in his stories, and Forever Odd continues the trend.Pico Mundo, the home of Odd Thomas, isn't any different from hundreds of other small towns across the country. Well, that's not true really, Pico Mundo has Odd Thomas. Odd has two great and unusual gifts, he can communicate with dead people and he has the ability to see psychic energy. This second gift allows him to follow a \\"psychic\\" trail.Both these gifts take some getting used to. But in Forever Odd the gifts attract a truly evil character in Datura. Datura has killed Dr. Jessup and kidnapped his ailing son, Danny. Dr. Jessup's spirit has called upon Odd and Odd is quick to take up the chase. Danny is quickly found at an abandoned casino with explosives strapped to him.Forever Odd continues Koontz' string of thrilling stories begun so many years ago. One wonders witht the appearance of each new book if the well is ever going to go dry. Forever Odd shows no lessening of Koontz' story telling talents.

Master story teller"},{"Title":"Forever Odd: A Novel","review":"I gave this book 5 stars for several reasons. I have been an avid Koontz reader for some years now, and the man continually amazes and thrills me. He writes with a freshness, with a view of things so different from everyone else. He makes comparisons, descriptions of things, as no other. Writes about things that we all know and consider, but don't always find the way to express verbally. He has the power with his imagination, and words, to sweep you away to another world, the dark and hopeull world of poor Odd Thomas. Odd has to be one of Koontz's most brilliantly realized characters of all time. You fear for him, pity him, and love him for his humanity and humor. He is the ordinary, with an extrordinary gift, with a heart that is as pure as gold. If there were more REAL men in this world with the decency that is embodied in this character, I believe it would be a much better place.

Mr Koontz if you are reading this how about a sequel to \\"Dark Rivers of the Heart\\"?"},{"Title":"Forever Odd: A Novel","review":"Forever Odd rises to the 4 star level because of the character Odd Thomas and his 1st person narration. He is a unique yet believable character that has remarkable gifts...the most amazing gift may be his likability, humility and angst in the face of his otherworldly vision and intuition.Forever Odd has the same interesting, entertaining qualities of the book Odd Thomas of which this is a sequel; however, a few times it is long on descriptions of time and place. These sidetrack the story and steal from the character development and intrigue.The spiritual journeys or wanderings of Odd (koontz) are indicative of the mysteries and wonderings most readers also experience. Koontz shines a light in the darkness and imagines what may be out there.Forever Odd offers an uncomplicated but meaningful read. Koontz again provides some treasures of wisdom in one of his books. And, above all, this book is entertaining from begining to end."},{"Title":"Forever Odd: A Novel","review":"Having read Odd Thomas, I must concur with other reviewers I've read on Forever Odd in saying that I don't think this one comes close to the pure infectious quality of the original. That said, we have all had the experience of doing something that we would normally do very well, EXCEPTIONALLY well. We all have those times when even we are impressed with what we have accomplished and it is often difficult, if near impossible to reproduce the results a second time. Odd Thomas was one of those works by Dean Koontz. If reviewed in the blinding light of the original, Forever Odd seems rather drab by comparison, not because it actually is, as I felt it was a wonderfully entertaining read, but rather due to the singular greatness of Odd Thomas. So if Odd Thomas didn't exist, my review would be as follows:The book starts off a little bit slow, as do many of Dean Koontz' books, but really grabs you as the action starts to pick up. While I enjoy reading, there are few books that I \\"can't put down\\", but during the climactic last 100 pages or so of this one, that was indeed the case. Koontz does a dazzling job of painting Odd in strokes that are profoundly unique, and yet strangely identifiable. I don't know anyone who couldn't see at least a little of themselves in Odd, and mostly the parts we'd all love to emphasize. Hang in there in the beginning and you will find yourself well-rewarded by a wonderfully entertaining book with a simple, but engaging story line. I'm already waiting in excited anticipation of the third title to be released in the Odd Thomas line."},{"Title":"Forever Odd: A Novel","review":"The first \\"Odd Thomas\\" book was a great book to read, presenting a rich narrative voice, an intriguing premise, a world populated by three-dimensional characters that you cared about and a plot that had many twists and turns. In my opinion, the original \\"Odd Thomas\\" would make a great movie, and I'm sure it would be as successful at the box office as it has been at the bookstore.The follow-up book, \\"Forever Odd\\", is like an episode from an ill-fated television series that inadvisably follows the success of some movies. It simply lacks the depth and freshness of the original, probably because it focuses on the action of a single day and most of the text is used to describe action, as opposed to developing characters or ideas. Furthermore, as some other reviewers have noted, the villain is simply not interesting but rather annoying, not terrifying but tiring.I'm going to change channels now, but I'm willing to watch one more episode, if and when it becomes available."},{"Title":"Forever Odd: A Novel","review":"We are compelled to read sequels of beloved books because of the promise of further delight in a garden we have learned to know and love. It may be a gripping story cut off at a cliffhanger, where we have to learn what happens next, or it may be a character that has become as familiar to us as a close friend, with whom we are reluctant to part, and wish to quickly reassume our acquaintance.Odd Thomas is that friend. His vulnerable but powerful voice, self effacing but sure, drew me in from the beginning of the original novel. I suppose I felt privileged to be among the small circle of his friends who were in on his secret. Of course, the explosive, soul-wrenching ending of the first book was a powerful inducement to look up the next installment of the tale, but, for me, the compulsion to read Forever Odd was all about Odd himself.However, the sequel leaves me with mixed feelings. Odd is all there, for sure, struggling to hold on to his reason in the rollercoaster that is his life. The story, however, is substantially weaker and less fulfilling than the original one. Instead of a mad dash to save his hometown, frantically chasing clues and people wherever his psychic magnetism pulls him, here is an exercise in protracted solitary confinement, running up and down abandoned staircases - or back and forth lonely cold-war era tunnels - like a psychic lab rat in an IQ experiment run by a mad (if exquisitely beautiful) scientist. Almost gone is the rewarding interaction with the many friends and neighbors that richly people the first book, replaced by a stale match of wits against a handful of voodoo lunatics. I find the plot holes harder to forgive this time round - where did this brittle-boned best friend suddenly pop up from, never having been mentioned before in the well-described in-group of friends privy to Odd's talents? The ending, too, leaves us with nothing of the fist-to-the-gut impact, nor the closure, as that of the first book. The mandatory eleventh-hour surprise, shifting our perception of life and death, is served up on cue, but the dish seems cold and tasteless, a sad shadow of the original. I find myself puzzled by Odd's final decision, unclear as to where he thinks it would lead him, or how it ensues from the existential questions he raises throughout the tale.I am not sorry to have read the book. I will follow Odd wherever he may go in the future. Yet I can't help feeling dissatisfied with this imperfect vehicle that carries on his tale."},{"Title":"Forever Odd: A Novel","review":"Well, I think my first mistake was comparing Forever Odd to the novel Odd Thomas. Odd Thomas was wonderfully written and you felt for the central character who came from a rocky upbringing (mother and father had real issues)only to realize that he has a special gift, he can talk to the dead. The dead can not verbalize what they were feeling, but he seems to make sense of what they are trying to say. He can see those who are in-between, those who could not let go of this earth and move on. And that is his calling to assist them with moving from this world to the next.In the first novel, Odd Thomas, we see his close knit friends band around him as he attempts to prevent doom from visiting his small town. However, despite his abilities, he can not prevent the death of his one and only love, Stormy. Stormy's character was interesting because among a lot of things, she is a victim of child molestation and believes that she and Odd are destined to be together. She also has a 3 part ideology about why we are here in the first place. I felt like crying when I realized that Stormy had been killed, and all Odd had left from her was her furniture and a tarot card that promised that they would be together forever....or something to that effect. She moved on and didn't waiver between the two worlds.Anyway, when I heard that Forever Odd was coming out...I rushed to get it. Just image an opportunity to see Odd's friends again: the father figure and police chief who understands and appreciates his gift; his over weight novelist friend who has a suspicious cat, but is insightful nonetheless, and the colorful people in the Grill again, especially his surrogate mother. Unfortunately, I was a little disappointed with the novel Forever Odd and I really can not articulate why. I really did not like the storyline, or maybe I should say that the story was missing something. Afterall, you had everything that should have made this Koontz sequel one to remember. There was an interesting location for the novel....a burned down casino haunted with lots of restless spirits, a person who needed to be saved (and he had brittle bone disease to make it more interesting), reappearing characters that we love (novelist, chief and friend from the grill), the hope that Stormy would make an appearance and tell Odd that everything was ok (but I guess she is happy where ever she is because she did not appear), a cat who loves to pee on Odd's shoes, and some \\"seemingly\\" evil/bad people. All these things add up to success, but that is where the novel seemed to fall short....I just didn't get the evil people. There was a lot of talk about them kidnapping Odd's friend to make Odd show them spirits, but it was lacking in depth. So the lady was going around the country following supernatural phenominons in the hope of seeing dead people. So she owned a \\"sex\\" line and was wealthy from it. So she was gorgeous and her looks did not match her spirit. All this buildup, a beautiful/evil woman and two, no three evil jerks assisting her (2 zombies and a snakeman), only to have them, well die with little fanfare. No climax. And the whole scene of one of the guys sucking a little blood from the inside of the villian's hand was silly. Not to mention, the whole Elvis thing is getting a little lame.The reason I did however arrive at the rating of a \\"3\\" was because there were times in the novel that you simply teared up. The writing was so moving that you could not help but smile or cry at times. The best part of the book was when you think Odd is dead and visiting all of his friends, you realize just how special Odd really is. Odd is a true blessing and an \\"oddity\\" because he is something that few people are honest and good, accepting and understanding. He struggles daily with issues that others are not aware of and just imagine how much pressure you would feel if you were or felt you were responsible for so many lives. You would be a little lonely and sad too.At the end of this novel, I sighed, Odd seems to be headed to a monestary to think and get himself together, and we still see him leading a lonely existance at the end of the novel. And yes, there will probably be another novel Odd Thomas novel...something interesting at the monestary perhaps and yes, I will probably read it."},{"Title":"Forever Odd: A Novel","review":"I enjoyed Forever Odd as much as I did Odd Thomas.

While I was left wondering about some pieces of the story, I still must say I enjoyed the novel a lot...Odd has the special ability (or curse) of being able to see the ghosts of dead people. They can also see him, and they communicate nonverbally. Unfortunately this often places Odd at the scene of a crime before anyone else knows what happened. In this story, he's drawn to a brutal murder scene of a doctor, who's also the stepfather of his best friend Danny. Danny, who suffers from a brittle bone disease, is nowhere to be found in the house, and Odd believes him to have been kidnapped by his biological father. By using his supernatural skills, he's able to track Danny and his captors to an abandoned casino that was devastated by earthquake and fire, never to be rebuilt. Odd tracks Danny down to a 12th floor room, but his captors are a bizarre lot. The main kidnapper, Datura, is a phone-sex goddess who got to know Danny and also learned about Odd's special talents. Her two accomplices are men seemingly under her spell. She's obsessed with death and the supernatural, and has staged the whole event to lure Odd into a place where she can get him to help her accomplish her main goal... to actually *see* the ghosts of the dead, not just feel them. She is a real nut case, and Odd needs to rescue Danny without getting both of them killed in the process...Koontz has a great talent with first person dialog from his characters. I really enjoy Odd's personality and mindset, and he's one of the most realistic characters in a story that I've ever read. The whole reasoning behind Datura's obsession remained a bit of a mystery for me, as well as the way things ended. While it left me thinking \\"huh?\\", it didn't detract from the pleasure of reading the book. So while I wouldn't give it my highest recommendation, I'd still call it a book that would be worth the time spent on it."},{"Title":"Forever Odd: A Novel","review":"This is the second in the series and I must say that while being a good book to read it just didn't measure up to what I was expecting when I finished the first.

In this book Odd Thomas has to find his friend who is taken by a crazed, mad, yet attractive woman who is obsessed with the supernatural world. Odd's childhood friend had spoken and revealed to this woman Odd's closest kept secret (that he sees the dead), and she wants to see them and experience them too. Koontz clearly shows us how crazy she is by statements that leave you disgusted that such a human being could possibly exist. But more so this is a fast paced, heart-in-your-throat kind of book which never lets up to the very end. Even the way it ends it makes you understand that the story is not finished yet and so I look forward to reading the next in this series: Brother Odd."},{"Title":"Forever Odd: A Novel","review":"not his best odd thomas book does not meet up to his other odd books which i like very much this one did not have the plot or interesting characters of the others"},{"Title":"Forever Odd: A Novel","review":"I read the whole series and can not wait for the next one!!

I have recommended the series to my friends, telling them they will not be disappointed with the read."},{"Title":"Forever Odd: A Novel","review":"This is another great read by Dran Koontz. I feel like I can purchase any of his books especially this caracter line"},{"Title":"Forever Odd: A Novel","review":"I am ridiculously pleased to receive this morning, a notification from Amazon regarding the latest book in the Odd Thomas series which is waiting for me in my Mac Kindle. Oh frabjous day, calloo calay!!I rate all of the Odd Thomas Series very highly. This is a fast paced and well crafted supernatural series from renowned author Dean R Koontz. The first book in the series drew me in very quickly held me for the duration and was so enjoyable I was hungry for more at the end. Mr Koontz has created a colourful and unusual scenario, engaging characters and riveting story lines which leave the reader (provided said reader enjoys the same style of books I do) with a serious thirst to renew the acquaintance with Odd as quickly as possible.I recommend this series for the person who wants a thoroughly enjoyable read which is sprinkled with wit, quirky humour and tension, in which the goodies are brave, clever and companionable and the baddies are despicable, dangerous and dastardly. This is a series where the serious supernatural is approached in a whimsical way. Odd himself is well named and grows with each book, applying his one supernatural talent together with the usual skill set one would expect of a young relatively inexperienced person, to survive each desperate and horrific encounter.I realise these books are somewhat predictable but I cannot say with any sincerity that this bothers me. Reading is something from which I derive a great deal of pleasure and my tastes are diverse. Odd pleases me and I have never felt the hours I spend in his company have been wasted. I am going to open my Kindle now and wait impatiently for twenty seconds or so for Book 5 Odd Apocalypse to open. If you haven't yet read any of the Odd Thomas series, the good news for you is that once you finish Book 1 - and are hooked, you have four books to go before you are left in the wilderness, waiting for the next to be published. Happy reading !!"},{"Title":"Forever Odd: A Novel","review":"If you love Odd Thomas I guess you'll have to buy this book - but I warn you - don't bother!Suddenly Odd has a best friend we never heard of in the entire first book, whose life he has to save from some meglo-maniacal new-age wanna-be witch lady protected by psuedo-zombie male followers, all holed up in an old Indian casino. For some reason Odd must transverse an underground drainage system to get there, which takes up half the book, why Koontz thought this would be interesting is unknown to me. Once he gets there his psychic magnetism and numerous failures of architecture thwart his rescue attempts. Unfortunately this creates little more suspense than does 100 pages of running through drainage tunnels.This sequel totally lacks the gut-wrenching twists of fate that defined Odd Thomas, and all of the humor that made that book so wonderfully readable. The plot limps along to a boring climax involving a villain we are never frightened by. I truly enjoyed Odd Thomas, and I want more of this eccentric, haunted character, but please, let's give him something half way interesting to do!I hope the next chapter in this series, Brother Odd, will prove much more entertaining."},{"Title":"Forever Odd: A Novel","review":"Note: As you can see from both the polarizing response my review has gotten (25 helpful, 29 unhelpful) and other reviews here, this book is a love it or hate it. Ignoring for a moment that it is an Odd Thomas book and looking at it as simply a thriller, I still believe it isn't a very good novel. The writing is sloppy, the villains insipid. Deus Ex Machina abounds, the ending is melodramatic. But I can over-look most of these if the novel thrills me. Forever Odd didn't. Not once was I fearful, not once did a passage grip me and pull me along. In fact, this is one of the first Koontz books that had me skimming to get the gist of what happened.For those who don't know whether to read this or not, no one can honestly say. I, for one, did not like this book. Others here did. Personally, if you are going to read it and aren't collecting, I would wait for it to come out on paperback. Its just not up to Koontz's (or Odd's) thriller top. And I don't see why we should support weak work; particularly when Koontz is spitting out books so quickly (Husband is coming out next month) and, in my opinion, sloppily.Unhelpful votes, here I come!My Review:Two years ago, Dean Koontz released Odd Thomas and created his most memorable and lovable character ever. That story fascinated me and the characters pulled me along. It was by far one of the most endearing and tender stories, while at the same time tense and dark. When I heard that Forever Odd was coming out and would be another story centering on Odd, I was over-joyed.What pulled me along in the first book was Odd's use of language. Koontz did a great job making Odd's voice unique and the first person narrative was perfect. Odd's views, his way of looking at life was a perfect counter point to what was happening on the page. And he was a great imperfect narrator.Unfortunately, that trend and this book is not the same calibur of Odd Thomas. In fact, the only reason the story fits with Odd Thomas is because of Odd's supernatural ability. The beginning starts out great. It catches the readers up with what's happening in Pico Mundo since the sad events of Odd Thomas. It felt like coming home; Dean Koontz had created such wonderful characters the first time around that seeing them again was a treat. About 3/4s of the book, however, was a silly and insipid thriller taking place in a burned out casino. The casino wasn't scary. The villain's motive was silly, the ghosts weren't spooky. It felt like a rushed job. And, considering how many books Koontz has been publishing recently in a year (another book is coming out in May by the way), I'm wondering if he's been replaced by a machine...I felt no connection to most of the characters, there was too much repartee for no other point than to be \\"witty,\\" and, the worst offense, the plot was a retread of so many thrillers Koontz has written throughout the years. And, I might add, had done much much better with earlier.As I continued to read, I found myself flipping through pages, summing up paragraphs and basically skimming my way to the end. The thriller is, at time, intense but it also grows dreary as you realize this is all it is: a thriller dressed up and posing as another life-warming Odd Thomas story. What eventually killed it for me was that Koontz utilizes a Deus Ex Machina, not once but at least twice, and that just soured everything that followed. It just wasn't very exciting.By the time I got to the ending with its insipid attempt at being another \\"life-altering\\" and poignant ending that Odd Thomas has, I was ready to be done. One thing I have noticed with Koontz is that he tends to end his novels with a sappy or \\"poignant\\" cathartic moment. In Odd Thomas, it works and affected me in the way Koontz wanted it to. In Velocity it was fairly successful. In this book, I just shook my head.What really brought this book down to below the average rating for me was expectations. Odd Thomas, the book and character, stands as Koontz's best in my opinion, not only in characterization but also in the three important \\"P's\\": plot, pacing and prose. It included characters you genuinely care about, thrills that belied the light tone the imperfect narrator kept, and a plot that kept turning and winding. Koontz took an idea that was tired after Sixth Sense and created a world that jumped off the pages with heart and panache. Then to turn around and release this book is, to me, a mockery of Odd Thomas. Nothing in this book worked as intended for me. From the lazy thriller aspect to the ending that tried to be a \\"twist\\" like the first book's, nothing worked. The ending was a lip curling attempt to trick the readers; whereas the first book's ending genuinely worked to provoke catharsis, this one made me shake my head. I was so excited and thrilled to see another Odd Thomas book and then was sorely disappointed at what was given. Here's hoping that if Koontz does write a next book, he will keep more in line with the first instead of dressing up a thriller in tones of Odd.Not only not up to the first book, Forever Odd isn't up to par with most of Koontz's thrillers."},{"Title":"Forever Odd: A Novel","review":"Odd Thomas was perhaps one of my favorite lead characters in ANY recent book I've listen to (Yes, I'm an audio book fan). The first book was awesome. You really got to know Odd and cared for him and what happens to his friends. The fact that Odd sees ghosts and more hilariously, talks to Elvis, was very compelling to hear. Great concept. But......and I hesitate to say this, only because I know people don't like to hear that one of their favorite authors has dropped a stink bomb...........but Dean has. And boy, does this one stink. ALL the things I loved about the first book (his relationship with Stormy, the black shadowy ghost things (can't remember their names) that come out when bad things are going to happen, his many interactions with Elvis, bumping into dead people......etc) are ALMOST non existent in Forever Odd. It's like he decided to take everything that was great in the first book and throw it out the window. Which really @#$%^ me off, because the first book was so damn good.In Forever Odd, you just don't CARE what happens to Odd or Dr. Jessup's son he's trying to save. Which leads me to another problem with the book. Dr. Jessup's son has brittle bone disease and has had it most of his life. Dean goes on to give several examples of how Danny broke bones throughout his life. One of which was when he broke his wrist by flicking playing cards. Now, I don't doubt that that can happen, but if he's THAT brittle, how could he have been kidnapped? I mean, the struggle alone would have crushed him.What happens in the end to the kidnapper is ridiculous and completely uneventful. But what happens to Odd and where he ends up is even WORSE.I know that many people will most likely click on the button that says this review was not very helpful. But I truly believe they will do that because it isn't a favorable review. No one likes to hear that a book they've been looking forward to, isn't good. And this one isn't. As they say \\"It is what it is..........\\" Sorry to be the bearer of bad news, but don't shoot the messenger, please.Will I buy the next Odd Thomas...........probably. But Dean better bring back Elvis and a compelling plot like the first book, or...................Elvis will most certainly be LEAVING THE BUILDING for this reader."},{"Title":"Forever Odd: A Novel","review":"For the second time, Koontz has taken a character from one of his novels and featured that same character in a second book--here, it is the title character from 2003's Odd Thomas. Like the young boy in the movie The Sixth Sense, Odd sees dead people. Often, he is surprised when someone whom he thought was still alive and kicking--in this case, his friend and neighbor, Dr. Jessup--silently and mysteriously shows up in his apartment, clearly no longer of this world.Forever Odd details Odd's personal quest to rescue Dr. Jessup's son, his childhood friend, Danny. Fearing that police involvement would result in Danny's immediate death, Odd decides to go it alone, relying solely on his own supernatural resources for guidance. Thus much of the novel is devoid of dialogue, instead featuring Odd's internal conversations. Here Koontz sometimes has the tendency to wax poetic, lapsing into such frequent comments about human nature that I found this to be a bit more annoying than in his previous works. Still, Koontz retains his uniquely engaging storytelling style, and although I think this is far from his best work, his fans are likely to find something of value here. Overall rating: three and a half stars (rounded up to four for amazon)."},{"Title":"Forever Odd: A Novel","review":"I must be the odd one out; but, I loved this book. Forever Odd was fun to read; that's my barometer of a good book. Forever Odd was nonstop suspense in the most interesting settings: the underground waterway, the old hotel, the crawl spaces under the building. I could picture Odd in all of these scenarios and I liked seeing how he planned to escape from each dangerous predicament he encountered. The villains were more believable to me than that in Brother Odd. We can all relate on some level to the selfishness and materialism that is Datura.Maybe most readers want a book with more dialogue, more philosophy, more long, drawn-out boring conversations. Forever Odd is not the book for these people. This book is for someone who wants fun escapist fiction in which Odd faces perilous situations and uses his wits to come out on top. While not as epic as Odd Thomas, this was a worthy addition to the series."},{"Title":"Forever Odd: A Novel","review":"Koontz could be considered to writing what Kinkade is to art. He is formulaic in all of his writings that I've ever read. There's always a girl in trouble and there's always someone there to rescue her. Despite this I still enjoy reading his novels because every so often something he writes really grabs me. Odd Thomas was that book, and character, as of late.When I originally read Odd Thomas I was drawn into the book by the central character. But it wasn't only the central character, Odd, but the assortment of secondary players that also drew me into the story. By the time I finished reading the book I felt I should have paid more for it.Sadly, Forever Odd is not the first book. I don't like to draw comparisons (OK, I really do but I'm trying to make this even more believable) but I think this book is suffering the Matrix complex. You know? The complex where sequels don't really fit that well to the original seemingly pushed out quickly and with not much regard for the first happening.I wanted to love this book, desperately so. I wanted this to be something other than the sophomoric slump for Odd. But it wasn't. The story's side characters aren't as capturing this time and the central plot isn't really worth the character that was originally written.If you're a die hard Koontz fan then this book is for you. If you're a mediocre fan that was hoping for the second coming of Odd Thomas this isn't the book for you."},{"Title":"Forever Odd: A Novel","review":"First of, I loved \\"Odd Thomas\\", and Odd was set up as a very interesting character.As soon as I knew Forever Odd was coming out, I got really excited, asking my local bookshop when it would arrive.I started reading it and quickly got very disappointed.There are some nice scenes, and it was great to catch up with some of the characters from \\"Odd Thomas\\", but there was soo much padding in this book.I kept thinking, ok interesting initial idea, but what is the story really going to be about, then 2/3 of the way through the book I was thinking, \\"is this it?\\".I expected so much more, its like getting a supreme pizza, opening the box and finding that while it is the same size as the previous pizza your ordered, its practically all dough and they pretty much forgot the toppings.Dean, you have to better."},{"Title":"Forever Odd: A Novel","review":"This book fell horribly short of the first (Odd Thomas). Koontz is a great writer but in this sequal he was (IMO) looking to capitalize on the success of the first and dumped this one on the fans. His first book kept me captured and I couldn't wait to finish it.. this one was predictable and made me NOT want to finish it. The lack of any real hook for the readers, the lack of any investment (on Koontz part) in the secondary characters just proves that his heart was not in this book.Don't buy this book ...unless you can pick it up at a garage sale for 50 cents."},{"Title":"Forever Odd: A Novel","review":"First off, the obvious disclaimer: if you haven't read \\"Odd Thomas,\\" you should read it first, because this book will make more sense if you do, and because this book gives away much of the plot of \\"Odd Thomas.\\"The best thing about \\"Forever Odd\\" is that, by and large, it moves quickly; it can be read in one (somewhat longish) sitting. It's a well-told scary story.In a larger sense, though, the word \\"story\\" sums up my reservations about this book: especially given the events in \\"Odd Thomas,\\" this book doesn't pack quite the emotional wallop that the first book does. That isn't to say that there are no surprises in this book (there's a big one near the end), but that, all in all, I just wish there had been a bit more substance. [To give one minor example, while Koontz tells us that the villain's name is probably one not given at birth, he never says *how* the villain came to choose that name. (For those who are curious, I've put a note in the forum below.)]So, if you're a Koontz fan (or a fan of Odd), will you enjoy this book? Almost certainly. Would I read a third installment in this series? Yes."},{"Title":"Forever Odd: A Novel","review":"Dean Koont's character Odd Thomas is a wonderful creation. His introduction in \\"Odd Thomas\\" was extremely well done. \\"Odd Thomas\\" is a must read, whether you are a Koontz fan or not (especially if you are not--you won't be disappointed).With that said, you'll most likely be ambivalent (at best) about \\"Forever Odd\\". There's no new ground covered here. In fact, one of the great strengths of \\"Odd Thomas\\" is so blatantly missing--decent characters--that I can scarcely recommend the book at all. The villain is simply uninteresting, the circumstances uncompelling, and the setting...well, who cares?The book is not without any merit, though. There is somewhat a surprise in the ending, which alludes to the meaning of the title and a little more of the town's history is revealed, but beyond that, it's very boring and (even within the realm of fiction) simply unlikely. \\"Unlikely Odd\\" might have been a better title, all things considered.I'm being generous with 3 stars just because I do like the Odd Thomas character a lot and want to see more books about him. But not books like this one.

In fact, most times being limited to a five star rating feel like a gross injustice to his superb writing skills.However, I found myself a little dissapointed in this second series in Odd Thomas' life. Don't get me wrong. It's a fabulous book and the last third of the book had me so entrapped, about fifty pages from the end I sneaked a peek at my alarm clock and was amazed to see that three hours had passed since I plopped down to read.That being said... I found that Koontz had Odd running away with his thoughts a little too much that I found myself doing something I've never done with one of his novels. Skimming.Still, 'Forever Odd' was fantastic. I found myself laughing to myself many times at his wittyness and even laughed outloud a couple times. Reread a few passages more than once and fell in love with Danny (you'll see).I dunno.

In this new book we again take up the story of Mr. Thomas, fry cook extraordinaire, potential tire salesman. This humble young man has the gift of seeing the dead. While they cannot talk to him, he talks to them and helps them move on. Odd is a truly good man, who believes that we all live three lives: This life is a boot camp; the second life we go to is a life of service. The third and final will be our reward.

A good story with an unexpected and touching end. More Odd please, Mr. Koontz!"},{"Title":"Forever Odd: A Novel","review":".....here we have a sequel that continues to expand and grow from where the original novel left off.Koontz has a knack for creating engaging leads in his stories that nuture a life of their own and draw us into their worlds. Characters that are all to familar and human be they Jimmy Tock in \\"Life Expectancy\\"....Deucalion from the \\"Frankeinstien\\" series....Billy Wiles from \\"Velocity\\".....Ethan Truman from \\"The Face\\"....Chyna Shepherd from \\"Intensity\\" and on and on. Perhaps preminent among these is the Odd one himself.So disarmingly engaging and self effacing as he was in \\"Odd Thomas\\" this prose once again mines the familar rich vien with our humble hero as the normal guy who is far more than he initially appears surrounded by a rich supporting cast including the return of the ghost of Elvis.The surprises continue to astound and the \\"odd's\\" are stacked in the chillingly evil villan Datura's favor yet despite all this and the tragedy that he has had to endure Odd finds ways to persevere.While it lacks the tragical gut wrencher that followed the death of Stormy from the original this story has it's own strengths and in some fashion I think it's important that the emotional well was less plunged this time around. Had Koontz gone along the same path this would have appeared more a remake than something fresh.It's still amazing that such a non discriept little desert town as Pico Mundo should be the hotbed of so much otherworldly activity one senses that it has more to do with Odd's presense there than the town itself.For those not familar with Odd prepared to be delighted and resist as you may the urge to pick up it's predecessor I suspect the lure of more Odd will be too great. Here's hoping there is a third installment to follow."},{"Title":"Forever Odd: A Novel","review":"I am new to the Odd Thomas series and I am loving it!

He created a really nice new friend for Oddy and a really creepy new character for Odd to \\"fight against\\".

The second book in the Odd Thomas book by Dean Koontz felt like an incredibly good TV show, where as the first book felt like an Oscar winning movie.In FOREVER ODD, Odd is awakened by by Dr. Wilbur Jessup (his ghost actually) and drawn to the house of Dr. Jessup. Odd's best friend Danny was Dr. Jessup's stepson has been burdened by \\"brittle bone\\" disease since birth. Odd soon finds that Dr. Jessup had been brutally murdered and Danny missing. After consulting with the Chief of Police, Odd begins a quest to track down Danny and tackle whatever evil awaits. And thats the story. We follow Odd in his chase which goes through the underground flood tunnels of Pico Mundo and then to an old Indian casino that was ravaged by fire a five years ago.The burned casino is a great setting, and there are some great observations by Odd. The book also sets up a great transition to the next book in the series (which I plan to read soon), BROTHER ODD. The villian is a young woman named Datura. She is beautiful but has been captured by the dark occult. She believes Odd and only Odd can summon the spirits and allow her to actually see a ghost.FOREVER ODD is a good book and should be read by fans of Odd Thomas. It should not be read first though. This book goes into Odd's powers a little bit, but doesn't include the awe and wonder that permeated ODD THOMAS. That's the problem with most sequels. It is almost impossible for them to capture the magic that made the first book so wonderful and in need of a sequel. So, don't expect the same thrill you got out of reading ODD THOMAS, but do expect a great story and a continuation of a great character."},{"Title":"Forever Odd: A Novel","review":"I have read the following novels by Dean Koontz: FOREVER ODD, BROTHER ODD, FEAR NOTHING, SEIZE THE NIGHT, FALSE MEMORY, ICEBOUND, DRAGON TEARS, BAD PLACE, INTENSITY, STRANGERS, MIDNIGHT, HIDEAWAY, STRANGE HIGHWAYS, SOLE SURVIVOR and FROM THE CORNER OF HIS EYE. I have also read LIFE IS GOOD: LESSONS IN JOYFUL LIVING by his dog, Trixie.In my experience, I grow weary of reading the work of a single author. For example, the novels of Clive Cussler and Patricia Cornwell have become SO predictable, I've stopped reading them. I just completed a Cornwell novel and disliked it so much, I will not write a review of it nor will I read her again.* I have to say that Koontz's work does NOT fall into that category. As with Cornwell and Cussler, I have read many of Koontz's novels, but have noticed that his storylines progressively improve and remain unpredictable.FOREVER ODD and BROTHER ODD share the grandest characteristic of excellent novel writing. Both skillfully portray the improbable as probable. In a very convincing manner, Koontz is able to lay out rules for the emergence of supernatural events. The actions of ghostly figures are limited by the functional equivalent of the laws of thermodynamics. As a result, confidence intervals can place both limits and variation on ghostly activities. Odd Thomas' interaction with the supernatural is like playing Black Jack.The Odd Thomas series is Koontz at this best. I, of course, read them out of order. FOREVER ODD introduces BROTHER ODD. Thus, read them in that order. Based on reading FOREVER ODD, I believe a third ODD novel exists. I get the impression that another novel introduces FOREVER ODD. If you know of such a novel, please let me know by writing in the comment section.Happy reading!* This is not to say that Cussler and Cornwell are bad writers. For me, because I've read them so much, their writing has become monotonous."},{"Title":"Forever Odd: A Novel","review":"I enjoyed Odd Thomas, the first novel in what is becoming a franchise for the author. I consider it one of Koontz's better efforts, but Forever Odd is no Odd Thomas. It's a tedious, sometimes painful read.The biggest let down in Forever Odd is the cartoon-like villain. She's annoying, not the least bit interesting, and more pathetic than she is menacing.The plot itself is thin. Koontz stretches things out, giving us more detail than we need about the tunnel system beneath Pico Mondo and loading his sentences with as many adverbs and adjectives as he can. Odd himself was endearing in the first novel but in Forever Odd his musings get too preachy for my taste. The life affirming ending was meant to be poignant but I found it sappy.And was Koontz serious when he killed his villain by random cougar attack? A cougar? Really Dean? That's the best you could come up with?Sometimes Koontz hits, sometimes he misses. Forever Odd is a miss."},{"Title":"Forever Odd: A Novel","review":"In Forever Odd, one of Dean Koontz's most endearing characters returns to face new perils, following the trail of a kidnapped friend and dicing with death in a derelict gambling resort. Odd Thomas is his gentle, quirky self once more, communing with the ghost of Elvis and finding himself terrorised by scary cat Terrible Chester. I found this latest outing good but not quite as gripping or significant as the first novel, with a villainess who is more frivolous than menacing. Hopefully, the bad guys will be back on form in Brother Odd, the next book in this intriguing series."},{"Title":"Forever Odd: A Novel","review":"Since Koontz crossed the threshold from telling horror stories into \\"horror with spirituality\\" stories, I've been tolerant because he spins such a great tale.But I've noticed since at least the late '90's Dragon Tears novel that Koontz has interjected a lot of his personal moral and politcal views into his tales and when he does, he lessens the value of his story. I'm fine with his views, but I don't want to be lectured on how lousy the hollywood system is, or how bad the morals of our nation are.This story really fell short of the first Odd Thomas story because Koontz ran off the rails so many times when he went on a long winded rants against our society, hollywood, materialism and modern religion.As much as I love the characters that Mr. Koontz creates (Odd Thomas is close to the top of the list), I find myself occasionally echoing the voice Neil Sloan, Molly's husband from \\"The Taking\\", when he said to a television that was showing the worst of humanity, \\"That's not all we are.\\"Mr. Koontz, you can moralize, I don't mind, it's good to think and reflect, but if you keep pounding away at it with a hammer, instead of a fine scalpel, this reader will hand off your next novel to someone else as I walk of the plane.And give up on the \\"gas jet blue\\" eyes. You've used it in too many books. Frequent Koontz readers will know what I am talking about."},{"Title":"Forever Odd: A Novel","review":"If you liked the first book, youre going to love this one."},{"Title":"Forever Odd: A Novel","review":"ODD THOMAS was such a great character/book that I rank it with John Irving's A PRAYER FOR OWEN MEANY and Koontz's own WATCHERS.But this follow-up is HEAVILY PADDED and really not very interesting or compelling. Pages and chapters are filled with Odd on his journey, climbing down into sewers, up and down elevators, etc.It reminded me of Koontz's MIDNIGHT when the entire novel was a chase. Odd Thomas is a wonderful character and I think the book in which he made his debut may become a classic because it had so much going for it and a true \\"whallop!\\" of an ending.This follow-up is a pale immitation."},{"Title":"Forever Odd: A Novel","review":"Seems like the pace of the Odd Thomas series is slowing down a bit. Odd is quite a likeable character and the original novel, Odd Thomas, is quite recommendable if you haven't yet read it. This sequel, however, seems to drag on in places and is somewhat less compelling and enthralling than its predecessor.All in all, the novel (or the audiobook) is sufficiently entertaining to warrant the price tag. It's readable in a day or listenable in a nice long meandering weekend drive. Just don't expect the book to knock your socks off with new twists in Odd's life or with some of the gripping thriller genre material that Koontz was known for in his earlier years."},{"Title":"Forever Odd: A Novel","review":"Ever since Dean Koontz jumped on the religious kook train, his writing has sadly, gone downhill. No longer do his books attempt to thrill and amaze the reader but instead are obvious and blatant attempts to hammer his particular view of the world and his religious convictions home. He has stopped writing mystery and started writing proselytizing propoganda. Gone are the thrills that shone in Lightning, Watchers, etc. I used to enjoy his books but I find I can't abide his preaching. This was the absolute last book of his I will ever bother to try suffering through."},{"Title":"Forever Odd: A Novel","review":"I can't say that I like all of Koontz's books, in fact just the opposite is true, I only like a small percentage of his books... i.e. Watchers, Sole Survivor, From the Corner of His Eye ... BUT, Odd Thomas was a complete surprise ... I Loved this audiobook and listened to it several times... Needless to say I was delighted when I saw this sequel. I couldn't wait for it to arrive and I WASN'T DISAPPOINTED. If you never read any of Koontz's other books.... every fiction reader owes it to themselves to get these books.For those who have read Odd Thomas, this story starts shortly after the end of Odd I and continues on with a an all new Odd story with several of the Odd I characters continuing here ... the police chief, the fat independently wealthy and unemployed philosopher, the philosopher's nasty cat chester, the owner of the diner where Odd works (well actually he doesn't work in this story because he's still on grieve leave from book one) and OF COURSE, Elvis is back, it looks like there will be a future Odd III as Koontz wove him into the story in a way to make him Odd's most frequent companion and alarm bell, and it looks to me like he will be back to lead Odd on at least one more adventure. The one sad thing is that apparently Stormy, Odd's only and forever true love .. dies. Poor Odd, for him, there will never be another Stormy in his life.If you love fiction like I do, DON'T MISS THIS SERIES EVEN IF YOU DON'T LIKE KOOTNZ, you'll be missing a truly captivating character and one of the all time BEST fiction series. Even if Koontz never writes another Odd book, he will always show up on my favorite author list because of only these books ... for me he doesn't have to write any others."},{"Title":"Forever Odd: A Novel","review":"If you are a Dean Koontz fan, ( I have no idea who John Hill is) you will love this book. If you read the book Odd Thomas, you will definetely want this one. Even if you did not read Odd Thomas this is a must.This character captures your heart and imagination . This unique hero living in a small desert town has a duty in life to do the right thing...It is hard to imagine when reading of Odd Thomas that he isn't real, he so becomes a part of your life, long after you turn the last pageTop of the line for Dean Koontz!!!"},{"Title":"Forever Odd: A Novel","review":"I bought this for my wife. It completes the series which she really enjoyed. She says dean koontz ranks right up with stephen kings work."},{"Title":"Forever Odd: A Novel","review":"I normally like a Dean Koontz book for a literary roll in the hay. They usually leave me thrilled and/or amused. FOREVER ODD made me wonder why I had invested the time when I could've romped around with Stephen King."},{"Title":"Forever Odd: A Novel","review":"Forever Odd, without a doubt, was one of the most satisfying sequels that I have ever had the honor of reading. With each page I find myself falling more in love with Odd Thomas. In today's literature there's not another hero that can compare with Odd...except for maybe Harry Potter."},{"Title":"Forever Odd: A Novel","review":"If you haven't read Odd Thomas then don't read this one yet! You must read them in order to truly understand. The Odd Thomas series is wonderful. I love this series. I am in the middle of Brother Odd right now which is the last of the 3. Dean Koontz is an amazing writer - he can be so many different styles. FOREVER ODD IS GREAT!"},{"Title":"Forever Odd: A Novel","review":"It was great to get back in Odd's head but I found that this read ended a bit too soon. The first book wove multiple story lines for Odd but this one was singularly focused. Regardless, I enjoyed it and look forward to the next."},{"Title":"Forever Odd: A Novel","review":"This is a great sequel to the first one \\"Odd Thomas\\"....typical good book from Dean Koontz - I definitely recommend this book & the author....If you aren't already a Koontz fan - you will be - just be sure to read \\"Odd Thomas\\" first!!"},{"Title":"Forever Odd: A Novel","review":"I bought this book the day it came out and read it within a few hours. It lacked the emotional impact of Odd Thomas, but that's to be expected. There's not much that can live up to the original. Supposedly there is going to be a third. If so, I can't wait!"},{"Title":"Forever Odd: A Novel","review":"Somewhere in Dean Koontz's maturation as a writer, he has evolved from a writer of suspenseful horror fiction to something far greater. The literary elite may disagree, but this reader would confidently lay a page of this book side-by-side with a page from any of today's critically-acclaimed literary fiction and argue that the precision of word choice, and poetry of expression, would more than hold its own. So too would the thematic content of the book, particularly the case he makes for envy as man's original sin, as well as the redemptive power of stoicism and unwavering honesty that Odd displays in the face of intense emotional suffering.The downside of Koontz's maturation is that fans of his older stuff may feel that the greater emphasis on character and theme in \\"Forever Odd\\" comes at the expense of plot, complexity and, well, overall creepiness. While this novel's plot could have been more developed, the horror octane is of an unquestionably high grade. Indeed the earthquake-and-fire-ravaged Indian casino that serves as the setting for much of the book generates a fright level that rivals the hotel in \\"The Shining.\\" And the spooks (live, dead, and undead) who haunt it would hold their own against Mr. King's Overlook Hotel denizens.So if you're looking to be scared, but without fear of being guilty of literary slumming, \\"Forever Odd\\" (and its predecessor \\"Odd Thomas\\") will serve you as well as anything since Edgar Allan Poe."},{"Title":"Forever Odd: A Novel","review":"When Odd Thomas wakes up from sleep, there is usually a dead person waiting in his bedroom. This story is no different, as a victem of vicious killers, seeks Odd's aid to save his kidnapped son. Only the killers want and expect Odd to follow. They know about his secret--seeing dead people--and lay a trap for him. His quest to rescue the son of the dead father from psychotic kidnappers will keep you turning pages.That said, this story did not hold my expectations. The main character, Odd Thomas, works completely alone. Koontz has had successes with such loner heros, such as Seize the Night and Fear Nothing--both classic thrillers. If you like such stories, you will enjoy this one, unless...Having read the previous book, Odd Thomas, I was looking forward to revisiting the supporting cast. They have very minor page time.Do not expect intense supernatural thrills. There are no Bodoxes to instill terror of impending disaster, and sadly, Elvis plays a very minor role. Even Elvis is only a cameo apperance, which for any one who read the first book may likely be disappointed in the change, or at best disconcerted by the change in focus of the story construction.The suspense is largely of the mundane variety, though interesting. The story is a worthy read, but the ending is not as fulfilling as the first book."},{"Title":"Forever Odd: A Novel","review":"I actually wasn't terribly impressed with Odd Thomas, the original novel. It wasn't bad, but I didn't think it was too great either. So I was very pleasently surprised by Forever Odd. The storyline is very original. There is plenty of action. There are some social issues brought to light in cool and entertaining context, the way only DK can do. This made a great read (or should I say \\"great listen\\") on a long drive. I hate spoilers, so I won't tell you what the book is about, or what's going to happen, except that there will be some interesting twists in the story. Give this one a try. I'd give this one 4.5 starts - not Koontz's best, but pretty darn close."},{"Title":"Forever Odd: A Novel","review":"\\"When I was a kid my parents moved a lot, but I always found them.\\" Take one part Stephen King, one part Rodney Dangerfield, and one part...Dean Koontz, and you get Forever Odd. This is a follow up of the book, Odd Thomas. I haven't read Odd Thomas, and my sense is that it is necessary to read it before reading Forever Odd. Obviously, Thomas has strange \\"gifts\\", a quirky sense of humor, and an important link with the chief of police (he has the chief's phone number speed-dialed into his cell phone). This character development must have occurred in Forever Thomas, because Koontz just assumes this all makes sense in Forever Odd. It doesn't.Koontz writes very well, and the action moved along at a fast pace. The first chapter is an attention grabber, but after a while Thomas' nonchalance with seeing \\"the spirit world\\" and being led to his captive friend makes you take a step back and say, \\"Say what?\\" Again, this must make better sense after reading Forever Thomas.This is not the best stand-alone book. And the cougar scene? What in tarnation was a cougar doing there? Even in a book that depended on the supernatural, that was a stretch!This may sound overly critical. I did read the book, and enjoyed it. But I do think Koontz could have done better. I expect books to be of stand-alone quality."},{"Title":"Forever Odd: A Novel","review":"This is the first Dean Koontz book I have read, decided to finally try some books on CD for my daily comute and this one had me looking forward to my comute to hear what would happen next. Can't wait to go back and read Odd Thomas to find out what the references were to in Forever Odd."},{"Title":"Forever Odd: A Novel","review":"Dean Koontz has created a likeable, amazing character in fry cook Odd Thomas. Odd, his real name, has the ability to see ghosts and communicate with them. It's not uncommon for him to sit around his apartment and commune with Elvis, for example. But this book begins with a friend's father showing up, as a ghost, which of course begins this terrible tale of murder and freakiness.Using his supernatural magnetism, Odd discovers his friend, who is fragile and disabled, has been kidnapped. At first he works with the police, but ultimately he uses his own special skills to try to save his friend.Along the way, he meets very strange characters, both ghostly and of this world. The one who has masterminded the crime against his friend is a very sick person whose ideas and actions help create a gripping, if twisted, story.Forever Odd is more than a ghost story, more than a mystery. A reader needs to be willing to let Koontz weave his tale without a terrible amount of skepticism. If one goes along with the crazy story, this book is a thought-provoking, entertaining and thrilling look into a world most people will never know.This book may not be for everyone, but it is a quirky, entertaining read for those who can open their mind to new possibilities."},{"Title":"Forever Odd: A Novel","review":"I am seven chapters in and I love it. Although the reviewers say you don't have to, I would read ODD THOMAS first. You'll enjoy that book tremendously and this one will make sense faster. You'll appreciate Odd much more. You will want to read the other one anyway if you finish this one first. You'll want more of this incredible character, so why meet him as we did and enjoy him from the beginning. You won't regret it.*******I must stop getting excited and entering reviews before I finish the book. I was SO desperate for more Odd Thomas. This started out interesting, but sagged about 1/3 of the way and I just tossed it. Fortunately, Brother Odd is MUCH better. If you are a die-hard fan, you may enjoy this, but be warned."},{"Title":"Forever Odd: A Novel","review":"Okay, it wasn't as good as the previous 'Odd' novel, but never the less it was quality writing. It doesn't move at a rollercoaster pace, but the authors skill with words and ability to involve the reader keeps Koontz in the game.The novel did have a tendency to be a bit wordy, and it was a fairly quick read, but overall it was a very satisfying story. I do look forward to his next novel in this series.Recommended."},{"Title":"Forever Odd: A Novel","review":"Odd Thomas is one of my favorite characters and I was glad to see him return. In this outing, one of Odd's friends is kidnapped and Odd travels alone to a deserted hotel/casino in the middle of the desert to rescue him. There is plenty of action in the beginning and the end of this one, but the middle tends to drag a bit with Odd's rambling introspection and Koontz's lofty prose. I missed the characters of Pico Mundo and Odd's interaction with them. The evil characters Odd must deal with were not of the quality I'm used to from Koontz. The premise is a good one and it's an entertaining read, but not quite as good as the first Odd Thomas story. I liked Koontz's dedication to his golden retriever, Trixie. My Golden retriever gives me many opportunities to laugh too. I would welcome a story from Koontz featuring a golden retriever in a heroic and/or clownish role. If Odd Thomas returns (and I hope he does) he should really have a dog at his side."},{"Title":"Forever Odd: A Novel","review":"Odd Thomas is a unique kind of guy. Sure, he's a fry cook in a small California desert town, and he's good-looking in a nineteen-fifties-surfer sort of way. But Odd is truly odd: he sees dead people. Whenever he can, he tries to help them.So when his best friend's father, Dr. Jessup, appears in Odd's apartment in the middle of the night (in spiritual form), Odd cannot help but get invovled. Jessup has been brutally murdered...and his son Danny kidnapped. As Odd races to find and save his friend, he finds himself up against the ultimate human evil: pure, unrelenting, calculating insanity, and a villainess who will stop at nothing--absolutely nothing--to get what she wants. And what she wants just may be Odd...dead.\\"Forever Odd\\" is a superb sequal to \\"Odd Thomas.\\" Sure, it's not quite as unique--sequals rarely surpass their predecessors--but it's still Dean Koontz. Koontz is, if nothing else, the unquestioned master of suspense. \\"Forever Odd\\" rolls along like a rollercoaster, taking you from one scene to the next in a breathless rush. It's funny, it's scary, it's quirky, it's thought-provoking, it's exciting...it's Dean Koontz at his rip-roaring, heart-wrenching finest."},{"Title":"Forever Odd: A Novel","review":"The first half ropes you in...the second half is boring to the point that I had to skim through it. Don't waste your time."},{"Title":"Forever Odd: A Novel","review":"I have never read Odd Thomas but probably, because of this book, I never will. This book was so predictable, boring and with no real plot that I rather read Teen Magazine before I read any other book from Koonz."},{"Title":"Forever Odd: A Novel","review":"I am a big fan of Koontz's later work. Forever Odd is every bit as good as the first installment."},{"Title":"Forever Odd: A Novel","review":"I enjoyed \\"Odd Thomas\\" so much that I was very much looking forward to Mr. Koontz' next Odd endeavor. Certainly, it's not as good as the first. The main disappointment was knowing everything about the bad guys before I was half-way through. It was also considerably darker than the first, with Odd's constant referrals to his dead fiancee, and, though Odd showed his usual joie de vivre, his final decision just didn't make a lot of sense. One element of this sequel that gained points (from me anyway) was that it could stand on its own, without the necessity of knowing the events of the first. Certainly, there were a lot of references, but nothing that relied too much on the first. The setting of the abandoned hotel was great, though he spent a little too much time in the sewers. No, not as good as the first, but I'm a Koontz junkie and I always look forward to his next project. The Koontz book that disappointed me the most was \\"Cold Fire\\", and \\"Dragon Tears\\" wasn't that great, either, but I'm compelled to take the good with the bad. I know he'll come up with a \\"Mr. Murder\\" or \\"Dark Rivers of the Heart\\" to enthrall me all over again."},{"Title":"Forever Odd: A Novel","review":"At first, I was inclined to agree with the reviewers who were disappointed with this follow-up to Odd Thomas, but I believe this book is neither better nor worse than any other in the series. The real key to the popularity of Odd Thomas really isn't the plots, it's the characterization and in this installment, Odd's every bit as endearingly off-center as he was in the first book, or would be in the third.Some improbable plot twists? Well sure, but what's new in this series? Koontz creates a wonderful villainess, but you have to wonder why after the first couple of conversations with Odd she's still convinced he is a true master of the mystic/diabolic arts. I won't give away her fate, but it is, shall we say an improbable one. Then again, there is an animal motif running through several books - recall the coyotes in the first outing and Odd Thomas has enough of the surreal that you're never quite sure what is supposed to be literally true and what is allegorical. Just to point out one more of many: it seems very unlikely the villains could've forced Danny that many miles on foot given his medical condition. Most of the plot elements are telegraphed well ahead of resolution.These are really minor points. The real pleasure of these books is simply going along for the ride with Odd. This ride's a bumpy one, and it's one with a rather...odd...ending, but no more so that the end of the first book, or for that matter the third.When book four comes out, I'll be one of the first to scoop it up."},{"Title":"Forever Odd: A Novel","review":"I usually have a keen interest in books by Dean. However, this was an excellent character placed into an ok book. I didn't read the first one, this happened to be at the airport. The beginning was excellent but fell flat on it's face. The ending was too abrupt also. I was expecting to see some more action, but we went from sewer to cafe in a page."},{"Title":"Forever Odd: A Novel","review":"Since I did not enjoy the first book in this series, until its very end, I surprised myself by picking up this one and realizing that I enjoyed it quite a bit more.Odd really endeared himself to me in this one. From the beginning with his story about Elvis to the end where he will do what it takes, even if it is his own life, to help a friend. That is what Odd does, and with the help of his loved ones in the town of Pico Mundo, Odd will forever be treasured by his band of friends and the readers of this series.Odd Thomas does not consider himself a hero, he just has the ability to communicate with the dead and has a built in magnet that draws people, whether alive or dead, to him. Odd's a good person so when his childhood friend disappears, Odd uses his ability to find him, not realizing that this journey will take him to an old abandoned casino and the evil Datura, who is determined to use Odd's gifts to further her own wicked goals.The ending leads right into what appears to be the third installment of the Odd Thomas story. That in itself looks very interesting. Just imagine Odd as a Lay member of a religious order with Elvis along, since Elvis knows that this is his way home to his beloved mother.I am glad that this series is starting to grow on me, I had been a fan of Dean Koontz with his original books, and I am glad that I can once again look forward to reading more."},{"Title":"Forever Odd: A Novel","review":"Dean Koontz is a craftsman and Odd Thomas gave him an opportunity to do what he does best: create situations where what is seemingly normal gets tossed on its head, create characters with details so well-written that they are not just plausable in the book, but in the real world and create places that have back stories as fascinating as the characters themselves.Odd Thomas was one of the best books Koontz had written. It had a twisty turny plot, interestingly developed characters and a central character who was luminous. It's so sad then that, in Forever Odd, the author chose to side-step the things that had made the first book so marvelous and instead turn out this insipid, lukewarm, ghost of a novel. I kept reading, waiting for the book to improve and it never did. I really envy those people who enjoyed the book. For me, it was like choking down cold schmaltz.I'll read the next one - hopefully he'll go back and do some of the perfect character and plot development for which he is famous."},{"Title":"Forever Odd: A Novel","review":"At one time, about a year ago, I tried to read ODD THOMAS and couldn't force myself past the first chapter. What compelled me to give the sequel a shot- I don't know, but I'm glad I did. This is a fun, humble, and exciting book. I really like the main carachter, Odd Thomas. Now, I've read some reviews on here where people trash this book. While they might have found faults in it, I think overall its worth whatever $7 or so price you're going to pay. People who write these 20 paragraph rebukes of this book.... well, I think it's a bit overboard. This book is by far no stinker. I read a lot of books (mainstream, literary, poetry, etc) and I really enjoyed this and will read the third book (Though I'm still skeptical about the first)."},{"Title":"Forever Odd: A Novel","review":"I was so looking forward to more of Odd Thomas but this book just didn't live up to the first:("},{"Title":"Forever Odd: A Novel","review":"...I had high expectations for the sequel to Odd Thomas. I enjoyed my kinship with Odd and his posse in the first installment and guess I thought I'd get the same here; Not to mention a thrilling plot, freaky villan, suspense and fright. I've been more scared opening a can of biscuits.Where were the flippin bodachs in this one?There was not enough time given to Odd's likeable friends like Teri, Ozzie and the ghost of Elvis which I thoroughly enjoyed in Odd Thomas. All there was to this book was Odd being visited by a Dr. Jessup that pleaded for him to find his kidnapped son. Whoop-dee-doo.To sum it up: Odd, the loner, embarks on a sewer- filled journey underground to a burned-out casino using his \\"psychic magnetism\\" to find his childhood friend and son of the late Dr. Jessup, Danny.The villan who has kidnapped Danny is a very unbelievable woman named Datura who is not to mention beautiful, rich and sexy but so facinated with the paranormal and seeing a ghost that she kidnapped Danny in order to draw Odd to her so she might see one. Come on! I'm dissappointed that DK couldn't come up with a better storyline than this wet noodle. Did he have a few martinis at the country club before embarking on this one?I stayed with this book even when I felt like I was treading water with dear sweet Odd just hoping that DK had a change of heart.....not gonna happen people.I did give this book two stars, however, because I do still adore Odd and Danny pulled at my heart strings a bit too. This sequel did have the capacity to be great but I still think it failed.If you've read Odd Thomas and thinking about reading this sequel, please oh please beware it's not as good as before and have a back-up like sleeping or maybe underwater knitting."},{"Title":"Forever Odd: A Novel","review":"In FOREVER ODD, author Dean Koontz continues the story that he began in ODD THOMAS.Odd Thomas is a kind and gentle young man of twenty-one. Odd is the name he was given by his parents at birth and he's even more unusual than his name suggests. He lives in a world that would be terrifying for most people, but his gentle nature and belief in God has made his life bearable. Odd can see dead people who have passed away, but continue to stay in the world of the living. Most of them are troubled spirits who have something that they want to reveal and seem afraid or unable to move on. The spirits don't speak, but sometimes he is given a glimpse of their past lives and what it is they are seeking. Odd tries his best to help these lost souls in any way that he can.Odd's character is charming and his sense of humor helps him deal with life. One spirit, who frequently visits Odd is Elvis Presley. Odd believes that the spirit of Elvis stays because he is afraid of meeting his mother in the afterlife. He fears her disappointed in the man that he had become.Only a few close friends know about Odd and his unusual gift. This story concerns a friend named Danny who reveals the truth about Odd to impress Datura, a beautiful woman. She proves to be a cruel maniac who is obsessed with death and the occult world. Datura wants to control Odd and force him into teaching her how to summon the dead."},{"Title":"Forever Odd: A Novel","review":"I have been reading Dean Koontz for many years now. I believe I've been through his entire library...and read some of his books multiple times. Odd Thomas is one of my favorite Koontz stories. Forever Odd seemed to me to be a lost chapter, or maybe a quick attempt to keep the character alive in his readers minds. I read the book in a day and didn't want for more. This book should have been offered in paperback as it hit the stands as it didn't seem worth the coverprice. I love Odd Thomas but this installment was dissapointing at best."},{"Title":"Forever Odd: A Novel","review":"I loved Odd Thomas. I was 20 at the time I read it, and thought Dean Koontz did a very good job of writing as a person of that age, and with his little...gift. I couldn't help but think that Odd Thomas was a grown version of that scared little boy in The Sixth Sense. There were some greatly drawn out characters that were believeable. You loved the relationship that Odd and the police chief had. That relationship and the one involving his love \\"Stormy\\" were the best parts of the book.If you didn't read the first novel, I don't want to ruin it, but I (and the people that did read the fist book) know why there is no interaction with Stormy in the second book. Odd talks to the Chief about two or three times.The \\"Bad Guys\\" of Forever Odd were a little shallow. The Bodachs don't make a return, which is understandable that you wouldn't have the same \\"ghosts\\" in two different ghost-involving storys. The Bodachs were creepy though, and in Forever Odd, nothing takes there place.Odd seems to repeat himself in this second novel. That got a little old. There is hardly any character development for Odd or his friend that he must save.I wanted to like it, but not a whole lot seems to happen in here. I do hope that another attempt is made, and that Odd makes a better return. I want to read about the same \\"every day guy meets not so every day problems\\" that you met in the first novel."},{"Title":"Forever Odd: A Novel","review":"Having read Odd Thomas I had to add this to my must read list. I was confused after picking it up due to the title: Forever Odd a novel. Is this a novel? Novel: an invented prose narrative that is usually long and complex and deals especially with human experience through a usually connected sequence of events. Long and complex? Ok, maybe I'll give Dean a little slack. While the book is small and the story a very easy read neither of those facts takes away from a great character. Odd Thomas is a wonderfully developed character that one can't help but find one's self pulling for. This installment has Odd chasing down the kidnapper/s of a dear friend. Once again Odd wants to \\"go it alone\\". The chase leads him to an abandoned Casino in the middle of the desert where we meet more wayward spirits. The villian is by no means an \\"A lister\\" but formibable none the less. I too, finished this book rather quickly but knew going in that I would. We find old friends from the first book and are introduced to some new ones in this installment but I feel the definition of a great \\"series\\" book is one that shows you new characters that will continue to delight you in subsequent offerings. I don't think we will be seeing any of the newly created characters in the Odd sequels (If there are indeed more to come). The prose is wonderful and can transport you to Odd's world if you let it. I will forver be a fan of Odd."},{"Title":"Forever Odd: A Novel","review":"Not one of my favorites. No character depth. Villian was completely unbelievable and one dimensional. Same old story hauled out and retread one more time. Koontz also needs to leave the Thesaurus in the drawer. Not one of Koontz' better works. When will he return to the greateness of PHANTOMS or STRANGERS?"},{"Title":"Forever Odd: A Novel","review":"This mildly entertaining sequel to Odd Thomas is told in the voice of the title character, a lonely and gentle man who can see and interact with the dead, even if they cannot speak back. When the novel opens, Odd Thomas is confronted with yet another dead person, this time the adoptive father of his close friend, Danny. When Odd follows him back to the house, he discovers a grisly scene. To complicate matters, Danny, who suffers from brittle bone disease, is missing, and an (overly) mysterious woman calls Odd to taunt him. Odd is haunted by his past heroic deeds and the loss he experiences as a result. The only dead person he wants to see eludes him.While the final scenes of the book are suspenseful, the novel suffers from Odd's childlike narrative voice and a failure to make the reader care deeply about the characters. This makes the novel forgettable once the last page has been read. Koontz is good enough to know how to keep the reader turning pages; however, this time his story is too thin and, in some ways, self-indulgent. I could imagine Koontz chuckling over his prose as he reincarnated Elvis again and again. I would have rather done the smiling myself.Certainly those who loved Odd Thomas should read this novel, as Koontz will, in all likelihood, return to this character. Maybe the next novel will be better."},{"Title":"Forever Odd: A Novel","review":"With the main characters already being established and described in the original novel of the series, not much rhetoric is needed to get to the heart of the story.Odd Thomas is just as likeable as he is in the original novel, and considering his friend's plight in life and his general demeanor, he proves to be just as amiable. Odd's friend is Danny Jessup, who suffers from a condition that makes him very sympathetic to the reader.The villians in this novel prove to be even creepier than in the original, and help the story move along at a nice pace.Sometimes Koontz novels can be bogged down by pointless composition by the author that just seems to add nothing to the book but the word count. However, Koontz does a great job of not straying too far from the center stoyline, and sets up an intriguing storyline for the next novel in the series."},{"Title":"Forever Odd: A Novel","review":"The book was very enticing. So much so that it has prompted me to read more \\"Odd\\" books. Odd Thomas, main character extrodinare, makes this story his third Dean Koontz novel. However, for me it was a pleasurable first. I can't wait to read the previous books."},{"Title":"Forever Odd: A Novel","review":"Odd Thomas is one of my favorite characters. Forever Odd is good but the first book I thought was a little better as I could not put it down. However, once I got far enough into this I also could not put it down. As soon as I finished this I went out and got \\"Brother Odd\\" so it is well worth the read."},{"Title":"Forever Odd: A Novel","review":"Koontz' style is evident from the first page of this book. The way the man uses words to describe things that we recognize instantly but are not able to put into words is truly satisfying. He has a way of showing us things from another point of view. As usual with Koontz, I was not disappointed."},{"Title":"Forever Odd: A Novel","review":"\\"Odd Thomas\\" was one of the best books of Dean Koontz's career and a sequel was inevitable. He had written an emotionally complex, entertaining, and witty novel with one of the most memorable characters in recent literary fiction. \\"Forever Odd\\" picks up soon after the first novel has ended, with Odd still reeling from the loss he suffered at the end of the first book. In this novel, he wakes up in the middle of the night to find a man named Dr. Jessup standing in his room. Jessup is not a psychotic man waiting in the dark for Odd, but a dead man trying to tell Odd something (after all, if you'll recall, the dead don't talk). Jessup is the father of one of Odd's friends Danny, who suffers from osteogenesis imperfecta, which means that he can break his bones really easily. When Odd arrives at the Jessup home, finding the doctor dead, he finds that Danny is missing. Around the same time, Odd begins receiving strange phone calls from a mysterious woman who most likely (which means does) has something to do with Danny's disappearance. I don't want to reveal much more, because even though there's about 300 pages after the events I've described...Much of it takes place in the same place and to reveal more would almost reveal the entire plot. That's why \\"Forever Odd\\" isn't as good as its predecessor.\\"Odd Thomas\\" had a theatrical quality to it, a book that screamed \\"make me into a movie!\\" It was also a book that could make you laugh or cry. \\"Forever Odd\\" is almost one-dimensional...Odd's winning personality is still intact and it's got a good villain (one which almost brings to mind Sharon Stone in \\"Basic Instinct\\"), but much of the novel takes place in one spot. It's a book that seems to scream \\"make me into a stage production!\\" This book is entertaining and has its moments of wit, but I'd agree with anyone who said the first was better. I do recommend one read it if they loved the first novel, plus Koontz has already published another entry in the series \\"Brother Odd\\" so reading this is a good way to start reading the other book; Reading it was not a complete waste of time and it's only 334 pages in hardback form and I breezed through it.GRADE: B"},{"Title":"Forever Odd: A Novel","review":"I usually don't like sequels, but Dean Koontz has a way of making them just as good as the first! I love Odd almost as much as I love Christopher Snow (whom I hope will have more adventures!!! Hey! Team Odd up with Chris!!). Fantastic book!"},{"Title":"Forever Odd: A Novel","review":"As always with Dean Koontz I read this book cover to cover in just two sittings. I have read everything he has written and I especially enjoy the Odd Thomas books. I find the character believable and someone I would call friend. There is humor, suspense and much drama in these books. I heartily reccommend them to anyone who enjoys a really good read."},{"Title":"Forever Odd: A Novel","review":"It was decent. It was something along the lines of Stephen King but a little different. I bought the next novel in line so here's to looking for more hours of reading pleasure."},{"Title":"Forever Odd: A Novel","review":"Getting to know Odd Thomas is to take him into your heart forever. You find yourself wishing every human had his sensitivity and humility."},{"Title":"Forever Odd: A Novel","review":"Thoroughly enjoyed this audiobook. Outstanding character development, and very good visualization. Reader is very important and this one does an outstanding job using his voice to set the tone of the scene."},{"Title":"Forever Odd: A Novel","review":"great set of books. i've been busy raising a grandaughter and doing very little reading, but started..finished the first one and couldn't wait to start the next. Now I don't want any of them to end. Mr. Koontz has always been my favorite writer but the Odd Thomas NovelsOdd Interlude #1 (An Odd Thomas Story)are his best yet!"},{"Title":"Forever Odd: A Novel","review":"Yet another great page Turner, keeps great pace throughout the book and the characters are so vivid.Dean Joint rocks."},{"Title":"Forever Odd: A Novel","review":"As in previous books he used great (real) places and things (a mountain lion) from the real world to add a special quality to the story. Most people know little about casinos, the people inside them and their relationships. He still uses important people from previous stories to add color and instant personal closeness. The affection you have for Stormy, the Chief, and a boyhood friend off sets the weirdness of the antagonists.The plot is a little simpleminded but there are enough twists to keep you off guard. This book ranks in the top third. I think you will enjoy it."},{"Title":"Forever Odd: A Novel","review":"I really enjoyed the plot of this book. Odd Thomas was as witty and funny as always. Over all the story was very interesting but I felt that it dragged on with its in depth descriptions of the surroundings. I felt like they were used as fillers to make the story longer, and at times I felt bored. But once the plot got going, it was highly entertaining with very good twists. The ending left me wanting more and was a bit hurried, but I am excited to see what the third book holds."},{"Title":"Forever Odd: A Novel","review":"A great read. It stays in tune with the others. Mr Koontz has such a vivid mind that his books are tough to put down."},{"Title":"Forever Odd: A Novel","review":"This is the 2nd time I've read this book. I loved it just as much this time as I did the first time!"},{"Title":"Forever Odd: A Novel","review":"Forever Odd is my least favourite one out of the series, but still an important part of the series, if it was a stand alone book it would be a good read but compared to the other three Odd Thomas books it just hasn't hasn't got the same excitement."},{"Title":"Forever Odd: A Novel","review":"I didn't like this story as much as Odd Thomas. It just seemed like a \\"what's the point?\\" type of story. Do we really need to send Odd on this \\"ODD\\" adventure? I don't believe so. It didn't seem to build him up in any way. It didn't seem to change his personality or give him any great insight to the world. It didn't really seem to serve much of a purpose except to bridge between Odd Thomas and Brother Odd -- both decent books.Either way I'm a fan of Koontz and I enjoyed this journey through his \\"ODD\\" imagination. Don't read BROTHER ODD without reading this one. You could, but I wouldn't."},{"Title":"Forever Odd: A Novel","review":"Some of the descriptions and characters were too gross -- and I'm no pansy. Nevertheless, the story was interesting and suspenseful."},{"Title":"Forever Odd: A Novel","review":"This is a decent read. Not as good as the first or the third in this series. I bought it used and felt I paid a fair price for it."},{"Title":"Forever Odd: A Novel","review":"I loved loved loved Odd Tomas, so I was so happy to find the next chapter, sadly it is not as good. Over all its one of Koontz darker story plots and it is filled with intresting twists, it just lacks the impact that Odd Tomas had. Even though I think its an okay book I still think it is wroth the read, so you should buy it, or get it from the libary it reads pretty quick."},{"Title":"Forever Odd: A Novel","review":"Forever Odd is the second in what are now 3 novels featuring Odd Thomas. Odd is a young man who possesses supernatural ability to see ghosts and to be drawn to people he thinks about. His talent and his kind and generous disposition lead him to the aid of people in his town of Pico Mundo, a desert city in the Mojave. In this novel, Odd's best friend is kidnapped by several diabolical villians in the Koontzian mold, perfectly beautiful on the outside, horribly evil on the inside. Odd relates the story of his attempt to rescue his friend using his otherworldly talents. I found the plot fast-paced and engaging. The first person narration by Odd was refreshing, at times philosphical, at others reminiscent of a detective story of the 1940s with witty and humourous repartee. I gave this novel 4 stars rather than 5 because I enjoyed the first Odd Thomas novel more. Nevertheless this is an excellent book, and I look forward to the third in the series."},{"Title":"Forever Odd: A Novel","review":"First of all, I just need to state that \\"Odd Thomas\\" is one of my favorite novels ever. That said, \\"Forever Odd\\" was a pretty big letdown. It lacked much of the intrigue of the first one, which is what I was expecting. By the end of \\"Odd Thomas\\", you pretty much know all of Odd's secrets and clear portrait is painted. I had a feeling that Koontz would not be able to do this novel the same way, and I was correct.What bothered me the most about this book was that it had little to do with Odd Thomas. If you cut out the first few chapters, last few chapters and change the names of the characters, you would have a book that would not even remotley remind a reader of \\"Odd Thomas\\". In fact, I think that Koontz probably should have done just that. If he had taken the plot out of the Odd Thomas universe and developed a stronger relationship between the main character and Datura, it would have made a good story.I also felt that a good third of this book was nothing but space filler with Koontz describing Odd wandering through complicated water drainage systems and a burned out hotel/casino.I thought the last three chapters of the book were amazing, but it didn't make up for the less than satisfactory sixty chapters I had to read to get there."},{"Title":"Forever Odd: A Novel","review":"I hadn't read any Koontz prior to this one, but I was captive in a hospital and out of reading material. I tried this one, and wound up really getting into, blew through it in about a day, I liked it so much. A really different approach on murder mystery, which I'm not normally into."},{"Title":"Forever Odd: A Novel","review":"Fans of Odd Thomas, the protagonist of this series, may be a bit dissapointed with this sequel to the hit original book \\"Odd Thomas\\".Odd Thomas, a fry cook on sabbatical, who is able to see the dead and act on their impulses and desires, is back for another adventure. Koontz of course is a master story teller, but the story is not as masterful as it could have been. The first book was a non-stop page turner and I could not put it down, sometimes reading for far longer into the night than I should have.\\"Forever Odd\\" fell short of my expectations. I will always be a follower of Odd Thomas and will read any subsequent books in the series, but I think the stories and characters need to get more developed than they were in this book. The villians were not all that villianous, in fact they seemed more talk than action, just the opposite of the first book. Plus, a lot of the supernaturnal thriller feel is lost in this book.Overall, the story revolves around Odd finding the body of a friend's stepfather. The friend however is missing and the stepfather's body and its ghost are indicating foul play. Odd determined to find his friend goes on the search guided by his special sixth sense. He finds out that his friend is being held for ransom by a modern \\"witch\\" who appears to take pleasure in other's pain and in fornicating with dead Nazis. The story evolves from there with confrontations both human and ghostly.Like I said, its a Koontz book so the story is good enough to capture your attention but it may not be up to his par of work. The question comes down to, is this book \\"Odd\\" enough for you?"},{"Title":"Forever Odd: A Novel","review":"I re-read sentences of this book just for the joy of reading the words again. Dean Koontz can say so much with so little, and seemingly little effort, which of course is never the case. In this sequel to \\"Odd Thomas\\" we are again treated to a journey into the unusual. You can't help but fall in love with Odd and his friends in spite of and because of their weaknesses, frailties and of course \\"oddities\\". For Dean koontz fans this book is a must. For new comers there may be some cultural adjustment and a need to check reality at the door. But then again, maybe not. If nothing else your vocabulary will be expanded and you will get an appreciation of how magnificently words can be strung together. And yes Elvis has left the building.. Enjoy!!!!"},{"Title":"Forever Odd: A Novel","review":"One of the typical defining characteristics of a Dean Koontz novel is how ordinary people may exhibit extraordinary courage and faith in difficult circumstances. \\"Grace under fire\\" might well be placed on Mr. Koontz' personal coat of arms. A parallel theme is that, even when things are really, really bad, life is worth struggling for. Repeatedly, I have thrilled to read how the demons are at the door, death and worse seems imminent, and yet good hearted men and women \\"keep fighting\\" and find love in the battle.Here, our rather unusual hero from the first novel \\"solves\\" the murder case but ends up concluding that life is not worth the pain involved. Read this novel with abundant anti-depressants at hand. Please, Mr. Koontz, Odd Thomas needs a long, and perhaps, permanent, rest."},{"Title":"Forever Odd: A Novel","review":"Not as good as the first in the series, but Forever Odd continues to breathe life into the interesting protagonist, Odd Thomas. Koontz delivers a fast paced tale, but in the end leaves you a bit unfulfilled. The climax didn't hit on all the cylinders for me and I was expecting a bit more supernatural elements. In the end, I enjoyed the book."},{"Title":"Forever Odd: A Novel","review":"This book is not worth your time. I kept waiting for the book to draw me in and it was the exact opposite. I could barely finish it."},{"Title":"Forever Odd: A Novel","review":"Very good summer reading. Odd Thomas is a great character. I actually read the first book last so I had a good idea what might happen however Koontz still was able to surprise me. Very fun."},{"Title":"Forever Odd: A Novel","review":"Although I liked Brother Odd better, I liked this one so much I immediately followed it up with the aforementioned novel. We learn a good deal more about Odd and his powers, and his longing for Stormy. Honestly, this book got pretty slow at times, so it's probably more introspective than I would like. There is more supernatural goings-on that will capture your interest and build some serious suspense. Odd saves the day again."},{"Title":"Forever Odd: A Novel","review":"Following the awesome first book, Odd Thomas, Forever Odd is equally enjoyable. I am still reading this novel so I can't give a definite thumbs up, but so far it has been a page turner and very interesting."},{"Title":"Forever Odd: A Novel","review":"I am amazed at some of the other reviewers here - how could any of you find this book unappealing? No, this is not the same impactful book as Odd Thomas (book one of the series), but this IS a good book, and yet another insight into Odd; finding his strength and holding steadfast to his love of Stormy, Odd's fate in this book is to bring himself ever closer to finding his true purpose in this life.I would not skip this book, not because I am a fan of Odd Thomas, but because it is a worthy and entertaining story. The man in this book, however, is a shallow representation of the Odd Thomas of the first novel - because he has suffered the greatest loss. Expecting him to be anything but a grieving man, shaken to his core and questioning everything about this life is unrealistic. Odd is realistic; and Dean Koontz makes sure that we understand just how human Odd really is.I poured through this book, the pages practically turned themselves - I loved everything about this story and I anticipate reading the next in the series, Brother Odd.Give this book the chance it so richly deserves !"},{"Title":"Forever Odd: A Novel","review":"I am a huge Dean Koontz fan, he is at best one of my favorite fictional writers. I think I have almost every book he has written. I especially like the Odd Thomas series. He is a very likable character in every way and his \\"gift\\" though he sometimes sees it as a curse is literally the saving grace for the many people that he come in contact with in the story. I recommend all of the Odd Thomas books. Well done,again, Dean Koontz as always. Thanks"},{"Title":"Forever Odd: A Novel","review":"The product that was purchased was just as described, perfect condition. Very impressed and at that, it was my first purchase through amazon. very happy."},{"Title":"Forever Odd: A Novel","review":"Odd Thomas is a uniquely drawn character that answers the question: what would happen if the kid from Sixth Sense grew up? While not the same character, the premise is the same and the manner in which these books mine this story concept is well done."},{"Title":"Forever Odd: A Novel","review":"Although not as good a read as the first of the series, \\"Forever Odd\\" is solid entertainment. This time around Mr. Koontz is somewhat more verbose, however, I enjoyed this the 2nd installment of the series, and anticipate reading the next book. I find \\"Oddie\\" a likable character, as I do all the other characters he relates to. This story has a little more violence than the first, but again, I found myself pleased by the plot twists, the humor, and sincerity. A solid 3 stars."},{"Title":"Forever Odd: A Novel","review":"\\"Forever Odd\\" is the second installment of novels featuring a sharp witted 20 some year old named Odd Thomas. Odd lives in the town of Pico Mundo and the most interesting aspect of Odd's life is that he can see dead people.The first book in the series \\"Odd Thomas\\" was by far one of the better books Mr. Koontz has ever written. The character development, interaction and scene descriptions quickly pull you into the book and seldom let you go. After finishing the book you feel as if you know these people like they were your own friends, that's what made \\"Forever Odd\\" a bit of a let down.Starting to read the first chapter I felt like I was back in Pico Mundo again, the sights and the sounds all came rushing back to me from the first book. However Odd meets and starts to interact with a spirit of someone who has been murdered. His conversation with the spirit was cold and almost snooty. I actually stopped reading and said \\"This isn't the Odd Thomas I remember... Odd wouldn't talk to a spirit like that\\".Perhaps Odd was left bitter and changed because of his experiences from the last book. The story progressed but did not really have the feeling of the first book. Perhaps this was Koontz's intent I do not know. I do not think it was, Odd seemed to get back to his normal self after a few chapters. The character development was done very quickly and is a little unbelievable. This childhood friend was just introduced, much of their history is given later. It didn't flow very well.The villainess; appears much like Odd's childhood friend just appears. She is a very unlikely character and isn't much of an adversary for Odd. Only in the last three to four chapters of this book did Koontz really shine. Dean if you ever read this, if you would have made the whole book like the last four chapters you would have had yourself another masterpiece and a worthy successor to \\"Odd Thomas\\". This book felt either very rushed or as if Mr. Koontz didn't really put much effort into it. I will give him the benefit of the doubt and say that it was the former instead of the later.Either way it is a sequel that must been read before you can read \\"Brother Odd\\". You could always just pick up the cliff notes and save yourself the time though. Come on Dean, I'm about to start Brother Odd... don't let your long time fans down!"},{"Title":"Forever Odd: A Novel","review":"In this second book featuring Odd Thomas, we follow Odd's life after losing his beloved Stormy, the love of his life. Odd has a strange life. He can see, feel, and talk to the dead, although they can't talk back to him. Elvis is one of his regulars. As Odd tries to put his life back together, he is pulled into another tragic event when his friend's adopted father shows up at Odd's door, in ghostly form, of course. Odd follows the ghost back to his former home to discover his murdered body. Odd also discovers that the dead man's son, Danny, is missing. Danny and Odd are best friends and Danny is afflicted with a horrible disease that makes his bones extremely brittle and easy to break. Odd gets a phone call from a woman who has abducted Danny and Odd must go rescue his friend. The woman is a freak who wants to use Odd to see and talk to the dead. That is the basics, now on to what is so wonderful about this book.Odd is a lovable character, he is warm, loving, everyone's best friend. He is a white knight without the ego. I defy anyone to not wish they had an Odd in their life. Dean Koontz uses a wonderful blend of suspense, horror, mystery, and humor to capture the reader and hold their attention. The villians are a bit ridiculous, but they are also fun and different. I admire Mr. Koontz for having the guts to break the mold and use his imagination to it's fullest.If you are looking for the next great who-done-it or the next great hair-standing-on-end horror, this is not the book for you. If you are looking for a great, enjoyable, fun adventure, you will love this one."},{"Title":"Forever Odd: A Novel","review":"This story took place mostly in one setting in the book, so the read didn't move around as much as the previous work did. However, I was on the edge of my seat most of the time.Mr. Koontz fashions a story of a man both blessed and tormented by a gift that he can't help but using. Odd Thomas faces challenges of a man with extraordinary powers in a surprisingly simple life. As always, Koontz ravels a tale around the reader that entices, thrills and chills. I could actually feel myself in the character's place at several points in the book.I look forward to reading the next installment in this soon to be classic line of Koontz novels."},{"Title":"Forever Odd: A Novel","review":"Among various writers in the horror genre, one of Dean Koontz's great strengths has been his consistency. Yes, he's rarely great, but he's even more rarely awful; ;instead, he is reliably good. In Amazon rating terms, he's Mr. Four Star; almost all his books merit this rating. Forever Odd, Koontz's second book featuring Odd Thomas - an amiable fellow in his early twenties who can see dead people - continues the string.As with several of Koontz's most recent books, this one takes place in a very short time span, with the bulk of it occurring in less than 24 hours. Odd wakes up to find the ghost of his friend's stepfather lingering nearby; the ghost leads Odd to the man's recently murdered body. Adding to the problem is that Odd's friend Danny - who is afflicted with a brittle bone disease - is missing and presumed kidnapped.The suspect is obvious: Danny's natural father, but it will not be as simple as this. Odd will go on a quest to find Danny, relying on his sixth sense to guide him to the remains of a burnt-out Indian casino. There he will find a villainous character that far exceeds what Odd could be expecting.As usual, Koontz's writing is fast-paced and entertaining. It is not, however, perfect writing. In particular, I've noticed a trend in recent Koontz books towards borderline silliness: all sorts of eccentric characters engaging in cheesy dialogue. In this case, this is best exemplified by the irritating (and fortunately only briefly appearing) P. Oswald Boone, a four-hundred pound mystery writer; some of the dialogue between him and Odd almost makes one wince.On the other hand, Koontz still writes good, suspenseful action and can still create a good, twisted villain, in this case, a warped woman named Datura. While still another four star effort, Koontz needs to get more serious again or his quality will slip. However, if you are a Koontz fan - and particularly if you enjoyed Odd Thomas - this book will be a fun read."},{"Title":"Forever Odd: A Novel","review":"A likeable main character with an eerie gift, any story with Odd Thomas makes for an interesting read. Koontz is obviously a great writer and with such a likable, disaster prone main character, it is hard to go wrong. Though this is the second book in a series about Odd Thomas, it reads well as a stand alone. Nothing in the story is extraordinarily original or mind boggling, which are usually characteristics of a good suspense novel, but the author does a good job of making the story work despite the lack of thrill. The end of the story gets a bit philosophical, with a lot of discussion about the meaning of life and death. I probably could have gone without a lot of this discussion, but I think the main point the author is trying to make through all of the philosophical banter is that life is important, and there is such thing as morality. There is a right way to live and a wrong way to live, and this is brought out well in the story. I personally look forward to reading the other two installments in the Odd Thomas series."},{"Title":"Forever Odd: A Novel","review":"I liked the book. I enjoyed walking in this foot steps. Developing a connection with characters he meets. However, you never really get to know the villians, never really understand what is going on. You got a lot of running around, near misses and unexplainable thrills you come to expect from Dean and Odd. But, like many of the endings. It just doesn't deliver. It was rushed, weak and quite sad (not the good kind)."},{"Title":"Forever Odd: A Novel","review":"Dean Koontz is my favorite author. I'll buy every book he ever writes. I loved Odd Thomas, and it may be my favorite Koontz book to date.But for most of the reasons outlined in Terry Mesnard's review, there is none of the magic in this sequel.But I will say this: Koontz at 20% is like most other authors at 80%. I would read his shopping lists. I've preordered the next in the Odd Thomas series, \\"Brother Thomas.\\" I am hoping for a return of the magic."},{"Title":"Forever Odd: A Novel","review":"Odd Thomas is his name. He lives a simple life as a fry cook at a grille in the town of Pico Mundo, CA. and he sees dead people.Forever Odd is book two about this plain and simple character who has a special gift to see the deceased, including Elvis, who have not yet crossed over.In this story, Odd must try to save the life of his friend, Danny Jessup. Danny is 21 and handicapped by OI (osteogenesis imperfecta) also known as brittle bones. Deformed by this disease, Danny does not date and in a weak moment turns to phone sex. Danny discovers that the woman he repeatedly speaks to is interested in the supernatural.

Good read."},{"Title":"Forever Odd: A Novel","review":"Dean Koontz - I love the way you write but I have issues with what I call the \\"creep factor.\\" I like to sleep soundly at night and some of your books are just too disturbing and I end up with nightmares. My husband reads all of your books and knowing me the way he does lets me know if the \\"creep factor\\" is an acceptable amount for me.I loved many of your earlier books especially Lightening and your more recent book By the Light of the Moon (especially the humor!!!). When Odd Thomas came out hubby thought the creep factor was okay for me. I agreed and I just loved your main character, Odd, and all of the supporting characters were interesting and you did a great job with the story - a little bit more creep than I like, but manageable.Now comes along the sequel - I love Odd - but way too dark for me - yes I had nightmares. It was a good book, well written but just too gloomy, creepy, and sad.How about a Sequel with Shep from By the Light of the Moon? I miss your humor."},{"Title":"Forever Odd: A Novel","review":"Odd Thomas returns in this second installment with a little less excitement than the first book. He is still the same young, naive boy who sees dead people and hangs with Elvis's spirit. This story starts out a few months after the last incident with the death of his beloved, Stormy. He wakes up one morning and sees his good friend Danny's father, Dr Jessup's: spirit in his room. His only option is to follow it to his home and find out the issue.As it turns out Dr. Jessup was killed while a small gang of people came to kidnap Danny and take him on a wild goose chase for Odd to follow. This story took a little more of the sci-fi route for me. Going on and on about his gifts and what he's capable of. It was definitely entertaining but not nearly and exhilarating as the original Odd Thomas."},{"Title":"Forever Odd: A Novel","review":"It's hard to know where to start when trying to get acclimated with Dean Koontz's novels, given that there's over 50 titles. Classics such as \\"Watchers\\", \\"Phantoms\\", \\"Intensity\\" to me would be the ideal way to get familiar with him. If you like Koontz's style, then moving on to the \\"Odd\\" series I believe would be the next logical step. There are 4 books in the series, \\"Odd Hours\\" being the most recent title, released in May 2008. \\"Forever Odd\\" is the second novel in the series, a sequel to \\"Odd Thomas\\".The events of this novel occur a few months after the tragic events in Odd Thomas. With his girlfriend Stormy dead and with the angels, Odd has been keeping a low profile, currently on a leave of absence from his job as a short-order cook so he can clear his mind and regain his sanity. Then one night, Odd is alerted to the disappearance of one of his best friends Danny, a young adult who suffers from a physical condition that make his bones frail. Odd follows the tracks that lead to Danny's location and faces dangers that he, even with his special powers, will prove very difficult to tackle on his own.This is a typical fast-paced Koontz suspense novel, as the events unfold within a 24-hour timeframe and the action starts pretty much right from the beginning and carries through until the end. When cracking open the first page of this sequel, I was afraid it was going to degenerate into a sobfest filled with musings from Odd about how he misses his lost love but thankfully Koontz spares us of much of this melodrama. Instead we are plunged head first into a fast-paced action/drama/mystery scenario. The female villain is one of the most memorable I've read of in quite some time, an adult industry goddess whose fascination with the occult is taken WAY too far. I liked how everything in this novel was rather believable, as long as you can buy into Odd's special powers of course.My 3-star rating should not be mistaken for a bad review. Forever Odd is quite enjoyable, it just comes short of matching the brilliance of its successor. We also see little of the characters of the first novel, such as Elvis, Terri, Ozzie and though it is an entertaining and fast-paced yarn, it does come across as a by-the-numbers suspense novel rather than something that is truly memorable. But clearly, Odd's character is evolving and we can sense that Koontz is trying to take this series in adventurous new directions rather than settling and that's the reason I'll continue reading."},{"Title":"Forever Odd: A Novel","review":"Koontz introduced the loveable and intriguing character of Odd Thomas in his first book. The follow up book \\"Forever Odd\\" seemed to step away from what was so well liked about \\"Odd Thomas.\\" Other than Odd's psychic tracking ability, the rest of his paranormal gifts were ignored in this book. Instead it read more like a regular murder mystery than a true Koontz novel. But for those who haven't read it, hang in there because the third book, \\"Brother Odd,\\" Koontz redeems himself."},{"Title":"Forever Odd: A Novel","review":"I'm sorry to say this was a really big let down. I liked Odd Thomas a lot. What a great cast of characters.I have to say the second half of Odd Thomas wasn't quite as sharp as the first half, but still, very solid. But, because the characters were so good, I was really looking forward to the next book.This was not what I was hoping for at all. First of all, the book moved away from many of the beloved characters from the first book. Second, the story just wasn't that good. It had some decent elements, but the whole premise wasn't enough to fill a whole novel. It feels like Koontz had a bit of an idea and tried to fulfill a contract by extending it into a whole novel.Unfortunately, the next book isn't any better. The story is a little better, but Koontz takes the story out of the town where all the beloved characters are based. Almost none of the new characters are memorable or loveable at all.Hope Koontz can get back on track. Odd Thomas and his loveable cast of characters deserve a top notch story."},{"Title":"Forever Odd: A Novel","review":"I love the character of Odd. I have to force myself to put these books down at night to sleep. Odd is so likeable; you'd just love to have him as a friend. I can see why he is such a favorite of Dean Koontz. On the subject of favorites; I thought for years that I was a strictly Stephen King fan but move over Stephen; Dean Koontz is becoming a favorite of mine. His books are so easy to read and always fascinate me. I love Odd and I love Dean Koontz!"},{"Title":"Forever Odd: A Novel","review":"I thought that over all this was a decent book. I enjoyed Odd's narration just as much as in the first novel. I thought that the book however was somewhat weighed down by the story. It was believable, but what happened to all the ghostly aspects of the first one. I found myself comparing this more to Velocity (The only other Koontz book I've read so far besides Odd Thomas) Than to the previous novel. Even though it isn't as good as the first book, I would still recommend this novel, just because Odd is such a great character. *Little Spoiler* The real highpoint of this book was for me the reflection that Odd has at the end on the real horrors of the world, how we have really messed up our opportunity here. Its broken and can't be fixed.But again, read this book if you enjoyed the first one, its still good by any standards. It just isn't as brilliant as the first one."},{"Title":"Forever Odd: A Novel","review":"The story line is definitely different, and in some places it gets a little slow. But overall, the story is greatly crafted and the characters are spot on. There's no good reason not to read this book.The fact that part of the story is in a big desert rainstorm brings back memories of when I lived in Arizona. Oh, monsoon season, how I miss you."},{"Title":"Forever Odd: A Novel","review":"I am really into Odd Thomas books. Dean Koontz is one of my favorite writers and Odd Thomas is perhaps his best character. This is one book in his series of this very special and interesting character. I hope to enjoy stories about this person for years to come."},{"Title":"Forever Odd: A Novel","review":"Datura was definately a Koontz villan. Evil, intelligent and formidable. A lot of readers don't like how Koontz gets so descriptive. I'm one who really appreciates the fact that he can bring you into the action with his details and keep you on the edge of your seat. Great read and a nice second adventure for Odd Thomas."},{"Title":"Forever Odd: A Novel","review":"Definitely not as good as the first Odd novel. It was rather boring, actually. I caught myself skipping over pages just to get to the next chapter. I'm not ready to give up on Odd yet, I just hope Brother Odd will not disappoint."},{"Title":"Forever Odd: A Novel","review":"I am not going to do a rendition, this has already been done quite well. This book was just as good as the first one, Odd Thomas. I think Dean Koontz really shines in this fascinating series about an honest good-guy who just happens to see dead people. You would think having Elvis for a part of his dead forte would get corny and cheezy but I think you would be amazed how Dean Koontz avoids the cheeze. I highly recommend this book. But you have to read these in order, I do not believe they would be as compelling if you tried to read each as a standalone novel."},{"Title":"Forever Odd: A Novel","review":"Dean Koontz has a breezy, well-crafted writing style which novels like Forever Odd show off nicely. This story continues where Odd Thomas left off, with the same characters in a similar plot line. Personally, I like the Odd Thomas series (including Brother Odd, the latest installment) but it is an acquired taste. In my opinion, Odd Thomas was the best - with each successive installment novel a little less great then the previous one."},{"Title":"Forever Odd: A Novel","review":"I call myself the \\"Autistic Reader\\" because that is what I am. I enjoy reading about Odd, this is my opinion, because to me he has a lot of autistic traits. Odd is a very interesting person and having the gift of seeing the dead is to me a powerful gift. Forever Odd is a great read!"},{"Title":"Forever Odd: A Novel","review":"I thought the book was far too detailed to the point ofbeing boring."},{"Title":"Forever Odd: A Novel","review":"Odd Thomas is just as endearing a character in Forever Odd as he was in the original, and the supporting cast is still there (though unfortunately, not as prominent as in the first novel). Unlike other reviewers, I found the villains in Odd Part II to be unnerving and frightening.If there is one negative, it is that Koontz spends a bit too much time laboring over the details of tunnels, fences and floors. But given the suspense that he creates and sustains, this flaw is forgivable.Koontz fans know that he loves to use metaphors. If there is one thing he does better in this sequel, it is his use of sometimes hilarious, but always appropriate metaphors.If you are a fan of Koontz and Odd, you will enjoy this book. It left me ready for Part III."},{"Title":"Forever Odd: A Novel","review":"Dean Koontz always leaves you waiting for his next book and Forever Odd is no exception! If you like Koontz, you'll like Dee Sullivan, too. So, along with ordering FOREVER ODD, you gotta read DEADLY BEHAVIOR by Dee Sullivan."},{"Title":"Forever Odd: A Novel","review":"This book is not nearly as good as Odd Thomas or any of Koontz's other books. I am a big Dean Koontz fan and was disappointed with this book. It was very slow moving and did not have much of a plot."},{"Title":"Forever Odd: A Novel","review":"Odd is one of those characters that you think about, long after the reading is through. This novel has everything you could possibly want in a story: an endearing main character, solid writing, well-crafted plot --- all twisted together as only Koontz can do (with the help of Oddie of course.) If you have never read Koontz (Odd Thomas was my first Koontz book) then I highly recommend that you start. And if you, like so many of us, are fans of this author, then this book will be among your favorites, forever."},{"Title":"Forever Odd: A Novel","review":"Odd Thomas was a wonderful book. I wanted more. But by the time I finished Forever Odd I rather felt like I'd had second helpings of Thanksgiving dessert, which tasted great at the time-but now I'm feeling logy and wish for a nap.I highly recommend Odd Thomas. It is one of Koontz's more emotionally provocative pieces. We feel for the character, who is so overwhelmed by his uncanny ability that he finds the work of a fry cook to be too trying. It's a solid four star book.But the book I'm reviewing here is Forever Odd. Truth is, there is not much I can say about it that I would consider new (Odd still has his uncanny ability, and still has difficulty working.) Please note, this is written in the literary voice of Odd and is not presented in Koontz's usual style.If you did not read Odd Thomas you can still enjoy this-and in fact, may enjoy it more than if you had. I am wincing as I give the book three stars-the villain in this piece is just STARTLINGLY evil-but still, I'd unwittingly already had my fill."},{"Title":"Forever Odd: A Novel","review":"I don't want to compare this to Odd Thomas, but it must- not just because it is a sequel, but because there are times that you need to refer to the original to understand what Odd is talking about. Actually I am having difficulty writing a review for this novel because it really had no effect on me other than a slight sense of disappointment. I like Odd Thomas, he is an affable character who can see ghosts, is haunted by Elvis and is trying to cope with the loss of the love of his life in the book's predecessor. Forever Odd's bad guy (or in this case woman) is fascinatingly insane, but she is introduced and disposed of too quickly without having earned her full potential as a character.I think what really disappointed me was that this was nothing more than a three hundred and thirty three page chase scene that ends abruptly and all the titbits tied up in the last two pages as though Koontz had run out of time and realized that he had to explaining to do."},{"Title":"Forever Odd: A Novel","review":"Remember when Koontz stories were great? You couldn't put them down. You couldn't imagine how anyone would survive or what would explain the supernatural power of whatever entity the good guys were battling. Cherish the memories. FOREVER ODD is nothing like that.Odd Thomas lacks the suspense and supernatural mystery of classic Koontz stories. We still have a few brutal murders, insane villains, horror-movie nightmare scenes and one very introspective hero. (Even Odd Thomas is less interesting here than in his first novel.) There are a few good spots but FOREVER ODD is not nearly as good as the early Dean Koontz books. It's too bad because I enjoyed Pico Mundo, the ghost of Elvis, Odd and the rest of the cast in Odd Thomas. If any of them make it into a third novel, let's hope it's one with more deserving plot."},{"Title":"Forever Odd: A Novel","review":"The character of Odd Thomas is the true beating heart of this series. The first book was a fully contained story that had many characters and intriguing set-ups. Not to mention the novelty factor of being introduced to a new character and story. This second book in the series shows that the series is hinged on Odd and his reactions to the situations he is thrust into. It is a good story that is atmospheric and contains Odd's trademark sense of humor.If your reading this, you have probably already read the book and are wondering what others thought. I think it was good but dragged in the middle. I liked the ending though.If you haven't read it, please pick it up and continue Odd's journey. There are 3 more after this one (as of when this written) and he has proven to be a great character. It's a rewarding experience to get to know Odd's philosophy. Check it out."},{"Title":"Forever Odd: A Novel","review":"I am rereading the Odd Thomas series after I realized I missed book fourOdd Hoursand I wanted to be caught up for book fiveOdd Apocalypse.

Maybe you have to be a Koontz fan and an Odd fan but if not, the supernatural aspect here was great and I thought the woman villain was really awesome. So, 5 stars and don't listen to these haters. They are micro criticizers and should be shot. :)Moving on to the 3rd book Brother Odd. Wish me luck"},{"Title":"Forever Odd: A Novel","review":"My favorite still so far is the first in the series. Forever Odd is a rather small story involving only a limited number of characters with really only one story arc and one principle setting (a burned out casino) in the whole book. The action takes place over one day. Since I read it on an e-reader I really don't know how many pages it was, but it seemed like I finished it in no time at all. Despite a rather simple story line, I really enjoyed my time with Odd---he continues to be one of the most interesting characters I have met. Once again, I found myself either nodding or laughing out loud at his narration and his statements about his philosophy of life. And the story, albeit a rather straightforward hunt and chase, was compelling as told by Mr. Thomas. I wonder how much of Dean Koontz is in this character. Probably quite a bit."},{"Title":"Forever Odd: A Novel","review":"Loved this book. Great pacing throughout the story and kept me interested throughout. I have always been a fan of Dean Koontz and he does not dissappoint with this novel."},{"Title":"Forever Odd: A Novel","review":"This book was great. I loved it. I'm not sure exactly why so many people found it disappointing.The main noticeable difference that people seem to be concerned with is that there is far less dialogue, and most of the story Odd's narrative and about the descriptions and thoughts that Odd has, but this is due to the fact that for most of the book he is without company, so I found that understandable to a degree.Other than that, I felt that it was a great follow-up, and can't wait to read more in this series."},{"Title":"Forever Odd: A Novel","review":"It is nice when the location and feeling of a place are conveyed. But if you all that out, the story would be about 30 pages long. There is not sufficient action for a book this long. It looks like Mr. Koontz is banking on his name more than his storytelling."},{"Title":"Forever Odd: A Novel","review":"So far I've enjoyed all Koontz books in the Odd series. This one was no exception. What I like most about Odd is that he seems so naive, which in a way he is, but his common sense is so brilliant and unexpected. He weighs everything very carefully, when he has the time, and trys to think of solutions from many angles. I think a lot of us try to do that, but he trys to include so many details in his thinking before he makes a decision. It gives you the impression that even though he is not very worldly, that he does a lot of reading and listening, which all of us should probably do. He also listens to his inner voice. We may not see ghosts like Odd, but we can all learn to listen to our gut feelings to help us stay out of trouble.One of the morals was that we are all human and nobody knows-it-all and that really erks all of us who know that we don't know-it-all. Ha! Ha! Also, over confidence can be the death of you. Also Karma is a b*!#h. It all goes back to the Golden Rule \\"Do unto others as you would have them do unto you!\\".All in all it was very enjoyable and liked the ending very much."},{"Title":"Forever Odd: A Novel","review":"As a sequel to the original \\"Odd Thomas\\" & second in the series, this story just plain misses. It starts off pretty well, then spirals downward.Dean Koontz is one of the most prolific writers out there with a huge following. One has to wonder what happened here.Koontz has created one of the most likable characters anywhere in the original book. In this book, all the characters are thin. The book suffers from spreading it's main characters too thinly.We have almost none of the bodachs Odd normally sees since there is no mayhem on a large scale.Odd has a best friend Danny with a disease of extremely brittle bones. Firstly, how is Danny Odd's best friend? Where did he come from? He's Dr. Jessup's son, but a dear best friend to Odd? That's a new one on the reader. Danny, with his affliction survives a kidnapping to the upper reaches of a burned out hotel by three brutal kidnappers. Pretty much nonsense.The main villain, Datura, meets her demise in a most ridiculous way.The saving graces are the writer's description of the surroundings much of the book takes place in. That's very nicely done.The weakest point should be the books strong point. It's characters. They just don't make it here. Not even ElvisThe last chapter sets the reader up very well for the next in the series, \\"Brother Odd.\\" Mercifully \\"Brother Odd\\" is much betterGiven Koontz's history of some excellent work, I'll cut him a bit of slack & go with 3 stars. As a stand alone book, only 2 stars"},{"Title":"Forever Odd: A Novel","review":"I am a huge fan of the novel Odd Thomas; it is a creative, hook-worthy read. However, Forever Odd lacks many elements that grabbed me in the first novel. There are no bodachs, no real compelling mystery, and characters either fall out of the air or fall flat -- where was Danny Jessup in the first novel? Forever Odd is seemingly aimless until we meet Dethura (around page 200). Once she enters, the novel becomes more interesting only to be fizzled out within sixty or so pages. The labyrinthine elements employed just did not work for this story or Odd's character. Even though the inherent humor and philosophy of Odd is always a nice touch, I found myself skimming through parts of this, and skimming is never something I aim to do in an engrossing read."},{"Title":"Forever Odd: A Novel","review":"We first met Odd Thomas in Koontz's ODD THOMAS; his sympathetic, likeable character garnered such praise, a sequel was inevitable. Unfortunately, FOREVER ODD isn't quite as good as its predecessor. While Odd remains a strong character, the narrative and plot in this book is threadbare and there's a lot of Koontz's psychospiritual babbling that slows down the novel's already slow pace. Feeling a need to describe every thought, every physical locality and the redundancy of the philosophical trappings, the book never really achieves a level of suspense it should have contained. Odd is out to rescue his best friend, Danny (who has osteogenesis imperfecta or brittle bones) who has been kidnaped by a demented phone sex operator named Datura. She has kidnapped Danny to force Odd to share his special gift of seeing ghosts. Datura also has three formidable assistants who have their own hideous secrets. I've been a fan of Koontz for years, having read almost all of his books, but he can be frustrating at times when he lets his narrative ramble on and on, as I feel he does in FOREVER ODD. A good writer, who is certainly creative and prolific, Koontz doesn't meet up to my expectations with this one."},{"Title":"Forever Odd: A Novel","review":"I am disappointed in this book. The situations in which Odd always feels he needs to do it alone have grown tiresome. The main evil character was not as formidable as many of Dean Koontz characters in the past and I just found her to be a bland form of a villian. The book just didn't have a substancial plot line from which I am used to seeing as well. I waited quite a while to read this book and read it in two days, not because I couldn't put it down, but because it was a quick, easy read. I would recomend it if you like Odd Thomas the character, then you will enjoy the book, but don't expect anything of substance to happen."},{"Title":"Forever Odd: A Novel","review":"Its a great story with a humble main character. there is love, fear, goasts, evil and good friends, with a humerous side as well"},{"Title":"Forever Odd: A Novel","review":"Odd is so likable and we so want him to be able to overcome and be happy. But life is here to throw more wrenches in his way.Some spoilers if you haven't read Book One, Odd Thomas, which you should before reading this one.This is a good, if quieter and slower-paced read than ODD THOMAS. We still have Odd with his dead-seeing power and his good heart that wants to help, even if it puts him at risk. This time, rather than major bodach-thrilling carnage, we have someone Odd cares about deeply in trouble--kidnapped by one whack Voodoo-ish skanky beauty. Odd, we know (as the series continues) will overcome, but as in all things, it's the how, the pace, the suspense, the characters, the why that makes stuff interesting. Koontz can write, so that's not even an issue. Koontz can plot, so we know it will have escalating danger and a ticking clock.However, Mr. Koontz seemed a bit too enamored of his research material, and I found some of the detail overwhelming. It's like I wanted to say, \\"Enough about the tunnel already, or the hotel, or the this or the that.\\" The amount of setting descriptive detail, while understandably some being needed for placing the reader in the situation, did feel excessive. I skimmed A LOT in spots.One quibble: If this Danny was such a dear, close, valuable friend, how come he was, like, not around in the first book? I know, I know, authorial license to add and enrich a character who continues in a successful series, but I had a hard time accepting this guy was like \\"a brother\\" when he's dumped on us out of the blue.In a novel that leaves us with an Odd with lots of time to reflect (as we read endlessly about some setting details), what shone for me in his ponderings was the seriousness of Odd asking some cosmic questions. Questions that evil makes us ask. I really thought Koontz did a great job of anchoring the metaphysical with the physical. He's great at metaphors, so no surprise. Anyway, by the end of this part of his story, Odd comes to some serious cosmic recognitions. As his writer pal says: He already knows. He must just recognize. After facing another example of human evil, Odd faces the truths he already knew. And that many of us readers know, too.By the end, he's ready for a different phase of life, a change, and so we'll go on with Odd to his next place and quest. He's a terrific character, one we can love and root for and one we wish to continue to learn about.This is a good read. This has some thrilling moments. This has some scary moments.

In fact, it was hardly supernatural, at least the first one had the bodachs.Dean Koontz introduced a new character in Odd's life, Danny, who wasn't in the first one at all, nor he wrote that Odd knew about this character. Danny seemed to came out of nowhere and gets kidnapped in the first chapter, and till the book ends, we hardly know this character other than he has bone disease and he's lonely.Most of the story takes place in a burnt out casino, which the setting is boring. There are really only three bad people in this story, two don't talk, and the female that talks a lot.The climax wasn't hardly a climax but a swim for survival, and Datura, the female character, gets killed way too easily by a mountain lion than Odd himself.How come the ghost don't actually guide Odd Thomas? And where was Elvis all this time?"},{"Title":"Forever Odd: A Novel","review":"So much action packed in the Zen of Oddie, with a truly icky bad girl whose turbulent soul is the opposite of good Odd's calm nature. Not so many plot twists as twisted villains, three of whom are actually corpses already.

Even if you haven't read Koontz before this series is a great time to start. Odd is possibly the most complete character I've ever read in a series."},{"Title":"Forever Odd: A Novel","review":"I've never been a fan of Koontz. His (over)use of description led me to scan the pages and just bogged me down. I have the same problem with Stephen King, incidentally. On audio, however, what a JOY! I bought Odd Thomas at a second hand store (on cd). Where in reading, the descriptions got tedious and distracting, in audio, the writing is pure genius. The description coupled with the narrators awesome and strangely soothing voice let my mind see exactly the scene as if I were watching a movie. And as I mentioned, the narrator on the cd has a voice that is SO perfect for our friend, Odd. It's exactly how I imagine he would sound were he a real person and not one of fiction.Once I finished listening to Odd Thomas, I literally could not wait one minute to order the next in the series, Forever Odd. I ordered it on Amazon, got it (used) a couple days later, and have enjoyed it as much as the first book. The narrator is the same so the consistency of Odd's \\"voice\\" was somehow comforting to me. It's rare that I find a character that so pulls me in and grips my attention, but I give huge kudos to Koontz for the creation of Odd and his friends.

He sees dead people, he can see evil Bodachs who are dark shadow demons that feed on death and fear, he has premonitions and he has radar like senses that let him find someone by just thinking about them. Odd finds out that a friend of his since childhood has disappeared. Using his talents he finds him after a long and arduous journey through a very long water tunnel.He finds his friend in an old abandoned hotel and casino that was destroyed by an earthquake. His friend is strapped to a bomb and Odd finds out the entire plot was to trap him so a woman obsessed with his special talents can meet him. What follows is a battle royal where Odd fights for his life and that of his friend.Dean Koontz has created a character in Odd Thomas that my wife and I just love. He is a natural born hero who just happens to have supernatural powers. The plots and characters for the Odd Thomas books are kind of crazy but I view them as light reading or listening for enjoyment. He simply gets himself into so many problems while he just wants to live as normal a life as possible. Well, as normal as it gets when you can see dead spirits.My wife and listened to this book on audio CD. The narrator, David Aaron Baker, does a wonderful job and I have come to see him as the voice of Odd Thomas.I can't wait until the next Odd Thomas book!"},{"Title":"Forever Odd: A Novel","review":"DISAPPOINTING - This was nothing more than an Odd Thomas monologue with characters that just pop up out of nowhere, with almost no personality, and end up dead in unimaginable ways. The few pages that contained dialogue and interaction between characters were mostly stilted and uninteresting and added little to the story line. If the test for the story was logic and reasonableness, this one comes in way short of the mark. There was little of Dean Koontz's humor, adventure, storytelling, or anything else that makes most of his books \\"can hardly put it down\\" adventures. I've read over a dozen of his books and this one is on the bottom of the list of my favorites.Luckily I purchased this book through my Kindle account, so I can simply delete it. I have done that."},{"Title":"Forever Odd: A Novel","review":"I really enjoyed this book! The whole plot basically took place in one area, the old decrepit casino, and it was always mysterious. It's my first Odd book and I can definitely say I'll be reading more of the series. I like the way Odd thinks and what he encounters. The other characters throughout were very interesting and at times pretty freaky. A lot of tunnels and underground scenes that made me feel like I was there!

If someone took one of those 'how to write books' and plotted out the key events I can't image there being more than 4. Now I don't mind my novels straighforwards and even don't mind short. But I do mind plotless wonders than %50 of the material is the main character mincing around thinking about things.That coupled with a couple of unexplained duex ex machina type events towards the conclusion (or I admit possibly by the end of the book my attention wavered due to disinterest) leaves Forever Odd low down on my star rating."},{"Title":"Forever Odd: A Novel","review":"I really enjoy a good series. I enjoy a good main character even more. This has both. The second installment of Dean Koontz's Odd Thomas series was, for me, an enjoyable read. Still grieving from his loss in book one he finds himself again in the role of Hero to a young boy in grave danger. Odd's PMS (not the one you're thinking) usually gives him the upper hand but this time it just might be his undoing.

Being such a huge Odd fan, I was anxiously awaiting the sequel. Now that I've read it, however, I am thouroughly dissappointed. Koontz's heart simply wasn't in it. It lacked the epic scope that I felt \\"Odd Thomas\\" contained. Nearly the entirety of this book takes place in the casino, and that alone disappointed me a great deal. Of course Koontz's writing is superb, as it always is, but the story itself lacked the richness and complexity that I felt the first contained. Another problem: N O B O D A C H S ! ! In fact, I felt that there wasn't enough \\"ghost action\\" in it period. The villian is a psychotic phone sex operator. Enough said there.

I never put it down, read it cover to cover in one day. \\"Forever Odd\\" just isn't as compelling and emotionally involving as it's original. Sure, it still has Elvis and the witty banter but it doesn't connect with the audience the same. The whole situation and events seem a little too far fetched, even in the world of \\"Odd Thomas\\". A close childhood friend goes missing, that's all I'll say about the story. Where was this friend in the first book? No refrence to him/her and many other details just don't quite cut it for me. How the story transpires is just amusing. I love Dean Koontz but he mailed in some of the story, as much as it pains me to say it.Bottom line: If you read the first book and loved as I had, this sequel is a decent read, just don't give your hopes up.

Many slight bumps went into the unsmooth storytelling. At chapter nine and ten, it threw me off that Odd was chasing the van where the kidnappers were and then, suddenly, in chapter ten, he was back at his friend Ozzie's place? When I read it the first few times, it seemed like a chapter or two had been cut. Too sudden.From chapters Eleven to Twelve, he was still at Ozzie's then he went to the Blue Moon Cafe? I didn't have any sense that Odd walked out of the house.2) here's some potential ***Spoilers*********************The villain, or anti-Hero/paradox Odd was an annoying character. Didn't like her a bit. Her demise wasn't exactly what I was hoping for, and I didn't know how she died until I had to re-read it for a third time.She didn't seem at all fitting in Odd's world, and her appearance left a bad taste for me. I don't like having the \\"evil v. good\\" theme played out here. Somehow, I didn't get that sense in the first book that was how Odd was supposed to be....She, also, despite being derranged, didn't seem at all the \\"villain\\". The \\"typical villain character\\" was missing in her. Too comical to some extent and she had the expectant ending.3) Danny. I liked him and didn't like him. Also, his appearance in the book was all too short. Odd talks about him a lot, but he appears for brief moments. Not enough for me to enjoy him. And, there wasn't much of an 'ending' with him not being in the last few pages of the book.4) A certain crispness in interaction between Odd and the villain was missing. Didn't seem genuine enough.5) oh yes, Elvis-ghost is getting old. Let's have a new ghost companion, already.Okay. To the things I liked:1) Odd grew as a character, and stepped out of his world. He became a \\"hero\\" when he needed to be.2) His trickery of the \\"villain\\" with the poltergeist thing was original and cool.Overall, not as satisfactory as the first one. Still, a good read."},{"Title":"Forever Odd: A Novel","review":"I didn't care for this book for the most part. I skimmed through his journey through the flood control tunnels and his actual encounter with the chronically stupid villainess, Datura, who left me cold. I'm still not sure what her 3 henchmen, Frick, Frack, and lizard-skin man actually were. Are they acolytes, sex slaves, zombies . . . ? Koontz gave one of the horsey henchmen some extra character development but he didn't go further. That'd how bad Datura is! She was so irritating that I was hoping for some worthy action from Cheval Robert. My favorite character in this book is Terrible Chester the Cat (although he still didn't pee on anybody's shoes.)The Good Stuff: Odd's relationship with Danny, the kidnapped son of Dr. Jessup whose murder started this tale. He is suffering a medical condition called \\"Brittle Bones\\". Think that movie UNBREAKABLE. Anyway, I thought their close friendship was affecting. Amusing patter continued about the Venusian slime beast trading card-- even through the jam they were in.You also saw for the first time Odd's proactive treatment of ghosts that he did see. (Unfortunately there weren't enough of them. It was Doc Jessup, the ghosts in the casino, and the irrepressible Elvis.)I keep forgetting Odd is only a 21-year-old. He's really surprisingly self-aware for his age. For a young fry-cook who's lived in Pico Mundo all his life, he's pretty sophisticated. AT that age, I had the vocabulary and the world-view of a jar of peanut butter. Still-- it was what kept me turning pages. That and his longing for his lost Stormy (who died in the previous book: ODD THOMAS) and how it has colored his life.Wait for the paperback."},{"Title":"Forever Odd: A Novel","review":"I had hoped for great things from this novel and for a bit it looked like I would get them. However this just was not a very well written novel. For reasons as to why check the discussion below."},{"Title":"Forever Odd: A Novel","review":"I will start off by saying I loved Odd Thomas. It was one of the best books I have ever read. It evoked almost every emotion a man can feel out of me. It was just incredible in every way. Unfortunately, with a book that great, the expectations are high for the next one and they just weren't met, not nearly.Forever Odd is an entertaining thriller at best. It was suspenseful at parts, interesting, but it seemed the character of Odd Thomas was just thrown in so it could be an Odd Thomas novel.First of all, almost the entire book takes place at the same spot, which got incredibly boring.In the first book I felt extremely connected to Odd's relationship with Stormy, and Wyatt Porter. The relationships are what made the first book. In this novel however, I did not feel any of that. Apparently, Odd is supposed to be best friends with the kid that was kidnapped, but there wasn't nearly enough explanation in the book so that I could feel connected to the kid.Also, I just wasn't afraid of the antagonist in this novel. She was uninspired, and again, I didn't feel anything towards her.As I said before, this was a good thriller, but compared to the first Odd Thomas, this fails in comparison. I just didn't care about any of the characters. I know it is hard to live up to a great novel, and Odd Thomas actually refers to this near the end of the story, but this was not even close."},{"Title":"Forever Odd: A Novel","review":"I have been a long time Koontz fan, I was given this book as a gift two days ago and finished it in two sittings. This book is a work of art; the characters are deep real people, the plot is like an underground roller coaster, you never know how deep and fast it will go and how long the ride will take. At just over three hundred pages the book is an easy read with clear, easy to follow metaphores and imagery that pixar is jealous of. This book is perfect for anyone regardless of age or reading level. this book not only told me a great story but left me with a feeling of euphoria. I am impressed that Koontz could fit so much soul, emotion, and imagery into so few pages."},{"Title":"Forever Odd: A Novel","review":"The horror genre is usually characterized by creepy ghouls, gruesome gore, sinister fiends and over-the-top heroes. You are less likely to find sorrowful ghosts, humble narrators and humor. Dean Koontz's latest novel, FOREVER ODD, is a horror story with ghosts torn between this life and the next, a reluctant 21-year-old hero, and yes, humor.FOREVER ODD picks up where the recent ODD THOMAS leaves off. Our protagonist, Odd Thomas (his real name), is recovering from a bloody showdown with a deranged killer and the loss of his true love. While on hiatus from his job as a fry cook, the ghost of Dr. Wilbur Jessup, the stepfather of Odd's childhood friend Danny, wakes him late one night. Odd can see ghosts, the \\"lingering dead\\" as he calls them. He tries to help guide them to the next life so they can be released from the misery and attachment of this one. Odd is summoned to the Jessup home, where the doctor's body is found. But when he realizes that Danny is missing from the scene of the crime, Odd sets out to save his friend.In the space of two long and dangerous days Odd tracks down Danny and his kidnappers. Readers learn much about Odd: his unique and often burdensome supernatural gifts, his love for Stormy, the wonderful and supportive (if a tad eccentric) friends he surrounds himself with, and his desire for a simple life, perhaps selling and installing tires. Still, there is much to the back story that readers are left in the dark about. What happened to his mother? How exactly did Stormy die? What happened to him last August? Koontz alludes to these things, but the answers are found in ODD THOMAS and he doesn't rehash much.The present tale finds Odd tunneling deep under the town following Danny and who he thinks has abducted him. The trail leads to the ruined Panamint casino and resort, the scene of a large earthquake and devastating fire. In this creepy building, full of ghosts and wreckage, Odd learns that Danny's captors are the insane beauty Datura and her two henchmen. Datura, a phone-sex operator and practitioner of a twisted version of Voodoo, has taken Danny to lure Odd to her. She has learned of his gifts and demands that he show her some ghosts.Datura and Odd play cat-and-mouse all over the Panamint with several frightening confrontations. Odd's goal remains saving Danny, but can he save himself from Datura's clutches as well?What is so humorous about all of this? The humor is not at all in the situation (except maybe the fact that the ghost of Elvis is a companion of Odd's), but in Odd's response to the situation. His humor, his light and offhand way of narrating the story, is funny and witty. Sometimes, though, it is a bit too much: not every statement needs to be followed by a one-liner or funny quip. The other thing that may turn some readers off is the tendency, toward the end of the novel, for Odd to moralize a bit. Yet it is an understandable response to what he has witnessed and suffered both in this tale and in his life.In many ways FOREVER ODD is more an adventure story than a horror tale. But many aspects of a horror novel are present as well. The most compelling aspect of the book is Odd himself. He is an honest, brave, smart and likable protagonist, if a bit damaged and sad. It is not necessary to have read ODD THOMAS before this one because it stands on its own as a complete story, but reading FOREVER ODD first will surely encourage a trip to the bookstore to pick up the novel that introduced Odd.FOREVER ODD is a quick and enjoyable read --- just scary enough for winter fireside reading but not scary enough to keep you awake at night. More character-driven than many horror novels, it is a fun and unique approach to ghost stories and creepy tales.--- Reviewed by Sarah Rachel Egelman"},{"Title":"Forever Odd: A Novel","review":"Dean Koontz is one of the most poetic authors writing in popular fiction.

He is able to see the departed before they make there way from here to there. Sometimes restless souls seek him out and stay awhile. Elvis, for example, is a frequent visitor to Odd Thomas's kitchen.One evening, Odd Thomas is visited by Dr. Jessup. Odd knows the purpose of the visit is to inform him of Jessup's very recent death, which in this case is as the victim of a gruesome murder.Odd's skills have become familiar to the Police Chief and a few others in town. What troubles Odd most right now is the disapparance of Dr. Jessup's son, also 21, who suffers from brittle bone disease.Odd determines that he alone can find Danny Jessup and he sets off on what begins as literally an underground odyessy, ending at an earthquake shaken, fire ravished former Indian casino.Koontz stuns with his unworldly characters. Odd Thomas is creepily real. Datura, just about as evil a woman as you'll ever want to meet, is even more creepy and still real. One of Koontz's incredible skills is writing about really weird people, but making them seem as cuddly as stuffed pandas. The man is truely something else.The action, once it gets rolling, is non-stop. Odd Thomas is not a hero in the conventiaonal sense. He thinks way too much, but more or less manages to remain intact, though a lot of folks who come into contact with him do not.Like I said, I'm not sure I'd want Dean Koontz as a neighbor: the man's imaginaion is frightening --- and he writes truly fine books, such as \\"Forever Odd.\\"Jerry"},{"Title":"Forever Odd: A Novel","review":"All his books reach the bestseller lists, and no wonder.

And, eventually, Koontz moved away from horror novels.Good luck trying to come up with a name for the kind of book Koontz writes now.

The chase part needs editing.I listened to the audio and the narrator was very good."},{"Title":"Forever Odd: A Novel","review":"Koontz's novel \\"Odd Thomas\\" was clearly a bigger hit than anticipated, because his publishers have urged him to continue the story of the twenty-something fry cook who sees dead people. The result is \\"Forever Odd\\", which sees Odd left deflated and dispirited (not literally - he still communicates with ghosts) after the soul-shattering conclusion to his previous misadventure. Now that his desert town of Pico Mundo has returned to its state of relative calm, Odd wonders if he'll have time to rest and repair himself. Unfortunately, fate has something else in store for him. A young and very twisted lady has taken interest in the man with the unwanted gift, and has abducted a young and vulnerable friend of Odd's in order to get his attention.Through his character, Koontz made it clear in the first novel that he intended to keep the tone light and the story swift-paced. He kept his promise for \\"Odd Thomas\\", and has done the same for the sequel. Every page in this novel feels relevant and un-belaboured, making this every bit the page-turner that the cover says.The light tone occasionally feels forced, however, with Odd spinning out weak jokes and sometimes excruciatingly unfunny extended similes. Odd's young friend Danny, who Odd claims has a rapier wit and unparalleled sense of self-deprecating humour, is even worse, making the reader wish that Koontz just hadn't bothered.Aside from that, the story is solid and still often amusing, and very occasionally emotional and chilling when intended. The conclusion and its admittedly minor revelation about the villains of the piece manages to shed a whole new layer to the narrative the reader has just finished, making up for minor niggles with a suitably uneasy conclusion.The third and fourth books are already out as I write this, and I'll definitely be getting the next in the series at least; it looks like the overall story is strengthening significantly with each instalment.6/10"},{"Title":"Forever Odd: A Novel","review":"In Forever Odd, Dean Koontz pits his hero, Odd Thomas, against Datura, a maniacal dark spiritualist and her chevals, French for horses, but animated corpses for followers of voodoo.Odd is propelled into the story - which starts a little slow but more than makes up for it once it shifts into high gear - when his long time friend, Danny Jessup is kidnapped for the sole purpose of drawing Odd to the voodoo queen.Koontz's unique brand of humor is in full force with Forever Odd, but as usual this only acts to strengthen the story as Koontz pulls you deeper and deeper into the plot.

Shortly afterwards, Odd decides to do things on his own and it was from this point on that I found myself skimming pages.

After reading the first book where the main plot was to stop a mass murder I was interested as to how this would top that. Well, sadly at first it seemed to fall short of Odd Thomas. I thought that in this book Odd is only searching for one person and I was expecting so much more. Well as I passed the mid point of the book wondering how much longer this could drag out, I received a twist to the story that boosted my interest again. I will not reveal the twist for fear of a possible spoiler, but it was enough that I kept going intently wondering instead of how much longer this would drag out, but what is next. Not one of my absolute favorite books but I did enjoy it more than I thought I would."},{"Title":"Forever Odd: A Novel","review":"Odd battles psychotic madwoman to save his friend. The main action takes place in a burnt out hotel in the middle of the desert replete with ghosts to help Odd defeat mad bitch and henchmen. I am still not convinced these books are meant for an adult audience. Trite plot, trite writing. You get the impression even the author was marking time, filling his page quota. If this be hell and I had come here on a rescue mission then it was my soul I was saving. This is a sample muing of Odd as he wanders through the bowels of the hotel with evil one in hot pursuit. maybe not an exact quote as I can't check on the kindle but you get the idea. Givem our friend Odd is a virginal fry cook who spends most of his time chasing evil it begs the question how his soul would need more saving. He never covets anything, lives a monastic life and etc. So this sentence in the book jarred and annoyed me. Its a not very deep thriller - it didn't need the dimestore philosophy as well. I did not enjoy this and really struggled to finish. I read in bed and just kept nodding off on this one!"},{"Title":"Forever Odd: A Novel","review":"Not as good as the first...but a good read. I will probably read the next one in hopes it will be as good as the first...."},{"Title":"Forever Odd: A Novel","review":"IT was a good read. I think it was a let down follow Odd Thomas. Look Forward to the Brother ODD, must reviews Koontz gets back to the Odd Thomas and the writing style in book 1"},{"Title":"Forever Odd: A Novel","review":"After reading the first Odd Thomas book and wanting to like it so much, but not really being impressed and finding it hard to warm up to Odd as a character, I still decided to give him another try with Forever Odd.Sadly, it only gets worse which makes me think Koontz is not so good with sequels after finishing all 5 of the Frankenstien books which he wrote after the Odd Thomas books. I'm seeing the same patterns here with the series starting off pretty good but losing steam fast by the second book.In Forever Odd, he's out to save a dear friend who has a fragile bone disease much like the Elephant Man, some kid close to his age who we never met in the first book. Instead of getting authorities involved, Odd sets out to do it all on his own by using his psychic magnetism to lead him through underground tunnels to an old abandoned indian casino wrecked by quake and a fire where the friend is being held hostage by a crazy sex phone operator and her zombie-like mute body guards.Unfortunately, Odd's journey through these tunnels and through the ducts of the casino take up well over half of this book! I seriously began to wonder if Koontz had come across some old blue prints of the archictecture of a casino and was so mesmorized by them that he just had to include them in a book. I now know more about elevator shafts, drain pipes, storage closets, copper piping, and crawl spaces than I ever thought I'd want to know!I think his intention was to build suspense, but all it did was bore this reader to death. And by the time the good suspenseful parts did come around, they weren't all that good or didn't last long. I would like to finish reading the series, but will definitely be taking a break from it for a while."},{"Title":"Forever Odd: A Novel","review":"First off, this should probably actually in the 3 1/2 star range.Jumping back into the Odd Thomas series was nice and I wasn't sure how effective the series would be after the events of the first book, however, stepping back into Odd's life was an easy and pretty comfortable fit. While this book is not quite on par with Odd Thomas - what sequel ever is - and has lost some of the charm of the first book, there's still plenty to enjoy with Odd and his quirky sensibility and humor. Ghost Elvis is still hanging around as are most of the regulars from the first book, though at times they felt a little forced into the story.The main villain was very interesting and very memorable and their scenes together were almost always compelling. She was not really like any \\"villain\\" I have run into in quite some time and I appreciate originality when and wherever it shows up. Still, there was far too much of the book of Odd either traveling to the place where he believes his friend is being held hostage - by way of sewer/flood tunnels - or him navigating a burnt out old hotel where the climax takes place. Literally chapters are spent describing these journeys and while some of it is necessary to setup the story and provide context, it was a bit tough at times to push through some of it. I also thought the \\"reverse physic magnetism\\" stuff was a bit far fetched and really thought the lengths that the last bad guy went to to track Odd down were a bit over the top.Still, these somewhat minor glitches in an otherwise enjoyable story. Odd remains an interesting, warm and compelling character to follow and I'm looking forward to continuing the series when I find some time to revisit the series. Recommended if you're already a fan of Odd Thomas but it's certainly not as good as the original."},{"Title":"Forever Odd: A Novel","review":"You take chances with a used book... but when dealing with this company they take the chance out of the transaction"},{"Title":"Forever Odd: A Novel","review":"I bought this book on cd for my sister.

If my opinion changes, I promise to update this review later on.My main problem was that it is very different from the Odd Thomas we grew so fond of in the first novel.We have this new best friend that wasn't even mentioned in the first book, we have a secret military base nearby, that was also somehow omitted before, we have underground tunnels leading to and from parts of town and that base, we have a cynical and grieving main character searching for his kidnapped friend in the form of Christopher Snow, oops, I meant Odd Thomas.It's not that it's a bad book. It's just that it smells too much like a Moonlight Bay book, rather than it's prequel, Odd Thomas that I really loved.It's true that Odd just lost his love interest and that he is bound to experience a change in character, but the readers expect the book to have at least the same pace as the first one, and this one doesn't.I will update if the remaining 49% will make me change my mind.UPDATE:Finished the book. It's not a bad book, but my opinion remains the same.

Two stars."},{"Title":"Forever Odd: A Novel","review":"This book continues the adventures of Odd Thomas, Dean Koontz's loveable hero who sees dead people. Because of his paranormal gifts, Odd gets dragged into some dangerous adventures. The events of this novel occur over the course of one action-packed day, in which Odd risks numerous dangers to help a friend.I do not think this book is as good as Koontz's first novel in this series,Odd Thomas; however, I did enjoy it quite a bit. The first novel introduces the reader to a cast of delightful characters. The quirky inhabitants of Odd's hometown are what made the book so entertaining, and the plot was involved and mysterious, providing the necessary suspense. This book, by contrast, focuses almost completely on Odd, who is alone for big chunks of the narration. The plot is less mysterious, and more of an action-oriented adventure. The villain was a little more interesting than the villains in the first installment, but the overall entertainment value is diminished because Odd's extremely interesting friends have faded into the background.One other aspect of this book that will either delight or infuriate readers is the narration's tone. In the narration, Odd mercilessly mocks the sacred cows of the politically correct establishment. These passages are the fun bits."},{"Title":"Forever Odd: A Novel","review":"Forever Odd was thoroughly enjoyable. Dean Koontz is a wonderful author and his narrative is fast paced and very enjoyable to read. If you have never read the Odd Thomas series, I would definitely recommend starting with his first book and read them in the order they were published, it makes the books easier to follow."},{"Title":"Forever Odd: A Novel","review":"First off i will start by saying when i read this book i did not know there was one before it.my one main complement about this book is that Dean set it up so well in the beginning i didn't even suspect there was another novel before this one in the series. it was not till later in the book i wondered about it.the story line was somewhat interesting as a whole and had some nice nuance like the brugmasia(totally butchered the spelling) tree and other things but the main villian seemed paper thin to me. just didnt seem great in the end. i plan on reading odd thomas so i can continue on to brother odd.my suggestion is if you want to read this cause of the series, my impression is you will be disapointed after reading the first. But if you are like me and stumbled on to this one before you read any of the other ones you might enjoy it alot.one of the only Dean Koontz books i have any complaints about."},{"Title":"Forever Odd: A Novel","review":"When I first tried to read this novel a year ago, I thought, \\"What a disappointment\\". I was expecting the same page turning excitement, the same wonderful characters that we grew to love, the same...Odd as the original. But, instead, it just seemed like there was something missing. I put it down half way through. I couldn't take it anymore.I picked it back up recently and started over with a fresh, open mind. It wasn't long before the story grabbed me and I found myself in Odd's psychic magnetism again.I gave it 2 stars because I had already rated it last year and I could not change it. If I could, I would up it to 4 stars. I suppose if I had not read the first book right before this one when I first tried it, I may have at least finished this one to see what happened the first time.This is sort of like when they ruin a good movie with a lousy sequel. I look forward to reading \\"Brother Odd\\", his next adventure."},{"Title":"Forever Odd: A Novel","review":"Koontz should do nothing else from now on but tell the story of Odd Thomas. I thought this was a totally enjoyable and intriguing follow-up to Odd Thomas. What is missing, i suspect, for many readers was the love story Odd had with Bronwyn, which was heart-wrenching and beautiful and likely not repeatable. I expect Koontz to write at least twelve more Odd Thomas books or I will yell and scream like Datura."},{"Title":"Forever Odd: A Novel","review":"Count me as one of those who has read every Koontz back, some more than once, going back many years. I used to view a new or as yet undiscovered Koontz book as such a treat, something I'd reward myself with when I found time to read. Not this time. I've thought that his writing has been rather variable of late - some good stuff, some not. This is not.In the first place, I'm not sure what the point of the book was. With his best books, there's so much going on - suspense, a tale of good vs. evil, heartwarming characters, an actual plot, etc. With Forever Odd, there's none of that; it's basically just an extended chase scene. In fact, my heart sunk as I was reading the book and realized that that was all it was - just a chase through this old casino. If that was all I was interested in, I'd just rent a shoot-em-up movie for a few bucks and save myself the effort.Secondly, there are all these hints of omens and dastardly things that are then left unexplored, so we're left with a psycho villain who gets randomly eaten by a mountain lion. Huh? Compare that to the ending of Hideaway and how that villain goes - that's an excellent Koontz book, one that also has great character development.Finally, maybe it's just me, but I rolled my eyes when I saw the name Datura, especially after he kept talking about the supposedly so poisonous brugmansia (as an aside, if a plant were THAT toxic, people wouldn't be allowed to grow it!). As a gardener, I know that Datura is a climbing vine with big, fragrant flowers, and while popular, is also toxic, though not so toxic that it's dangerous to have around, certainly. So was there supposed to be some connection between the neighbors with the brugmansia and Datura? Seems like that was another random thing he threw in there but never explained.Quite frankly, I'd be embarrassed to recommend this book to friends who haven't read Koontz's best stuff. For a great Dean Koontz book, read Lightning - one of my favorite books of all time, by any author. His best books have me so involved that I'll actually tear up, or go back and reread some of the best parts, because I don't want the book to be over. I wound up skimming through this one because it was so tedious and boring, and I was annoyed that I wasted any money on it. He really phoned it in on this one. Reminds me of Mad Libs. Insert name of character and a few actions (\\"Then 'Odd Thomas' wound up at a 'casino' trying to kill off 'psychotic woman' who is brought down by 'help from guardian angel' - no, scratch that, let's just make it a 'mountain lion') and voila, instant novel to pawn off on loyal readers. What a shame."},{"Title":"Forever Odd: A Novel","review":"To get a few things out of the way first: I've read some of Dean Koontz's work before but wouldn't call myself a big fan. And I had not read \\"Odd Thomas\\" before reading this book on a recommendation from a friend. I see now in reading other reviews of \\"Forever Odd\\" that many who loved the first book found this sequel lacking, and I can certainly understand why on many levels. Still, at first I was quite engaged as I found the main character so interesting and the setting easy to fall into. For me it was a \\"first discovery\\" of Odd, so even though I knew I was missing the backstory on the other characters and his earlier adventures, I was eager to keep reading.I found myself struggling to keep up my enthusiasm once the main action really kicked into gear, however. And I'm using the term \\"action\\" loosely as the endless pages devoted to Odd's underground tunnel journey was difficult to plod through. The burned-out hotel setting was a bit more interesting, but then we are introduced to a trio of very cartoonish villains and again my enthusiasm was waning.The main disappointment, however, was the rather ludicrous final confrontation with the main \\"Big Bad\\". It's a complete let-down of a Deus Ex Machina that's practically an insult to the readers who have made it so far, expecting something more dramatic and satisfying.Still, I can't rate the book too poorly as I did enjoy Odd as a character and I liked his narrative voice. I was left absolutely wanting to read more of Odd - just hopefully with some better plotting to match what such a great character deserves."},{"Title":"Forever Odd: A Novel","review":"I love Odd Thomas! I love the series. But this one went over the edge. Not like any of them are true, but they have an authentic ring to them. This one gets silly and loses the character and feel of the others.

I found her annoying & stupid when she constantly responded w/ \\"liar.\\" She sounded like a little spoiled brat. I would have preferred her to be more of an intelligent sex vixen - more like Eve in \\"Dark Rivers of the Heart.\\" Instead Datura sounded like a stupid bimbo & bored me to tears.The other problem I have w/ this bk. is that Odd is supposed to be best friends w/ this guy named Danny. To me this character came from nowhere.That said, I still found the bk. entertaining from beginning to end & I could not put it down.This book should not be read before the 1st novel \\"Odd Thomas\\" since it spoils the endings of the first book."},{"Title":"Forever Odd: A Novel","review":"This book is average at best.

Of course, I really enjoyed the first Odd Thomas book or I wouldn't have gone after the 2nd. Actually, I bought the 3rd thinking it was the 2nd but that is a whole other story, luckily I only read 10 pages before I realized my mistake.But anyway, this Odd Thomas book feels like the wrong cheese in the middle of your sandwich. You have a good first book and from what I read (and hear) about the third, a good conclusion coming but you have to somehow get to that conclusion--hence--Forever Odd (which let's face it the title itself is a bit cheesy!)Odd's voice and actions are forced. I understand the intent is that this is Odd (who is not a writer) writing about his \\"adventures\\" but it comes across as muddled. I like the character of his friend Danny and the initial crime that opens the book but the reason for the crime etc seem very forced.I am still going to read the final book but I am glad I am done w/ this one. I try to give the author's I read one bleh book so I'll chaulk this one up for Koontz. Don't give ma 2nd one please like King did!!!

With his usual artful style, Koontz flips your emotions as if on a remote control. You feel the fear of the situation, the tension, the thrill, and then flip right back into laughter... and awe. Koontz can tug at your heart strings, but leave you with enough humor that you aren't completely devestated and can smile in spite of it all.Odd Thomas is a special character. He is one we should all strive to emulate. Compassionate, intelligent, humble, yet confident.

This is more of a chase novel than the first installment. Odd chases the bad guys(tag your it), then they start chasing him.

I read it on an hour and 1/2 bus ride. My seat mate was reading over my shoulder when I got to the end. I liked the brotherhood bond between Danny and Odd. I also really liked how he spoke to the ghosts. A great read."},{"Title":"Forever Odd: A Novel","review":"I never thought it possible for me to give a 2-star rating to a Koontz novel. It sounds weird but I loved the first book of the series, ODD THOMAS, and gave it a 5-star rating without hesitating ! For at least 3 reasons, YOU REALLY SHOULD read the first book before even thinking about FOREVER ODD :1- Forever odd contains dozens of spoilers from the first OT book. Anyway, if you have to read one book from the series, the first one is definitely the best.2- This sequel doesn't present the series characters at their best. They are less credible and profound. The writing is floppy and much less rigourous than the average Koontz. After reading Forever Odd, you may not want to read a Odd Thomas book again. If you have read the first book, you may forget about this one and give a try to the third and upcoming fouth books.3- The book contains a few important elements (descriptions, events) required to understand the story correctly. The book is not that good, so if you haven't read the first tome, you won't even appreciate the few \\"good\\" parts of the plot.The main vilain is not credible and the ghosts featured in the story are less important and interesting. Odd Thomas is still a great character, but was funnier, smarter and more entertaining in the first book. Still, he is the one who raised my rating to 2 stars (alright, maybe 2 1/2).Overall, not a real bad book, but not a masterpiece. Entertaining, easy to read, nothing more. The ratings for the third book, BROTHER ODD, seem much better. I will have a look at it because I really enjoyed ODD THOMAS."},{"Title":"Forever Odd: A Novel","review":"Loved Odd Thomas, so I couldn't wait for this. One word: BORING. Koontz mentions how his villainess drones on and on and on ... so does he. Lots of words; little reason for them. Nothing happens over and over again. The last few chapters had me groaning to get through them."},{"Title":"Forever Odd: A Novel","review":"Dean Koontz's Forever Odd is the second in his three novel mini-series about Odd Thomas, a young man who shares his life with assorted living and dead beings, some human but many not. The book opens as Odd (supposed to have been named \\"Todd,\\" but for a typo on his birth certificate) awakens to find long-dead Elvis Presley with him as usual but also Dr. Wilbur Jessup, a kindly radiologist, who is anguished but cannot speak, only wringing his hands and attempting to express his dual grief: first at having been recently murdered and second for the future of his seriously disabled adopted son. From there, the tale becomes increasingly bizarre with the genuine intermixed with the unbelievable in both events and characters. However, after trials and tribulations with both living and dead characters (mostly human, but not always), and equally strange settings, the plot, having been knotted, sorts itself out and the conclusion is more or less normal. The reader has a better concept of what happened and how it occurred, but nothing absolutely certain. Read Odd Thomas for pleasure, for surprise, for amazement. It's just plain a good read."},{"Title":"Forever Odd: A Novel","review":"Ok, well it wasn't ODD THOMAS, but it wasn't what Ms. Persnickity said it was either. If your looking for the Golden Globe of books every time you read your in for a surprise. The Storyline had good meat, imagination and just enough cliff hangers to want me to continue on and on. I 4stared it because it was just not the read Odd Thomas was, but nor was it a 3star either.Odd Thomas had one thing Forever didn't and that's ODD moved around a lot more with various things happening that kept adding to the plot. Not that Forever NOT having those was the reason for it being any less of a story, I'm just stating that that is an apparent difference, at least to me.Still, as usual, I was captured by the storyline and enjoyed the read enough to be proud to keep it in my hardback Koontz Collection.

Highly recommend!"},{"Title":"Forever Odd: A Novel","review":"This is a very enjoyable reading book. Just beware - you may be sleepy at work tomorrow because you will not want to put it down to go to sleep."},{"Title":"Forever Odd: A Novel","review":"One of my favorite things about Dean Koontz is the Hook: He usually comes up with a supernatural or quasi-scientific phenomenon that I cannot figure out right away. Something really weird will happen at the start of the book, and I will devour the book to try to figure it out.Usually, the mystery gets solved about 1/2 of 2/3s of the way through, and the solution is typically pretty cool. The rest of the book will be fun because by then, I care about the characters and I like a good, satisfying resolution. The villains are ruthless and relentless and the plot is Terminator-fast.One of my least favorite things about Koontz is the Cheese: His dialogue and interior monologues are often so forced and cutesy. He tries really hard to be funny but instead winds up smarmy and artificial.Forever Odd omits the Hook, leaving only Cheese. If you've read Odd Thomas, you already know that like the kid in The 6th Sense (a bit too much like him, in fact), Odd can see dead people. And even if you haven't, Koontz explains this right away in this sequel. So the hook is absent and the only other mystery is why his friend gets kidnapped, but it's not really much of a mystery. Plus, the villain is absurd and not the least bit frightening.So the book didn't draw me in at all. Also, Forever Odd is almost all cheese. Odd makes all sorts of oh-so-cute observations and wisecracks, none of which is either cute or funny.Worst of all for me, though, may be how religiously dogmatic Mr. Koontz is growing in his old age. Now, sure, you can say that it's only the voice of his character, Odd, except it isn't. This stuff runs through most of Koontz's recent books.In the Koontz worldview, all universities seem to teach is anarchy, godlessness and solipsism. The human race is a tribe of desperate, amoral cretins. No one any longer ascribes to what Koontz refers to as \\"the Truth,\\" with a capital T. Other religions (other than Catholic, that is) are pagan superstitions, and anyone who is agnostic or atheistic is by definition amoral, as though it is impossible to have a moral code or live by the Golden Rule without reference to a higher power.As much as I enjoy Koontz when he shines (see Intensity for a great yarn), I need that Hook, I hate this Cheese, and I really could do without the religious arrogance and chauvinism. It grows old. Really old."},{"Title":"Forever Odd: A Novel","review":"I'd been waiting eagerly for the sequel to Odd Thomas, and I devoured Forever Odd as quickly as I could. Odd Thomas was a tough act to follow, and unfortunately I don't think Forever is quite worthy.The story is entertaining enough; by itself it would make a pretty typical Koontz thriller. I half suspect that that's what happened: Koontz adapted an already-concieved villain and setting for a successful hero. (Okay, I'm being more cynical than I should.) But it's more of a rushed-Hollywood-style sequel than a good book sequel. It was fun to see the people again, but I still fell like I'm waiting for the real followup novel.If you enjoyed Odd Thomas, by all means read Forever. It's a suspenseful thriller, and it is fascinating to see how the very believable residents of Pico Mundo, including Odd, have been carrying on. If you haven't read Thomas, try that on for size first."},{"Title":"Forever Odd: A Novel","review":"The trouble with writing a sequel to such an explosive, compelling and well received book such as Odd Thomas, is that it needs to equal its predecessor. I can't say I was exactly blown away by Forever Odd, but it just didn't seem to be in the same league as Odd Thomas. I did find myself skipping the Ramblings of Odd, and thought the demise of Daktura was kind of corny. However, the book did hold my interest and it still at times had the same quirky humor I enjoyed in the First. Odd's friend Danny has Brittle Bones and is kidnapped by phone freak, Daktura. From information gleamed from Danny, she is curious and keen to meet with Odd and encounter the uniqueness of his gift. I sympathised with Odd after his rollercoaster adventure and near death experience, especially as he realises he is still no closer to being with his lost love, Stormy. Perhaps more supernatural intervention may have made this a better read."},{"Title":"Forever Odd: A Novel","review":"While I enjoyed the writing style of Forever Odd, as I enjoy Dean Koontz's writing overall, the story line lacked the edge of your seat suspense and creepiness that has kept me a Koontz fan for many years. I listened to this book on CD, and found my attention repeatedly wandering--something that doesn't usually happen when I'm listening to Koontz novels. Odd's supernatural powers and his ability to see ghosts were almost thrown in as an afterthought. In the first Odd book, I liked the parts with the bodocks. They were non-existent in this book, and I was disappointed that all the \\"villians\\" in this movie died with no supernatural assistance. So, my reaction to this book was that there was nothing very special or memorable about it."},{"Title":"Forever Odd: A Novel","review":"Koontz is one of the most prolific writers of our time. He can write on any subject you can imagine. But... after reading him all of these years, I notice that he has three basic styles of writing. The first, and for me the best, can be seen in \\"The Watchers\\", where every paragraph was important and you came to care about all of the characters.. even the bad ones. That is a stay up all night book. Then there is the second style - which I call romance pacing... lots of descriptive prose that doesn't always need to be there... seems like he has fun coming up with the plot and then gets bored and just writes filler as he is actually crafting the story. Third is a book like this one - not a bad book, but the writing is actually too fluid... the whole book reads at the same pace... you know where the humor will come and lighten things up. Some other reviewer mentioned that they thought his computer had written the book. I am figuring that Mr. Koontz' brain was just on cruise control. After all, he has written enough books to come up with a best seller without too much effort.To conclude... I like the book - I think all of you who like his style of story will like it also. I just hope he challenges us more as readers on the next one!Happy Reading,Jay"},{"Title":"Forever Odd: A Novel","review":"Many reviewers seem to love this book, while others lambast it. Yes, \\"Odd Thomas\\" was a fantastic story with a wholly original character; no, \\"Forever Odd\\" doesn't live up to the first tale. That said, I think this book has been unfairly criticized.Koontz again takes us into the life and mind of Odd Thomas. Once more, Odd is on a mission to save lives. He's not your typical hero; rather, he plods along, submissive to his gift and the urgency it demands. This alone makes him a likeable fellow. In the last book, we had his romantic interests and his family history to add to his depth. This time around, Odd ruminates on his past while facing the potential death of a dear friend, but the fantastic prose and lyricism of Koontz's writing can't lift it past the thin storyline.Okay. So it's not the masterpiece of its predecessor. Nevertheless, \\"Forever Odd\\" moves along quickly and gives us a fascinating and horrific villain. Although some timely coincidences come into play, the action is different and intriguing.Despite its weaknesses, Koontz's novel shows why he is considered a craftsman of the language. I enjoyed another day in the life of Odd Thomas, even if it didn't match up to our first encounter."},{"Title":"Forever Odd: A Novel","review":"After discovering the lovable psychic boy Odd in Koontz's prequel, Odd Thomas, I was ecstatic to find that there was a sequel on the horizon. My excitement was shortlived. Not long into this book I realized that my reunion with Odd would hold none of the excitement and originality as encountered it its predecessor. Quite literally, 50% of this novel describes Odd's journey to find/save his childhood friend. 50% of nothing but descriptions of scenery, underground topography, and casino ruins. When the action finally begins, readers are still left wondering,\\"Huh?\\" One simply cannot deny this author's command of the English language, but it could be suggested that he revels in it...resulting in long, belabored thoughts and sentences by Odd that seem ridiculously inappropriate in times of crisis.Clearly, there will be another tale in this series. One can only hope that this author is more kind to both Odd and his readers in the next installment.DYB"},{"Title":"Forever Odd: A Novel","review":"Awful. I am a koontz fan, and I liked Odd Thomas. However, this book is 10 page short story disguised as a novel. This is a case of a talented author churning out crap to make a buck."},{"Title":"Forever Odd: A Novel","review":"This follow-up to Koontz's \\"Odd Thomas\\" begins with the aptly named central figure, Odd, a year older and decades wiser after the horrible events that occurred on August 15 when Odd lost the true love of his life, Stormy Llewellyn. Odd continues to use his gift to see the dead and correct the wrongs that occur in this world while grieving Stormy's death. Odd awakens one night to see the ghost of Dr. Jessup, the adoptive father of his best friend, Danny. Dr. Jessup has been murdered and Danny is missing. Danny suffers from a condition in which he has brittle bones, making his kidnapping more treacherous. Odd uses his psychic magnetism (where he can focus on a specific individual and then locate that same individual) to find Danny and Danny's captors, Datura, Robert, and Andre. Koontz compares Datura to the goddess Kali with her fascination with the occult and her zombie-like followers, Robert and Andre. Koontz again interweaves humor with horror as Terrible Chester and Elvis reappear in this second installment in the Odd series. Odd is more introspective in this novel than in the first but it was overall very enjoyable and action-packed."},{"Title":"Forever Odd: A Novel","review":"Dean Koontz has always been hit and miss with me. I either really like his books, or really dislike his books. However, his first-person narratives (the Odd Thomas books and the Chris Snow books) have really struck a chord with me. This latest installment is excellent.You must say this for Koontz. Most authors, when faced with a popular character (in this case, either Odd or Snow), are happy to keep churning out yearly installments and beat the characters into the ground by continually placing them in uninspired stories (i.e., Patricia Cornwell). Koontz, on the other hand, although one of the most prolific writers around, continues to try new and different things. He only comes back to the popular characters when inspired. In this case, the wait was worth it.The key to a first-person narrative (I believe) is that the reader has to grow to actually like the narrator and be invested in his/her future. You can't help but like Odd Thomas. His wry, deadpan commentary on the weirdness going on around him pulls you into the story.While I certainly look forward to any future adventures of Odd, its OK with me if Koontz waits 3-4 years (as long as there is another Chris Snow story in between). I'd much rather have periodic excellence than yearly mediocrity."},{"Title":"Forever Odd: A Novel","review":"Not long after Odd Thomas became a hero in the town of Pico Mundo by taking down a sniper at the local mall with plans of blowing it sky-high, Odd finds himself once again helping out both the living and dead.His best friend, Danny, who suffers from brittle bone disease, is missing from his home where he lived with his adoptive father, Dr. Wilbur Jessup. Dr. Jessup had only minutes before arrived at Odd's apartment seeming to appeal for help--he was, like so many people who drift in and out of Odd's life--no longer alive in the real world. He had been murdered, and now Danny is missing.Odd sets off to find his missing friend, using his \\"physic magnetism\\", as he calls it, and finds a woman who is so desperate to experience supernatural activities that she'll use Danny as a pawn to get what she wants.With the same cast of characters fromOdd Thomas--Ollie, the overweight novelist; Terri, Odd's employer and friend; Chief Porter, the town's police head; Terrible Chester, Ollie's cat; and the ghost of Elvis--Odd is set upon another adventure that contains murder, mayhem, and one bad-a** evil woman.This continuation of one of Koontz's best characters is a true winner. I read the book in one day, and I'm left with wanting to know where Odd will go from here. After the death of his beloved fiancee, Stormy, the previous August, Odd has been slightly adrift--and at the end of FOREVER ODD, we get some indication of where his life is leading, but not a clear-cut picture.Definitely another winner by the incomparable Mr. Koontz, FOREVER ODD is not a story to be missed."},{"Title":"Forever Odd: A Novel","review":"Another funny, quirky Koontz type adventure with our favorite Elvis seeing character, Odd Thomas, who, whilst saving a crippled boy from a mad would-be voodoo princess and her two zombies, ponders the meaning of life as postulated by a jolly fat detective-writer / cook and nails it! His reason for why things are as bad as they are (e.g. Voodoo princesses and zombies murdering a crippled boy's father) are pretty much what I hear in Church and believe. Can't wait till Odd, in the monestary where he went, figures out also what the answer is - stay tuned. Another good read for fans of the New Koontz."},{"Title":"Forever Odd: A Novel","review":"(3 & 1/2 stars) Mr. Odd Thomas, the repeat main character in Forever Odd, makes the book pretty a rare event for Dean Koontz. He hardly ever uses a lead character more than once. My own choices for a repeat character probably would NOT have included Odd, but I was a little surprised (positively) by this 2nd Odd book. I actually thought it was better than the first one, although still with some flaws.The plotting is relatively tight, and the suspenseful story moves along briskly as Odd finds himself in increasingly more jeopardy as he attempts to rescue a friend from an extremely dire situation. How he uses his supernatural gifts was interesting, and the villain was somewhat unusual. In the midst of all that, I also appreciated Mr. Koontz's inserting humor, such as this comment by Odd:\\"Considering that I frequently find myself in a patch of trouble and that I'm not by nature a walking machine of death, I should be more diligent about educating myself in the arts of destruction and assassination.\\" Koontz is good about placing humor in a tense or dark moment.Unfortunately the story kind of weakens at the end, with a preposterous and more-or-less unexplained trick performed by the author (a bad idea after his major plot twist in the first Odd Thomas novel, a device which borrowed heavily from The Sixth Sense movie). And post-rescue, he (Odd) spouts some meaningless mumbo-jumbo bits of philosophy that annoyed me. Up until the last 30 pages, though, Koontz had me reading with pleasure and interest."},{"Title":"Forever Odd: A Novel","review":"I thought Forever Odd was an enjoyable read. I think Dean did a good job giving Odd a new story. I thought it was a good story. Dean Koontz has an interesting mind to say the least."},{"Title":"Forever Odd: A Novel","review":"I used to love Koontz' books - couldn't wait for the next one to come out. But the \\"Odd\\" books - ridiculously dumb and boring. Its as if someone else has been writing books for him lately. These two don't hold a candle to his earlier works like \\"Lightning\\" \\"Watchers\\" or \\"Sieze the Night\\". I got through about half of Odd Thomas, and about 4 chapters of Forever Odd before I decided there are many more reading opportunities out there, no sense in my wasting my time on something I didn't enjoy at all. A ghost Elvis - really scraping the bottom of the barrel.........."},{"Title":"Forever Odd: A Novel","review":"\\"The dead don't talk. I don't know why.\\" Odd Thomas isn't your ordinary 21 year old. He has the ability to see the dead, though they lack the ability to talk to him. In Koontz's first introduction to the character, we met Odd (yes, that's his real name) and the quirky residents of Pico Mundo, alive and dead-including Elvis. Odd's tragic story had a powerful ending and surprises thrown at you constantly.Several months have passed since the events in Odd Thomas. Odd is on a leave of absence from his job at the grill. He still has frequent ghostly visitors who seek his help. One visitor in particular sets a chain of events into motion that threaten to be too much even for Odd this time. A childhood friend is missing, and Odd's search for him will lead him into a confrontation with someone even more evil than the protagonists from his last adventure.Dean Koontz has really changed his writing style in recent years. Whereas his old novels tended to be overblown with more fluff than a king-sized goose-down pillow, his recent books have trimmed most all of the fat to give us a rocket ride adventure. Forever Odd is no exception. The entire book covers a matter of hours of \\"real time\\", leaving little time for those endless rabbit trails he used to go down with his characters (if you lived through False Memory or The Bad Place, you'll know what I mean. The characters are memorable, but they tend to ramble on incessantly with interior monologues). There are still places in the book where a little trimming could have come in handy, but it's nowhere near as bad as it used to be.The book only slows down at the end, which is a shame. The final confrontation between Odd and one of the villains goes on far too long, getting tedious after a while with the \\"I'm safe...no, wait, there they are again\\" chase scenes we see too often. And the book almost refuses to end. Like a guest at a party who refuses to leave after the party is over, the book seems to linger a little too long after the climax is over. But that is the only weak spot in the story. The character of Odd Thomas is a nice guy who just happens to have a strange talent. Even Danny, the boy who gets him into so much trouble, is easy to sympathize with. The baddies in this book are cold-hearted, with great motivation for their actions.Not a lot is given away about the first book, but two major plot points are mentioned, so if you haven't read it first, I'd suggest doing so. While not as good as the first Odd Thomas story, it's still an entertaining read."},{"Title":"Forever Odd: A Novel","review":"koontz is one of my favorites. this, however, was not one i will recommend."},{"Title":"Forever Odd: A Novel","review":"Forever Odd is a sequel to 2003's Odd Thomas which in my opinion is one of Dean Koontz's best books if not the sharply written one. And with this book he is still on a role, this is the seventh novel in a series of consequetive novels that are just about his best (starting with 2002's By the Light of the Moon and continuing with The Face, Odd Thomas, The Taking, Life Expectancy, and Velocity).Well, any way-the book begins six months after the events in Odd Thomas. It begins as Odd is sleeping then is awakened by something. At first he believes it is Elvis (who for some reason is still haunting this world instead of moving on). But it is the spirit of a friend's father. Following this spirit Odd finds out that the man is dead and that his friend (who is afflicted with a brittle bone disease) has been kidnapped. So the search begins.The villian in this book is probably one of the most vicious and cruel character (other than the villian in the Dean's last book, Velocity). Datura, as she is called (but I believe and so does Odd that this is a name she gave herself), is obsessed with occultism and the mystical and demains that Odd show her spirits. But as we know this is not in his power. So begins a fight for survival.The book ends on a nice note and also solves the Elvis mystery. But leaves you wanting more (and Mr. Koontz has promised more, soon).

Outstanding."},{"Title":"Forever Odd: A Novel","review":"The ending of Dean Koontz's 2003 book, Odd Thomas, left me upset and wondering what would become of its title character. After reading Odd's first manuscript and finding myself totally enamored of him, this second manuscript he's penned, Forever Odd, let me know two things about him: He is managing, although he'll never be the same, without his heart, his soul, Stormy Llewellyn; and he is still a man who cannot sit idly by while evil rides roughshod over the innocent!This time, Odd awakens in the early hours to find Dr. Wilber Jessup, stepfather of his close friend, Danny, standing next to his bed. Knowing that Dr. Jessup would not come into his bedroom in the middle of the night uninvited if he were alive, Odd deduces that Dr. Jessup is dead. If you don't know by now, Odd Thomas sees ghosts. He immediately gets up and dresses, heads out. There is no question that he will investigate in spite of the danger. And there is always danger.At the Jessup home, he finds the bludgeoned body of Dr. Jessup. Odd is then frantic to find Danny who, even though he is twenty-one, as Odd is, suffers from brittle-bone disease and cannot defend himself. At first Odd believes this to be an attack by Danny's biological father who was recently released from prison after serving time for murder. However, after a complete stranger uses a Taser on Odd, leaving him twitching on the floor, he has to reconsider his theory.Danny has been kidnapped, but something much stranger is going on here than a mere abduction. The action is fierce and at breakneck speed. The pace reminded me of INTENSITY, another favorite of mine by Koontz.This book's villain is \\"crazier than a syphilitic suicide bomber with mad-cow disease.\\" And the villain's followers will gladly obey any vile orders given them. Odd Thomas really has his hands full this time.Will he rescue Danny? Will he, himself, get out alive? Frankly, I thought the ending of the first book was hair-raising enough. But Koontz, diabolical as he is, gives a new meaning to hair-raising with this book's ending.I'm hoping we haven't seen the last of Odd Thomas."},{"Title":"Forever Odd: A Novel","review":"Love the Odd Thomas books and hope hope hope Dean Koontz comes out with more!"},{"Title":"The Rise of American Air Power: The Creation of Armageddon","review":"The Rise of American Airpower by Michael Sherry represents the new breed of military history. This book is about the physical, organizational and technological advances which affected the United States armed forces in peace and in war. It is not a record of the battles and campaigns of World War Two. This is a cultural history which seeks to explain the rise of strategic air war. Sherry set before himself the massive task of understanding how humans could delude themselves to the point where they could seriously consider the horrors of conventional mass bombardment and later nuclear warfare as an abstract idea.Sherry identifies three related developments which his study should address. These are the creation of the apocalyptic mentality, the creation of an apparatus for realizing that danger, and the creation of the modern nuclear dilemma. Sherry decided to limit his dealings with nuclear warfare and deal with that last issue primarily in comparison to the first two issues. What Sherry is after is an understanding of the bomber in the imagination of the American public before and during World War Two. He believes that to understand wartime developments one needs to know the story of the rise of American airpower and perception of bombers and bombing in the popular imagination. He suggests that after WWI aircraft became inextricably linked to civilian uses. Airplanes were immediately familiar in their civilian role and had practical peacetime applications. Sherry suggests that these factors resulted in the imagined use of the bomber often outpacing the practical realities of actual bombing. According to Sherry, \\"the warplane was created in imagination before it was invented as a practical weapon.\\" In this way Sherry focused his study of the social and cultural history to explain the rise of American airpower.Sherry arranged this book in a generally chronological format with ten chapters. The chapter titles almost tell the story themselves, they are \\"The Age of Fantasy\\", \\"The Age of Prophecy\\", \\"The Decline of Danger\\", \\"The Attractions of Intimidation\\", \\"From Intimidation to Annihilation\\", \\"The Dynamics of Escalation\\", \\" The Sociology of Air War\\", \\"The Sources of Technological Fanaticism\\", \\"The Triumphs of Technological Fanaticism\\", \\"The Persistence of Apocalyptic Fantasy\\". Although he occasionally deviates from a strict chronology, the primary diversion from the format is the chapter on \\"The Sociology of Air War\\". In this chapter he looks at the actors, the generals, civilian expert advocates and aircrews of the bomber forces.In his opening chapter, \\"The Age of Fantasy\\", Sherry starts not with a direct examination of the airplane, but an examination of the popular civilian perceptions regarding technological advances in warfare during the nineteenth century. This is the base upon which his later arguments rest, and I believe that it is a solid base. Sherry notes that the airplane was \\"like a host of other weapons invented or imagined in the nineteenth century and celebrated for their capacity to diminish the \`evils of war'.\\" Sherry points to the writings of such well known people as Jack London and Victor Hugo as evidence of this social phenomena. In fact, as early as 1864 Hugo stated that airplanes would make armies \\"vanish, and with them the whole business of war, exploitation and subjugation\\". Others made similar claims for Tri-Nitro Tolulene (TNT), the machine-gun, and the large caliber artillery piece.These claims and perceptions did not end with the nineteenth century, rather they accelerated prior to the First World War. Civilian theorists exaggerated the destructiveness of new weapons so that they might inflate their power to keep the peace. Sherry also draws a link between the nature of nineteenth century war and the popular perceptions. In the civilian imagination wars were short, and although bloody for a few days, relatively cheap. (The American Civil War was generally overlooked or seen as an aberration.) They took this as substantive evidence that their theories were correct. These two factors combined to lay the groundwork for consideration of air bombardment of civilian population centers. Their logic suggested that if war was inevitable, then a short war is best. The best way to have a short war is to use terrible weapons quickly and be done with the matter. With these thoughts in mind the world entered WWI.Sherry deals only briefly with World War One, but the treatment is important. It is important not for what was learned, but for what the world did not learn from the first war involving significant numbers of aircraft. During World War One both Germany and Great Britain experimented with the first strategic bombing raids. These raids were not the result of military theories regarding civilian production and demoralization. They occurred as a series of raids then reprisals motivated by popular civilian demand for vengeance on both sides. No specific targets beyond \\"the enemy\\" were sought or targeted, hatred was the primary motive in a Europe locked in a stalemated war. The lesson that was missed was that bombing civilian population centers does not necessarily result in panic, chaos and surrender.During the 1920's America and Europe underwent what Sherry calls \\"The Age of Prophecy\\" with regard to military aviation theory. The two most significant events of this period were the 1921 sinking of a battleship by Colonel Billy Mitchell and the 1927 solo trans-Atlantic flight by Charles Lindbergh. Sherry sees these two events as uniting to form, in the American national psyche, a positive opinion towards aircraft as expressions of individualism in the wake of mass warfare. Americans, a people that had never been bombed from the air, saw aircraft as marvelous inventions. They tied grand prophecies to the powers of these machines. Together, the effects of cultural imagination and prophecy formed in the American mind a benign image of the airplane. From that image Americans began to see the bomber in a similar light, powerful yet somehow detached from the actual horror that they could potentially inflict. Sherry claims that in this way the military theories and forces required to actually conduct a bombing campaign advanced faster than any debate on the legality or morality of doing so."},{"Title":"The Rise of American Air Power: The Creation of Armageddon","review":"This book is a very comprehensive and authoritative account of the birth and the growth of the U.S. air forces. This is the best book I have read on this topic, and the work is so detailed and encompasses all aspects of the evolution of air power from the first theorists of what air warfare would entail to creation of a separate branch of the military for the Air Force to what the future may hold for this aspect of warfare.Mr. Sherry goes into great depth writing about the philosophy behind the men who helped to create the Air Force and those who fought for it. At its beginnings it was thought (much like nuclear weapons) that this method of warfare would be so terrible, so horrific that it would force an end to all war. It was thought that an attack on a nation's capitol or major cities would cause the civilian populations to panic and flee causing economic collapse and thus quick ends to any war. Of course WWII completely eradicated this myth. Instead of a new weapon that assured no more war, air power just became a an aspect that ensures that the price of war is increased and is now paid by civilian and soldier alike.He also chronicles the failures of combat thinking, planning and philosophy during WWII. Hundreds of thousands of people died in useless bombings that had no strategic value whatsoever and did not hasten the end of hostilities at all. The fire bombings of Japan and the Dresden bombings were examples of the needless destruction of innocent lives. Mr. Sherry details many of the fire bombings of Japan and gives the reader the Japanese (or victims) perspective of this horrible new weapon.Mr. Sherry discusses the strategic limitations of this warfare and why it failed to bring about the surrender of the Axis powers even with the horrendous tolls it took during the war. He discusses how air power still looms as a potential disaster for all people.This is an extremely thorough and scholarly look into all aspects of air power, and how it affects warfare and peace for every nation. It is a fascinating read and one that I felt taught me so much that I would not have gotten from any other single book. If you only read one book on air power make sure it is this one because it is the only one you will ever need."},{"Title":"Safety Pharmacology in Pharmaceutical Development and Approval","review":"i will be greatfule to send me the imp pharmaceutical journals"},{"Title":"Royal Icing: Intermediate Techniques [Sugarcraft Skill]","review":"This is a book that i will keep but i do not believe i'll ever put it to much use.It has very good picture's,and some very,very nice cakes.I was hoping it would show alot of royal icing flower's,it only show's 7.The 7 that it does show the picture's are very small &amp; there isnt much detail on how to make them.I was also hoping for several royal icing figure's.Not much of those either,just 3.They also use royal icing to completely ice the cake in,yuck!

Certainly centrist, it lifts up the vibrancy present in a denomination that has too long been described as the &quot;frozen chosen.&quot; It portrays the Presbyterian Church (USA) as a dynamic denomination, &quot;always reforming,&quot; on into the 21st Century --taking the world and the Scripture seriously.Relevant? Absolutely. Beginnning with 2 essays followed by 2 sermons, each section lends itself to study by an individual or within a group.Section 2 was especially appealing as it discusses the hospitality of God and it's role in shaping the church that &quot;believes in an unchanging Christ in an ever-changing world...&quot; (Bohl, p. 71).There are many giants present in these pages and their wisdom is worthy to consider...

I very much would like to read the work as Whitman presented it, without interjections from an editor or some other new person whose voice for me is an interruption.This editor presents this work as a means for writers to find inspiration for their own work, and attempts to guide or at least aid the reader in that project. For someone like me, for whom writing (and reading) is intensely personal, and who prefers to work directly with the text, without intervention, this is just not the right book."},{"Title":"Leaves of grass,","review":"Walt Whitman is one of the most famous, widely read, and influential poets - one of the few who can truly be said to have revolutionized poetry. Free verse's true originator, he broke free of formal shackles way back in 1855, nearly three quarters of a century before it became standard. He proved that great poetry could be written without traditional trappings - and it has never been the same. Many, including me, think it has gone too far in the other direction, but this is not Whitman's fault; his work is undeniably great, and we have in many was long since suffered weak imitations. There is simply no equaling him, much less replacing him; his work is as essential a part of American literature as Mark Twain's. He is indeed the Twain of verse, to be anachronistic - as monumental, all-important, and epoch-forming as Twain was in prose. Technicalities aside, this had almost as much to do with subject matter; Whitman famously self-proclaimed \\"America has a bard at last!\\" - and so it did. He freed American poetry from European heritage, making truly national art that both defined its era and instantly became timeless, speaking to the heart of all that America and Americans stood and stand for. The great poet of democracy, he preached the gospel of westward expansion, celebrated America's natural beauty, extolled its unique history and exciting new status, championed its values, chronicled the Civil War, dramatized the struggle over slavery and other national debates, and generally held forth about the country's unmatched cosmopolitanism in all areas from ethnicity to landscapes. He also somehow managed to write about sexuality with unprecedented openness and vigor, striking a blow against Victorian prudery that would eventually prove fatal and even laying the foundations for non-heterosexual identity. Accomplishing even one of these deeds would have been truly remarkable; Whitman did them all.Yet he published only one poetry book - 1855's Leaves of Grass, which went through several updates through his 1892 death. He not only continuously added poems but extensively revised older ones, sometimes dropping some and moving others. For example, the original and final versions of his masterpiece Song of Myself are substantially different. Many key poems were there from the start, but some of the most famous and best - including the Civil War and associated Abraham Lincoln ones - came later. None of the many poems added late in life were nearly on par with prior masterpieces, but nearly all were worthwhile. Whitman wanted the 1892 edition to supersede the rest, and editors have nearly always complied; it is by far the most popular and widely available and the one that nearly all readers will want.And what a version it is! - hundreds of poems plus several prose prefaces and a prose afterword over nearly five hundred pages. To have so much greatness in one book - especially from one person - is near-unbelievable; the depth of Whitman's achievement simply staggers. Nearly all the poems are worthy, and many are great; quite a few are pure masterpieces. Included are some of the all-time great poems like \\"Song of Myself,\\" \\"I Sing the Body Electric,\\" \\"Crossing Brooklyn Ferry,\\" \\"Out of the Cradle Endlessly Rocking,\\" \\"When Lilacs Last in the Dooryard Bloom'd,\\" \\"By Blue Ontario's Shore,\\" and \\"Passage to India,\\" plus many superb short poems. Anyone even remotely interested in poetry must be familiar with these; there have always been some for whom Whitman just does not click, but even they must be prepared to deal with him, so great is his influence.Great as the 1892 Edition is, it is possible for both hard-cores and casuals to complain. Many of the latter will say that it is simply too imposing - too many poems, too many pages. I certainly would not advise anyone who has read very little or no Whitman to jump right in; it is definitely a lot to take in at once, and the poems are by no means of equal quality or importance. One would be far better off reading a selected edition first, but everyone should come here eventually; indeed, nearly all will want to after the first tantalizing taste. Conversely, diehards have always complained about various aspects, from poems it leaves out to various changes made to included ones. The most important omission in my view is Whitman's original prose introduction, which served as his poetic manifesto. The dedicated will of course want to seek out this and every version of every poem, but their complaints are of interest to very few. The 1892 Edition will satisfy nearly everyone.This is not the most deluxe version; one can find various critical editions with extensive commentary, notes, etc. as well as variorum versions. However, this is one of the most widely available and is very affordable. Taking this into account, it has fairly generous supplemental material: a good basic Introduction, a short glossary and bibliography, and an index of titles and first lines with original and final publication dates. This is the ideal Leaves of Grass for most, but everyone should have it in some form. It is one of very few books truly essential for all. Even those who do not like poetry may well like Whitman, and anyone even remotely interested in American literature, history, or culture must be acquainted Leaves, so thoroughly has it penetrated popular culture and entered the American consciousness. Bookshelves missing this might almost as well be empty."},{"Title":"Leaves of grass,","review":"Choosing the fullest, most complete version of Whitman's text, before the final editing of the deathbed edition, but following the additions made after the Civil War, the Norton Critical is a must have for students of poetry, or literature, and of nature. The wild, ecstatic hunger for the world, the ravishment of the senses, as Norman Mailer put it (though not about Whitman), the mysticism of the flesh, Whitman is, arguably, the most accomplished poet of American letters.A must read for poets, students, and pagans (Whitman as spirit of the Green Man himself!)."},{"Title":"Leaves of grass,","review":"If you read only one peice of American literature this should be it.

It has all the hope and romance of every individual young and old but also the strife and sadness we all experience. I take it everywhere I go!"},{"Title":"Leaves of grass,","review":"In the three days I have had The Modern Library's edition of Whitman's 'Leaves of Grass', it has become my favorite book. It is a beautiful celebration of the passions in life, awakening and tantilizing the reader as no other book of poetry has ever done (for me). I look forward to passing this beautiful book and its passion for life on to my children."},{"Title":"Leaves of grass,","review":"Whitman's &quot;Leaves of Grass&quot; is a collection of some of the finest American free-verse poetry ever written. Outward from his home on Brooklyn, Whitman soars out over our great nation, painting a sweeping portrait of mid-nineteenth century America and its diverse inhabitants. Whitman covers a panorama of ideas and themes, from lofty, aloof musings on the nature of man, to piercing depictions of the horrors of war. Gems of wisdom hang from Whitman's web of of verse like dew drops - easy to see but hard to grasp. This is a powerful work, and a never-ending source of beauty. Unfortunately for me, I am not a big fan of free verse, making this work harder for me to enjoy than I had hoped.Which edition do I recommend? That really depends on what you are looking for. If you are just interested in getting a taste of Whitman, I would recommend some of the abridged versions. I don't feel that reading all 700+ pages of Whitman's poetry is necessary for anyone but his biggest fans and students. For a complete version, I found the Modern Library edition acceptable, but nothing spectacular. This work has a multitude of editions, and I would recommend actually holding them in your hand before making a decision on which best suits your needs."},{"Title":"Leaves of grass,","review":"Although the poems are beautiful... and I certainly don't mean to bash Whitman with this 2-star rating... it's the wrong book. NOT AS ADVERTISED. This was supposed to be the original 1855 edition. That's what I expected, and therefore (in my mind) what I was paying for. The original 1855 edition, according to modern literary analysis, was the \\"strongest/purest\\" version. It was the true starting point of Whitman's own (and consequently America's) poetic awakening. Consisting of just 12 \\"perfect\\" poems, it was THAT edition which Emerson praised so highly.Whitman never put out another book... just revision after revision, addition after addition, and edition after edition of Leaves Of Grass... until you wind up with \\"the deathbed edition\\" which is a severely bloated and different work from the original.I was very much looking forward to a slender volume of the original edition. Which is what the item description says this is. It's not. Be forewarned... it's the Deathbed Edition of 1892... nearly 500 pages. And frankly, there are MUCH better versions of the deathbed edition. Sturdier versions with nicer pages exist (this is a pretty weak paperback, printed on pulp pages), with better footnotes and more authoritive introductions. Shop around.To sum up... the 2 star rating is because lying about which edition this is, is a terrible way to sell the book. Whitman was fantastic and the poetry contained in the book itself is first rate. It just would have been nice to get what I paid for. The \\"true\\" editon, written by a YOUNG Whitman at the height of his powers..."},{"Title":"Leaves of grass,","review":"Words cannot describe the complexity of Leaves of Grass. I am constantly amazed at how well Walt Whitman holds it all together, keeping is hand on one object while amorously praising another. Everything works in perfect cohesion...An unabashed love of self, of nature, of all that is divine and not divine. Leaves of Grass is a truly inspired work...its words are boundless and fluent, rising in an intoxicating crescendo of naked emotion. \\"I am the poet of the Body; and I am the poet of the Soul.&quot; Throughout Leaves of Grass there is an overwhelming theme of unity...unity of man and nature, of man and man, of man and God. Excitable sputterings of ageless wisdom become scattered, but somehow stay anchored to the intricate framework of the book. This sounds contradicting, and it is reminiscent of a line from the book --&quot;Do I contradict myself? Very well, then, I contradict myself; (I am large-I contain multitudes.) After reading this book, you will delight in how large Walt Whitman is."},{"Title":"Leaves of grass,","review":"It's difficult to think of something appropriate to say about a man who spent his life trying to express the panorama of humanity through the lense of his own heart. From a drop of blood to the grandeur of a shipyard or a continent, he takes all readers on a journey wild with raving, raging, sorrow, longing, humbleness and pride. At once he is totally modern and yet rife with history.For readers new to poetry, Walt Whitman is wonderfully accessible. One can pick up Leaves of Grass and virtually start and stop anywhere and pick up something wonderful every time.Not to be missed."},{"Title":"Leaves of grass,","review":"The original edition of 'Leaves of Grass' published in 1855 contained twelve poems only. The subsequent editions beginning in 1856 were to greatly expand the work. Thus I would recommed that anyone who wishes to know the true range of Whitman's work find another selection of his work of which there is a larger share of his great work.Whitman is the poet who Emerson prophesied, the American visionary poet who sang of the complex greatness of the society, and connected his own soul with its expansive facts of life."},{"Title":"Leaves of grass,","review":"The 1855 edition of Leaves of Grass was the first and the best.When I was young I bought the big deathbed edition, not knowing about the 1855 one. I became a Whitman disciple. Either version is a good place to start, but the 1855 is the best version of the early poems and a fine introduction to W.W.The 1855 version was ignored for quite a long time in Whitman studies, but started recieving critical attention after Malcolm Cowley worked to revive it in the 1950's. It was his version that used to be available, until recently, as a Penguin Classic.So whats the difference between 1855 and the Deathbed one?Throughout his lifetime, Whitman not only expanded LOG, his only book, with gobs of inferior-- and sometimes truly awful-- poems (especially when he was older) but he also revised many of his early poems for later editions-- revising them almost always for the worse.The 1855 edition is realtively short and reflects the diminutive, obscure quality of the original. The poems are full of Whitman's original fire before he tinkered with them.Bloom, the author of the introduction, is in the estimation of many America's best living literary critic. He profoundly knows and adores Walt Whitman.If you have the slightest interest in reading American Poetry,drop whatever you are reading (unless it is perhaps Dickinson or Emerson) and get this book. It's still America's best. Nothing since has been (and nothing will ever be) better. The only American poets after Whitman who mattered were deep readers of LOG: Hart Crane, Wallace Stevens, TS Eliot, John Ashbury. (A Ginsberg, C. Sandberg, and O. Paz resemble him superficially but they are are wonks.)If you are interested later in getting all of Whitman's poems, skip all the in-between editions and get the 'Deathbed' Version, which has many good and important poems like 'When Lilacs Last in The Dooryard Bloomed' and 'As I Ebbed with the Ocean of Life'-- as well as many bad ones, to go with your 1855.The Deathbed Version (Whitman approved it as the final Version of his one book as he lay dying) is probably close to ten times as long as the 1855 edition.But Whitman got it right in 1855."},{"Title":"Leaves of grass,","review":"Giving Walt Whitman only five stars out of five does him an injustice. Walt Whitman is perhaps the finest American poet ever as well as the most quintessentially American poet. His poetry never dates itself. It is as contemporary as if he just wrote it last week. Walt Whitman's poems overflow with life and energy, pulsate with excitement, and contain deep though simply-told truths that rival those of any wise man in history. Much maligned during life and after for the eroticism of his writing, he never let his inhibitions hold back his writing and thus it sparkles with honesty. Walt Whitman was also a great patriot, who loved America in a way modern Americans would do well to emulate. He sought it out on its own terms and recorded what he saw in his poetry. His war poems, written during the American Civil War, are some of the best war poems existing in literature. Whitman knew his subject, having spent much time caring for the wounded soldiers in the hospitals and visiting battlefields. His poems create vivid pictures, richly textured, as real as you read them as if you were seeing the scene yourself. And the dialog he carries on with the reader makes the reader feel that Whitman, if he were still alive, would like nothing more than to sit down and discuss life. He is one of the few poets who manages to establish a rapport with his reader, to anticipate his reader's reactions and talk to each one through the poem. Walt Whitman should be read by any and every literate American. 'Leaves of Grass' will change anyone who dares to read it."},{"Title":"Leaves of grass,","review":"The best way to appreciate Whitman is to read him aloud as you walk down a street or the country side.You'd feel electricity stirring within you and all else would change too.Even the inanimate would seeth with life and vitality amidst the gentle choreography of nature.Thats what happens to me when I read &quot;The Song Of the Open Road&quot;.It's amazing that Whitman could capture the deep inherent things we feel inside,things that stir us inside out and yet find it difficult to express.A timeless clasic that will stir people from generation to generation.Nothing like it."},{"Title":"Leaves of grass,","review":"Do yourself a favor and buy this book.

Being a native of Brooklyn myself I feel a deep connection to him. When I read his work I am instantly transported into his universe, a universe which is the domain of every man. For Walt Whitman was possibly the greatest democrat who ever lived.In his great poem, Song of Myself, his opening lines are: &quot;I celebrate myself, and what I assume you shall assume, for every atom belonging to me as good belongs to you.&quot; This is not only good old American horse sense, it's good science. For everything comes forth from that great source of life the sun, and none can be better for it, only different.Walt was a born visionary. And I surmise that he must have had quite a few mystical experiences before he set out to write his great poems. You can really get a sense of his mystical connection when you read poems like When I Heard The Learned Astronomer or even in Song of Myself when he proclaims: &quot;There was never any more inception than there is now, nor any more youth or age than there is now; and will never be any more perfection than there is now, nor any more heaven or hell than there is now.&quot; Notice the emphasis on the word now. Mystics through the ages have said that God is beyond time, that God is the eternal presence, and that he exists in a timeless eternity sometimes referred to as the eternal now. I believe that's what Walt Whitman is telling us.I could go on and on singing the praises of Walt Whitman. His work is inexhaustable and profound and wise beyond measure. But there are innumerable books written about him. However, I believe to catch the essence of the man you have to read his poems.

And he is the one who too speaks of it at the moment of its great outward expansion and hope, as a historical progress of ever rising ever more sweepingly inclusive cosmic concentrical circles. He is a writer who touches the stars, and above all reaches the sense of the light within us (When I heard the learned Astronomer) He touches upon American tragedy ( O Captain my Captain) and most deeply expresses it ( Out of the Cradle Endlessly Rocking) He is the one who takes all America as an adventure and feast for his eyes and lines.

It is, alongside the poems of Hart Crane, Rimbaud, Lautreamont, Blake, Lawrence, Emily Dickinson and St John Perse, a totally singular experience. I have never read anything like \\"Song Of Myself\\" and \\"The Sleepers\\", and I am certain that you will love them just as much.I do, however, have certain reservations about Malcolm Cowley's introduction. It is well-intentioned enough, but I would like to issue a few words of warning, as it is certainly a very confused affair, one that will no doubt perplex many Whitman neophytes. For Cowley, the task of Whitman interpretation couldn't be simpler, one need only look towards Indian Vedic philosophy and Buddhist scripture for an all-purpose key. While this certainly seems attractive and convenient- a lazy expedient for phlegmatic types- Cowley himself realizes that it is totally incongruous with certain aspects of Whitman:\\"Most of Whitman's doctrines, though by no means all of them, belong to the mainstream of Indian philosophy. In some respects he went against the stream. Unlike most of the Indian sages, for example, he was not a thoroughgoing idealist. He did not believe that the whole world of the senses, of desires, of birth and death, was only maya, illusion, nor did he hold that it was a sort of purgatory; instead he praised the world as real and joyful. He did not despise the body, but proclaimed that it was as miraculous as the soul.\\"Having meandered into a cul-de-sac, Cowley's attempt at escape is characteristically sloppy:\\"...it must be remembered that Indian philosophy or theology is not such a unified structure as it appears to us from a distance. Whitman might have found Indian sages or gurus and even whole sects that agreed with one or another of his heterodoxies (perhaps excepting his belief in material progress). One is tempted to say that instead of being a Christian heretic, he was an Indian rebel and sectarian. Sometimes he seems to be a Mahayana Buddhist...\\"Pedants are like spiders- they love cocooning themselves in their own contradictions. All of the difficulties that Cowley encounters here stem from his insufferable compulsion to categorise, and hence domesticate, Whitman. I take issue with this preposterous statement:\\"One is tempted to say...\\"No, Mr Cowley, YOU are tempted to make these conclusions, any sober reader is willing to meet Whitman on his own terms, to delight in his incomparable vigor. Further on, we find the following:\\"Since the Indian mystical philosophies are elaborate structures, based on conceptions that have been shaped and defined by centuries of discussion, they help to explain Whitman's ideas at points in the first edition whre he seems at first glance to be vague or self-contradictory. There is, for example, his UNUSUAL combination of realism- sometimes brutal realism- and serene optimism.\\"Unusual, perhaps, if you insist on translating the poem into Vedic terms. It is a little depressing that scholars are so blind to the revelatory miracles of Leaves Of Grass. Here was a poet attempting to forge new forms of expression commensurate to his time, a capacious, all-enveloping style that would sing the songs of democracy. To thank him for his troubles, scholars do the only thing they are capable of, dragging Whitman into the malodorous mire of comparison. This line is redolent of Plato, this one reeks of Vimalakirti, this shadowy section can be illuminated with the torch of the Gita, all of it is regurgitated thought, relics coated in new varnish.What makes matters worse is Cowley's admission that Whitman had read none of the cited works in 1852. Yet, the empirical evidence admits no contestation- the symptoms of Whitman's mystical paroxysm are largely identical with prior examples. \\"Leaves Of Grass\\", we are told, is another manifestation of the 'perennial philosophy'- for all of its ornate embellishments and flourishes, it is, in fact, not very revolutionary at all. Once you master the rudiments of said philosophy, the swelling surge of Whitman's writing is easily navigable. Here we see Cowley defeated by his own epistemological suppositions. Cowley's method, after all, is that of a good Platonist. Poetry, for him, marks a poet's gradual emergence from anamnesia, a rapturous remembrance of eternal truths.In actuality, the introduction is not really about \\"Leaves Of Grass\\" at all. It is about the scholar's will to power, his inexorable urge to subordinate every literary text to precedent. In reducing \\"Song Of Myself\\" to yet another incarnation of Hindu absorption, Cowley does a severe injustice to a great American poem. He would have us believe that \\"Song Of Myself\\" is little better than a journal entry in verse, a haphazard approximation of a subjective mystical experience that has been repeated throughout history. To further substantiate his claim, Cowley compares a stanza in \\"Leaves Of Grass\\" to a Vedic text, noting their thematic and stylistic similarities. Does this not consolidate Whitman's unflinching faith in metempsychosis? In \\"Song Of Myself\\", Whitman effects the transmigration of souls, channelling the voice of the Vedas. The complacence and self-contentment of Cowley is, for this reader at least, truly vulgar.I am not disputing the notion that Whitman has a consistent doctrine beneath all of his creative output, but the system must be sought WITHIN his texts and NOT without. This is the thought that courses throughout all of Whitman's writing, that of pure immanence. To those approaching Whitman for the first time, I hope you have the good sense to treat Cowley's introduction with the bemusement that it deserves."},{"Title":"Leaves of grass,","review":"One of the greatest pieces of work from the Heritage Press and, arguably, one of the more important reprints of the 20th century.The famous pairing of Rockwell Kent illustrations with Walt Whitman's poetry was first released by Heritage in 1937.

I've been forced to read Song of Myself so many times I can't stand it any more but somewhere in there are some really beautiful lines. But you have to deal with some... other ones sometimes. I don't really enjoy his poetry that much. I value it as important. This specific edition (ISBN: 0140421998) is a recreation of the very first edition of Leaves of Grass. Over the years Whitman added poems and changed some of these so you'd be reading the first draft of some things, so to speak. This is the best edition, in my opinion. It shows Whitman at his freshest and I think he second-guessed himself too much with some of the revisions. Plus this is a pretty thin edition so if you've never read Whitman then this could be a good starter. Don't get me wrong, people interested in poetry should read Whitman. But don't worry if you feel you must put it away afterwards."},{"Title":"Leaves of grass,","review":"In the full bloom of my late sixties, I find too much of Whitman's writing far less rhapsodic or even elegiac than I both remember and am told it to be.

But Walt Whitman was and still is one of the most influential poets I have ever read. He began life on a farm on Long Island, but times got bad and his family uprooted itself and moved to Brooklyn. Brooklyn at that time was a growing city unto itself and trades were needed. Thus Whitman learned the trade of printer. But his soul led him to a higher calling. He became a jounrnalist and wrote poetry. His early efforts did not amount to anything major. Yet sometimes the unimaginable happens in a man's life. A sudden thrust of inspiration strikes one like a bolt of lightning. Then something new and unique is born out of this inception - a new form of poetry - what is today referred to as free verse. Yes, Whitman is the father of the form, and perhaps one of its greatest practitioners. The beat poets who were to follow in his footsteps never really rose to his great height of mystic revelation. I think that's what the other reviewers are talking about when they refer to Whitman's religiosity. For Whitman was the poet of a new world, a new nation, a growing entity that would go on to fulfill an old dream of mankind. That is, the dream of a thoroughly new man, a man who was free from the past, a man who could find his soul was one with the fathomless cosmos. Hence, &quot;Walt Whitman, a cosmos&quot; is a very telling way Whitman has of describing himself to his reader.My favorite poem by Walt Whitman is his &quot;Song of Myself.&quot; It contains the seed of everything he had lived as a human being and every vision he would realize as a mystic of epic proportions. After that, I believe his next great poem was &quot;I Sing The Body Electric.&quot; &quot;Drum Taps&quot; was also quite an interesting addition to &quot;Leaves of Grass.&quot; Also, &quot;When Lilacs Last In The Dooryard Bloomed&quot; is Whitman at his poetic best.So it is without any reservation that I am highly recommending &quot;Leaves Of Grass&quot; to all and sundry as a must read. Especially now, in the wake of 9/11 we need to reaffirm what it means to be American, and I know of no better American Visionary to help in this cause then Walt Whitman."},{"Title":"Leaves of grass,","review":"I love poetry and Walt Whitman is one of my all time favorites. This volume is chock full of his poems, so grab a cup of coffee, curl up in the armchair, and enjoy!"},{"Title":"Leaves of grass,","review":"Whitman wrote as if to me personally. He picked me out as someone many years hence from his perspective, in order to share his world in sufficient detail for me to insert myself into his skin. Through what he put down he came forward more than a hundred years. He is sauntering, noticing the sounds, sights, smells, how he lit up with joy, bittersweetness, fear, self doubt and at times loneliness. He carried me along the river bank at any pace I wanted to go. He would not miss a stride as he adapted to my pace. He taught me how to recline in the summer grass in the cemetery not much more than a stone's throw from where I live, and meditate on his leaf of green summer grass, inviting my soul to enter our picture. I am writing this as a message, an invitation for you, my reader, to get to know Walt Whitman. Don't join the crowd of hate and be put off by the fact that he was gay.I am learning much about making healthy connections, being myself one of the dots I am connecting. I do a little Lazarus raising activity in the cemetery two or three times a week, as I bring back to life my parents, my mother's parents, and her mother's mothers parents. They are in my mind, what I remember and imagine of them, increasingly clearly. There is so much more good will, mutual respect and intimacy aware to me now. I even have group therapy with them.I learned a lot about how to do this from carrying on with Walt Whitman!"},{"Title":"Leaves of grass,","review":"More as a point of clarification than review: the Oxford World's Classics edition is not the 1855 edition.

The typesetting is not ideal.

It is also a shame that the engraving of Whitman included in the first edition of the book is not reproduced.

He takes what seems like existential ramblings, and turns them into beautiful and self-reflective pieces of art. This is not just poetry, it's literally a thesis on life, a philosophical treasure, a song that celebrates being alive, a picture depicting the cycles of life, an ode to the SOUL - simple thoughts, taken to extraordinary levels by an extraordinary man.Although to some, the poems may be too open-ended, long, tedious or verbose to appear enjoyable - but, when you lay bare the meaning behind Whitman's words, you cannot help but feel empowered, aware, introspective, a believer in life, the lover of a human body, and a worshiper of the human soul.

There are some good poems in it which aren't in the original, such as When Lilacs Last in the Door-yard Bloom'd, but there's a lot of pretty weak stuff, too. The 1855 has a small number of pretty consistently excellent poems which are highly original and loosely but definitely connected. Reading it is a very different experience from wading through the bloated, inconsistent final version - there's something Whitmanesque (i.e., at it's best) about the original collection as a unit.

The language, for the most part, is clear and easy. Nevertheless, like most poetry today, the poems are so little different from prose, except in the presentation into lines. Very few poetic devises are used.One may correctly criticize my critique as one who does not appreciate contemporary poetry.

None of his poems are memorable. Not a single line is considered worthy of citing anywhere in literature.I give two stars to the work, simply because I must admit my own incompetence in modern poetry appreciation.

Much praised and criticized when it was first published, &quot;Leaves of Grass&quot; remains a wonderfully innovative, original, observant, wise, sensually unashamed, and heroic portrait of American identity, and a eulogy in praise of American people, places, ideas and things.David Rehakauthor of &quot;Poems From My Bleeding Heart&quot;"},{"Title":"Leaves of grass,","review":"No other poet has described his country all the more so vibrantly optimistic as this great man.His unique descriptions in all it's naked simplicity give life to all the subjects it touches more than most of the flowery &amp; metaphor addled verses one could find.It's so remarkable to the point that at times it's like watching the silver screen on these printed words.His innovations in the world of poetry extending to universal factors celebrating the human heart &amp; mind together with nature's undeniable course while accepting &amp; loving it nonetheless may be a bit awkward &amp; trying to the cynically modern mind,but eventually seeps into the reader heading towards its comforting acceptance.Although some of the poems here may not hold up to the best,one of the remarkable things about this book is that even when I was tempted to bring it down many times,i couldnt.Whitman is the last person of his nationality to ever talk about his country without any negativity &amp; blemish;he is the last American to hold up to his nation's true ideal."},{"Title":"Leaves of grass,","review":"The Kindle edition of this great book is not well formatted, and is thus physically difficult to read. Line breaks appear in the middle of words, not always divided by syllable or in a way that would meet the approval of any author of a manual of style.Having only paid 99 cents for this tome, I can only comment that I suppose I got what I paid for."},{"Title":"Leaves of grass,","review":"While for those more into Whitman's work would probably want to invest in the Library of America's edition, this one is a good start for those who are just starting to read Whitman. So many people proclaim Whitman as the essential American Poet because of his lines showing the beauty of Democracy. Personally, I could have cared less whether he loved Democracy or not. He wrote about life. He wrote about the mundane world, and made it look so beautiful. He admired the human form, and praised the wonderful design of the body. His comments on life in America during the middle of the 19th century really carry a romantic outlook. He was passionate about himself, life, and the world around him. The fact that he inspired many poets around the world in the 20th century gives testimony to him being a poet with worldwide appeal. He was not just a voice for America; he was a voice for lovers of life."},{"Title":"Leaves of grass,","review":"I needed a copy of \\"Leaves of Grass\\" that includes the 1855 prose preface.

It could be called The Complete Whitman. It contains hundreds of poems.I am a senior citizen who had not read any Whitman for more than 50 years and am enjoying it very much. His descriptions of the 19th century's people, places, and inventions are eye-openers. He was actually a feminist before there was such a concept, and also an abolitionist. He truly believed in equality and democracy. He was a nature lover and wanted to protect the environment.Of course, there are parts I could quibble about, but that would be foolish. Whitman was a man ahead of his time."},{"Title":"Leaves of grass,","review":"While I agree with most of the reviews written here, I must take issue with them somewhat. First, I also believe that Walt Whitman is one of the finest poets that ever lived and certainly the finest when it comes to being a proud American. Although, he comes from a time in America that was like that of Socrates and Plato in the past, a time when the most important thing in life was not work, or success or career, but the exploration of one's inner thoughts. Were we living in a time when such a thing was permitable rather than the constant search for the almighty dollar, we might see more such poets. But he and his era are long gone. The art of the word is certainly Walt's. I ask you to also purchase a dictionary when you purchase this or any of his volumes, not because it is difficult to read, but because Whitman doesn't always use a word for it's main meaning, often burying a meaning of a word or line in the third or fourth meaning, completely changing the meaning of the poem. It is such fun and exactly what I believe Walt Whitman is meant to be, a journey and a trip to the celebration of life. A celebration that also includes a look at the worst that is us and the best that is us. When the reviewer wrote that his work is a study of a narcissist, I have to disagree. Yes, it begins his work with Song of Myself and it is an epic poem. But while he celebrates Walt, he is truly celebrating all of us as amazing creatures in nature. He celebrates every molecule of us, the amazing capabilities, perfumes and evilness of us. He studies us as though someone would study the amazing ability of a tree to grow or a flower to bloom. We are nature and he recognizes that and it is amazing to him. Clearly, he had bravado and self-love, but in the most non-imposing way. We wishes all of us to realize the miracle that is us. To believe that he is only about himself is to miss the point of Walt. Also, it is important to read the various editions of this volume. He wrote and rewrote Leaves of Grass continuously throughout his life adding and deleting poems as he saw them. The best way to see his journey is to read the first edition (complete with his swaggering picture), where he was not listed as the author to the final \\"deathbed edition\\" that is truly a masterpiece and you can see what he learns, what he tries to teach you and how deeply you will be moved by him. One last hint - read \\"Song of Myself\\" outloud. It becomes truly a song about life and read outloud can certainly stir your soul."},{"Title":"Leaves of grass,","review":"What more can be said about Walt Whitman's &quot;Leaves of Grass&quot;? This 19th century work is more than just a poetic masterpiece; it is a pivotal landmark in the history of world literature. Read &quot;Leaves&quot; and you will understand why Whitman is hailed as a poetic ancestor by poets, both male and female, of many different ethnic and national backgrounds. His is truly a universal voice.Whitman published the first edition of &quot;Leaves&quot; in 1855, and continued to revise and expand the book until it had grown into the monumental final version. While the &quot;deathbed&quot; edition is an essential text, I'd like to put in a plug for the much smaller 1855 edition, which has been reprinted with an introduction by Malcolm Cowley. The &quot;deathbed&quot; edition may be too large and intimidating a literary tapestry for Whitman &quot;virgins&quot;; the reprinted 1855 edition may thus be a good way to begin exploring the bounteous poetic talent and vision of this giant.The Cowley-introduced edition also includes Whitman's original prose introduction, which is itself a remarkable piece of literature. While the 1855 &quot;Leaves&quot; is missing vast sections of the deathbed version, it is still a stunning work of art that succeeds as a self-sufficient piece of literature and philosophy. In this &quot;embryonic&quot; version of the soon-to-evolve masterpiece, we already discover Whitman's pungent eroticism, his embrace of paradox, and his playful theological exploration. His language is sensuous, outrageous, tender, and amazing, and is full of compassion for all living beings.Whitman is more than just a great poet; his work is a sort of prophecy for both the secular and multifaith worlds. So read &quot;Leaves&quot; in either the embryonic version or the ultimate version, and embark on an unforgettable poetic journey."},{"Title":"Leaves of grass,","review":"Is this FREE edition abridged?

No rhymes to bore anyone, no meter, simply a transfer of pure mental energy. It took me a while to get into Whitman because I knew him thru a lot of boring teachers who tried to squeeze the very life out of these works and inject them with artificial, completely sanitized \\"meaning\\". This is poetry at its most raw. It does for the written word what Stravinsky did with music. It doesn't need dressing up and it utterly rejects the falsity of good manners. As Whitman joyfully tells us of himself: \\"I am not the least bit civilized!\\" This is wild stuff and it'll kick you sideways if you give it half a chance. Read it and then choose the right moment to sound your own barbaric yawp!"},{"Title":"Leaves of grass,","review":"What a lover?! I have fallen in love with Walt Whitman. One such as this writing such passionate things in those times or these...and with such candor. I am so thankful to have read this book. Beautiful."},{"Title":"Leaves of grass,","review":"If you care for literature at all, even if your interest in it exceeds no further than reading the morning paper, Walt Whitman's &quot;Leaves of Grass,&quot; is a must read. He is truly one of the greatest poets, revolutionaries, historians, and Americans to ever live. As a poet, Whitman lures his reader in with work exploding with passion and inexhaustable energy. As a revolutionist, he baisically tore up any rule book to writing, stripping away any limitations, and paving the path for further free, independent thinkers. He was unaffraid to rebel against the narrow-mindedness of his time, making himself a leader as one of the very first poets to ever use &quot;free verse,&quot; a technique rellious on its own. In doing so, this great leader was criticized and looked on disapprovingly for his work during much of his life time, and like many other artists who dare to be unique, his true genius was never fully recognized until after his death. As a historian and as an American, Whitman has taken these works of his and has combined them into the nations most patriotic yet brutally honest text book.It is in writing of himself and his own personal experiences that Whitman imbeds the history of this country, both dark and nationalistic. Through his time working as a volunteer nurse to the wounded and dying soldiers during the Civil War, Whitman writes often of the terror of war, making it one of his most recognizable themes throughout much of his work. He also brings us back to a time in history in which those who believed in equal rights for all, including persons of every race a gender, was considered rebellious; for in such beliefs, Whitman took religions that placed severe restrictions over such things as sexuality, and attacked them. The reason I am so confident in recommending this book to any reader, is that you are given a selection of editions to choose from; the edition you choose for yourself, fitted to your familiarity with the poet. I cannot promise that will fall absolutely in love with this book, every person has their own tastes, however, I can promise that if nothing else, you will walk away from this book with appreciation and understanding the value in reading it."},{"Title":"Leaves of grass,","review":"Walt Whitman's Leaves of Grass is an exemplary representation of both transcendentalism and realism. Walt Whitman was one of the few writers to bridge the gap between these literary movements and Leaves of Grass was, in essence, his opus. It represented the author himself and was often condemned in Whitman's time for it's blatant descriptions and incorporations of sexuality and homosexuality. However, years later it came to be appreciated for what it is truly worth as an exquisite culmination of people, emotions, and the democratic spirit.Of the many themes covered throughout the 438 pages in the ninth edition of Whitman's masterpiece, symbolism was often used to represent allegory ideas and situations. In \\"O Captain! My Captain!\\" the captain symbolizes Abraham Lincoln and America is ship. In the captain's death, Whitman is alluding to the fact that in the absence of strong leadership guiding the \\"ship,\\" there will be a lack of order and chaos. \\"Song of Myself\\" was, on the other hand, explicit in the ideal it depicted. All fifty-two sections discuss intricacies of semi-specific people or types of people; they come together as one poem and are all part of something larger. Whitman believed not only in the individual being but also in a larger being that everyone and everything was a part of, in other words the oversoul. \\"Song of Myself\\" is truly filler in the gap between the literary movements because it is so thoroughly transcendental in meaning, yet so precise in describing reality.Emerson's was completely justified in praising Walt Whitman's work because it is still today very profound and extremely important in respect American literature overall. Unfortunately a fairly high mentality is required to take in his poetry for all its meaning and worth. Maturity and openness is key because often criticism of Leaves of Grass spurns from prudish and thoroughly conservative readers."},{"Title":"Leaves of grass,","review":"Since there was some confusion in the comments section as to what volumes were or were not truly the \\"First Edition,\\" I though I'd confirm that the Penguin Classics version entitled \\"Leaves of Grass: The First (1855) Edition\\" is in fact the first, slim, volume of \\"Leaves of Grass\\" published in 1855. This version has Malcom Crowley's introduction, followed by the frontispiece, title page, Whitman's introduction, and then 12 poems. The poems cover 120 pages, making this a slim, compact volume.

The poetry speaks of Walt Whitman's connection to his fellow man, nature, and to God. It is not to be missed.Leaves of Grass speaks to the turbulent times in which Whitman lived, being the Civil War era. He speaks out against the horror of war and he embraces the spirit of compassion for his comrades. Yet the book is also a reflection on matters relating largely to uplifting themes. His poetry has evoked thoughts about what is of value within my life. Even though it is the product of another era, it speaks to the timeless values of humankind.As the author of a spiritually-themed novel entitled \\"The Misadventures of Sister Mary Olga Fortitude,\\" I look for books that provide food for my soul. This is one that certainly hit home for me. It is also a book written by a gay man. Since I am gay myself, I appreciated the affirming nature of Whitman who embraced his sexuality with little judgment. This was a remarkable example which reflected his inner peace during a time when being a homosexual was not accepted.Whether or not you are a man, woman, gay, or otherwise, this book will speak to you. It will help you to embrace humanity, your spirit, and all of creationDavis Aujourd'hui, author of \\"The Misadventures of Sister Mary Olga Fortitude\\""},{"Title":"Leaves of grass,","review":"One of the greatest pieces of work from the Heritage Press and, arguably, one of the more important reprints of the 20th century.The famous pairing of Rockwell Kent illustrations with Walt Whitman's poetry was first released by Heritage in 1937.

Not really sure it it's the original 1855 edition but I presume it is."},{"Title":"Leaves of grass,","review":"I was familiar with the well-known poems and wanted to own \\"Leaves of Grass.\\" I'm not going to review the poetry, but describe, hopefully to help others figure out what took me some research, its various editions.In 1855 Whitman self-published \\"Leaves of Grass\\" as a 12-poem book. Up to 1892, he added poems and revised the original twelve poems -- books also published under the same title, \\"Leaves of Grass.\\" In 1892, Whitman published (by then, recognized, not self-published) its final version, the edition he wanted to be thought the definitive \\"Leaves of Grass.\\" This is the commonly called \\"Deathbed Edition.\\" It contains over 300 poems. It does contain the original twelve, though not in their original or other previously-published forms. By then, they'd been many-times revised over the years, and released within other publications between the first and the last. In essence, \\"Leaves of Grass\\" was a nearly 40-year evolving work, under the same title, each edition containing the prior editions' poems further revised, plus additional poems.I wanted to read the original poems. I also wanted to see their final versions, and was curious to see their evolution. I noticed that some books include so many evolutions of the poems/book, they fill at least two volumes. I wanted to own \\"Leaves of Grass\\" but I didn't need to become a scholar of it; I wanted to read the book. However, I didn't want only the Deathbed Edition -- I was both curious about the original and wanted to see more than 12 poems.I decided to buy an edition of the book that contains the entire Deathbed Edition, plus a few of the poems in their original form, and some commentary. I believe, after researching, I found the best I could. That would be my recommendation: if this is your first purchase of \\"Leaves of Grass\\" make sure to see some poetry from 1855, some poetry from the Deathbed Edition, and some poetry in between. That is, if what you want to read is the poetry and not own a collector's item or only the \\"definitive edition,\\" as Whitman viewed it (Deathbed). To me, seeing only the final version detracts something from its core -- and after reading the poems and comparing them, I feel this even more -- so in that sense I disagree with Whitman; he chose to make public many books over 40 years, yet wanted only the last to be considered the true version.As a reader, I find it unfortunate that this is a work that evolved over a lifetime under the same title; it renders each addition of poems to the book not books of their own, and also difficult to find on their own. So, for me, the compromise was to choose a book that includes the Deathbed Edition and part of the original, without having to read multiple books, or 1,000 pages, or a scholarly journal (though I would love to see the full original 12 poems).I understand a book will be released soon that includes both the full original (12 poems) and the full Deathbed Editions. I don't have it, so I don't know what else will be included."},{"Title":"Leaves of grass,","review":"Having read only tid bits, here and there, from Leaves of Grass, I found that it was full of truly unique American poetry. Whitman definitely achieved his goal of becoming a truly innovative poet. The fact that he rarely uses any type of meter, rhyme scheme, or exaggerated rhetorical devices almost says that he has mastered the basic fundamentals of poetry and surpassed his peers. He is so far above the simple and frequently used methods that he must create his own fresh and new style of writing. I found Leaves of Grass to be a lot to grapple with as a high school student, especially his philosophy pertaining to Deism, and yet, it was most intriguing and made me want to simply delve deeper into it. I look forward to completing Leaves of Grass and recommend it to anyone looking for truly original forms of American poetry."},{"Title":"Leaves of grass,","review":"I carry a copy of Walt Whitman's Leaves of Grass with me where ever I go.

He shares his limitless love for all Americans, including, of course, himself. I particularly enjoy his frequent usage of listing without commas, which I find livens his excitement for life even more. Whitman, although he may come off as a bit over eager to some, truly makes you realize how blessed you are and how lucky you are to live in this beautiful place, and he reminds us all that we should not take any of these blessings for granted.

This isn't great literature, but it's pleasantly seductive and is told with more flair than many of its genre."},{"Title":"Seducing Sybilla (Zebra Regency Romance)","review":"I both read and write novels. If I enjoy a writer's style, I will read three chapters, regardless, but SEDUCING SYBILLA drew me on, entertaining but with no sense of urgency. Madeleine Conway has a marvelous vocabulary and uses it boldly. The only improvement I might suggest is breaking chapters at plot turns rather than allowing a reader to drift. I saved the last 30 pages to read as I soaked tonight, then inadvertently flipped the book into the bath. After a blow dry, the pages fanned fatter, but the content held true. I look forward to Conway's next effort."},{"Title":"Seducing Sybilla (Zebra Regency Romance)","review":"For me, &quot;Seducing Sybilla&quot; turned out to be a disappointing read. And that was because I couldn't understand how any romantic hero could fall for so hysterical, immature and hot-tempered a heroine as Sybilla Smethwick.After so many years of being ignored by her in-laws, the long widowed Lady Honoria Ampthill is greeted with the news that her brother-in-law, Augustus Swaffam, the ninth Earl of Ampthill, wants to reestablish ties with her and her son, George. Both Honoria and Sybilla, Honoria's younger sister, are natural wary about Augustus's sudden interest in them, but because George is Augustus's heir, Honoria decides to concede to Augustus's expectations. Sybilla however is determined not to be won over easily and to protect her sister and her nephew from the high-handed Ampthills. That is until a string of almost fatal accidents begin to dog George's footsteps. Now Sybilla must put aside her reservations about Augustus and work with him in order to protect George. And the more time she spends with Augustus, the more she comes to like and esteem him. But Sybilla has privately resolved that her happiness and that of Honoria's and George's can only be assured if the Ampthills keep their distance. How then is she to reconcile her growing attraction for Augustus with her need to remove her family from the Ampthills's sphere?From the blurb at the back of the dustjacket, I was led to believe that Sybilla was the more sensible, practical and intelligent of the Smethwick sisters, and that she spent a lot of her time taking care of her sister and her nephew. This, proved not to be not completely true. Honoria is actually the more sensible, intelligent and practical sister. And both sisters are suspicious and wary about the Swaffhams sudden interest in Honoria and George -- not just Sybilla. Sybilla in reality was quick to judge, fly of the handle and blame the hero, Augutus Swaffham, for every unfortunate incident that befell her, Honoria and her nephew George. Her apologies, once she had realized just how much she had erred left a lot to be desired as well. I suspect that the blurb at the back of the book was the reason why I was so disappointed with Sybilla. Whether the fault was mine for misinterpreting the plot synopsis, or how the plot synopsis was written, I was just unable to cope with the very often angry, suspicious and hysterical Sybilla. Which brings me to the other thing I found sadly lacking in &quot;Seducing Sybilla&quot; -- the utter lack of any kind of romantic spark between Sybilla and Augustus. Very quickly we come to realize that Augustus is drawn to Sybilla's beauty and her intelligence. I was never quite sure what Sybilla found attractive about Augustus save that he was, like her, interested in engineering. I probably missed something somewhere since I spent a lot of time wondering why Augustus persisted in his pursuit of this tiresome heroine!Storywise, however, &quot;Seducing Sybilla&quot; is a rather good one even if you can guess the identity of the villain from the very beginning. And I thought that Madeline Conway did a really good job of establishing the characters of Honoria, Sybilla, Augustus and the Dowager Lady Ampthill. Although, I know that I would have liked it better if Ms Conway had spent more time on reestablishing the relationship between Augustus and his mother than on the who-is-out-to-murder-George subplot. But that is just a personal observation on my part. All in all, if I had had more sympathy for Sybilla, &quot;Seducing Sybilla&quot; would have rated a good 3 star read; but because I truly had no patience for this overly emotional heroine, I've had to reluctantly give &quot;Seducing Sybilla&quot; a 2 star rating."},{"Title":"Intellectual Discourse and the Politics of Modernization: Negotiating Modernity in Iran (Cambridge Cultural Social Studies)","review":"In this manuscript Ali Mirsepassi, a professor of Sociology and Near Eastern Studies at Hampshire College, broaches a question of the first importance. Why and how did Iranian intellectuals manage to embrace modernity while at the same keeping a critical distance from it? By deconstructing the discourse of modernity in general and its apprehension among Iranian intellectuals in particular, the author manages to provide a rich account of how Iranians negotiated with the multifaceted challenge of modernity. In the course of doing so he criticizes (neo) Orientalist accounts of how the ascendancy of political Islam was made possible in Iran. This book offers an insightful account of how despite its vociferous rhetoric; the Iranian discourse of authenticity was itself impregnated with modernist sensibilities.Intellectual Discourse and the Politics of Modernization is a major addition to the field of Iranian intellectual history and deserves to be read by all those interested in this topic."},{"Title":"Queens Cross a Biographical Romance of Queen Isabella of Spain","review":"this is one of larence schoonover best historical novels. it is another one that you won't want to put down."},{"Title":"Be Fit!

Fundamentalist Christians will probably find a whole lot to disagree with.Many who are into &quot;New Thought&quot; are inclined to stay away from Bible studies, but I feel there is so much to learn and understand when one has a full grasp of what the Bible actually says. This book is a 47 day study, best started on Ash Wednesday and ending Easter Sunday.Wilson, who was founding pastor of the Christ, Unity church in Los Angeles, draws on all four of the gospels along with an immense knowledge and understanding of Biblical times and lands. The 47 chapters take us from Palm Sunday through Easter Sunday, day by day, a little at a time. Each chapter begins with the Biblical account, followed by the author's discussion on the significance to each of us that the words hold. The chapter ends with a short devotion appropriate to the study. There is a day by day study guide in the back of the book which gives the Biblical source for the lesson, questions for discussion, and a short prayer.I've gone through this study twice, and have found that it keeps me in tune with the true meaning of this season."},{"Title":"The Week That Changed the World","review":"Didn't know what I was getting in this book except I had read a short article in one of the Unity phamphlets that really hit home for me.

The main idea was about cholos (wanna-be gangsters) who were trying to help a nerd named Martin get the girl of his dreams. Their names were Joaquin, Martin, Tito, and Freddie. They are trying to help Martin get a girl named Ceci. His friends tried to give him a different personality so they performed an operation on him. They slicked his hair back, filled his arms and chest with Bondo, then hooked jumper cables to him and turned them on. He got up and thought he was a new man.Then Ceci stopped being a chola and changed herself into a nerd to try to get Martin. Now they changed their personalities so when they saw each other, they did not recognize each other. They looked for each other in the yearbook, but they still could not find each other. Afterward Joaquin falls in love with Ceci, but he does not know that she is Ceci because she changed her look.

Likable original characters and good dialogue. It was entertaining but disappointing because of its predictability and much used sitcom plot."},{"Title":"Fire in the Hills (Puffin Novel)","review":"I will give the basic story line at the end of the review. I wanted to point out since this book is published and marketed as being for young adults, that there are a few elements that might render this book unsuitable reading material for some families. The book contains several incidents of bad language (one by the heroine) and two near rape scenes. Each family will want to decide when and if these are introduced to their children. Folks concerned about these elements will either want to choose something else or to preread this selection.That said, I also wanted to state that this was an enjoyable read for me. I had also read RED-DIRT JESSIE and found that this book revisits much of the same territory. Both books are set in Oklahoma and involve a family member's death. Each has a father who shuts himself off emotionally from the family for a time. Both families are held together by a strong female who grows up through the pain and goes on to \\"save the day\\" in the end in some way. I could really identify with the conflict between personal progress and dreams and family progress and needs.The storyline is this: Sixteen-year-old Hallie's mother dies at the opening scene of the book leaving Hallie as \\"mother\\" for seven brothers and sisters. The brother leaves to fight in WWI after a disagreement with the father over pursuing his dream to play baseball professionally. Hallie has her own dream of becoming a teacher and given these circumstances she believes this will never happen now. The war prompts neighbors to distrust a draft dodger hiding in the hills and a German family who has been some of their dear neighbors in all the years before. All these elements come together to shatter the peace of the town and this family. The cover of the book touts this as a romance. If you are interested in a romance that starts and develops as the book goes along, you will be disappointed. The relationship seems to develop without the book revealing many tender exchanges between the couple. Those elements are left to your imagination. The romance happens quickly and mostly in the last half of the book."},{"Title":"Fire in the Hills (Puffin Novel)","review":"This was a good book i think. I liked that she was so independent and could be so strong when she had to. i also liked the end of the book when everybody was cheering in the streets, and when Hallie asked what they were doing, they said, Armistice, War's over!!!! I would recommend this book."},{"Title":"The Place of the Skull","review":"political undertones are weak and inconsistent. Not like his usual stuff. Interesting plot though."},{"Title":"The Place of the Skull","review":"I dont' know what the previous reviewer is talking about--the book's stories are not complex at all. Aitmatov does have a very distinct style, that is, he likes to uses many characters and mix them up. That, however, doesn't make the story complex, in fact quite contrary. It feels very strange to see how different from different walks of life could be connected."},{"Title":"The Place of the Skull","review":"This book starts out describing a wolf pair and their life, jumps to a russian &quot;holy fool&quot;, and only gets more complex from there. Three storylines that are only connected vaguely by the wolves. While each section is a good solid effort it lacks a solid cohesion. The tentative connection of the wolves hardly requires it be written as a novel. Instead this book may have been best written as smaller novellas.At one point it even goes into the telling of Jesus prior to his crucifixion as a comparison to the Russian &quot;holy fool&quot; who later suffers an equally gruelling fate. This seems both boring and excessive. It's been done before and better.In short the writing style is compelling but not enough to hold the novel together for 310 pages."},{"Title":"The Place of the Skull","review":"This is the third novel I have read by Aitmatov. The first was The White Ship, which I found to be very skillfully done. The second was The Day Lasts More Than A Hundred Years, which although not quite as engaging (I did not care for the \\"science fiction\\" aspect of it, which thankfully was only a minor part of the entire work) did provide a penetrating and insightful glimpse into life on the central Asian steppe. But then I went on to read this one ...... ah, where to begin.Okay, I know that Aitmatov is technically not a Russian. He's Kyrghyz. But he was obviously brought up in the Russian writing tradition, and for that reason must have felt that at some time he had to tackle a \\"big\\" subject, like religion. You know, the Dosteyevskian thing. Unfortunately, Aitmatov is no Dostoyevsky. (And quite honestly, I think even much of Dostoyesky's writing might appear laughable if viewed as being contempory rather than as being some relic from the past).I don't know, perhaps if I was raised under Stalinism I might view this differently. But from my vantage point in the turn-of-the-millennium U.S., the idea of a religious busybody whose sole purpose in life is to convert everyone else to his particular point of view, because of course only he knows best ... well, face it, in our society these people are a dime a dozen and can be found on almost any street corner, and they are generally not the type to arouse our sympathy. I found myself the entire time I was reading this hoping that this particular buttinski got exactly what was coming to him, which I'm certain is not what Aitmatov had in mind when he wrote it.Not to mention that the dialogues in some places are terrible. Come on, a deep philosophical/religious discussion between this religious fanatic and the head of a drug gang, in the middle of a drug running operation? Oh, yeah, I'm likely to believe that!And that's only the first half of the book. The second half, while being a little more engaging, also turns into such a hopeless muddle by the end, that you can only scratch your head and wonder.And then there is the wolf mother, that magically anthropomorphic critter that is the only link between the two halves, who we are led to expect holds the key to the entire puzzle, only to mysteriously drop from sight about fifteen pages from the end, leaving us with ... ???The White Ship and The Day Lasts More Than A Hundred Years are well worth reading. But take my advice and avoid this one."},{"Title":"History of the Chaplain Corps United States Navy, Volume VIII: United States Navy Chaplains 1972 - 1981 (Biographical and Service Record Sketches of Chaplains on Active Duty During The Period 1 January 1972 - 31 December 1981, Volume 8)","review":"While not the best edited, this book does capture some of the key issues faced by the Navy as Vietnam was winding down and the military transitioned from the draft to a volunteer service."},{"Title":"Blood On Their Hands","review":"This anthology consists of nineteen well-written new stories that focus, for the most part, on how everyday people react when pushed over the edge.

The authors are some of the leaders of the mystery/suspense genre and obviously everyone took the tasking seriously to the benefit of the audience.

The Great American Novels are dead, and I was glad I purchased this book. I liked the history of Kentucky in a transitional time period.

Since, I have read it three more times and will probably pick it up again. It is a great study of human nature in a unique and believable setting.With great american novels, you have a sense of wilderness, and living off the land. The land beating down a man when he tries to conquer it, then finally rising above his/her own tragedies to learn from it. This book had all of that, but in a more complex way. If you look at the \\"hunting\\" as just that, then you miss a man's struggle with alcoholism, poverty, and belief in a higher power or God.The book really was about Milly though, struggling with a Man that didn't do as much as he could for their own survival. You see her dealing with the children and the women in her little community. She did what she could for her children and feared for their lives throughout the novel.It was ahead of it's time, the author writing about things that stayed behind closed doors. Things like Child birth - in a graphic, unforgiving way, so much so it was banned and pulled from the book in the first printing.

I learned so much and am eternally grateful to be walking the earth with him in the same decades."},{"Title":"A Vast Illusion: Time According to 'A Course in Miracles'","review":"If you're a student of ACIM you'll find this book a very valuable addition to your library. It's an in depth discussion of time from both a metaphysical level (Level One) and a practical level (Level Two). Over \\"time\\" I continue to reread this book and get more out of it. Very happy to see it is now on Kindle!"},{"Title":"A Vast Illusion: Time According to 'A Course in Miracles'","review":"This book is a Ken Wapnick work that is a \\"focus\\" on \\"Time\\" as it is covered in A Course of Miracles (ACIM). ACIM teaches that we live in a temporal illusion or miscreation. The way back is thru Forgiveness which is the only \\"illusion\\" that undoes a miscreation. Once the bad dream is dissolved, then the illusion of time and space is dissolved and we are returned to God and eternity. Dr. Wapnick did an excellent job of presenting this work as a focus on time. In addition to his ACIM presentation, he includes many questions and answers from seminars that focus on time as an illusion. I have found all of Dr. Wapnicks books to be interesting, helpful and enjoyable. One of my favorite references in this book is to the Gnostic \\"laughing Jesus\\" as follows:\\"There is an interesting parallel found in the teachings of Basilides, one of the great Gnostic teachers of the second century. He had a fascinating theory, which on first reading sounds totally preposterous. Basilides maintained that Jesus did not die on the cross. Rather, he changed his form and instead Simon of Cyrene hung crucified, while Jesus was off on a tree Laughing. Basilides, who remained in opposition to Church teachings and its leaders, saw Jesus derisively laughing at all the people (primarily the Jews) who could not understand what was truly happening. The content of Basilides' inspiration was correct; namely, that Jesus \`remembered' to laugh at the tiny, mad idea of the ego and not take it seriously. Thus, he knew that he was not being crucified, as he was not his body. Merely an observer, Jesus watched himself, knowing that what he was seeing was not real but only a dream. We may thus conclude that Basilides' mind could not fully encompass the magnitude of the thought of Jesus' non-derisive laughter. The inspiration thus filtered through his limited ego mind, manifesting itself in the form of attack.\\"From birth we are taught how to think of everything we perceive in this physical universe as \\"real\\". But is \\"it\\" real? Have you ever looked at it? Have you ever really looked at it from your \\"mind\\" as opposed to the 5 limited senses? Would God create a temporal universe and stick his children in it?"},{"Title":"A Vast Illusion: Time According to 'A Course in Miracles'","review":"All kenneth Wapnick's books are essential support material for any earnest student determined to understand the message of A Course in Miracles and change his mind and his life.Dismantling the belief in time - at least in my opinion - is one of the most difficult aspects of re-programming your mind in favor of truth. Without this book, and in accordance with A Course in Miracles - at least in my opinion - it would be next to impossible.A Course in Miracles is an intellectually sophisticated masterpiece, and this book, like all of Kenneth Wapnick's books, is equally intellectually sophisticated.But, do not let this put you off. Remember the task undertaken here. To undo the side of your mind devoted to illusions, littleness, limitations and far, far worse.This book will help guide you on a journey with no distance towards a place within yourself of Peace and Joy and Love. A place of timeless, space-less, One-ness.I recommend you read this book slowly, thoughtfully, and many times.Kurt.

If your not very familiar with ACIM, then it might not make much sense. I have found that just about all of Ken Wapnick's work is great and I am very pleased with all I have read and studied. I have about five solid years studying ACIM and probably would not have been ready til now for a book like this. I consider this a must read for any serious and dedicated course student."},{"Title":"A Vast Illusion: Time According to 'A Course in Miracles'","review":"A Vast Illusion is one of those books that one needs to have a background in the subject before one can really grasp the concepts.

I have to use my Kindle to get hismaterial."},{"Title":"A Vast Illusion: Time According to 'A Course in Miracles'","review":"Everything that Kenneth Wapnick writes helps me to more deeply understand A Course in Miracles because I can apply a new understanding. The application then transforms understanding into a new experience which, hopefully, unfolds as knowledge."},{"Title":"A Vast Illusion: Time According to 'A Course in Miracles'","review":"This early Kenneth Wapnick book was quite difficult to grasp twenty or so years ago as was the Course itself. Little by little day by day and year by year clarity comes as the student is ready and able to absorb what is really being taught here. I must admit that without Ken's guidance and insight over the years I would most likely still be scratching my head regarding many aspects of (once again) what this wonderful Course In Miracles is REALLY teaching. Now when I look again at 'A Vast Illusion' as well as 'Forgiveness and Jesus' from the same period I no longer scratch my head.. yet as my journey proceeds I am aware that I am just scratching the surface.

It is an excellent overview of emerging and traditional avionics systems. The book starts with a short history of avionics development and then goes on to explain all avionics systems found in modern aircraft. Dr. Helfrick does an excellent job of explaining how various systems function and their role in the aircraft and air traffic control system. The book is written with the avionics technician or engineer in mind but would be very helpful to pilots who want a more in depth knowledge of the systems in the aircraft they fly.

It's really tempting to believe that Dr. Phil's repetition of what we heard and tried before will somehow work this time around.Dr. Phil is a tough character and the workability of his psychology is based mostly on the idea of will power. However, if will power alone was sufficient, we would not need Dr. Phil's help.

He feels time with them is wasted and he put his foot down from the very start of their relationship that he would not visit them. So, that is putting family first???

Doctor Phil writes too much of nonesense before he even tell you the step to correct the problems. But even when he shows the step to correct the problem, it's nothing interesting to learn neither.

While the target audience is parents with children at home, the same things can also be useful in other relationships.One of the points he raises is the different social styles (authoritarian, permissive, Egalitarian) effect outcomes.Children are often a bit more sophisticated than in times past, parents need to 'Gear Up' to meet the challenge.I don't consider this book a complete work on child raising or on relationships, but it adds valuable insight."},{"Title":"Family First - Your Step-by-step Plan For Creating A Phenomenal Family","review":"We take family so for granted yet these relationships should be treasuredif possible.

By the time I read a few chapters I returned the library's copy and bought my own. The chapter on \\"Parenting Style\\" is worth the price of the book, especially for the little test to determine if your style is authoritarian, equalitarian or permissive. Also helpful is the test to determine if your child is rebellious, cooperative or passive. It is important to know something of your own personality and your child's to determine how you (and your spouse) are going to teach and discipline. I teach \\"Marriage and Family\\" for a college and I will be incorporating these two tests in my curriculum.Also, I really enjoyed the stories he told about family. One particularly moving story is when his dad would not let him drive one night because of bad weather. Even though Phil argued his case and lost, he says he is glad his dad didn't relent. His parents loved him enough to set up boundaries. They valued Phil's life more than they did his agreement on their decisions. His dad was decisive and strong and Phil respected that. Phil apologized to his friend for ruining the plans. His friend looked at him with tear filled eyes and said, \\"I wish my parents cared enough about me to tell me I couldn't go. They wouldn't care if I drove straight off a cliff.\\"Phil writes, \\"It struck me that though John had asked his parents for permission to go to the game, what he had really needed was for them to provide some boundaries and leadership.\\" (Pp.157-58). Parents, even though discipline is sometimes difficult, it does communicate to our children that we care.I like to use Dr. Phil's book in conjunction with Dr. James Dobson's \\"The New Strong-Willed Child\\" and \\"Parenting Isn't for Cowards\\" in parenting classes and situations that I teach.

I recommend all three books."},{"Title":"Family First - Your Step-by-step Plan For Creating A Phenomenal Family","review":"I find Dr. Phil's newest book just super.

That's not true. What is true is that you don't controlyour temper, as you do when at church, work or at a restaurantwith friends.In addition, if you want to create the \\"phenomenal family\\" that theauthor frequently mentions, you'll find the following thoughts helpful:* If there are any problems with a child, the family has to be lookedat too.* Continually ask yourself: What can I do today to make my familybetter?* Best time to get a divorce: When you are past the hurt feelings.* If you want your children to be able to handle anger, then youhave to be able to handle it yourself.* The things in life you wont' regret will be the things you don't do.* Provide family members with at least one supportive statementeach day.* Don't tell a child what NOT to do."},{"Title":"Family First - Your Step-by-step Plan For Creating A Phenomenal Family","review":"Another great Dr. Phil book!

All of his books are about making changes in ones life whether it means that you have to change how you see yourself or how you treat others-especially your family in this one.It is hard to look beyond your own frustration and all the things pulling at your attention and focus on your family. I can't even focus on a single book which is one of the reasons I usually have to flip back and forth in every book I read. Dr. Phil makes it easy for people who have so much to do.

My wife has turned to him for support in these past years, and has bought each of his books hot off the presses. Her enthusiasm used to baffle me, but then I retired and settle down with her on the couch for what is like a good home-therapy session. We've been looking forward to the family first series on the show, and now that the book - the handbook, the guidebook, is out we read it and are buying copies of it for our children so that our grandkids grow up happier and healthier. Not to say my kids don't know what they're doing, but everyone can use a little bit of help and guidance along the way. This guy's a real honest-to-goodness expert and he knows what he's saying. Having raised three children, I just wish he was around then, telling me what my parenting style is so I could have related better to my kids. My kids struggle with disciplining their kids in these days of no-spanking. I think Dr Phil has some solutions for them. Go out and buy this one, study it, and pass it along! It's for a good cause - there's nothing more important than family."},{"Title":"Family First - Your Step-by-step Plan For Creating A Phenomenal Family","review":"I became the legal guardian of a teenager a year ago and in preparation for her arrival read loads of parenting books. I also work in youth violence prevention and routinely research risk factors for teen delinquency. This book was the best book out of the bunch I read, which was surprising to me because I sometimes don't like the advice Dr. Phil gives. However, this book was inspiring, it posed great questions and activities, and offered sound advice. I particularly liked the focus on defining your goals for your child and parenting with purpose, as well as the chapter on modifying behavior. It also addresses teen behavior/discipline better than any of the books I encountered, which are typically better for younger kids. Very comprehensive book! I recommend it to all parents."},{"Title":"Family First - Your Step-by-step Plan For Creating A Phenomenal Family","review":"I think poor Dr. Phil might be getting a bad rap here. Any book that helps someone even a little to prioritize and cherish tier family has merit..it just may not have credibility. If you are looking for a light read with some good ideas this book is worth a look. However, there are many credible, researched based books by real experts that would certainly be in front of the line. I recommend Dr. Michele Borba's books for anyone interested in real solutions to modern parenting problems. Otherwise, Dr. Phil is entertaining and Family First has the right idea, if not the best implementation."},{"Title":"Family First - Your Step-by-step Plan For Creating A Phenomenal Family","review":"The title says it all. If your family is dysfunctional, how can your children be successful?

I've read all his books and I'm such a fan. My family is getting along oky, but we're not close. I want true intimcay with me family, I want us all to be close and talk about all the important tings, and some of the unimportant ones. We just go through our days not minding each other and I have no clue wha'ts going on in my kids llives. Dr Phil's book gave tips on rituals that we need to be closer, to do things together on a regular basis that gives meaning to our interactions. I'm going to start a board game night at home, starting with Cranium, which is a great game. I'm also going to drop them off at schookl in the mornings to give us mroe time together. Dr Phil gives me the tips and the motivation I need to really do something about all this seperation, and now I knoe how to go about bringing change.

One thing I love about it is that it is so comprehensive. It covers issues any family might face - those with just one child, those with 6 children, those with babies and toddlers and those with teens or young adults. There are very few other books out there that do this! This is a book I will be keeping by my nightstand to refer to throughout my parenting, and beyond. It is that good! I also think the principles in the book apply to every relationship in the family and extended family - treating people the way you'd like to be treated, basically! For nitty gritty how-to advice from Moms, I like Jodie Lynn's book, and anything by Dr. Sears is great for the medical perspective. The 3 of these authors make up the only parenting library I need and they share the same philosophies as Dr. Phil's book! I am so glad Dr. Phil jumped on this topic. What he says is so important to every kind of family out there!"},{"Title":"Family First - Your Step-by-step Plan For Creating A Phenomenal Family","review":"Dr. Phil is my hero! He makes me laugh, makes me cry and makes me think. All the ingredients for the best book ever. I have three small children (a handful) and his solutions to time out have worked wonders already! I now know that sending them to their room is like sending them to Disneyland, with all their toys. I now sit them in an empty corner and make them sit still. They hate it and it works!

I just can't seem to get through to her. Is this the mother/daughter angst that we all go through, or can this situation be workable? Dr. Phil seems to think I communicate with my teenager without all the tears and fighting. I never thought about how I might sound to her-condescending, like I don't trust her judgment, and like I'm talking down to her. I want her to feel independent, like she is the one making all the right decisions instead of me mandating all the time. I'm trying to follow this chapter word for word and we had a long talk last night and I think we actually heard each other. I recommend this manual to everyone with kids of all ages, but it works wonders for older children."},{"Title":"Family First - Your Step-by-step Plan For Creating A Phenomenal Family","review":"Dr. Phil's newest is absolutely amazing.

His chapter on divorced families really helped me get an action plan for working with my children's feelings.

I went out yesterday and bought it first thing. I've not had a chance to read the entire book, but one of the five factors caught my eye. Factor #2 talks about how every familly member is authentic. Dr. Phil uses a comparison between snearkers and children. He writes \\"Your child's authentic self may have started out clean, solid and brand new, like the last pair of new sneakers you bought them.\\" This is a brilliant analogy! I've not finished reading this book, but from what I've read so far I give it two thumbs up!"},{"Title":"Family First - Your Step-by-step Plan For Creating A Phenomenal Family","review":"Dr. Phil's latest book could not have come at a better time for me! I am the mother of a new baby girl and want to give her every opportunity to excel as she grows up- from her first steps to doing well in school, right on through to becoming a successful adult.I knew that every move I made from here on out would impact her entire life. What I didn't know was how to create the environment that would get us where we wanted to be as a family and as good parents. \\"Family First\\" is a phenomenal book! Dr. Phil's \\"Tools\\" have given us a realistic, day-to-day plan for creating a rich, loving environment through family rituals and rhythm and practical parenting advice.I would recommend this book to everyone! If you are considering becoming a parent, already have a family that just needs a little helping hand in those tough moments, or are in need of some advice for fear that your family has or may be taking the wrong path- READ THIS BOOK!Now I am off to buy The Ulitmate Weight Solution to help take off some of this baby fat!"},{"Title":"Family First - Your Step-by-step Plan For Creating A Phenomenal Family","review":"It is about time that someone wrote a GREAT book on Parenting.

This book is a must have for any parent whether or not your child is having problems."},{"Title":"Family First - Your Step-by-step Plan For Creating A Phenomenal Family","review":"I preordered Family First and was happy to receive it yesterday. I started flipping through it and have already seen Phil's unique message. I am a social worker and I have to see a lot of broken families. It is good to see someone that is so public that has such a good sense of family. I think Family First is a jewel. It focuses on parents and how they can change themselves and the way they parent. Alot of parents just think that the instinct to parent will just come to them after they have kids, but that is untrue.Family First will help parents learn how to build up their parenting skills as they grow as a person. I read the chapter on Family Legacy and I think this one is really going to strike some very vital cords with alot of people. I hear people saying all the time that they do not know why they did something to their kids- I think the evaluations in this chapter will help them figure it out.I recommend this to parents of all ages. It is never too late when you are a part of a family."},{"Title":"Family First - Your Step-by-step Plan For Creating A Phenomenal Family","review":"This book is on my mind because I recommended it yesterday while talking with a single mother. She clearly loved her kids but was at her wit's end with them not listening, not helping out at home and constantly arguing with her and each other. She said she had \\"tried everything\\" (which she later acknowledged she hadn't once she saw how she eventually gave in because the disciplinary tactics she used \\"weren't working\\"). This book immediately came to mind as one that is easy to read and will give her guidance on setting boundaries, sticking with them, being consistent and doing \\"what it takes\\" to get her family back on track.This book offers an assessment for parents to identify their parenting style and their child's personality style and provides strategies to best adapt their parenting accordingly. Make sure to measure each of your children separately - amazing how kids in the same family can be so different!This book is especially recommended for those who are (or quickly heading toward) parenting teens. Even if you feel like you've lost control of your teenage kids, this book's message that it's never too late to turn things around is reassuring and empowering. Some parents might need additional professional help but this book provides a solid start for all.Mollie Marti, Ph.D., J.D.Author, Selling: Powerful New Strategies for Sales Success"},{"Title":"Family First - Your Step-by-step Plan For Creating A Phenomenal Family","review":"Awesome book.

This book is no different. I didn't give it 5 stars only because naturally, some opinions differ. However that's not to say he doesn't know what he's talking about.

If they don't get you geared up to read the book I dont know what will. I truly think he has a gift to share. I have two kids, and although i think we are doing pretty good I picked up Family First. I think that every family could use a little help. It is hard to raise kids these days, it was hard for my parents too, but I think that we are dealing with a whole new set of problems.

MOST BOOKS TAKE CARE OF THE PERSON THAT BOUGHT THE BOOK. THIS IS FOCUSING ON THE COMPLETE ENTITY OF FAMILY. THIS BOOK IS NEEDED!"},{"Title":"Family First - Your Step-by-step Plan For Creating A Phenomenal Family","review":"Dr. Phil's central messsage in his new book FAMILY FIRST is that nurturing our children and strengthening our families is the most important work to be done in the world today. If parents took this to heart, there will be many more happy children and well-adjusted adults. I agree with other reviewers that this book was refreshing in its relative lack of judging and demeaning language that often turns me off to Dr. Phil's television show. FAMILY FIRST offers some workable strategies to nurture your children and guide them to reach their full potential. As a parent of four, ages 14 to 24, I would have liked to see a broader awareness of the complexities of raising children in a violent world filled with injustice and duplicity. It would be refreshing to hear Dr. Phil admit that even if parents do their very best following his advice or the tenets of their religion or parenting philosophy, there are no guarantees and all parents make mistakes. Still, Dr. Phil's statement that family should come first is an important one for our time and FAMILY FIRST is worth a read."},{"Title":"Family First - Your Step-by-step Plan For Creating A Phenomenal Family","review":"This book has great advice for single parents and blended families. I always felt like divorce would mess up my kids, but this book has some great advice on handling all of my issues, like visiting their other parent, and introducing a step-parent. I also liked Dr. Phil's \\"5 Factors for Phenomenal Family\\". Anyone can follow and use these factors."},{"Title":"Family First - Your Step-by-step Plan For Creating A Phenomenal Family","review":"We had a bump in the road with our 13-year-old daughter this summer when we found out she'd been drinking at parties. We were shocked as we have a strong, healthy family and we thought this was insurance against this kind of behavior, plus our older son (who is now in college) successfully went through high school without doing this. I ordered 3 parenting books to help us navigate this challenge in the best possible way for her. When I started reading \\"Family First\\" I felt better about my parenting skills after just a few pages and I couldn't put it down until I finished it a week later. It helped me to relax and realize that all parents make mistakes and it's never too late to turn things around with your children.The concepts are easy to grasp and there are exercises to help the reader get a good handle on how their own upbringing is now affecting their parenting style. I also loved the tests to determine parenting style and the child's personality type. I started laughing when I took the test for my daughter-my husband and I both scored it separately and we each gave her 37 out 40 points on the rebellious personality type (I prefer to call this the leader). This was so enlightening and what followed was practical advice to help us relate to her personality style in a way that minimizes conflict but still maintains authority. The rebellious (leader) personality likes to be in charge and this explains how to get them involved in decision making without letting them run the show. We also realized that our kids have different personalities and therefore we need to parent her differently than we did our son.Dr. Phil does give examples of how these techniques have helped families who have lost complete control of their kids. In my opinion, this book alone might not be enough to help families with serious challenges or deeply troubled children. But Dr. Phil does say a few times that as parents, we need to be willing to do whatever it takes to have a healthy family, including getting professional help if it's needed.I also ordered the book \\"Get Out of My Life: But first can you drive me and Cheryl to the Mall\\" which I am now half way through. It is saying many of the same things about the way that teenagers think and act. I highly recommend Dr. Phil's book to any parent who wants help navigating the often choppy waters of the teenagers journey."},{"Title":"Family First - Your Step-by-step Plan For Creating A Phenomenal Family","review":"As someone who speaks and ministers to families and teens, I was thankful to see a common sense book that pulls no punches. It doesn't try to tiptoe around the fact that family is so key to children and teens. It puts the emphasis back on the strength of the family.As an author, I interviewed hundreds of teens and 98% of them said that family was key to making it in today's world, and yet they had trouble defining the word family. They put it in terms like \\"acceptance, love, loyalty\\". If a teen looks for that in a family and can't find it, then they go outside of the family to find it. And that is where many of our teens get lost, making destructive life choices just to have a \\"family\\" around them.Thank you, Dr. Phil, for addressing these issues.T. Suzanne Eller, author of Real Issues, Real Teens -- What Every Parent Needs to Know"},{"Title":"Family First - Your Step-by-step Plan For Creating A Phenomenal Family","review":"Dr. Phil has written a book to help parents in their never ending quest to create happy, well behaved children. While his suggestions are somewhat thin, he says that the basics of parenting are still what is important, and concern about the various problems of our world shouldn't make us lose that focus.He stresses that parents should make decisions as a unit and shows the problems that occur when they don't. He goes over some basic ways to discipline and how to keep the lines of communication open - another area that lacks detail.This isn't a perfect book, but Dr. Phil provides a good, no nonsense approach to parenting that gives you a place to start If you like Dr. Phil - you'll probably like the book.

I pick up maybe hundreds of parenting books off the shelves, I am a parenting book addict because I want this parenting thing to make sense and maybe be a little easier, and I found Dr. Phil's chapter on divorced and blended families to be an immense support. His insights are profound throughout the book, but I especially found that this chapter spoke directly to the heart of the matter for stepfamilies. He covered topics such as how to discipline, what kind of relationship to expect and what kind is most appropriate. I love his breakdown of the needs of my kids (and new kids). It really gave me insight into what they must be going through, and that can help me address the issues at hand more easily."},{"Title":"Family First - Your Step-by-step Plan For Creating A Phenomenal Family","review":"If you are a woman who is always doing too much, do not buy this book. While the tips and ideas are good, you will end up stressing out and then likely feeling inadequate because he sets the reader up to fail. His ideals are unrealistic and will only serve to make you feel bad about yourself. No one in the world is healthy enough or has enough time to do everything he says one needs to do to have a \\"phenominal\\" family. Instead, spend quality loving time with your children and teach them by example."},{"Title":"Family First - Your Step-by-step Plan For Creating A Phenomenal Family","review":"Family First is a great book. you cannot start parenting better without a place to start parenting from. Dr. Phil gives that place. This is not a child development or an analysis of our society with all the child violence going around. Family First is a book that teaches foundational priciples of having a better family and thus creating a happier, more well-behaved child. Too many books nowadays are all too happy to focus on one thing-violence, kids grades, or a number of other things that do make our lives as parents harder. The problems with these books is that parents do not usually have one problem, they have one after the other that have just piled one on top of the other.Family First does not hammer one issue into the ground, instead it refocuses on the larger topic of family and how to parent that family. It allows parents to get back to the basics of parenting teaching them things like: how they were parented influences how they parent, communication (how to have a conversations with your about the little things), basic ways to discipline, and how to make decisions as parental force instead of a divided front.I really think that it fills a void in family books by showing how much your family and the way that you organize influences what kind of children you have. This book isn't just about being a better parent, it is about raising a great family that makes every one of its members a better person.Thank you Dr. Phil!"},{"Title":"Family First - Your Step-by-step Plan For Creating A Phenomenal Family","review":"Once again Dr. Phil gives practical, common sense advice for creating and maintaining positive relationships.

Dr. Phil thinks so too! and gives a lot of information on how to do this in his book. He also discusses socialization of our children which is so important. Our kids spend way too much time in front of the t.v. and video games, and this is ruinous to their future.In this book, Dr. Phil discusses how to help your child set and achieve goals, and how to take responsibility for their own actions.

My comments are organized more by author than by appearance in the book.Cherryh's own story, \\"Fever Season\\", is the thread around which the others develop. There's been no Plague, only the Crud, but since Mondragon hasn't fully adapted to Merovingen's local germs, he is seriously ill. At this point in the series, the Takahashi brothers move into Mondragon's place, so that he can be cared for without publicly showing weakness.Abbey, Lynn: \\"Life Assurance\\" - More about the Kamats, particularly Richard, beginning with lunch at the Ramsey Bell, the tavern frequented by heirs and second sons of trading houses. (As Richard's peers are mostly his father's generation, he still eats at the Bell - a fine place to pick up information.) Jordie Slade, one of Kamat's workers, has disappeared, so Richard, with a Kamat's sense of responsibility, investigates the matter personally. Eleanora, Jordie's wife (or is she a widow?), appears for the first time.Asire, Nancy: \\"Night Ride\\" - When 6 men attack a youngster on a walkway, Justice Lee rescues the kid - who turns out to be Raj. Raj wants to know how an Adventist got into the College (no real Revenantist would get involved in a stranger's karma). He'd give anything for the College's medical training...Fish, Leslie: \\"War of the Unseen Worlds\\" - Rif appears at Jones' tie-up to collect on her promise (see Festival Moon, \\"First Night Cruise\\") to help Rif on her next run through the city.Lackey, Mercedes: \\"A Plague On Your Houses\\" - Raj has 2 apparently hopeless dreams - a crush on Marina Kamat, and becoming a doctor. As it happens, Raj'd be a fairly good doctor; he knows a lot of swampy herb lore...enough, maybe, to save the life of one Thomas Mondragon, if Raj can trade get the drugs he needs from the swamp.Unfortunately, Raj leaves anonymous poems for Marina Kamat.

Cherryl, I was delighted to stumble across her Merovingen Nights series and be once again drawn into a world of interesting characters and events. The setting of Merovingen with its canals and intricate bridgework becomes as interesting as the characters who live there. The action and political intrigue provide an interesting plot and the love of Jones for her beautiful aristocrat, well any girl knows all about that and can identify one gorgeous hunk in her life that made her heart beat faster. The book will not shake your world with new concepts, but it will provide a most satisfying escape read. I look forward to reading the rest of the series.

In reading it, I have been subjected to all sorts of personal prejudices from the authors without any solutions. They have used too many pages voicing their undocumented research in a difficult to read format. The opinions are extreme, with no concrete foundations to back them up. There are constant contradictions in every chapter, sometimes within the same paragraph. This was a waist of college students money!There must be more substancial reading out their on Multicultural Education."},{"Title":"An Introduction to Multicultural Education","review":"I have been using James Banks' Teaching Strategies for Ethnic Studies for teaching intercultural education at the college level for almost a dozen years and have yet to find one better. The first semester when I was preparing to teach the class, I had not yet chosen a book when, leaving our college library one day, I noticed an old edition of Banks' book on the give-away shelf. His name jumped out at me since he was noted in my doctoral studies as the foremost authority in the field at that time.I read the book over Christmas break just before my course began and was ecstatic to find that such a learned author had compiled chapter histories of ten major ethnic groups in the United States. These are histories that until recent times were never taught in schools. They are eye-openers in ethnic history from the eyes of those who experienced not only the Civil Rights era, but one to two centuries of the history of our country's ethnic groups before that. As a Caucasian, I was extremely impressed with Banks' extensive work, something no one else until his time had attempted to do, especially in one volume. Even after changing texts for two semesters, thinking students might appreciate something different, they begged me to return to an approach that would tell 'the stories' of suppressed peoples in the United States. I returned to Banks and plan to stay with him for the rest of my carrer.In recent semesters, my students have been creating power points highlighting chapter histories in Banks (He's an excellent resource for that), resulting in some rich discussions that might not have happened otherwise. I have come to the conclusion that most of us don't live long enough to recall or appreciate the struggles of peoples who came before our time, especially those that were, up until now, seldom taught in our institutions. Banks book, especially the chapter histories, helps to fill that gap in our knowledge and lives."},{"Title":"An Introduction to Multicultural Education","review":"Frankly speaking, this book is easy to understand for a foreigner like me.

One would think that any strategy for teaching ethnic studies should be objective, but this is not the case. His writing is infused with bitterness carried from his personal experiences, and rather than discuss tolerance and appreciation, he preaches reverse-racism. He has a tendency to box people into groups according to their heritage: Mexican-American, Italian-American, etc. What if you do not identify with any group whatsoever and are the product of early 20th century alien assimilation? Those who cannot find a cultural niche are considered Anglo-Saxon. If you pay attention to his writing, you notice that being white is not a good thing. Multicultural studies should promote tolerance. This intolerant mode of thinking is outdated and needs serious revision."},{"Title":"The Song and the Truth","review":"Because this book is about Jews during WWII I thought it would be depressing - it wasn't. Because this book is told from a child's point of view I thought it would be childish or stream of consciousness - it wasn't. This book is alternately a little funny and a little sad, alternately vague and brilliantly lucid, but always it was engaging and delightful!"},{"Title":"The Song and the Truth","review":"_Reviewed by Randy Farnsworth, author of \\"A Stand Yet Taken\\".As soon as I started reading this book, I found myself absolutely intrigued by the story. Seeing the magical world of early-twentieth century Indonesia from the eyes of a five year old was truly enjoyable. Ruebsamen has a way of writing that puts the reader directly into the mind of the narrator, and I honestly felt little Louise's excitements and disappointments. It was a real let-down to leave Indonesia with Louise and her family and make the journey to Europe.The middle part of the book, including the ocean voyage and the stay in Paris, was much slower, and I found it less interesting. Perhaps Ruebsamen intended that, because Louise disliked that as well. But in the latter third of the book, the pace increased somewhat and I found myself much more interested in the outcome.As Louise mixes real events with imaginary ones, it becomes a little confusing, and I had to re-read several sections to figure out, for example, if someone had really died or did they survive after all. Again, it may be that the author intended this, because the child narrator has reinvented her vision of reality to alter certain horrific events.I don't know what the author's intent was in writing this book, and I'm not one to try and put a meaning to everything an author produces. However, after reading this, I found myself sitting and watching my young children, trying to understand their view of the world and relate that to my own perceptions. With that, I'd say that Ruebsamen definitely succeeded in causing this reader to stop and think about life."},{"Title":"The Song and the Truth","review":"the book review that I read in the paper said that the first part of this book, which is set in Java is majical but that when the setting moves to Europe it becomes ordinary. I disagree. I ordered it because of the exotic early setting but I liked it even better as it went on. Description is important to me in a book and I thought that the writer actually lavished more of it on the European section, probably because this is an autobiographical novel and she remembers more clearly what she saw when she was older. I'll never forget the part about the wetlands of Holland because she made me see it so clearly. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"The Song and the Truth","review":"I submitted a review of this book last week.

It is an easy and entertaining read for anyone who is curious about the Bible or just beginning to study it.

Catholics (me being one) and eastern orthodocs know more of the catechism than of the Bible.I read the Bible once, without any prior knowledge or anything to put it in wider perspective, hence without understanding, and of course it made no sense. It was BORING.This book explains the circumstances, the origins and what the Bible and its various texts are all about, so reading the Bible can start making sense.I agree with other reviewers on points of \\"humorous language\\" overboard (I guess that is the \\"brand essence\\" of \\"for Dummies\\" series, but it still BUGS me in all the \\"dummies\\" books, not just this one) and references to other chapters (I never ship chapters, I read my books thru, and I hate having to flip back and forth for stuff.

This book has helped turn the confusion into common, understandable words. I am still early in the book, BUT I now understand WAY more than I ever have. There are also tidbits throughout that explain contreversal and interesting parts of the Bible, and the authors present them without bias. The first chapter made me understand differences between the Literature used by Jews, Christians, and the Koran; I had no idea we believe in the same beginnings. This is a great book for the person, like me, who has tried to understand the Bible but can never get past the wording and sequencing. If you are looking for direction in spirituality, this may not be the inpirational jolt you need. Forget about what serious Bible-beaters tell you, the light-hearted speech of the authors does NOT deface nor belittle the wonderful message the Bible has for us."},{"Title":"The Bible For Dummies (For Dummies (Religion & Spirituality))","review":"Both my husband and I have enjoyed reading The Bible for Dummies.

This book helps me to get the big picture, then step a little closer to look at each book and get a good summary of each one without getting extremely detailed. I enjoyed reading this all the way through and I now have a better understanding of the events and locations when I read the Bible now.I would recommend this to anyone who is having difficulty grasping the \\"big picture\\" of the Bible while reading it, just as I did, but also to newcomers to the Bible who would like to know what it's all about before diving into it."},{"Title":"The Bible For Dummies (For Dummies (Religion & Spirituality))","review":"Book gives a generalized summary of the Bible.

Even as we continue to sell more Bibles and religious titles every year, the Bible is actually being read less and less. I doubt if anyone who regularly reads my blog falls into this category, but a number of my friends do, and I'd like to find an easy introduction to the stories in the Bible. What better choice than a Dummies book, right?I'm a huge fan of the Dummies series! Since they introduced their trademark fun and attractive layouts for computer-related topics years ago, I've accumulated quite a collection. I even included a Dummies book in the \\"suggested reading\\" appendix of my book about Revelation! Scholarly suicide, you think? Fact is, I find most of them well-researched and generally unbiased.Turns out this one was a bit of a disappointment. The reading is a bit dry, there's too much discussion of general topics rather than Bible stories, too much emphasis on introducing every book in the Bible instead of just the basics, and too much of a religious bent. The authors feel obligated to explain the stories, adding meaning, which is not only unnecessary but I often found myself disagreeing with their interpretations.

Is it the premise of the Dummies series that there be a joke for every so many words of text? It's a shame because there is much good information in here, but the authors insist on inserting gratuitous humor in every paragraph. To some it may seem cute but it gets tedious quickly. The book could be 2/3 the size and far more readable if one didn't have to wade through so many attempts at humor. This is entertainment as pollution. The authors undoubtedly know their Bible, if only they could talk to the reader as one adult to another on a fascinating topic, and leave out such things as the lyrics to the Beverly Hillbillies. It may be hard to believe, but some people do get beyond high school and some people do like TV shows and comedy but don't want them threaded through an explanatory book. Read any non-fiction book by Isaac Asimov to see how complicated subjects can be delightfully and simply presented without resorting to silliness. If you have any reverence for the Bible, whether as religious text or simply good literature, stay away from this book.

That being said, I thought this book was an excellent introduction to the Bible as a scholarly text. All of their interpretations of biblical passages are clearly explained (they are often illustrated by humorous examples) and the prose itself is eminently readable (I read through this book in 3-4 days but have yet to proceed past Exodus in \\"the real thing\\").Here's a prime example of this book's style: \\"People usually think that the Bible is condoning/encouraging revenge with 'An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth.' In fact, it is really *limiting* revenge. For example, if Moe pokes Curly in the eye, then 'An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth' only allows Curly to poke Moe in the eye, not poke him in the eye, grab his nose, and give him a 'nyuck, nyuck'.\\"If you are offended by such examples, bas***dizing the \\"Holy Bible,\\" then perhaps this book is not for you. However, its [American] culturally relevant examples clearly convey what the author is trying to say.The one feature in this text that I found somewhat annoying is that there are regular \\"for more information, see chapter XX.\\" They are useful if you want to read topically, or don't want to read this book all the way through (in fact the authors encourage \\"skipping around\\"), but since I did read it all the way through, it got a little frustrating.

I have not devoted time to Bible study since I was young. I picked this book for it's obvious simplicity. I am so glad that I did.

The Bible for Dummies book is a very fun, easy to read, and easy way to comprehend the entire book of the Bible. It does contain some humor which makes it more fun for me. It also contains some theories which I usually hate about Bible study or reference books but it does give the reader the option to agree or disagree with certain theories instead of stating it as an opininated fact.

Every Branch In Me is an impressive compilation and highly recommended reading for students of religion, philosophy, and metaphysics."},{"Title":"Every Branch in Me: Essays on the Meaning of Man (The Perennial Philosophy)","review":"This book is a collection of articles that have been previously published in other magazines. Ostensibly about the Meaning of Man, it's real thrust is about the need to return to a traditional religious culture. The authors include Prof. Hossein Nasr, Schuon, Burkhardt, Huston Smith, Brian Keeble, Joseph Brown, Grey Henry, Marco Pallis, James Cutsinger, just to name a few. If you are already familiar with these authors and their writings you could probably skip this book.The articles cover a wide variety of topics from dress, art, holy fools(a good article), modern psychology, Christianity in and its relation to Perennialism, education.Brian Keeble has a fine piece on 'Work and the Sacred' the same with Thomas Yellowtail's work entitled 'Loss of Our Traditional Values'. Both are short but powerful.Some of the most poignant for me were written by Grey Henry and Lilian Staveley as both wrote from the heart so to speak. Both pieces are quite moving.Some are a bit outdated though. For example Titus Burckhardt rails against modern psychology which was defined in his time as Freud and Jung. However truthful neither Freud nor Jung theories mainstream anymore, western psychology has started to realize its limitations and now admits mankind's spiritual aspects with Transpersonal Psychology. Its not perfect but what is in this world?Though I have some major qualms about of the articles and writers.One is James Cutsinger's piece, which is a eye glazing head nodding attempt to show that one can be a Christian and still support Perenialism. He does this by invoking the obtuse Trinitarian dogma and using the works of Schuon. Whom is not recognized by any Christian doctor as a authority on Christianity.The fact is unless one reduces Christian theology to the consistency of chewing gum as Cutsinger does, you cannot say that all religions are valid. A Christian if he is to be honest must state that only his religion is the only valid path and only his way will lead to salvation. Orthodox Christianity may always be the exception to the rule of Perenialist thought.I'll take the works of Anthony Bloom or Philip Sherrard over Cutsinger anyday.Now some of the writers like Linbolm and Mark Perry come off as polemical or shrill. Tage Linbom who is in essence a spiritual brother to Jerry Falwell or Pat Robertson. He seems to yearn for the good old days when the Church and tyrants were the ruling authority in Europe and democracy is abolished. Simply put everything post Reformation is bad and has the mark of the Devil on it. He has nothing good to say about anything in western society. Overall his critique of modernity is shallow in comparison to Lewis Mumford's , Ellul, or Theodore Roszak. Metropolitan Anthony Bloom or Bishop Ware would have been a much better and saner representative for the classical Christian point of view than Linbom.Mark Perry seems to combine both polemics and contempt, he delights in showing how brilliant he his by using Buddhist, Hindu, neo-Platonic and even Christian terms in a single sentence or paragraph. His prose is generally obscure and meanders through a variety of subjects giving each one only scant attention, each of which deserves a chapter of their own. Like Linbolm he too has a intense dislike not only of everything western but is also contemptuous of many religious practitioners in the west ranging from Buddhists, Christians, and Hindus. His implication is that they don't have a clue about their practices and since they are not practiced in a sacred culture they have no effect. Prelest anyone?I've generally been a avid reader of Traditionalists like Hossein Nasr, A.Coomaraswamy, Smith and Schuon. But these newer authors like Perry and Linbom are a whole nother kettle of fish. They lack the heart and intellect that I found so attractive in Prof. Nasr's and Schuon's works.As a result Perenialists, especially in the wake of 9/11 are taking a serious risk of alienating the very people they intend to reach with the inclusion of perennial fundamentalists like Perry and Linbolm and will be written off as a bunch of contemptuous, cranky religous elitists.Who would benefit from this book? If you already familiar with many of perennial authors , this book won't add anything you don't already know. If you're new to the perennial idea, this is a advanced tract and not meant for a non-scholar type, unless you're comfortable switching between Hindu, Islamic, Buddhist and Christian terminologies. Stick with Huston Smith's \\"Why Religion matters\\", \\"Forgotten Truth\\" or E.F. Schumachers \\"A Guide for the Perplexed\\". Then get Hossein Nasrs \\"Knowledge and the Sacred\\". Read Schuon last, he's a difficult read and suffers from bad translations from French."},{"Title":"Kindergarten fun","review":"I had to purchase this text for a graduate class that I am required to take.

I always thought so too, until I actually lived in England and married a Brit. America is such a big country, but we have so few accents... unlike England where a native can tell what street in which city you grew up on just by hearing your voice! The system is so concrete that it is impossible to fake out anyone who \\"knows.\\"This is a sort of difficult book for Americans to read, because we don't really understand just how important language is as a social and class divide in England. It is still the case, but when Ms. Mitford's essay was first published it was even more concrete. At times, I grew a little bored of the book because even though I understand that it is a big deal over there, the democratic American spirit in me doesn't particularly like or appreciate it.The book consists of Ms. Mitford's essay, and several supplemental and follow-up essays and letters about it. It is worth a read if you are interested in class in England, or in linguistics (though keep in mind that it's best described as \\"anecdotal linguistics\\" and not as a real academic study). However, it is rather snobby at times, though she tries to cover this up with her considerable sarcasm and wit, and Americans who haven't witnessed firsthand the language snobbery that goes on over the pond might be confused."},{"Title":"Noblesse Oblige; An Enquiry into the Identifiable Characteristics of the English Aristocracy.","review":"I found the book very humorous.

It is a lively exploration of the quaint turns of phrase, social peculiarities, and other habits that identify the British upper-classes (charmingly referred to as U), as distinguished from the lower-classes (non-U).As the title suggests, what makes an aristocrat is a sense of Noblesse Oblige, or the obligation of the nobility to put his high position at the service of those beneath him, and at the service of the common good. That being said, there is always a je ne sais quoi about the fictional and non-fictional characters of the Aristocracy that make them sometimes irresistible and other times loathsome, but always fascinating, and often extremely funny.If you simply want to know for the sake of idle curiosity--or if you want to avoid the blunders (beginning with audible self-promotion and ending with obnoxious table manners) that might make the occasional aristocrat you run into at a dinner party either enjoy your conversation (think of Elizabeth Bennet) or avoid you like the plague, (think of Mr. Collins) you will enjoy this book.If you are a sociologist studying the nature of class-distinctions which the human race routinely creates (in spite of every attempt to prevent it) than you will REALLY enjoy this book.If, on the other hand, the very thought of social class gives you hives, avoid this book at all costs."},{"Title":"Noblesse Oblige; An Enquiry into the Identifiable Characteristics of the English Aristocracy.","review":"It was not as interesting as I thought it would be.

He writes books incrementally, and then he writes later books that are based on his prior books. Harold Camping is the general manager of Family Stations, also known as Family Radio.The result is a cascade of lies and deception that is not fully realized by the reader until his final books.One of his later books is calledTime Has an End: A Biblical History of the World 11,013 B.C. - 2011 A.D.. In this book, the author aggressively and emphatically taught that Christ would return and Judgment Day would begin on May 21, 2011; and that the end of the world would occur on October 21, 2011. He continued to teach these lies even after May 21, 2011.Do not get trapped into reading this author's earlier books. He uses his earlier books as his basis for later books like \\"Time Has An End\\". His logic and reasoning and analytical approach to studying the Bible has led many people astray.His incremental approach to book writing only lures people into trusting his books and his interpretation of the Holy Bible.\\"Thus saith the Lord GOD; Woe unto the foolish prophets, that follow their own spirit, and have seen nothing!\\" (Ezekiel 13:3)\\"But I fear, lest by any means, as the serpent beguiled Eve through his subtilty, so your minds should be corrupted from the simplicity that is in Christ.\\" (2 Corinthians 11:3)\\"That we henceforth be no more children, tossed to and fro, and carried about with every wind of doctrine, by the sleight of men, and cunning craftiness, whereby they lie in wait to deceive;\\" (Ephesians 4:14)"},{"Title":"Feminist Thought: A Comprehensive Introduction","review":"This is the best source I've seen which defines the various feminisms (e.g. liberal, marxist, existentialist...)

The bibliography is also indispensible."},{"Title":"Feminist Thought: A Comprehensive Introduction","review":"Although I would agree that this text isn't a nail-biting page-turner, I have difficulty believing those reviewers who found the primary texts by the likes of Butler, Cixous, Irigaray so much livelier, more accessible and clear than Tong's explanations. Post-structuralist criticism, especially following upon the heels of French thinkers like Lacan and Derrida, became dense, esoteric, and difficult beyond the understanding of even many Ph.D.s with its specialist jargon and self-referential, seemingly private, inquiries/demonstrations into the limits and possibilities of human language. Feminist criticism--originally influenced heavily my male thinkers in the areas of structuralist, post-structuralist, post-modernist thought--was no different. In fact, its frequently recondite, difficult, and impenetrable prose led to many revolts by undergraduate women against feminist theory itself.For this reason, Tong's book was especially valuable during feminism's heyday--an organized approach to the entire field as well as an accessible explication of the major, primarily female, feminist thinkers. Given the movement's declining influence as the 1990s came to an end, it was important that Tong came out with this new edition--not only to address developments since the 2nd edition--including the so-called \\"backlash\\"--but to serve as a reminder that even if feminist theory had lost much of its popularity and influence, it was still alive--and many of its most influential voices, if less heard from due to apathy and new priorities, were merely waiting to be rediscovered by later, intellectually curious students.While there are always those who will deride \\"theory\\" (French theory, especially, has never been popular with American academics), thinking about what we normally do without thinking--in effect, thinking about thinking--is critical to the life of mind which, in a desperate world where only survival and political action count, becomes a \\"necessary luxury,\\" a sure sign that all human actions and behavior aren't determined exclusively by the herd. Moreover, theory offers a useful paradigm, a structure, a conceptual framework for what would otherwise be an occasionally diverting but rather incoherent chorus of various, individual voices. The danger we face, especially since the downloading, piecing-out, and \\"atomizing\\" of texts by the many individual hyper-spatial \\"files\\" (fragments of what were once whole and complete works, albums, suites) is exactly the sort of disarray that theory seeks to organize and clarify--and to do so without \\"reducing\\" the original works and their authors to mere talking points and topic sentences in an overly broad, sweeping, homogenizing overview. Tong's strength is that she covers the field without misrepresenting its individual voices. The reader has every right to trust her and her carefully chosen words."},{"Title":"Feminist Thought: A Comprehensive Introduction","review":"I had to buy this book for class, and it turned out to be a blast.

While being naive on the topic I felt like I was exposed briefly and informatively to major schools of feminist thinking and critiques against them, from an author who strictly phrases all viewpoints in a non-judgmental and evenhanded manner.Naturally, this book is only a start. The synopsis of multi-cultural feminism is a door to a library, i suspect, of books on the struggles and successes of other countries' women. Apparently the feminisms covered here are mostly through an American lens. I hope that third-wave feminism isn't so nebulous and open-ended as its definition, leaving yet another library of increasingly individualized viewpoints.I did find myself, politically in this book, highlighting synopses and critiques that fit with my perspective.

He is able to state simply the interactions between a wide variety of animals, Ourselves included."},{"Title":"KING SOLOMONS RING.","review":"Konrad Lorenz, a naturalist and author of King Solomon's Ring, explains different aspects of animal behavior and how their behavior is sometimes similar to that of humans in his book. He observes many different species of animals during his studies and he tries to explain what they are doing. Observing the body language and the noises the animals make are the main points discussed in his book. Also, he tries to explain that the balance of the ecosystem is crucial to the survival of the animals and plant life that is found there.Have you ever owned a fish? They normally are considered the easiest pet to own. However, Lorenz describes some of his experiences with fish tanks, and how to make one very interesting. He explains that having real, living plants growing in the tank helps with keeping oxygen in the tank for the animals that are going to be living in it. He gives advice to anyone planning on owning a fish tank. He also explains that having too many animals in the aquarium can be disastrous. Even the littlest change in the number of animals can be bad. Lorenz illustrates for his readers the balance of life that can be changed when a \\"robber\\" is present. The larva of the water-beetle Dytiscus is the predator that is described in the book. This creature devours whatever is in it's path when it is hungry. The development of an ecosystem is dependent on the balance of between the good and the bad in the environment; therefore, the balance is crucial to the survival of many organisms.Lorenz has had his share of dogs, and he explains the behavior similarities and differences between the Aureus breed and the Lupus breed. They have incredible loyalty and intelligence, and Lorenz tells his readers much about the way they exhibit that intelligence. Behavior of other animals, especially birds and water-shrews, are also explained in this book. Lorenz caught and observed the behavior of small, baby water-shrews when they are learning to explore. They are creatures of habit, as explained by Lorenz. They developed a certain way of doing things, and if they did it once, that is the way they will always do it if nothing has changed. Birds, on the other hand, are fascinating creatures that Lorenz spends a great deal of time with. He trained some of them to come at his call. He explains the mating habits of jackdaws, and their peculiar ways of choosing mates. These animals and their behaviors are what Lorenz explains in depth about in this book.When an animal and a human are put into similar situations, they will react similarly, and this is a concept that Lorenz explains in his book. When two animals are fighting, and one is losing to it's superior, they will surrender. They do this by showing their superior their most vulnerable area, normally the head or neck region. Humans, in a similar aspect, do the same thing. When they are losing a battle or fight, they will surrender by putting down their weapons and allowing their superior to kill them. Also, humans and animals guard their young fiercely. If a stranger is approaching their offspring, both a human and an animal will react in anger and try to get the stranger away from their baby. Lorenz describes the similarities of animals to humans in detail in this book.In my opinion, this book was very interesting and it taught me a lot. The reasons why an animal acts was a very interesting topic to read about. So many people don't think that an animal has reasons for his or her behaviors; they think they are just instincts. Some behaviors, of course, are just instincts; however, humans have behaviors that are instincts as well. Humans also have behaviors that have purpose, and so do animals. Whether it is for a mate or for a higher ranking position, animals choose to behave in a certain way. Lorenz's book clearly states important information about animals to anyone who wants to take the time to learn about them. This book helped me understand the differences and similarities of humans to animals. The development and behaviors are similar in situations and it really opened my eyes to animals and their behaviors."},{"Title":"KING SOLOMONS RING.","review":"Konrad Lorenz was one of THE three European founders of ethology (the study of the natural behavior of animals in their environments). Nikolas Tinbergen, Von Frisch, and Lorenz were co-awarded the Nobel Prize in 1973 for their preceding bodies of work which created this new scientific discipline.This was extremely significant to the course of American psychology which, until that time, had grown increasingly dominated by learning theory and the laboratory method. American psychology, influenced by the achievements of physics and medicine,etc., preferred studying behavior under controlled, laboratory conditions as the means for getting nearer \\"ultimate truth\\", which, at that time, was thought to almost always involve learning at its core--in accord with the principles and theories of famous American learning theorists such as Thorndike, Watson, Skinner, Hull, et al. Comparative psychology was the American branch that studied similarities and differences between animal species but controlled problems in a laboratory setting were greatly preferred. Observations of behavior, while valuable for designing later lab experiments, were considered less rigorous.So the truths Lorenz, Tinbergen, Von Frisch and their other European naturalist colleagues reported was as significant as the child's observation of the Emperor's new clothes. The truth of a significant lack was revealed. The laboratory method could not examine or reveal all important aspects of animal behavior; the lab method obscured or eliminated those behaviors occurring in natural settings.Lorenz and Tinbergen discovered, explored, and brought imprinting to the attention of the scientific behavioral world. Imprinting is the lasting (often irreversible) effects of early experience (occuring within a critical period of development) on the later behavior of animals. This contrasted with the view of normal learning theories which found the strength of a response was mainly a function of the number of practice trials. (Von Frisch's work was in understanding the \\"language\\" of bees.)Lorenz's \\"King Solomon's Ring\\" was a significant contribution that enabled lay people to understand the importance of such observations and prepared (sometimes excited) beginning students in the behavioral sciences to take psychology in new directions. Within a few years, learning theory no longer formed the spinal column and much of the skeletal structure of American psychology.I was a psychology graduate student during these years and the laboratory instructor for my university's professor of comparative psychology. It was an exciting time, seeing the old \\"truths\\" and axioms become overthrown and helping to search for new ones.The \\"Ring\\" is still a delightful and interesting read and inclines the reader to look with different eyes at the behavior of our animal friends. Possibly because I've kept current on research on dogs, I think it's weakest chapter is \\"The Covenant\\", Ch. 10, which is on dogs. Here Lorenz decides that most domestic dogs descended from the jackal while a few also descended from the wolf. Having advanced that thesis, he then describes in detail the dichotomy of personality and behavior to which these two antecedents lead and which can be commonly found in all their descendents.WRONG!For the last 40 years, we've become increasingly certain that almost all domestic dogs descended from wolves. Lorenz speculates an incorrect premise and then proceeds to elaborate (with charm and erroneous fact and observations skewed by his belief) on this in great detail. It's interesting and illuminating to see how wrong Lorenz can be in some areas and yet was so right (or right enough) in others.So read the \\"Ring\\" to understand its and its author's deserved place in the history of behavioral sciences. Read it to increase your observational powers of your animal friends. But please do not read it as divine, ordained truth. Many thousands of scientists have since built on the foundations that Lorenz, Tinbergen, & Von Frisch built along with the contributions of Watson, Pavlov, Skinner, Hull, and others. (Serpell's \\"The Domestic Dog\\" provides a good source on more recent information about dogs. You can click on \\"read my other reviews\\" to get my evaluation of Serpell's book.)"},{"Title":"KING SOLOMONS RING.","review":"This is a wonderful book with fun, easy to read, and informative information. The illustrations are cute and add an artsy touch to this book. Lorenz's brilliant discoveries have helped myself and other people better understand animal behavior. I have several animals at home and reading this book has helped me realize how unique each animal's behavior is. To listen to our three birds communicate through squaks, whistles, and squeaks is a truly enchanting experience. This book is awesome and I highly recommend it to all people, especially to those who are interested in animal behavior."},{"Title":"KING SOLOMONS RING.","review":"I was introduced to this book through a college proffesor. I fell in love with the way Konrad Lorenz viewed the world. It is a very funny book about animal behavior. A must for every library."},{"Title":"KING SOLOMONS RING.","review":"The last two pages of the book explain why the human species does not have time to evolve a method of conflict resolution. The wolf survives mortal combat by &quot;turning the other cheek&quot;, a behavior developed over many, many years. Humans enter combat with weapons that are not a part of their anatomy so the evolution of one on one response is not available. A learned method of conflict resolution is necessary."},{"Title":"KING SOLOMONS RING.","review":"This book is an established classic. It's beloved by animal lovers the world over. Many of the observations therein are fascinating.And some of them are just plain hooey.Love it or hate it, you have to at least appreciate an author to dedicates himself so enthusiastically to anthropomorphizing animals to within a micrometer of their species' limits. The degree to which Lorenz interprets the intentions of his animals is positively breathtaking.It's an enormously fun read, but for your own sanity, take his conclusions with a small dose of caution."},{"Title":"KING SOLOMONS RING.","review":"Perhaps because this book was so influential, a lot of what he says are now common sense. It's a good read and very amusing. Makes you want to bring in a bunch of animals to live with you so you can observe their behavior."},{"Title":"KING SOLOMONS RING.","review":"&quot;It has been theorized that cats which present dead mice to their owners, and which play with live mice in front of their owners, are not seeking approval. Rather, they are attempting to teach their oversized, deformed, clumsy, learning-impaired two-legged kittens how to make a living. They are responsible for your welfare, after all.&quot; This is just one of the many theories found in Konrad Lorenz's &quot;King Solomon's Ring.&quot; In his book, Lorenz shows how some kinds of behavior are governed by the same process of natural selection as governs physical development. Animal behavior is absolutely fascinating. If you've never read Konrad Lorenz's &quot;King Solomon's Ring&quot;, buy a paper copy. It may very well change your view of animals for the rest of your life. More and more you will appreciate the complex things that go on as you watch animals. This book is easy-reading and is filled with humor. I recommend it to all ages of animal lovers."},{"Title":"KING SOLOMONS RING.","review":"Confession - I'd never heard of Konrad Lorenz (even though he won the Nobel Prize in 1973), and I don't usually read books by Naturalists.I was driving between business meetings during the day, when I happened to tune in to BBC Radio 4 (same as National Public Radio in the USA), and by accident caught a book reading of Chapter 10 regarding Dogs. Then on another day I caught Chapter 11 on Birds. Captivated, I actually pulled over so that I could hear the whole chapter & find out what the book was and who the Author was.Then I ordered the book as a treat to myself for Christmas.Fantastic! With some abridging 'on the fly', this book could even be read to/by a younger audience say down to 8 years old, who would enjoy, laugh & cry at some of the stories contained herein.I wish my science teacher had read this to me when I was 8, rather than do some silly experiments with boring pond life (Chapter 2 would have taught me more about Pond Life)!"},{"Title":"KING SOLOMONS RING.","review":"In readable, friendly style, Konrad Lorenz uses illustrations from his everyday life among animals of all kinds to illustrate a variety of fascinating points. The balance between anecdotes and theory is well handled and the book stands out both as education and as entertainment. I find the sections dealing with keeping animals in captivity especially worthwhile - Lorenz explains clearly and concisely why most people feel sorry for captive animals for all the wrong reasons, this section should be required reading for most people who think that they are promoting 'animal rights'. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"KING SOLOMONS RING.","review":"This is a gem of a book. Written by the father of ethology, the study of animal behavior in nature, it provides a surprising amount of fascinating information in such a small book. He covers a variety of animals, both domestic and wild, and a number of issues, such as breeding behavior and aggression. I read this book twice, the first time I whipped through it. Only after I read it more deeply the second time did I realize just how much is covered. It's a short book, with nice drawings and cute stories. So everyone should read this book. Even if you don't think animal behavior interests you, you might be surprised and this is the book that will get you hooked on the subject."},{"Title":"KING SOLOMONS RING.","review":"I first read this book in college and thought it was okay, easy to read, friendly style, not too scientfic. But as the years have passed it is one of those readings that has stayed with me and been useful in my everyday life. I've even had a copy sent to my son who loves his fish tanks. I've grown up around animals, but since reading this book I see the actions of animals as so closely related to ourselves. To know that birds mate for life, makes listening to birds call each other so much more romantic. To know that even fish have mating rituals makes my own rituals that much better and acceptable. This book has given me that perspective for some 15 years, I can say it has definitely changed the way I have viewed the world, thus the way I have lived in the world- and for the better."},{"Title":"KING SOLOMONS RING.","review":"This book is true to Lorenz' style - humorous, intelligent, large hearted and adventurous. Besides being entertained, I came away with humility borne of the knowledge that human beings aren't truly supreme. Even the littlest fish exhibits interesting thought processes and overriding maternal extincts. One just has to look hard enough!"},{"Title":"KING SOLOMONS RING.","review":"I read this book while in high school and it prompted me to explore zoology. I recieved a BS in Zoology in 1969 and haven't looked back since. I suggest any parent to give this book to their child/children....it is mesmerizing. I now have geese to share with my grandchild and she dearly loves them."},{"Title":"KING SOLOMONS RING.","review":"I read Lorenz's book when I was a boy and have never forgotten it, except now that reading it again I see that any number of the animal facts I would spout to people, giving Lorenz as my reference, are severe distortions of his positions. I would tell people, for example, that lambs and sheep are totally different species, and in citing Lorenz I now realize he said nothing of the sort. One of the great things about KING SOLOMON'S RING is how many species it treats. We also had to read an earlier book by Lorenz, in which he discussed only dogs and how to train them. Did you know that Konrad Lorenz was the first scientist to discover that in every pacxk of dogs (even in any pair of two dogs) one dog will be the so-called \\"alpha male,\\" even when they are technically female? Lorenz was a scientist, a trained observer, but he also had a big heart and this spills out into his books.They are each of them veritable fountains of good writing and common sense, though sometimes he goes overboard in his enthusiasm.Some of the animals hje observed in his heyday are acting differently nowadays! I wonder if that is part of natural selection, or if they are being changed due to the ozone layer brteaking up and global warming. Even the patterns of birds' migrations are no longer the same, and they seem to be no longer travelling the immense distances we once thought they did (from Tierra del Fuego to the Maritimes, for example).In other ways, although dated, KSR remains one of Konrad Lorenz's great accomplishments. I remember meeting him around the time the United Nations honored him for his work with animals. He was a humble man with a witty grin, and the flourish of one who should have been an actor in the movies."},{"Title":"KING SOLOMONS RING.","review":"I first read this marvelous little book while taking a Comparative Ethology class in graduate school. It is truly a classic book of animal behavior. His approach, in this book anyway, was more of a comical narrative of his experiences in the field of ethology; however, the stories will remain timeless."}]`),x={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:F},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:S,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},D={class:"card-container"},P=["disabled"],C={key:0},M={key:1};function W(n,e,s,m,r,i){const c=f("PoemCard");return t(),a("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=o("div",{class:"top-banner"},[o("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[o("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),o("div",D,[(t(!0),a(y,null,w(i.visiblePoems,(h,g)=>(t(),p(c,{key:g,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),i.hasMorePoems?(t(),a("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>i.loadMore&&i.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(t(),a("span",M,"Loading...")):(t(),a("span",C,"See more"))],8,P)):b("",!0)])}const H=u(x,[["render",W],["__scopeId","data-v-aae1b876"]]),N=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"drive/64.md","filePath":"drive/64.md"}'),j={name:"drive/64.md"},z=Object.assign(j,{setup(n){return(e,s)=>(t(),a("div",null,[v(H)]))}});export{N as __pageData,z as default};
