This is in part Amazon's fault, because I'm looking at a Scholastic paperback listing and seeing reviews for an audiobook, for example. Because of that, I'm including the ISBN of the book I'm actually reviewing, hoping to keep things clear.A strange man appears in Iping, taking a room at the Coach and Horses owned by Mr and Mrs Hall. He doesn't make a fuss about the price, but does make odd requests from the first. Thrilled to have a paying guest, Mrs Hall is more than happy to oblige, especially since her guest was obviously the victim of a terrible accident. Covered from head to toe, other than the very tip of his nose, he gives no name and no answers to her prying questions. Money talks, though, and she accepts quite a bit in the way of strange and bad behavior. When money is stolen from a neighbor, things begin to come together for the people of Iping and they realize there's an invisible man in their midst. Chased from town and forced into hiding, he runs. While fleeing, he meets with Dr Kemp, who was his fellow student at University College, and tells him his story. He identifies himself as Griffin and the story he tells removes all doubt for the reader about pitying the poor misunderstood invisible man - he's most definitely an unfeeling monster.I couldn't help but wonder what to make of some of it. The sentence \\"Sounds like throwing the tablecloth about\\" made me wonder exactly what that sounds like - mine, thrown about, makes no noise. Also, Griffin says he made a rag invisible, as well as a cat. Of the cat, he says \\" ...giving drugs to a cat is no joke...\\". Does this mean he gave drugs to a rag? How is that possible? My pickiness aside, it's a very good book and a classic that everyone ought to read at least once. This edition is supposed to be for kids ages 9-13, but some might actually find it gives them bad dreams so I'd recommend it for the 9 year old who actually likes scary tales. It's not overly frightening, but a sensitive kid with a vivid imagination can scare himself silly fairly easily. Words like Strychnine and paleolithic appear through the book, so a dictionary to hand might help the younger ones.- AnnaLovesBooks"},{"Title":"The Invisible Man","review":"It was a cold and snowy February day when a stranger walked to a small country inn and ordered a meal and a private room.

In this story the people unite to terminate the Unseen; this doesn't always happen in the real world."},{"Title":"The Invisible Man","review":"A brilliant and obsessed scientist named Griffin makes an amazing discovery that -he thinks- will change the world completely: the method to achieve invisibility. Eager to show his environment the power of his invention and to obtain the necessary funds for his research, he applies the formula to himself. But soon he realises that a man with such capabilities is automatically cast out of society and will be hunted down like a rabies dog. Taking whatever action is necessary to keep his discovery safe, he terrorises the local village where he has sought refuge.The Invisible Man was serialised in the June and July 1897 numbers of Pearson's Weekly before its appearance in book form the following September. Surprisingly enough the story does not show a single sign of old age: it can almost be called a Modern Classic. In comparison to other great novels of the same period, Wells successfully avoids adding too obvious moral lessons to the story. Nevertheless The Invisible Man radiates one strong social message. Wells created a strong allegory to the Invisible Men of the Victorian times. He skilfully weaves together the elements of the story as the invisible Griffin first sees invisibility as a solution to every problem, but soon realises that it is nothing less than a gift from the Devil. As Griffin gradually loses his sanity and, ultimately, his humanity, the reader becomes aware that social invisibility breaks down the pillars of society.Although the story-line is quite straightforward, in such a way that the author leads the reader by the hand with first person narrative, the power of the story clearly lies with the evolution of the character Griffin. The deterioration of his moral is portrayed with such a convincing drive, that one easily gets to understand the motivation of his evil deeds."},{"Title":"The Invisible Man","review":"It is ironical that one of the characters of H. G. Wells' \\"The Invisible Man\\" finds the right explanation to the book itself: it is \`a story of brutal self-seeking'. The fact that he is referring to the invisible man's personal story itself actually helps to make the connection.\\"The Invisible Man\\" is in the surface a fantasy science fiction. But it is too simplistic to reduce Wells' book to that. At some point it can be read as a metaphor of living in society or the human nature. One is only free to be what he or she is once he/she is hidden. The character only shows his true colors once he is invisible -- what is a little ironic.Most of the characters are archetypical, and they work fine for the writer's purpose. With that he explore different strata of his society. And however much it is a fantasy; the aspects of the human nature are quite believable.Wells' writing is accessible and it is not difficult even for young readers. His style is very straightforward -- even when a flashback pops up-- and there is always something happening, what never let the rhythm falls. And, Wells' sense of humor is a plus. Some fantasy and science fiction contemporary writers should read Wells and learn a thing or two with this man -- who, by the way, was very ahead of his time."},{"Title":"The Invisible Man","review":"Ah, \\"The Invisible Man\\". One of H.G. Wells' big four books. Probably his least self-conscious in terms of conveying a meaningful message. Indeed, aside from some quick jabs of satire regarding class and the customary warning against bad science found in all \\"mad scientist\\" stories, Wells seems far more interested in having fun with the idea of an invisible man. The end result is just a treat.In a nutshell, a mysterious man, wrapped in bandages, arrives in a small English hamlet, takes a room in bording house, and demands absolute privacy, as he fiddles with chemistry sets and generally acts like a mad man. When he finally has enough of his neighbors' nosyness, this man, Griffin, rips off his bandages and false facial features, revealing himself in all of his invisible glory. He then creates all manner of mischief, even committing a murder. Looking up an old acquaintance, Kemp, Griffin relates his grand scheme for a \\"reign of terror\\", leading to the rule of the Invisible Man over the world.Despite Griffin's progressively evil nature, Wells was definitely going for laughs. Griffin is far more successful in being a general pain then he is a monster. Nonetheless, when he begins on his plans, they are unnerving. When he turns on Kemp, the reader genuinely fears for Kemp's safety. And yet when he meets his demise, we find ourselves rather pitying the poor fool.This novel was only directly filmed once, starring Claude Rains. While it alters the plot some, the film definitely captures the spirit of Wells' classic.While not Well's most sophisticated novel, it is among his most entertaining. You can't go wrong with this one."},{"Title":"The Invisible Man","review":"I watched the &quot;League of Extraordinary Genlemen&quot; and saw the Invisible man's likness in it. I instantly wanted to read the book, and I think it is one of the best I ever read. The plot is amazing, and although Mr. Griffin is homicidal, he never fails to lose his sense of humor. Though short, I would definitely read it again- because it is wonderful. If you haven't read it, then you are truly deprived of a good book."},{"Title":"The Invisible Man","review":"When the movie &quot;Hollow Man&quot; camed along, i thought it was going to be a modernized version of this book, so then i started reading it, this books it's very thrilling, smart, entertaining and suspenful, but this book didn't have to be that long, H.G. tries to make a long short story, but it would be a better book, if it cutted all those senseless chapters,also if he made a better descrpiption of what is he telling, it would be a better book, i give three and a half stars, because it feels just like if you are in there, and because it really has a very strong suspense and terror, but you rather read other H.G. Wells book such as &quot;The Time Machine&quot;."},{"Title":"The Invisible Man","review":"&quot;The Invisible Man&quot; by H. G. Wells is not your typical science fiction book. It doesn't have the long pages to develop a truly complex storyline and it doesn't have any mystical aspects that one might be attracted to. But in fact what it does have is characterization, suspense, and plot. The beginning of the book is all characterization, developing the story around our mysterious stranger who suddenly appears in the small English village of Iping. Townfolk grow curious and want to know more about their curious visitor. It is once they expose the Invisible Man that they infuriate him and cause him to go on a rampage, although this book does not have the standard violence and gore that others may have. Wells does a good job of describing the Invisible Man's temper and growing dementia. The conclusion of the novel depicts his final plunge into outright megalomania - spurred on in fact by his own genius and the reaction of others to his invisible condition. Each character has a unique personality and all of the characters strongly influence the outcome of the story. The final element in this story, theme, talks about how technological advancements should be put into the hands of the righteous who would use those advancements for good and not evil. This story is an excellent piece of science fiction literature by one of the world's most renown sci-fi authors-H.G. Wells and each character has its own personality by the end of the book, and this is not a very long book. Wells proves that it is quality, and not quantity that makes up a good story."},{"Title":"The Invisible Man","review":"This book teaches us that all man kind has a monster deep inside. Hatred, anger, and greed are true destoyers."},{"Title":"The Invisible Man","review":"The Invisible Man is a short, well-plotted story of a scientist who made an experiment without considering the consequences of his work. Although it was written in the late 19th century, it still speaks to readers in this current age of technology. Each day we reap the benefits and suffer the consequences of our cleverness. Like King Midas, Griffin found his dream was really a nightmare.At the same time we see a portrait of a violent man, a man who could not love himself and,thus, could not love others. This too, perhaps, has relevance in this age of high school shootings and other random acts of rage."},{"Title":"The Invisible Man","review":"What can I say? I'm a lover of the classics. H.G. Wells' THE INVISABLE MAN is one of the greatest sci-fi/horror stories of all times. Alien Voices brings this great piece of literature back to life with their version of it. John de Lancie and Leonard Nimoy bring their characters (Giffin and Kemp) a certain realistic quality which only they can do. Bravo!!!! Another Alien Voices success."},{"Title":"The Invisible Man","review":"It was a cold and snowy February day when a stranger walked to a small country inn and ordered a meal and a private room.

Wells classics!"},{"Title":"The Invisible Man","review":"In the book called'The Invisible Man'by H.G Wells,He explains why things that you think are someimes good that may be sometimes be bad.This book is mostly about a scientist, named Griffin, who tries the poison formula on him-self,discovers a method in which he can turn nearly anything invisible including himself. At first he thought that at the idea of being invisible, he soon discovers the many negative aspects and must continue his research to accomplish what he is discovering or dream.This book will be a great book for all types of readers.I would recommend that anyone that reads this story or novel,pay much attention on what the author's purpose of writing this story."},{"Title":"The Invisible Man","review":"This novel can be understood at several levels and each one is fundamental and excellent. First, the crazy scientist. A young physicist discovers the secret of invisibility. He implements it on himself and the situation in which he projects himself makes him absolutely crazy and his only objective becomes the desire to dominate the world in a reign of terror. New inventions change the relation between science and the world, between scientists and society, and produce a complete unbalance by projecting the inventors into some unknown land for which they are not prepared. They become crazy. Here Wells seems to advocate a socially-integrated science, a science that answers demands or orders or needs duly expressed by society. Second, the desire to discover new territories. There is no science if the desire to go beyond any known limits is not implemented, no matter what the consequences may be. The quest for this new knowledge has to come from one mind and has to be encouraged no matter what. But the danger we have already seen leads Wells to the conclusion that such quests must not be solitary and have to be shared among scientists. Hence the scientific community must encourage such research. Here Wells criticizes the scientific community : some try to plunder the research of young scientists for their own glory and interest ; some refuse any innovation that would disturb the social balance from which they draw their prestige and income ; some are even more negative and refuse any innovation because it disturbs some established truth. This condemns these young scientists to isolation or alienation. Third, modern society is severely criticized, and here Wells becomes very ironical. Some scenes are funny like the invasion of the department store by the invisible man. Wells takes an obvious pleasure in describing the puzzled reactions of individuals who are confronted to this invisible man. But Wells also becomes very critical at this moment and shows how society defends itself by becoming a military body of man-hunters. They do not try to negociate the integration or re-integration of the mad scientist. They just aim at mobilizing people into a vast hunt that has only one objective : to kill. Society is ready to kill any one who may disturb their social order just to eliminate the disturbing element and go back to the established normal order of things. In other words Wells shows us a deeply conservative society. In other words he is from his own age. Today science and technology are moving things at a tremendous speed without the possibility for any one to stop it. But Wells had seen something absolutely fundamental : change produces conservatism, or even extreme reactionary attitudes that can lead to fundamentalism and the total exclusion of groups that are seen then as scapegoats. Wells had foreseen the rise of fascism, nazism, and any other ideology that leads to the exclusion of one group of people, be they those who supposedly slow down change, or be they those who supposedly impose their version of this change. For Wells there seems to be no democratic way to manage change and scientific progress.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU"},{"Title":"The Invisible Man","review":"This book was astonishing to me because it's not a traditional science fiction novel. It's a novella. Making it easier to follow the actually complex plot. This is not a mad scientist story. It is about a young, immature, and brilliant chemist who saw only the benifits and none of the drawbacks. This book makes you take a second look at a lot of your fantasies."},{"Title":"The Invisible Man","review":"Here Wells develops the original notion of, well... being invisible. An unknown scientist is obsessed by the idea of becoming invisible, and he manages to pull it off. But the potential for power and mischief that come along with being invisible trigger very anti-social behavior. This book, in addition to being a superb sci-fi story, is a commentary on human nature. The invisible man is defeated only because of his impatience and carelessness. Both are caused by his newly acquired feeling of power. Thus this book is also a warning about the destructive potential of new and radical technologies. Not long before his death in 1946, Wells commented that reality took a page from his book and made it into an even more desperate and dark nightmare.There have been modern adaptions of this book, most recently by Hollywood in a less than impressive &quot;Hollow Man.&quot;"},{"Title":"The Invisible Man","review":"I first read this in the 8th grade &amp; have read countless times since then. The Invisible Man has to kill just to show how powerful he is. Of course, he's desperate to show being invisible is a worthy endeavor, because he can't figure out how to become visible again. Like his contemporary Verne, Wells was a visionary. Too many people were willing to use technology to the disadvantage of others. Maybe there's an &quot;Invisible Man&quot; analogy in the Stealth bomber: just because you can't see it doesn't mean it can't crash. This is Gothic horror after the Industrial Age: here, the character Griffin is Dr. Frankenstein AND the monster!

Who doesn't want to read about an invisible man? If I was able to choose a \\"super power\\", invisibility would definitely be one of my top three choices. The problem is I didn't find it that entertaining or interesting. I found the Invisible Man to be a bore and unlikeable. Who knew that the Invisible Man was a cranky guy with a temper?Yes, I realize that being invisible would be difficult, especially when you have no ability to become visible again but it seemed that he was unhappy and brash from the start. Maybe I am overthinking it too much, after all the Invisible Man is the anti-hero of the novel but I wanted to care about him a little and I couldn't.We don't hit the climax of the book until the last 25 pages or so.

Written in the late 1800s, the story suffers from none of the expected short comings one might expect in a book based heavily on science; a testament to the quality of Well's writing.The story deals both with the intricacies of what it would mean to be invisible as well as the inner turmoil suffered by the protagonist as he discovers the unexpected downsides of moving through life unseen. I expect any admirer of science fiction will find enjoyment in this short yet intriguing story which easily rates among Well's best."},{"Title":"The Invisible Man","review":"H.G. Wells certainly wasn't the first author to write stories involving something or someone who is invisible but his novel was definitely the first big hit of the invisible man genre. It is also easily the best known and widely circulated of the invisibility stories written before the 20th century. In fact with maybe the exception of H.F. Saint's Memoirs of an Invisible Man (1987) (which was later turned into a Chevy Chase movie which although enjoyable, was nowhere near the masterpiece that book was), Wells' 1897 classic is still probably the most well known of the genre today. This book also has had a number of movies made based on its story and as well has had a few sequel books written by other authors in the modern era such as Legacy of the Invisible Man by Dave Ulanski and The Invisible Dirty Old Man by Richard S McEnroe, both based on relatives of or people who found possessions of characters from Wells' story.This was one of H.G. Wells first stories, it was actually originally a short story as were most other invisible man stories pre dating it which Wells later came back and expanded to the length it is now. Being one of his first stories the quality of the storyline isn't always sensational and is in fact rather slow moving in parts for the reader. A large number of words Wells picked to use, unfortunately for him have also dropped out of the English language meaning you've either got to look them up or just take a wild guess as to what he is referring to. The best parts of the story were when Griffin was recounting how he became invisible and the events straight after in London to his friend Kemp. The novel really would have benefited from more of this type of storyline. Saying that though if you're a fan of the invisible man genre you definitely need to check this out. Better stories have been written in the modern era that go more into depth with the problems an invisible man faces and have a lot faster paced storylines such as H.F. Saint's Memoirs of an Invisible Man as well as Donald E Westlake's novel Smoke.The version of this book I have also has a lengthy intro by someone called Christopher Priest who is obviously a hard core fan of Wells. While it is great for fans of this genre to learn about other stories about invisible people (although it is certainly no comprehensive list there's many titles missing) unfortunately though Priest's bias shows as he makes some ludicrous claims about other stories being based on Wells' story which if he actually read these books, aside from having an invisible character have nothing more to do with this storyline at all then the this book does when compared to the invisibility stories that Wells must have read before writing this.Anyway if you have no idea what this novel's about the basic storyline is a man named Griffin wrapped in bandages who never takes of his coat or gloves checks into a small town hotel. Obviously trying to keep his secret Griffin is quite short with the busybody landlady and others who just walk into his room uninvited and keep pestering him about things that are non of their business. Small town bigotry and gossip has locals assuming he is either a member of an undesirable to them race, criminal or something worse, so when there is a burglary in town he is the main suspect. Not being treated the way he should be he decides he'll become even more abusive back to them so it is not long before a physical fight breaks out, the police get involved and he is forced to shed his clothing, expose his secret and escape. Not having the most pleasant of personality certainly doesn't help stop those he has enlisted to assist him from betraying him and stealing his possessions. Griffin decides that if he is going to be labelled and treated as a ruthless monster he will go one better and become an even worse and feared villain then their lies ever wrote in the papers."},{"Title":"The Invisible Man","review":"HG Wells was a master storyteller with an uncanny imagination centuries ahead of his time.He was the isaac asimov of the 19th century.We all know the story, so I will not reiterate it here and simply recommend that you read the book rather than watch the movie.The book would make an excellent bedtime story for your children."},{"Title":"The Invisible Man","review":"'The Invisible Man' is undoubtedly one of the early science fiction classics. And while its concept is deserving of strong praise the story itself is surprisingly narrow in scope. H.G. Wells was clearly an idea man who couldn't quite do much with prose. Therefore I generally feel disappointed whenever I finish one of his novels.In 'The Invisible Man' we have a young London scientist who discovers how to make mammals invisible, and imprudently uses himself as a test case. He then slowly loses his mind and becomes violent as he retreats from any form of succor. In the end he is hunted like an animal. Unfortunately the scientist is so ornery that this reader took no pity on him. And as you can imagine, the ending is not a happy one.'The Invisible Man' is really a trifling of a novel, more of a novella. There is very little in the way of character development, the dialogue is either low class British slang or high brow, aristocratic fluff. So once the clever unveiling of our invisible man is complete the story grows tired very quickly.Bottom line: see the movie instead."},{"Title":"The Invisible Man","review":"This book is by far the best science fiction book that I have ever read! H. G. Wells is one of the world best Science Fiction authors ever! This is a must read for any Sci-Fi fan!Overall: Read this book!"},{"Title":"The Invisible Man","review":"H.G. Wells is undeniably a master of ideas. Unfortunately, his concern for scientific details often interferes with his execution of a particular story. This is the case in his 'The Invisible Man'. Wells takes a fascinating idea of how invisibility could be possible and forces it into the story. The idea is good, the story is good, but they never meld. The requirements for invisibility are so specific that in order to find a suitable candidate, the executor must be a malevolent genius albino. Despite this improbability, the story could work, but Wells is much more interested in furthering his plot than in character development. The genius combined with the evil stupidities of his invisible man make the story almost laughable at points when it most wishes to horrify. One brief example is the dramatic moment when the invisible man succeeds in achieving invisibility. Despite the fact that he is a brilliant scientist, the man works the change during January in England. In order to be successful, the man has to be nude. As one may imagine, many inconveniences that help the plot ensue. There is no human nature to be found in this book, and for that reason, I quickly became bored. I love Wells' original ideas, but I find his execution heavy handed."},{"Title":"The Invisible Man","review":"This Scientific novel in spite of the fact of being very emotional from the beginning to the end is based on impossible realism, because a human being needs red corpuscle (red blood cells) to subsist. Without a doubt the good coordination and imagination of the writer transports the reader to a false reality that could see through in suspense and curiosity. The narrative capacity of Wells, The characterization of the actors in time, place and space give this novel a high rating for this type of scientific novels. Even though this novel was written more than one hundred years ago (1897) is consider a classic in science fiction. This novel also has a lesson for the present generation for which consequences should be measured and the possible results before making experiments with the unknown."},{"Title":"The Invisible Man","review":"Excellent character potrayal. It takes half a book to identify the character, well developed and story build up. However, a bit hard to read as style is Classic."},{"Title":"The Invisible Man","review":"It is interesting to note that not only is this not the most acclaimed of Wells' works, but it may not be the most acclaim novel that goes by the title \\"The Invisible Man\\". And it is difficult to top H.G. Wells, even if this is not his best work.Beginning in a manner that may remind the reader of Kafka, a mysterious visitor arrives in town. Revealing little about himself, he naturally arrouses the suspicions of the locals. When unexplained events occur in town, fingers begin pointing at the newcomer. Seemingly backed in to a corner, the invisible man reveals his state. Rather than arousing in sympathy, the invisible man becomes the aggressor. The reign of terror begins.Wells chose not to make the invisible man a sympathetic character, despite allowing the opportunity in the early pages. While the character's development is logical, the change is sudden and significant. The reader immediately wants this venomous person to be exterminated. The story did have scare value in its day. While \\"The Invisible Man\\" is an interestingread, the plot seems uneven."},{"Title":"The Invisible Man","review":"I seem to have an attraction to H.G. Wells' writing, and I had seen the classic Invisible Man movies, The Invisible Man, The Invisible Man Returns, The Invisible Woman, Invisible Agent, and The Invisible Man's Revenge. This is one of those books that was replaced in society by the movie, like The Wizard of Oz. I personally feel that in the case of The Invisible Man, the movie was not that much better. When it comes to the movies, I actually prefer The Invisible Man Returns because I didn't have a book to compare it to, and I preferred Vincent Price's performance over Claude Reins' performance. Why I'm explaining all of this stuff is because when reading the book, I pictured Vincent Price's performance in my mind.About the book, it is a wonderful story, and H.G. Wells really knew what he was doing when he explained how the invisibility potion was made. I also like the fact that they point out that the invisible man is naked. It seems like a comical aspect, but it's logical. I feel that this story really makes the invisible man a human being. When reading some of it, there are moments where I felt sympathy for him. I also like how several times, the invisible man is narrating the story by telling it to someone else. I feel that H.G. Wells was a big fan of the first person, but I also feel that he liked having the story be about someone telling the story, but I like that.Get this book."},{"Title":"The Invisible Man","review":"One of the most fertile and imaginative minds of the last 200 years, H.G. Wells foresaw the uses and impacts of the military tank, atomic bombs, and automobile freeways. Thanks to \\"The Invisible Man\\" we can add another biggie -- modern terrorism.Wells envisioned what strong currents of fear, chaos and dread could be unleashed in an open, industrialized society by a small group of disgruntled men, or -- as in our story -- by just one man with a powerful invention.Our author impressively challenged his own pro-science proclivities by showing how Griffin's breakthrough enabled him to sink to the lowest levels of depravity. Science is not necessarily uplifting, a heretical view among many Darwinists whom Wells associated with. Perhaps sentiments contained in \\"The Invisible Man\\" caused Wells's chances of leading England's Fabian Socialists to vanish.Humor is used to bring home the existential dilemna. Our bodies, visible or not, are something we're stuck with as long as we're alive, Wells reminds us.Another tension visible in the story and in Wells's own life is the individual's relationship to the masses. Wells, the political socialist, rose from humble circumstances (his father was a gardener, his mother a housemaid), making him a poster boy for capitalism and its up-from-boot-straps mystique. Griffin, Wells's \\"Invisible Man,\\" is also an exceptional individual. Does Wells believe exceptional people need to be beaten down by socialism? Perhaps Wells thought some (like Griffin) need to be deflated while others (like himself) need not be.Socialism usually means misery for all except the ruling clique (although Wells and idealistic fellow travelers of his era likely didn't view it as such). Maybe Wells took his public literary adoration as proof that he was one of the insulated elite.Wells resembles current-day social democrats in acknowledging the beneficial role of the entrepreneur amid welfarism (although they just can't keep themselves from playing politics). Capitalism's \\"creative destruction\\" weakens the glue of order, something Wells valued highly. How to maintain order and cultural consensus without killing the golden geese found only in a market system? Tis a question that won't disappear anytime soon."},{"Title":"The Invisible Man","review":"I loved it, and this is one of my favorite books. I love HG Wells's books.

If you're a fan of contemporary sci fi at all, you should definitely give this novel a try. It won't disappoint."},{"Title":"The Invisible Man","review":"For English class I needed to read a classic novel and it was pretty good but it was slow in the beginning."},{"Title":"The Invisible Man","review":"H.G. Wells' _The Invisible Man_ (1897) recounts the horror of a scientist condemned to invisibility due to an ill-advised choice to ingest potions that make him disappear. After conducting secret experiments for almost four years while living in London slums, scientist and provincial professor Mr. Griffin sees invisibility as a means to escape from poverty and obscurity. What motivates him is a desire for power and a wish \\"to transcend magic.\\" In the middle of the novel, Griffin recounts, \\"I beheld, unclouded by doubt, a magnificent vision of all that invisibility might mean to a man--the mystery, the power, the freedom. The drawbacks I saw none.\\" Of course, the story dwells on the drawbacks of both invisibility and of scientific investigation that lacks an awareness of consequences.One irony of the novel is that Griffin is, in many respects, already invisible by the time that he literally becomes invisible. The structure of the book reinforces this idea, as Griffin is invisible when the novel begins. His own story only emerges later. Through a reckless desire for \\"his magnificent vision,\\" Griffin alienates himself from his family and society as a whole in a profound way. As he seeks invisibility and immateriality, his impoverished background becomes repugnant to him; it is what he labors to abandon. For example, he describes his father's funeral with a bitter attention to the material circumstances and emotional dissociation: \\"I remember the funeral, the cheap hearse, the scant ceremony, the windy frost-bitten hillside, and the old college friend of his who read the service over him--a shabby, black, bent old man with a sniveling cold.\\" His literal invisibility leads to further alienation, which in turn precipitates violence. Wells offers a psychologically astute picture of the pathology of violence.Wells' construction of the science behind invisibility reveals his own deep fascination with science as well as a suspicion of its applications. Just as in _The Time Machine_ and _The Island of Dr. Moreau_, Wells' explanations of scientific experiments and inventions are ingenious and terrifying. Griffin develops a process to discolor his blood vessels and remove his pigmentation. Such a pursuit, however, lacks any intrinsic merit. Wells suggests that when science exceeds the limits of nature and is undertaken as a form of monomania, danger inevitably ensues.One of the novel's strengths is that it presents the predicament of Griffin's particular form of invisibility empirically. In other words, the practical challenges that Griffin faces as he moves about the world are described vividly. To be fully invisible, for instance, requires that Griffin be completely naked, since only his physical person, not his clothes, is invisible. This is especially entertaining because Griffin's physical attributes are withheld from the reader who sees only what the characters themselves see, which his thin air. The reader, like the characters, must imagine the antagonist, Mr. Griffin, in order to know who he is.In the final chapters, Mr. Griffin assumes the role of the most feared agents in contemporary society--the terrorist. Unseen in the midst of civil society, the invisible man strikes with vengeance, using his invisibility as a weapon. Griffin desires to make his presence felt and feared: \\"That invisible man must now establish a reign of terror [...] He must issue orders. He can do that in a thousand ways [...].\\" The end of the novel, particularly the chapter \\"The Hunting of the Invisible Man,\\" describes how the English town of Burdock attempts to apprehend an invisible threat.The Invisible Man is surprisingly relevant in terms of its discussions of social invisibility, science, and violence."},{"Title":"The Invisible Man","review":"Just as the foreword says, the wonders of invisibility does have its pros and cons. Or put it this way, it can be used for both bad and good, but given human nature, more to the former. Shoplifting, sneaking into movies for free, robbing a house, even murder or rape. It's that element of surprise that gives invisibility its appeal, that sense of being powerful and thus invulnerable. However, imagine someone looking around to make sure nobody's around, sees nobody, pulls out a gun and shoots at nothing, hitting an invisible person. Moreover, what if one couldn't revert to visibility? Both assets and disadvantages are experienced by the title character, who during the course of H.G. Wells's immortal 1897 novel, goes around the bend.The Coach and Horses country inn in Iping gets a mysterious visitor on 29 February 1896-the year's not mentioned, but I say this because 1896 is the closest Leap Year-and this person isn't exactly hospitable. He's brusque, reclusive, demanding, and temperamental, as he breaks things but is willing to have them put on his bill.Iping being a small-town and all, it isn't long before people learn about the \\"damned rum customer\\" at the inn. Rumours start flying. One is that he's an escaped criminal in disguise. The most amusing comes from Mr. Fearenside, whose dog bit the stranger's leg. \\"He's a kind of halfbreed, and the colour's come off patchy instead of mixing.\\" The only thing patchy here is Fearenside's theory, but let's not go there. A burglary and an event the inn's proprietress Ms. Hall attributess to spirits occur, before the stranger's secret is unveiled, to reveal... nothing. But that's only the beginning, as the stranger's hot temper eventually becomes his undoing.Wells' writing in this novel is more journalistic. He writes from the POV of someone having heard this account from other sources, like the characters in the story. The account of a murder that takes place reads out partly like a police report, but also a detective yarn. And he gets the dialect of the Iping folk down pat--imagine people talking like Hagrid (Harry Potter).There are also interesting bits of writing, as when he describes Mr. Huxter yielding to unconsciousness: \\"The world seemed to splash into a million whirling specks of light, and subsequent proceeded interested him no more.\\"Like its predecessor The Island Of Dr. Moreau, Wells' novel is another portrayal of science gone wrong under misguided scientists."},{"Title":"The Invisible Man","review":"It does no good for me to declare H.G. Wells as being a man ahead of his time, as this has been stated thousands of times over the last century, but his unique mastery of foresight is quite evident here in The Invisible Man.The story follows a stranger, completely covered head to toe in heavy clothing, with only the skin of his nose exposed, having just arrived in the small English village of Iping, where he checks into a local inn. Shortly after the stranger's arrival, the townsfolk begin to take an interest in the peculiar newcomer, as he never removes his dressings, and tends to venture out only in the evenings. The stranger has an enormous chemistry lab shipped to his room in the inn, which draws many speculations from the inn's guests and owners, thus drawing unneeded attention to the man.After a series of odd occurrences, such as burglaries, begin cropping up in the quaint village, a local man discovers a shocking truth about the stranger: he is invisible beneath his clothing. This triggers a wave of rumors and panic, and the invisible man, enraged and in need of hiding, is driven out of the town, where we eventually learn the truth behind his mysterious condition.The story starts off a little slow as Wells sets the scene, but once the pieces start coming together, the narrative is compelling and clever in its simplicity. I will keep mum about the details, but only reveal that Wells' understanding of science and storytelling merge to form a brilliant sci-fi tale, that was truly ahead of its time."},{"Title":"The Invisible Man","review":"Imagine if you were invisible and could come and go as you pleased, with nobody able to see you. Cool, right? Well, not really. H.G. Wells' \\"The Invisible Man\\" has the sci-fi master exploring what would happen if a person took an invisibility elixir, and discovered too late that invisibility has some definite downsides. It's possibly Wells' funniest novel, but it also has some wonderfully chilling moments.A strange man arrives at a hotel in Iping, wrapped up in goggles, bandages, scarves, and heavy clothes. He spends most of his time hidden away in his room, doing odd scientific experiments, and avoiding contact with other people -- while still keeping everything except his nose hidden. Meanwhile, the local vicar and his wife are robbed by a mysterious thief... who is completely invisible.Well, you can guess what's up with the stranger -- he's an invisible man, and after a blowup with his landlady he reveals his true.... um, lack of appearance to the entire town. After a series of disastrous encounters, the Invisible Man encounters Dr. Kemp, an old friend to whom he reveals how he became invisible, and what he's done since then... as well as his malevolent plans for the future.H.G. Wells isn't really known for being a funny writer, but the first part of \\"The Invisible Man\\" is actually mildly hilarious. He writes the first third or so of the book in a fairly light, humorous style, and there are some fun scenes speckled through the story, like a homeless man dealing with the Invisible Man (\\"Not a bit of you visible--except-- You 'aven't been eatin' bread and cheese?\\").But things get much darker after Mr. Kemp enters the scene, and we find out that the Invisible Man is... well, kind of malevolent and crazy. Very crazy.And as the plot grows darker and grimmer, Wells also inserts a clever (if far-fetched even by Victorian standards) explanation for how a person could become invisible, using a mix of science and fantasy. The plot hurtles through wild chase scenes and the occasional riot, and some moments of bleak tension (\\"When dawn came to mingle its pallor with the lamp-light and cigar smoke of the dining-room, Kemp was still pacing...\\")The Invisible Man himself (aka Griffin) is a pretty mysterious character for most of the story, since all we know about him is that he's invisible.... and also kind of a jerk. I mean, the guy constantly flies off the handle and even robs a nice little old vicar. And the more we find out about him, the more malignant and insane he turns out to be.Even if you had a way to become invisible, \\"The Invisible Man\\" would be a pretty effective way of dissuading people from using it. A deserving classic."},{"Title":"The Invisible Man","review":"The invisible man tells the story of a man who invents an invisible serum which not only affects his personal life, but also his mental state. The book overall is very discriptive. It containd so much eloquence and scientific backround you may think that the serum is real. The sence of realism and scientific explanation creates a story so pulse pounding you will not put it down. Probably the main strength of the invisible man is the personal life of Griffin, the scientist that invented the serum, he did not have a joyfull childhood, and he did not have a good life overall, though he is a man of great brilliance, so once he became invisible his life went to an all time low. He is in the nude in mid london, he does not have much money, he is very much frustrated. He then becomes a tad violent and mentally unstable at times; and due to that he cause a discord in an inn in the rural london that makes him a n infamous beast, and ofcourse london is at a peak of terror.

G. Wells is a classic book published in 1899, so while it fulfills the requirement of a classic book from the 19th century for my Classics Challenge, besides that, I wasn't impressed.\\"The Invisible Man\\" is a story about a man, Griffin, who is invisible and angry with the world. He realizes that if he wears clothing or eats, his clothing and food are seen. If he moves, he's heard. So basically, an invisible man is good for causing terror and abuse. Thus, Griffin proceeds to cause terror and harm to the people in the story.I greatly disliked the invisible man, Griffin. He's an evil character, but not even a villain you enjoy, like the Joker in Batman. He's just ruthless, unfeeling, angry, selfish, and really rude to people.I recommend this book to people who want to read the classics, but I didn't enjoy it myself. It's a quick read, I just wasn't a fan.I'd prefer to recommend \\"The Island of Dr. Moreau\\" by H. G. Wells if you are looking for a short classic by the same author. And although I disliked this book, I still have on my list, and will read another one of his books, \\"The Time Machine.\\"What are your thoughts on \\"The Invisible Man\\" and H. G.

While there are some defiantly dated things in the book I do not believe that this take away from it too much because like all good science fiction it focuses on the human element of what a new technology or other change will cause. In this classic story of science taken to its grotesque conclusion the reader is shown that being invisible is not all that it is cracked up to be and presents its own unique problems even for someone look to exploit that ability like the main character Griffin, Despite the fact that Griffin is not a very sympathetic character at all I could not help but feel a little sorry for him. I could not help but ask myself what I would have done in Griffin's place and whether his predicament was one to be envied or avoided. This is a story that has aged very well and is still a very entreating read that makes the reader ask themselves what they would do in a similar situation and how would society at large deal with someone who did have such an ability."},{"Title":"The Invisible Man","review":"I somehow managed to miss this one while I was reading all of Wells' other books as a kid. I guess I just thought an invisible man was sort of a low rent villain. I was thinking that the protagonist (Griffin) would be a scientist trying to advance science for the benefit of mankind but would be caught up in the unforeseen consequences of his invention. Sort of like \\"The Fly.\\" I also remembered the movie in which it is portrayed that the drugs that allow him to achieve invisibility is what turned a good man into a raging madman.Not this guy.What follows below may be spoilers to some. I don't give away any cliffhangers or plot twists but I do realize that some people (myself included) like to know as little as possible before they read a story.***************Griffin is pure psychopath from the word go. I don't want to give anything away, but at one point Griffin tells the story of his life before, during and after perfecting the invisibility process (which by the way is fascinating) and I found his matter of fact and remorseless descriptions of his actions to be chilling. He is pure self-centered id. His only intended uses for his invention are killing, theft, extortion and terrorism and he considers any target to be fair game if it serves his purpose. I found the last third of the book riveting as Griffin unleashes his rage on the world and anyone he perceives to stand in his way. And don't look for any moments of epiphany and change of character. Griffin is pure evil and hate and now has a \\"gift\\" that allows him to spread terror to get whatever he wants.Finally, Wells was a great writer. There is a strong sense of satire and social commentary here as we find that the other characters are really no less selfish (and often violent) as Griffin. There are no heroes here.I don't know whether this is fair or not but I only gave it four stars because I compared it to other Wells books and I didn't like it as much as \\"The Time Machine\\" or the masterpiece \\"The Island of Dr. Moreau.\\""},{"Title":"The Invisible Man","review":"Cool and Mysterious!

I have collected all the previous magazines of the series and still enjoy leafing through them on a rainy day"},{"Title":"James Bond: On Her Majesty's Secret Service","review":"I was very excited to hear that Titan was set to deliver even more editions of the James Bond strips that appeared in the pages of The Daily Express in the 1960s and even more pleased to hear that two of my favorite Fleming books - 'On Her Majesty's Secret Service' and 'You Only Live Twice' were set to appear in the same edition.Some years ago, back in the 1980s I had picked up a previous edition of 'Octopussy' that Titan had put together and promptly devoured the book and for years later had wished and wanted to see the rest of the series. Here at last some two decades later I am getting my chance - and am extremely happy about it.Not only do we get the comic-strip adaptation of the above two books in this one edition, but we also get an introduction by Bond actor George Lazenby (who played the character in the 1969 movie) as well as a discussion of the Fleming books (from 'Doctor No' to 'For Your Eyes Only') and before the beginning of both novels a brief discussion on the background behind the comic-strips and even mention of where the strip deviates from the book which it is adapting.A word of warning must go out to those who only know the secret agents exploits through the popular series of EON Productions movies. These strips are based on the Fleming novels which are very different from the 007 movies (at least since 1971 onwards). In fact one of the novels adapted here - 'On Her Majesty's Secret Service' may be the Fleming novel most faithfully adapted for the movie screens.Titan Books deserve a great deal of credit for publishing these editions and this one will undoubtedly (and justifiably) become a proud addition to the bookshelves of every self respecting fan of the novels of Ian Fleming and in particular of his most famous creation - James Bond."},{"Title":"James Bond: On Her Majesty's Secret Service","review":"Like the previous reviewer I had stumbled onto the other Titan releases in the late eighties- and loved them. Now Titan has resumed publishing these strips and I couldn't be happier. You can read my GOLDFINGER review on that page.OHMSS has long been one of my favorite Bonds- novel and film! Now I can add comic strip to that category as well.There are some \\"issues\\" because the comic strip version of THUNDERBALL had been cut short and the character of Bloefeld was never properly introduced. OHMSS hardly misses a beat without this information. This is a testimony to Henry Gammidge's adaptation skills.John McLusky did a spectacular job with the art. I think he really hit his stride with GOLDFINGER, and only got better. The two adaptations in this volume are some of his best work ever! The material seems dated only in that it takes place in the late fifties. The artwork itself is modern and vital- or, if you prefer, it was advanced for it's time.If you're wondering whether the strips are as good as the novels, I have to say they are- for what they are. Sure, they're comic strips but they're faithful adaptations of Flemings books with the language and sexuality toned down.Titan is releasing CASINO ROYALE in June, and it appears to be 36 pages longer than the previous 1990 release. I suspect they will be including MOONRAKER in this volume. ***Note-According to the Titan website it will still include only CASINO ROYALE and LIVE AND LET DIE. I'm not sure what all the extra pages will be!***I say we try to get Titan to release all 20+ years of the James Bond Comic Strip in published form."},{"Title":"James Bond: On Her Majesty's Secret Service","review":"another saga in Flemings' greatest spy stories. i am an avid fan so very very very biased. i enjoyed this one much more than the movie. if you are in to bond, then you must read these GNs."},{"Title":"James Bond: On Her Majesty's Secret Service","review":"On Her Majesty's Secret Service is my personal favorite James Bond novel. The movie (On Her Majesty's Secret Service - 2-Disc Ultimate Edition) adhered closely to the novel and this collection of daily comic strips likewise stays faithful to the most humanizing James Bond story. (You Only Live Twice included in this volume follows the novel, not the movie version). The artwork by John McLusky starkly captures the time period of the 1960s. The story is presented very straight-forwardly in classic three and two panel segments. Though this book cannot be equated to modern 'graphic novels', James Bond fans will appreciate seeing a familiar story in a different medium."},{"Title":"The philosophy of physical science,","review":"Arthur Stanley Eddington was British astrophysicist who was the first person to really understand Einstein's Theory of Relativity. He also developed the first accurate description of stellar processes including the discovery of the mass-luminosity relation. A decade later Hans Bethe worked out exactly the fusion process that produced stellar radiation and heat. It conformed to Eddington's general framework. Eddington wrote up his theory of stellar processes in 1926 in \\"The Internal Constitution of the Stars.\\"He was also the Carl Sagan of his day. In a series of books based upon public lectures he gave at various venues in England, Eddington explained the amazing transformation of physics in the early 20th century to the educated lay public. He also explained that scientific knowledge is subjective but also can be absolute. His concept of \\"subjective absolutes\\" is unique and, I think, accurate, although most scientists to this day maintain that science is objective. It takes Eddington about 4 pages to show that no knowledge can be objective because individuals create knowledge, hence always must come from a subject whose cognitive ability is constrained. Plus scientific knowledge is always evolving toward better explanations. But scientists do search for absolutes and assume there is an objective world \\"out there.\\" His metaphor of the ichthyologist is not only witty but a beautifully effective way to communicate his epistemological viewpoint.Eddington is also the soul of dry British wit. All of Eddington's books written for the lay public are examples of how to explain a difficult subject clearly without compromising on quality. He is a joy to read. He is also opinionated, which is also fun. I don't agree with all his opinions and in some ways his later work in physics ended up in what seems to be a dead end, but for anyone wanting to understand what happened in physics when Einstein discovered relativity theory and a host of brilliant physicists developed quantum mechanics, there is no better source than Eddington."},{"Title":"First Seven Days","review":"In The First Seven Days, Alan, Linda, and Lindsay Parry successfully collaborate to blend a counting book with the biblical creation story.

The sprial binding also makes it easy to use and perform from."},{"Title":"Quiet talks on power (The family inspirational library)","review":"Quiet Talks on Poweris one of those books which you return to over and over, there is so much wisdom in its pages. Actually, all of S.D. Gordon's books are that way, full of biblical wisdom in simple language with wonderful applications. Even though this was written a long time ago, it is very relevant today as we live in a culture of \\" easy believism\\", where \\" religion and christianity \\" have taken on a different meaning than what it meant in S.D. Gordon's time. He talks about the reality of the Holy spirit working in our lives, always pointing us toward Jesus Christ, he talks about the power evident in lives when we walk with Him on a daily basis. Many people are hungry today for that kind of relationship with a God who continues to draw us to Himself. This book, as well as his other ones, will deepen your understanding of God's love in your life."},{"Title":"Quiet talks on power (The family inspirational library)","review":"S. D. Gordon's writings are as pertinent today as they were a hundred years ago. He has captured the timeless step by step instructions from the scriptures on how to live a powerful life to accurately represent the Lord in the earth today. He reaches into the scriptures and brings to life the scenes that illustrate his simple but profound lessons. I highly recommend this book and his others for anyone interested in a deeper understanding of inner life in the Spirit."},{"Title":"Eagles","review":"It's not like there are a lot of Eagles biographies floating around out there, and Laura Jackson (no relation to me, despite having the same last name, so no nepotism at work in this review) does cover some ground not found in \\"To the Limit\\" by Marc Eliot or \\"The Long Run\\" by Marc Shapiro. I'd rank it a distant second behind \\"To the Limit\\" but still well ahead of \\"The Long Run,\\" which I thought was rather sloppily written, although even it contained some factoids that added some value.I think Eliot does the best job of in-depth research, however. Some people have knocked his book because he seems to \\"take it easy\\" on Don Henley in certain key areas, and I understand their beefs. He virtually ignores Henley's police incident with the underage prostitute (which Jackson does cover in \\"Flying High\\"), which seems odd, considering his otherwise detailed insights into Henley before, during and after his time in the Eagles. However, the personal interviews he did with Henley certainly give his book a more personal feel than \\"Flying High\\" or \\"The Long Run.\\"\\"Flying High\\" seems to me like it was pieced together from many pre-existing articles. The writing style, though competent, seems more like a research paper than a biography, which is ironic, because Eliot's book is the one with the exhaustive endnotes. I prefer Eliot's writing style. That being said, \\"Flying High\\" does give some information on Frey, Felder, Walsh, and Meisner and even Henley that is not found in Eliot's book. Furthermore, since it was written more recently, it gives valuable info on the Eagles' most-recent reunion.It took me a little while to figure out that Jackson is apparently an English author, and so I had to get used to words like \\"artistes\\" rather than \\"artists,\\" but it was mildly interesting to see the Eagles story told with a British accent (and perspective). Still, I think the distance caused by being an English writer is part of the \\"term paper feel\\" problem. And the Eagles weren't anywhere near the chart phenomenon in the United Kingdom that they were in the United States, so it doesn't have the intrigue of reading, say, a Cheap Trick biography written by a Japanese author.I hate to be nit-picky, but at least one factual error really bothered me. Jackson says that Henley only sang one song on the Eagles debut album, \\"Witchy Woman.\\" Any serious Eagles fan knows that he also sang \\"Nightingale.\\" It's not just a known fact; it's obvious from listening to the song. She not only says gets that crucial fact about Henley incorrect, she also mistakenly attributes the vocals on \\"Nightingale\\" to another band member elsewhere in the chapter. If you can't trust the author to get a fact like that straight, how do you know the other facts are correct?To me, as a former reporter, I find it disturbing that a person who considers herself enough of an expert to write a biography would make such a mistake. Compare that to Eliot's book which not only gives Henley the proper attribution but also includes the story as to why Henley sang on \\"Nightingale\\" (i.e. he was sent back into the studio to record it because the label felt the album needed another song with him singing on it). Nevertheless, Jackson's book is still much better than the third choice, \\"The Long Run\\" by Shapiro.If you're an Eagles fan hungry for as much info as you can get, then \\"Flying High\\" is still worth your time. But if you can only buy one book, then get \\"To the Limit.\\""},{"Title":"Eagles","review":"My big mistake in buying this book was disregarding the reviews. This book sucks! I'm sure that the author, based on all her other books, is a fine writer, but she dropped the ball on this one. It would appear that she didn't leave her home to write it...that she took advantage of the internet to gather her facts and quotes. Some of her facts were innacurate, such as saying that Timothy B. Schmit might have \\"taken a step backward\\" when he participated in the Poco reunion. That was Randy Meisner! Not only is that common knowledge, If you read \\"Pickin' Up the Pieces\\" by Richie Furay, He says that when the Poco reunion was in the planning stages, he suggested that Timothy as well as Paul Cotton be a part of it and his suggestion was shot down. There some other singer/songwriting inaccuracies as well. She is obviously British, which isn't a bad thing, but I seriously doubt that she left the country let alone her desk to get her facts. Save your money...the Felder book is great!"},{"Title":"Eagles","review":"The Eagles, Flying High, is a short but insightful look at the group in all its glory and shame. Mostly the glory.

However, even with the lack of great detail, and the presence of some inaccuracies, her inferences are interesting and not far off the mark."},{"Title":"Home Swell Home","review":"Just like it's mama publication Swell: A Girl's Guide to the Good Life, this isn't a bible--it's for inspiration. CR and IR remind you that your place is a reflection of you--so why not make it just as kooky, fun, crazy, and yep, swell, as you are? You're not going to read this book on the way to Home Depot to pick up exactly what you're going to buy to re-do your bathroom. You're going to read it and be inspired to think up your very own ideas. What could be more swell than that?"},{"Title":"Home Swell Home","review":"This book was a disappointment. There is a small handful of good ideas (ie. using frayed denim as a bedskirt, paintng one wall a bright color and the rest of the walls white, hanging hooks on the bedroom wall to hang your outfit for the next day, etc.). However, the remaining totally absurd ideas, the constant suggestions of having a bar/minibar throughout various rooms of the house, the abuse to books (nevermind perhaps reading the books and enrichening oneself), and the flippant suggestions to just have your carpenter come over and do the work made me think the authors are just a bunch of arrogant mindless rich witches most likely on drugs. Not everybody can afford to own a place or hire a carpenter/contractor, especially during these times. The real creativity lies in making something wonderful with little resources. I also did not appreciate the broad generalizations they make and hold as truth, such as stating it is a known fact that people who can cook cannot make a good cup of coffee. Ehhh? I don't think so. This was the most irritating book to read, and I had to force myself to read it through to the end. I really felt like burning it when I finished reading. And I consider myself pretty open-minded....

There are also no real pictures (save for one of the two writers/designers on the last page). A decorating book with no pictures? There are illustrations, but c'mon, we're not talking detailed images or even very imaginative ideas. I kept on going back to the table of contents thinking that I must have missed something, that they were somehow hidding pictures, or projects, or different colour schemes or anything, but alas no. If you're really looking for a swell guide to designing your digs this is surely not it. I'm pretty sure I wrote something like this book a few years back for a college 'zine. Trying for a groovy 'It' girl look? try checking out my lists, or check out design books by period, get a feel for your style, which designers you like, which period you like.

Some of the advice is annoying and just makes you go &quot;duh. I knew that&quot;.

However, I found the prose a bit forced, i.e. trying too hard to be \\"zany\\" and \\"edgy,\\" and the contents seemed a bit random. To me, it read like a book that was just cranked out by the authors due to publishing pressure (following the success of their original book). The authors even mention a couple instances in the book where they were trying to find inspiration in order to finish certain sections, and there are a few editing errors (typos, grammar). The authors also make several references to alcohol/bars/hangovers, which I found a bit odd (due to the # of times)... Maybe I'm just getting old (38). This book would likely be best for gals seeking ideas for college dorm room or first apartment, etc. Not so good for someone looking for more realistic/mature (albeit fun) home decorating inspiration.

I was disappointed at the book's size and how few pages it had. Add that to the fact that the pages say nothing, and you get nothing for your money.

I've had my copy since back in the day and it never is on the shelf, but always near my music collection for handy reference. Concise yet informative, the format makes for a quick study. Released before discs were available, the book features (275) classic album covers in both color and black and white. Glimses into the classic album covers is worth the price of admission alone. The discographies are complete up to the time of publication in the late 70's. There are many rare photographs as well featuring many of the giants of America's music. The book is a comprehensive who's who of jazz with over 400 artists covered. Short biographies covering mostly the musicians artistic career reflects the various stages the musician passed through in their development, which groups they played with etc. There are obscure artists featured as well as the more popular. The records listed for each artist include UK releases that may have been unavailable in the United States. This is especially helpful for the jazz album collector who is hunting the second hand used record bins. There are some quite rare releases that are still floating around in the thrift stores and swap meets. In essence there is a wealth of information that mixes nicely with the nostalgia of the days of old school jazz records. Recommended for jazz afficionados everywhere."},{"Title":"Italian journeys","review":"William Dean Howells, an immensely influential figure in the history of American letters, now almost unjustly forgotten, wrote a biography of Lincoln, and was rewarded by the president with a consulship in Venice. He and his Bostonian wife travelled around Italy in the 1860s, and he reported what he saw in this excellent book, an entire chapter of which is devoted to the gruesome but fascinating history of the Gonzagas of Mantua--murderers, cutthroats and thieves, but at more peaceful times, patrons of the arts.

The great paintings and frescoes, we travel to see, were only a fringe benefit of a terrible turbulent time in the history of Italia.

Among the luminaries in this group were Ruth Benedict, Margaret Mead, Erik Erikson, Lawrence Frank, Helen and Robert Lynd, Ruth Munroe. And then there was Gardner Murphy, a friend of all these, who in his great book \\"Personality\\" (1947) synthesized the teachings of this group.The present volume by his widow, the late Lois Barclay Murphy, herself a distinguished psychologist, tells the story of Gardner Murphy's life and friends. It will be of interest to all who are curious about these men an women who so profoundly influenced social science in those decades.I was a student of Gardner Murphy at New York's City College in the early 1950's, and I appreciate the extravagant praise that his widow heaps upon his teaching prowess. When I walked into Murphy's lectures, I entered a world of no-nonsense intellectual discourse. We young undergraduates were barely adult, but Murphy treated us with a respect due to fellow intellectuals. Those of us who rose to the occasion were rewarded with an education that remains unforgettable.It is now more than fifty years later, and upon reviewing Murphy's written work of those years, it is pleasant to note that, with all the naivete of his group, Murphy was no man's fool. He accepted most of the doctrines of his day -- the presumed power of the Rorschach test, to give but one example -- but he was never as uncritical as some of his friends. He was also curiously drawn to \\"psychic\\" phenomena as a field of investigation, but unlike others similarly afflicted, he was critical and cautious in his approach.Lois Murphy's volume was published in 1990. She was then eighty-eight years of age, and Gardner had by then been eleven years dead. The book contains many details of historical interest, and I am glad to own it. But it is totally uncritical, not only of Gardner, but of the group of social scientists to which he belonged. It is in many ways more of a eulogy than a biography. When the book was published, the cracks in the doctrines of this group had already become apparent. Derek Freeman's trenchant criticism of Margaret Mead's work had appeared in 1983, and Lee Cronbach's critique of the Rorschach test as early as 1955.Gardner Murphy's life and work gives us the opportunity to examine the strengths and weaknesses of his generation of social scientists. This book does not rise to this challenge."},{"Title":"Germany: The Federal Republic of Germany","review":"This big hardcover book highlights German buildings and landscapes, with an emphasis on historic structures such as churches and palaces.

The principal character Razumov is a quiet philosophy student who gets caught up with the anarchist Haldin. Instead of helping Haldin Razumov goes to the authorities and betrays him.This leads to further complications. Razumov has been appointed as if by fate to become a tool of the autocracy; he has no choice really. He is sent on a mission to Geneva in order to spy on Russian emigres living there.Haldin's mother and sister are living there waiting for word from him. The emigres are grotesque. Eventually Razumov confesses that he is helping the government and is almost beaten to death. In the end Razumov returns to Russia where he is cared for by a servant woman. Conrad suggests, as he does in most of his writings, that our fate is something beyond us and his skill is in showing how that is so"},{"Title":"Under Western Eyes","review":"This is a Russian story for Western ears, says the narrator, an Englishman who teaches languages in Geneva at the beginning of the 20th century.A Russian student in St.Petersburg is faced with a dilemma that must have been experienced in similar form by many others in many times and countries, and by many more in their imagination. What would I do, if...Say, you were a German student with vaguely leftwing orientation in the early 70s, and Ulrike Meinhof had just gone underground, and by some strange combination of coincidences she turns up in your flat and asks for temporary shelter and some minor help in an escape plan.This is the situation that Conrad puts his hero Razumov in. Not with Meinhof, silly, but with a freshly successful assassin of a high Russian politician; the 2 students knew each other barely.From here, Conrad develops a compelling story of betrayal and espionage and political revolution, starting in St.Petersburg, then moving to Geneva. Like in real life, one might say. Switzerland becomes the playground for the Russian revolutionaries in exile and for their hunters. The title of the story means exactly that: Russian fights fought in the West for \`them' to watch and wonder over.(This book is another case of oddly misinforming book descriptions, here on an otherwise blameless Penguin: the back cover says that the book explores the conflict between East and West. What nonsense. The book explores no such thing.)Conrad was far from sympathizing with \`the Russians', but he seems to have known them quite well. His Razumov (the word means \`reason' or \`mind', says the writer of the notes) is a variation on Razkolnikov. Conrad disliked Dostoyevsky, who was \`too Russian' for him, but he was rather obviously writing \`against' him here. Razumov's guilt is his betrayal of the assassin, and his atonement/punishment comes in hard struggles between reason/self preservation and emotion.The novel has a rather simple structure, for a major Conrad novel.The narrator came into possession of Razumov's diaries; he paraphrases and summarizes them for us. (Why not stick to the fiction and let us read the \`original' diary, as Nabokov might have done? - I thought of Nabokov here because VN, like JC, disliked Dostoyevsky; it may be an interesting subject to compare the differences of the dislikes of JC and VN.)Part 1 is the story in St.Pete, by the diaries. Then we follow the narrator's personal experience in Geneva. Protagonists in the story have not read part 1, of course... This gives the narration a Hitchcockian flavor. We know more than the people in the story, and that drives suspense.JC did not have the benefit of the Bolshevik revolution hindsight, that's why some of the politics are oddly off target. It could hardly be otherwise in 1910.The novel has more women than most other Conrad books. This about the main female character: at the educational institutions, she was looked upon unfavorably. She was suspected of holding independent opinions.Quite possibly, JC wrote women into this book as a defense mechanism. He had been attacked from that angle.In the life work of Conrad, this novel is in a surprising position. He wrote it before he reached his prominent and profitable phase. It is not necessarily a shocking departure in terms of methods, but it is for sure a pure thriller: a precursor of Graham Greene and John Le Carre, and their next generation. There is nothing of the complexity and complication of Nostromo in this novel. Even the Secret Agent is much more complex.I do not hesitate to include this in my short list of best Conrads."},{"Title":"Under Western Eyes","review":"The book could have been interesting but it's simply not up to Joseph Conrad's usual quality. It's rather plodding and the characters are not really convincing."},{"Title":"Under Western Eyes","review":"Conrad writes like Dostoyevski. This book might have been a knock off of Crime and punishment. It has all the soul searching and emoting that you expect from Russian works. Self destruction is a main theme.It also has some uniquely Conrad touches. The destruction of the main character's eardrums by Nikita's violent slapping is a typical Conrad detail. The reconciliation of the traitor and the rebels also has his touch.A rather dark and heavy read, but worthwhile if you enjoyed Heart of Darkness."},{"Title":"Under Western Eyes","review":"You have to be around my age (i.e., older than dirt) to remember Barry Goldwater, a right-wing Republican from Arizona who wrote a book with the above title and spectacularly lost to Lyndon Johnson in the presidential race of '64. I invoke his long-dead phrase because, without the irony, it could be UWE's subtitle. Conrad actively hated leftists and self-proclaimed \\"revolutionaries,\\" and this disgust shines through all of his best work, from the sniveling proto-unionist Donkin in \\"...Narcissus\\" through the bestial \\"generals\\" of \\"Nostromo\\" and, needless to say, the uber-hypocrite Kurtz. Razumov's moment of conservative illumination, in the snow on the night Haldin destroys his life, can be read as serious, humorous, or anywhere in between--but it is genuine. That fragment he pins to his wall (and which Councilor Mikulin finds so fascinating) sums up with Conradian depth and precision today's popular doctrine of personal responsibility. Peter Ivanovich, one of the slimiest characters on record (not to mention his \\"Egeria\\") could easily send major liberals over the wall. Naturally, all readers are free to interpret political novels as they see fit, but Conrad's biographers have documented his rightward tilt. UWE is wonderful proof that genius does not play politics. The novel's other virtues are too numerous to list here. I could read it every year for the rest of my life, and probably will."},{"Title":"Under Western Eyes","review":"An English teacher (the 'Western Eyes') tries to find the truth behind the autobiography of a Russian agent, for 'words are the greatest foes of reality', and 'speech has been given for the purpose of concealing our thought.'The Russian agent betrayed a friend-terrorist and meets afterwards his sister and mother. His friend combatted autocratic despotism, the destroyer of the spirit of progress and truth, of freedom, law and justice.This novel is Conrad's version of Dostoevsky's 'Crime and Punishment': 'A moral spectre is infinitely more effective than any visible apparition of death.'Conrad was a visionary: 'A violent revolution falls into the hands of narrow minded fanatics and tyrannical hypocrites. The scrupulous and the just, the noble, humane and devoted natures, the unselfish and the intelligent may begin a movement but it passes away from them.'His picture of the world of revolutionary conspirators is excellent: double agents, opportunists, naive idealists, hypocrites, rogues, agitators, fanatics and cynics. 'It did not matter what it was, vanity, despair, love, hate, greed, intelligent pride, a stupid conceit, it was all one to him as long as the man could be made to serve.'But this book has many flaws: melodramatic overreactions (attack on Ziemianitch, secret love of Razumov), high improbabilities (confession of Razumov, interventions of 'Western Eyes') or the ultimate verdict ('he was the victim of an outrage. He had confessed voluntarily.')Joseph Conrad was an ambitious writer, but this book has not the same high standard as his masterpieces 'Heart of Darkness' and 'Lord Jim'.A worth-while read."},{"Title":"Under Western Eyes","review":"I read only a few pages and did not find it all that interesting.

This novel does not ressemble any ohter of Conrad's as it has a strange feeling or atmosphere to it that can barely be grasped. I read it when I was young and I was deeply affected by the people he describes and the locations. A must for anyone interested or related to the Russian nation!"},{"Title":"Under Western Eyes","review":"I found Under Western Eyes to be Conrad's finest work and perhaps, along with Anna Karennina, the greatest of novels.

The depth of the characters and the moral power of the storyline make this a must read for all (not too difficult)."},{"Title":"Under Western Eyes","review":"\\"Autocracy knows no law,\\" is the essential message Conrad send us in this harrowing tale of a young Russian student, Razumov, who finds himself involved in a political assassination in pre-World War I Tsarist Russia.We know his involvement to be purely accidental without complicity, but he is unable to prove that and the authorities, though accepting his account, leave him under a cloud. Unable to free himself of suspicion, Razumov leaves Russia for western Europe.In Switzerland, Razumov finds himself involved with other Russians, revolutionary plotters intent on overthrowing the Tsar. The events surrounding our protagonist's time in Switzerland are woven in Conrad's usual masterful way. Razumov finds love with a sympatico woman, a fellow exile, but ultimately nothing comes of it.I would be tempted to label Razumov a sociopath, given his described thoughts about others he encounters. He is a loner described as having no family or close friends, and seems driven by ambitions unrelated to the involvement of anyone outside himself. Fellow students he knows are seen by him as no more than nodding acquaintances. It is true that Conrad never suggests Razumov suffers from some emotional incapacity, but the evidence is certainly there.With respect to Conrad's theme about the autocratic state, we have been told that the totalitarian state is worse than one that is merely a dictatorship. Both would appear to be lawless, qualifying under Conrad's definition as autocracies. Insofar as neither would recognize any limit on the power of those in power, the foregoing distinction becomes one possessed of no substance.Today's Russia appears to differ from the Tsarist one in that some law appears even as limit on the power of the national leaders.[...]Does that leave today's Russia the same as the Tsarist one? Probably not: some power-limiting law seems to exist in the current Russian state."},{"Title":"Under Western Eyes","review":"...of the 20th Century written in English by a Pole! Honestly, you could remove any and all of the prepositional qualifiers from that assertion, and I'd still be willing to defend it. Under Western Eyes is a superb novel in every way - in emotional impact, in intelligence, and in narrative art - and it is very specifically a Russian novel as well as a novel about Russia. Anecdotes suggest that Conrad wrote it in response to his reading of Dostoevsky; if so, he exceeded his model in dazzling narrative acrobatics and in intelligence.The central character, Razumov, is the most dislikable anti-hero in all fiction, so it's an amazing feat of empathy by which Conrad brings us to care about his fate. Conrad's genius as a narrator is his ability to place himself and the reader in a realm of detachment, so that every event and every character can be observed from several angles at once. The \\"unreliable narrator\\" is child's play for Conrad. I don't want to spoil any of the prismatic effect of Conrad's narrative structure by telling any more of the tale of Under Western Eyes, but I will mention that the title is not insignificant.The Russia portrayed in this novel is a land of cynicism and naivete intertwined - hyper-emotionalism and psychological repression in equal measure - omnicompetent surveillance and hopeless myopia - ruthless bureaucracy and utter disorganization - a land in short of oxymoronic self-destruction. This is NOT, however, the Russia of Communism! The novel was written in 1911! This is Russia as it existed under the Tsarist autocracy, and everything about it clamors for revolution. It's interesting to compare Conrad's portrayal of the old regime with the nostalgic and idealized version served up by Vladimir Nabokov in his memoir \\"Speak, Memory.\\" Nabokov wrote far more beautiful sentences, but Conrad saw deeper. The horror for us, post-Stalinist readers, in Conrad's depiction of the pre-revolutionary state-of-things is that we KNOW that change will not change much, that autocratic, arbitrary repression will be replaced by...more of the same.Conrad wrote two novels aground, away from the sea - this one and The Secret Agent. They are among his best. Some readers of today seem to find Conrad's style involuted and dry, and blame it on his status as a 'second-language' writer. To my mind, they are missing the point, the complex lensing of perspective through the minds of Conrad's narrative intermediaries. This is a book to be read slowly and observantly; the effort will be rewarded."},{"Title":"Under Western Eyes","review":"Conrad is a real star, I'm rather fond of him. Under Western Eyes is about living in a time of revolutionary urgency, individual fragility in a delicate system, and personal honor.To summarize; Razumov, the 'Hero' is a university student in Russia post 1905 but pre 1917 who keeps to himself and has no real family and no close friends. A fellow student and a revolutionary, Victor Haldin, assasinates a local oppressive Tsarist autocrat. He then takes a chance and takes momentary asylum with Razumov, asking him to help him get out of the city. Razumov is an evolutionary progressive, not a revolutionary. Not willing to risk association with a radical like Haldin and destroy his entire life, Razumov turns him in to the police, and Haldin is subsequently hung.The rest of the novel deals with Razumov's struggle with himself- he betrayed, and he has to live with a lie. Complicating things, he falls in love with Haldin's sister in exile. Raz can't bear it though, and eventually he does the right thing, but things get messy.Thats the general plot, but the real meat of the novel is in the characters and the ideas underlying the conversations between them. The idea of how you justify revolution, the chaos of revolution vs the order of gradual reform, the unwillingness and helplessness of the individual caught in it all. And there's a continual theme of the diference between East and West.Razumov reminds me a bit of Crime and Punishment's Raskolnikov- an isolated university student waxing the time away in a single apartment, brooding over Big Ideas and being slowly crushed by a powerful conscience. The stuff of modernity. Dostoyevsky was a little bit better, so thats why Under Western Eyes only gets 4 stars."},{"Title":"Under Western Eyes","review":"Joseph Conrad is one of the most wonderful writers for me (although there are a couple of his novels that I am yet to come to grips with). Often novels give me cause to reflect on my life and my place in the universe, but this one is so personal to me that I wonder if my recommendation can be meaningful to others. You see, the narrator of Under Western Eyes is an English speaking man, an older man, an observer, who becomes a possessor of secret knowledge which reflects on the things he sees taking place around him - of the one holding the secret, of the ones ignorant of it. But the second most important character is a young woman, Natalie Haldin, living away from Russia with her mother (in Geneva). And by chance I have a work-based friendship with a colleague who happens to be a Russian woman living away from Russia (in Australia). The last chapter telling of the final meeting between Natalie and the narrator - for quite personal reasons (but it is so well written) was an emotional torment for me, my final meeting has yet to occur - I hope!The most important character in the novel (I discount the narrator, as I would myself, although he is of great importance - you may think the greatest) is a young student, Razumov, who betrays Natalie's brother and then is imposed on by the powers to spy on Russian dissidents in Geneva. There he meets Natalie and others who are totally unaware of his role in Natalie's brother's betrayal and subsequent execution. But it is known that he was a fellow student of Natalie's brother so they are drawn to him. Would Natalie and Razumov become romantically allied? Only if the secret is kept?I will not answer these questions. But I will say that Razumov, weak throughout the novel with the same sort of uncertainties that challenge me, turns out to be the most courageous of characters and, in fact, is afforded one tiny morsel of reward.Conrad is a great user of words although he does say very early on that words are the great foes of reality (page 1). The title of this review is a quote. Here are two more):The man who says he has no illusions has at least that one (page 188)There is always something to weigh down the spiritual side in all of us (page 122)While the novel may not have the same personal impact for you as it did for me, it is very engaging and rewarding. Typically for Conrad though, the writing is very dense, and for me at least, needed lots of time and reflection."},{"Title":"Under Western Eyes","review":"It was a relief to find Conrad's Under Western Eyes somewhat less surreal and more concise; yet the complexity and subtlety prove to be no less daunting as the readers are lured into the very same maze in which the main character Razumov finds himself trapped in.As a time when &quot;men were sacrificing their lives for ideas&quot;, 1911 was not meant for moderates who wished to stay neutral between anarchy and hierachy. Razumov, a steadfast philosphy student in St. Petersburg is involuntarily enmeshed in a radical's political intrigue, and to put it in plain &quot;matter-of-fact&quot; tone, he betrays the anarchist. But the brilliancy of Conrad is the way he makes this statement grow by exploring the soft tissue of human interaction in between the hard mechanism of change. Razumov has no choice as the system's teaching induces him to turn in the &quot;criminal&quot; who is dismantling order in society. After the authorities dispatch Razumov to Geneva with a mission, he willingly accepts without realizing he is actually losing his individuality instead of regaining it as he once supposed. To spy on the radical's sister and mother does not lie coherent with his righteous character, yet Razumov's rigid faith in czarist bureacracy and inability to choose for himself lead to more lies. It is still truth however, that redeemds Razumov despite fate's little surprises to keep his betrayal in the shadow. And not unlike fellow St. Petersburg student Raskolnikov from Crime and Punishment, Razumov finds salvation in the betrayed radical's sister's deep love for him. Also like Raskolnikov, Razumov is at last reconciled to his existence through physical suffering.Conrad was by no means denouncing the blossom of revolution, he grazed at the thorns and showed us the many shades of reformation. No idealism remains pure in the real world; in this case, Haldin's kind of pursuit fuses with political murder as his compatriots in Geneva embrace a bureaucratic order. All this is coolly observed by Conrad's Western eyes-an outsider to the struggle and the inner turmoil of Russia to find a balance amongst the blinding clashes of change."},{"Title":"Under Western Eyes","review":"Joseph Conrad had famously hard feelings for the Russians, occupiers of his Polish homeland. In \\"Under Western Eyes\\" (1911), Conrad employs tough love in depicting the Russian character, hopelessly divided between reckless radicalism and reactionary reasonlessness, between devotion and despair.Razumov is a college student in St. Petersberg content to labor under the Czarist system, under which he hopes to advance through study. Fate intervenes in the form of a fellow student, Victor Haldin, fresh from blowing up a secret police chief, who thinks Razumov is the man to aid his escape. Razumov is horrified instead, not at the murderous nature of the act but what it could mean to Razumov's future. Will he turn Haldin in, or try and get him out of the city?The introduction of my Penguin edition notes a popular criticism of \\"Under Western Eyes\\" is that its characters \\"exist only for the sake of the ideas.\\" That's a problem of much of Conrad's fiction, and after the very taut and thrilling first part is over, we are treated to a number of garden-path colloquies in Geneva that slow things down considerably. But the ideas Conrad deals with, about Russia's political and philosophical underpinnings, are often fascinating and certainly to the point, especially considering the novel was written as the real Russia stood ready to implode from the strife depicted here.Conrad tended to view revolutionaries with cynical remove, especially when they employed violence as a means to an end, yet many of the revolutionaries we meet here are a more sympathetic lot than the nihilistic goons of \\"The Secret Agent.\\" \\"You have either to rot or to burn,\\" explains Sophia Antonovna, a genuinely good character who supports the revolution. She's not one to wither quietly while there's injustice to be fought.Razumov might disagree. It's not that he believes in the system, just the futility of fighting it. \\"The exceptional could not prevail against the material contacts which make one day resemble another,\\" he tells himself. \\"Tomorrow would be like yesterday.\\" But as he is pushed into the world of revolution despite himself, he finds himself doubting more and more the shaky pillars of his prior existence.It's not clear to me which point-of-view Conrad held; likely he saw the merits of every ideology depicted here, a relativism that made him doubtful of any one solution. Certainly \\"Under Western Eyes\\" is about as even-handed a book about revolutionary struggle as you might care to read, compelling, deep, and quotable from first page to last. One wishes that Conrad could have sustained the dramatic force of the Part First in the latter three-fourths of the novel, but what you get is one of Conrad's most important books.Those thinking novels about Russians are reflexively depressing and opaque are not going to have their minds changed here, but they will enjoy the chance at seeing one of the world's most complicated nations through the prism of one of literature's most discerning, eloquent minds."},{"Title":"Under Western Eyes","review":"In ways almost all students, and certainly their teachers also, are hard-pressed to explain, one particular work of an author becomes the one \\"assigned,\\" and the others are dismissed, usually unread, as \\"minor,\\" or, at least not necessary to have read in order to say that one has \\"done\\" this author. For example, for Thomas Wolfe, it isLook Homeward, Angeland for Gustave Flaubert, it isMadame Bovary. For Joseph Conrad, it isHeart of Darkness, and it still rankles me that it was adopted as a metaphor for the Vietnam War inApocalypse Now. The better intentioned readers will often say... someday... I'll read another work by that author. And I'm pleased to say that that someday has finally arrived, and I read my second work by Joseph Conrad, one that seemed better and more insightful that the one normally \\"assigned.\\"Conrad was born a Pole, lived for a period in exile in Russia proper, with his parents, and was orphaned at the age of 11. He commenced to \\"seek his fortune\\" in the merchant marines, at the age of 16. Nautical themes are the subject of several of his works. English is his THIRD language, and it is truly humbling to recall that while reading his exquisitely crafted prose, like beautifully polished fine grain wood.\\"Under Western Eyes\\" opens in pre-revolutionary Russia, in the first decade of the 20th Century. The majority of the novel however transpires in Geneva, in the milieu of Russian revolutionaries and poseurs. The narrator, sometimes direct, at other times indirect, is an older English teacher of languages, who is the Western eyes of the title, and believes himself an impartial observer, an \\"inertial reference frame\\" if you will, of the machinations and power struggles of the revolutionaries, primarily, but also of the Russian establishment figures as well. The action commences when a student revolutionary, Victor Haldin, assassinates Mr. de P--, the President of the notorious Repressive Commission. Haldin then turns to a fellow student he does not know well, Razumov, to assist him in his escape. Haldin is betrayed to the quintessential establishment figure, Counsillor Mikulin. However, it appears that despite Razumov's actions, he is \\"tainted,\\" and must seek exile himself in Geneva, where, inter alia, he develops a relationship with Haldin's sister and mother. It is a deeply psychological novel, and much of the action is in the drawing rooms of Geneva, where the revolutionaries pose, and establish pecking orders. Of the several sub-plots and minor characters of interest is Peter Ivanovitch, who supposedly made a spectacular escape from the Far East of Czarist Russia, with the help of a woman, and thence became an ardent \\"feminist,\\" though he sure manages to abuse his housekeeper / stenographer. Another theme in the novel is similar toThe Red Badge of CourageAfter the \\"battle,\\" with Haldin's demise, who really knows what happened, and is it possible for the coward and villain to portray himself as the hero?Conrad was generally considered to be politically conservative, with a strong distain for revolutionary elements, and certainly in this novel many do not come off well. However, Conrad also paints an exceedingly bleak picture of living conditions, and the repressive nature of Russian society, certainly sufficient to motivate revolutionaries. In his notes, as an afterword, Conrad says: \\"The obligation of absolute fairness was imposed on me historically and hereditarily, by the peculiar experience of race and family, in addition to my primary conviction that truth alone is the justification of any fiction...I have never been called before to a greater effort of detachment: detachment from all passions, prejudices and even from personal memories.\\"I firmly believe that Conrad succeed in his stated objective above. The novel is also an excellent \\"spy novel\\" filled with intrigue and duplicity that inspired Graham Greene, W. Somerset Maugham and John Le Carr&eacute;. Prince Peter Kropotkin famously said that the worse things are, the better, since reform is the enemy of revolution. Counsillor Milulin understood this dictum well, and is why he fought the revolutionaries, so that his reformist agenda could succeed.It was a bitter cold February day in Santa Fe, NM when my hiking friend and I sought refuge in an excellent second-hand bookstore. In continued attempts to broaden my literary horizons, Mike bought me this excellent work, with a historical picture of the Pont du Mont Blanc in Geneva on the cover.

Moving further from the symbolic sea stories of his early career, it extends the remarkable diversity that Nostromo and The Secret Agent introduced. It is in many ways an extension of the latter but also mixes in elements of classic Russian fiction and other factors to make a truly great work. The novel is many things: a psychological portrait, a sociohistorical look at political unrest, a philosophical take on revolutions, a complex depiction of the Russian character, a dramatization of the conflict between politics/morality and idealism/practicality, a nuanced view of Russia filtered through a Western lens - and by extension a contrast between Eastern and Western sensibilities -, and more. It is essential for fans, and those not fond of more representative Conrad may be pleasantly surprised, especially those interested in Russian, historical, or political fiction.As Conrad's 1920 Preface notes, this 1911 work became in many ways a historical novel in only a few years. It depicts Czarist Russia's death throes, unflinchingly showing its many horrors and atrocities. Conrad always had great sympathy for the poor and downtrodden, and this may be the clearest example; the book's portrayal of poverty and other forms of want is truly eye-opening. That such suffering existed less than a century ago in an ostensibly modern country is enough to breed misanthropy in the staunchest optimist. Conrad leaves no doubt that it was ripe for reform - nay, that drastic change was practically inevitable. Revolution of course came in only six years, instantly changing the book's significance. The writing is very visceral, leaving no doubt that the era was anything but pretty; a focus on various forms of dreariness makes clear that it was in many ways truly wretched. It is particularly valuable as an antidote to those who for decades championed - and still champion - Czarist Russia as a haven of relative tranquility and liberty in the wake of the Soviet Union's admitted oppression.However, this is not a liberal work crying for revolution. Conrad was far too deeply conservative to ever write or even think such a thing - not in today's dumbed-down political catchphrase sense but in a truly pessimistic way. He had little hope for melioration in politics or anything else, tragically convinced that human life will always be pained and striving with the poor and downtrodden forever at succeeding tyrannies' mercy. I have never seen another work with such little faith in revolution or political change of any sort; Conrad's Preface concludes by mocking \\"the strange conviction that a fundamental change of hearts must follow the downfall of any given human institutions,\\" noting, \\"These people are unable to see that all they can effect is merely a change of names.\\" If this sounds dry, however astute, worry not; the dramatization is very engaging and intriguing, making the point clear without failing to entertain and managing to avoid heavy-handedness.Indeed, like nearly all Conrad, the novel can be enjoyed on a very basic level. Like The Secret, it deals heavily in international political intrigue complete with spies, assassinations, etc. It certainly has little resemblance to the superficial spy stories so sadly ubiquitous in recent decades but has more excitement and adventure than most century-old novels. Perhaps more integrally, it is told in an essentially straight-forward, though not linear, way, especially compared to most Conrad; the feeling of being lost and disoriented that turns off so many casuals to much of his work is only slightly present and used with great skill for suspense and dramatic irony. Under is thus one of his most accessible major works and a good place for neophytes to start or for the unconvinced to try again.Many other factors give wide appeal. For instance, Russian fiction's many fans would be very hard-pressed to find a more \\"Russian\\" work by a non-Russian. The novel is often called Conrad's response to Fyodor Dostoevsky, whom he apparently loathed, particularly in regard to Crime and Punishment. There are indeed many similarities between the latter's Raskolnikov and Under's Razumov; Crime fans and Dostoevsky scholars can have a proverbial field day analyzing this and other aspects. More fundamentally, much of the novel is set in Russia and is thoroughly inundated with all things Russian. We not only get a good idea of how early twentieth century Russia looked but more than a glimpse of its culture - everything from manners to speech to politics. Also, in the grand tradition of Russian greats like Dostoevsky and Leo Tolstoy, Conrad includes a wealth of thought-provoking material - without their famous bulk, doubtless to the great relief of many. The novel is both broadly and specifically philosophical, dramatizing a wide variety of abstract and practical issues in a way that forces us to confront the weighty subjects that many think necessary to great literature. The depiction of feminism, implicitly championed in other Conrad, is especially dubious and thus fascinating. Also like Dostoevsky and Tolstoy, and unlike other Conrad, much of this is done via dialogue - another striking instance of Conrad's diversity.Even more fundamentally, Under is a profoundly penetrating study of the Russian character - not only as it then was but in its essence. This is in many ways what the Russian greats were really getting at, and that Conrad was able to approach their greatness is a true testament to his artistry. Rarely has a foreigner had such a clear vision of another country or its people. The thoughts, emotions, and sensibilities at the heart of Russia and its people are given with great verisimilitude and sensitivity. This alone would make the novel worthwhile, especially to the many interested in the subject. Like all Conrad novels to this point, Under was a European commercial failure, but the Preface notes with great satisfaction that it did very well in Russia, which says much about its believability and empathy.The most remarkable thing about the book in this and other regards is complete lack of didacticism. Conrad shows the characters and what they stand for on their own terms sans comment, never even coming close to preachiness or any other authorial intrusion. He simply dramatizes sociopolitical concerns and lets us decide, remaining admirably neutral. This is extremely rare in any sociopolitical work, and the story is better for it; those turned off by didacticism have nothing to fear. However, it is all the more remarkable in that Conrad had every reason to lambaste Russia; a Pole born in the Ukraine, his family suffered under Russian imperialism, crushing his parents and forcing him to leave his native land at seventeen never to return. As one might expect, the struggle to remain dispassionate was agonizing; he had a nervous breakdown lasting several weeks during which, in his wife's words, he lived the scenes and spoke to the characters, apparently in Polish. That none of this shows is truly incredible - an amazing feat of artistry rarely seen or even attempted.Separate from, and perhaps over and above, all this is the deft characterization that will be one of the main features for many. This is not one of Conrad's acknowledged strengths, but Under proves him on par with the best in this important area. There is a notably wide variety of characters, everyone from aristocrats and generals to intellectuals and revolutionists to the poorest of the poor, and all are drawn realistically and compellingly. The most important is of course Razumov, who forms one of Conrad's - and thus one of literature's - most intriguing character studies. He is in some ways the era's representative young Russian; well-educated and intelligent with a social status neither high nor low, he is clear-eyed enough to see the problems around him, but inherited loyalty and self-interest check his liberal impulses. This again recalls characters in the Russian greats' work, as do his more universal qualities. He is in many ways thoroughly dislikable, even despicable - vain, selfish, and indecisive with occasional malice. However, in a true sign of his artistic skill, Conrad somehow manages to make us care about him, even if he is not quite sympathetic. He may be more sinned against than sinning, but more to the point, he is like many intelligent youths throughout history - full of potential but unsure what to do and thus pitiably easy prey. His lack of resolve and true convictions may offend strict moralists, but he is distinctly human; his faults if anything make him more relatable. Some have criticized Conrad for not condemning him, but this misses the point - an essentially ordinary person, he could be almost anyone. Only the very few who have been in comparable situations can say how they would act in his place. Even more essentially, though, Razumov symbolizes many conflicts that numerous youths in politically turbulent eras have experienced: personal vs. public morality, idealism vs. practicality, politics vs. morality, patriotism vs. conscience, etc. His confessions also bring up many important debatable issues. Whatever we think of them generally, the acts have a certain courage that even the revolutionaries cannot deny. These and other aspects make Razumov one of Conrad's most fully realized and important characters.As all this suggests, different as the book is from most Conrad, it carries on his tragic vision. A dark fatalistic streak is particularly notable; Razumov shows how people can be pulled into extremely precarious situations against their will, and they seem unable to escape. Conrad shows little hope of meliorism here or in the larger political sense. Like The Secret, despite being published only shortly into the twentieth century, Under in many ways anticipated much of its darkness. It depicts humanity on despair's verge with little or no reason for optimism; the time and place may be distinct, but these and other factors are sadly universal.Great as the novel is generally, a few minor problems ensure it is below Conrad's best. The primary one is the narrator and the unusual narrative style to which he leads. Many will like this last because of aforementioned strengths and because it is yet another Conrad innovation, but the character himself is somewhat awkward. Conrad's Preface makes a good case for why he had to exist, and he may well be right, but Conrad himself often seems unsure how to use him. His presence is supposed to lend the verisimilitude that can only come from direct observation, but the narrative plan - having him write in the first-person but mostly from Razumov's perspective because he has read his diary - is quite a stretch. Conrad does an ingenious job of eventually explaining how he knows all he tells, but the apparent initial impossibility can be distracting, and his intrusions are particularly so. The author also attempts to explain the latter - in fact quite cleverly -, but the whole premise often seems contrived. Excerpts from Razumov's journal mixed with the narrator's recollections may have worked better. However, the narrator frequently seems out of place even when present, having little or nothing to do with the scene; it is almost as if Conrad forgot he was there or was simply unable to come up with a reason despite thinking him necessary. The ending - not the climax - is also somewhat weak, especially compared to Conrad's usual high standard, coming somewhat arbitrarily and failing to satisfy.Thankfully, though, these are minor limitations and detract little from what is an excellent novel overall. Indeed, it is one of Conrad's most widely appealing works. It comes highly recommended for nearly everyone who likes any type of classic literature."},{"Title":"Under Western Eyes","review":"If you are familiar enough with Conrad's writing you will know he has a few favorite words - like \\"inscrutable\\" and \\"destiny\\". They reflect I believe Conrad's literary outlook. He likes to take characters, give them a haunted past with some shameful secret, emphasize a fatal weakness, introduce some culminating stimulae, and watch the tragic unfold. I think he could have written a brilliant biography of Richard Nixon. But to the point...\\"Under Western Eyes\\" is a quintessentially Conradian book. But unlike many of his other novels - Lord Jim, Nostromo, Victory - \\"Under Western Eyes\\" treats of period politics (namely the revolutionary movement on the rise in Europe) as he weaves his tale of betrayal and tragedy. There are no heroes in this book (save perhaps one) but only a motley collection of victims, fools, and eccentrics. There is not much action, despite its subject matter. I don't want to give away too much. The story unfolds in Moscow and Geneva, not around political machinations but around the tragedy of the central character, a young Russian thrown into the revolutionary movement entirely against his will. In this sense, I think it would be a good companion reading to Henry James' \\"Princess Cassamassima\\", which also revolves around a certain misunderstanding and like \\"Under Western Eyes\\" unfolds its story at the crossroads of the personal and political. The saga of the young man's anger, self-loathing, and attempts to extricate himself from his \\"situation\\" form one salient plot of \\"Under Western Eyes.\\" The ultimate solution to his unsought conundrum also serves to redeem him in his own eyes, if not those of others.\\"Under Western Eyes\\" is also an attempt by Conrad to explore the peculiarities of the \\"Russian character\\". This is another line of development in the work. I put this in partentheses because such notions of racial character are naturally not so well received now as in Conrad's day. Whether you agree or not, Conrad (who himself was Polish) offers some interesting personal insights into the nature of the \\"inscrutable\\" Russian soul - its ability to persevere, its mysticism, its ultimate radicalism. Such issues were particular relevent to the time the book was written (1908), as Russia was then already breaking out in revolutionary violence. The story's narrator - a retired English bachelor - are the \\"Western eyes\\" under which Russia is regarded.I might label \\"Under Western Eyes\\" a comic-tragedy, in that the primary factor behind the story's tragic chain of events is a misunderstanding. It is ultimately for the book's central character a journey of personal redemption. Within the context of this, however, Conrad details some of his views on Russia, its people, and the nature of the revolutionary movement. I did not find it as engaging as some of Conrad's other works but anyone interested in the Russian revolutionary movement, or radical politics of the period in general, or with a bent for stories of betrayal, tragedy, and love should take a look."},{"Title":"Under Western Eyes","review":"Having just finished reading Under Western Eyes, I would like to say that I found it to be one of Conrad's best books. It is beautifully written, not too difficult to read (unlike some of his other works) and raises thought-provoking ideas about revolution and personal integrity. Conrad is one of the greatest English language writers ever and this book is very much worth reading."},{"Title":"Under Western Eyes","review":"Joseph Conrad's Under Western Eyes should be of interest to those with a particular interest in Russia, especially the period of the late 19th century. Others may find the book boring, given that it is largely devoted to dialogue rather than action and trite in that the main conflict is the inner struggle of a man with his conscience. The title refers to the fact that the story is told by an English professor of literature who comes across a diary written by the book's protagonist. The reason Conrad gives for this manner of telling the story is that, in his view, Western readers cannot comprehend the circumstances of life in imperial Russia and can only view them through the eyes of a fellow Westerner. On pages 106 and 107 he has the professor say, \\"for this is a Russian story for Western ears (sic), which, as I have already observed, are not attuned to certain tones of cynicism and cruelty, of moral negation, and even of moral distress already silenced at our end of Europe.\\" I find this statement to be incredibly ethnocentric, and as events later proved, entirely wrong. He adds that Western European countries have already had their revolutions and thus are no longer able to fully understand czarist Russia. We can certainly argue with this viewpoint and in my view this literary device does more to get in the way of the story than to help explain it.In any case, the book begins with the professor saying that he has come across a manuscript written by a Russian student at St. Petersburg University, Kirylo Sidorovitch Razumov. Razumov is impoverished and without family and sees his only chance for success in life as coming from academic success. Accordingly he largely avoids the other students and is intent on his studies. As he is in his room one evening another student, Victor Haldin, comes to see him proclaiming that he has just assassinated a prominent political figure and asks Razumov to help him to escape. Razumov, having no sympathy for Haldin's cause, is reluctant to get involved but finally agrees to go to the lodgings of a sledge driver who has agreed to drive Haldin away to safety. But when he finds the man he is drunk and Razumov cannot arouse him. After beating him in disgust he begins to walk back to his room, pondering what to do next. Fearful that if Haldin stays with him too long he will be implicated as well, Razumov decides to give him up to the authorities. Haldin is then captured and executed.Razumov is still under suspicion and finally receives a summons to go to the office of Councillor Milukin, who, as it turns out, is the head of the bureau in charge of revolutionary investigations. After what appears to Razamov to be a kind of cat-and-mouse game he is given permission to leave. As he puts his hand on the doorknob Milukin asks him where is going to go.At this point part one of the book ends and the scene shifts to Geneva in part two. Here we meet the mother and sister of Haldin. They see him as the hope for their future lives and are devastated when they learn of Haldin's death. The mother goes into a state of shock and stays in her room staring out the window, while the daughter, Nathalie, an idealistic, but nave, young woman, tries to make the best of the situation. Other revolutionaries appear on the scene most notably Peter Ivanovitch, the leader of the group, Madame de S___, whose money is apparently financing their operations and Sophia Antonova, a long time revolutionary.The Haldin women receive a letter stating that a \\"friend\\" of Haldin is coming to Geneva and Nathalie begins to believe that this person will help them. The friend, of course, is Razumov, who has apparently reached an agreement with the government agents to spy on the revolutionaries. Razumov arrives and is accepted as a fellow revolutionary and friend of Haldin. He undergoes a difficult inner struggle trying to maintain this pretense, particularly in the light of the goodness and trust Nathalie shows him. The story then progresses as a struggle by Razumov with his conscience, whether to report on the revolutionaries or to reveal the truth about himself.The book bears some resemblance to Crime and Punishment with its psychological overtones and dialogues about good and evil, right and wrong. Much of parts two and three are devoted to conversations and it is only in the last part that there is dramatic action. I rate it as three stars because it is not as good as the best of Conrad (Lord Jim), nor is it on a level with the really good fiction of Russian writers. I could rate it at 3 and a half or even 4 as well. It can be interesting reading and thought provoking and does end in dramatic fashion."},{"Title":"Every Child Can Read (Grades K-6)","review":"This book is extremely helpful in working IN THE CLASSROOM with children who are having difficulties.

She waits years and he never comes, so eventually she goes to Oregan to live with her sister Loretta and Hunter.At the start of Comanche Heart, it has been 12 years after Swift left Amy. He returns to her farm only to be told she died. Three years later, he makes his way to Oregon to find Hunter and Loretta after years of being a gun slinger and riding with the Comancheros. He is amazed to find his Amy alive and well, living as a school teacher near her sister. Amy has never forgotten her childhood love but is terrified of the hard looking Comanchero Swift had become.Swift still loves Amy and is determined to have a life with her now that he has found her again. Amy is scared of losing the freedom she has at Wolf's Landing if she honors her promise to marry Swift. While she still loves him, she went through a lot in her life that has left her terrified of intimacy and all but broke her spirit. However, Swift is one determined man who is patient and willing to do whatever it takes to win Amy's trust.I loved Swift and Amy's story! Amy went through so much in her life that she deserved to find happiness with her longtime love.

It really keeps your interest. However, after reading the first book in the series, this one did have some points that were a bit of a let-down. The prequel, \\"Comanche Moon\\", gave us the introduction to the 4 main characters of \\"Comanche Heart\\". They are Hunter (hero of CM), Loretta (Heroine of CM), Swift Antelope (hero of CH, he is Hunter's Comanche \\"cousin\\" in CM), and Amy (heroine of CH, she is Loretta's true cousin). Amy was a courageous 12- year- old who survived unmentionable horrors. By the end of CM, it was young Swift Antelope who had brought her out of the fear and devastation. He was Amy's best friend. He had helped lift her back into the sunlight. Her spunk and courage had been returned to her. Before she was forced to return to her white family, Swift Antelope and Amy made a betrothal promise in front of his entire tribe. I was really looking forward to their story. Unfortunately, Amy's character is totally changed in CH. Amy's change is understandable, because she has again been terribly abused since she had to leave Swift Antelope. However, it did not create the story I had been looking forward to reading. I was expecting adventure and some happy times for the couple. Instead, for the first 250 pages or so, Amy does everything she can to hurt Swift and drive him away. It went on too long for me. When they finally did find happiness together, it was very brief. The book is packed with emotion, but not much of it is joyful. The only laughs I found came from the characters remembering the \\"old times\\" from the CM story period. I truly missed the charming and hope-inspiring young couple that Swift and Amy were before.Swift and Amy pledged themselves to one another in a Comanche village as teens, but she was soon forced to return to her white family. Swift promised to come for her. Because the Comanche were at war with the government, Swift had to wait many years to go and claim Amy. When he finally arrived at her family's farm, Amy's step- father tells Swift that she died and is buried in the backyard. With his heart torn apart at the loss of his Amy, Swift leaves the broken Comanche world and joins with a band of Comancheros. He lives for the next few years on the edge of the law.After saving a young woman from being raped by his companions, Swift knows he must leave the Comancheros or face retaliation. He decides to go and start a new life with his Comanche cousin, Hunter. Hunter has started a new town in Oregon. His mountainous land is filled with unclaimed gold. When he arrives in Hunter's gold- mining town, Swift is shocked and overjoyed to find his true love alive and well. Amy, however, has changed. She wants nothing to do with men. She especially wants Swift to stay away. Swift is determined to see their betrothal through. He is in for the greatest fight of his life. He must learn what has caused Amy's change of heart, then convince her to give him another chance.*Spoilers here:Another problem I had with this book was the fact that the powerful character of Hunter was very watered down. In CM, he slaughtered a whole band of Comancheros for raping 12- year- old Amy. In CH, a few guys tried to gang- rape Hunter's own daughter and he hardly blinked about it. Swift fought off her attackers, but even he ended up letting them just walk away with a warning... even as they continued to threaten that they would be back. No one reported it to the sheriff (who was a fair man and would have arrested the thugs). What happened to the proud and strong Comanche spirit? It was pretty much \\"Oh well. She'll be fine.\\" The nonchalance really bothered me.The first book of the series is much better. I recommend it:Comanche MoonIf you want some excellent Native American romance, try these titles:Cheyenne Song (Zebra Historical Romance)Feather in the Wind (Leisure Historical Romance)Under a Prairie Moon (Leisure historical romance)"},{"Title":"Comanche Heart","review":"Amy is the stubborn heroine of this Western romance. She once suffered a terrible situation of abuse, a story told in it's prequel Comanche Moon. She was raped be two dozen men as a child which is obviously pretty extreme. However, she healed with the help of her loved ones and her friend Swift Antelope, a Comanche warrior she pledged her heart to.Swift leaves home to assist his tribe and promises Amy to return and marry her. When he does, Amy's abusive stepfather lies to Swift and tells him that Amy is dead. Heartbroken, Swift becomes a bit of a renegade and forms a name for himself as a gunslinger. After a few years, he decides to go visit his family and is shocked to discover that Amy is alive and well, living close to his family and teaching at the local school. He wastes no time in cementing his love for Amy.This promising beginning takes a sharp decline when Amy stubbornly refuses Swift. I didn't understand how she could lose her trust and love in Swift so drastically. I was frustrated with her. After she'd come so far with Swift, to just turn her back on him. He's nothing but loving and sweet and romantic and supportive and she's awful to him. I didn't believe her excuse - that she thought he'd become a bad man. It's so clearly obvious that he's not.The premise is so extreme also, it's hard to understand where Amy is coming from.Just a decent Western romance."},{"Title":"Comanche Heart","review":"One of the most beautiful love stories I've ever read that easily made a place for itself on my keeper shelf. I absolutely loved Swift and Amy. Their story is one of those rare ones that touches you deeply. It ws so touching to see how Swift nurtured her trust in him and over and over proved how much he loved her, both in words and action. Who could ask for anthing more. What a dream! I hated when their story ended and found myself going over passages just because I hated to say goodbye to them. I soon realized however I'll never say goodbye because I know I'll pull it back out over the years and once again be taken away by two of my most favorite characters ever. If I could give this book more than 5 stars I would."},{"Title":"Comanche Heart","review":"Don't get me wrong. This was a good book and I would tell anyone to read it. I just had a few problems with it. In more than half of this book all Swift did was beg Amy to be with him. I have never read a book where all the hero did was beg and beg. I just got tired of Amy after a while. I loved Amy in Comanche Moon. She was a little spitfire. In this book she was just so withdrawn. I know that in CM she was just a kid but I was really looking forward to seeing just a little of that sassiness and I didn't. But, then again I guess what Amy went through in her life can excuse her for becoming the person that she did.Another problem I had was when Indigo was almost raped. Hunter did nothing and just didn't react the way I thought he would. In CM he scalped Santos and killed all the other Comancheros for what they did to Amy and he didn't even know her. Granted, Indigo wasn't raped but she was his daughter. I just thought he would've reacted a bit differently.Like I said, the book was good and I do recommend it. It wasn't as good as CM though. I will read Comanche Magic and Indigo because I am curious as to what stories are developed for these additional characters."},{"Title":"Comanche Heart","review":"Comanche Moon is one of the greatest romance novels ever written....period. It was because of this that I hesitated reading it's sequel Comanche Heart. I was afraid that it would, at worst, taint Comanche Moon and, at best, not live up to it's predecessor. Unfortunately for me...both fears were realized.Swift Antelope was such a compelling and attractive character in Moon, but honestly, I did not care for him in this book. His gunslinging ways, the crimes he committed, the life he chose just made me disappointed with the man he had become. I also felt that I never really got to UNDERSTAND Swift which may have helped me relate or at least sympathize with him. Neither of those things happened. Amy was also a disappointment to me. If you've read Moon, you know about Amy's difficult past and the abuses she's survived. Swift Antelope played a SIGNIFICANT and positive role in her life and it bothered me how long it took Amy to feel anything but fear when she was around him. I wanted to shout into the book \\"This is Swift...the one who loves you and supposedly taught you how to love...SNAP OUT OF IT!\\"Not a great book. I am trying to forget portions of this book. Hunter and Loretta are also in this book and I am trying to forget how Hunter reacts when his daughter is attacked. The Hunter I know is a strong and mighty warrior....not timid and weak... I need to forget this one and move on!"},{"Title":"Comanche Heart","review":"I thought that Comanche Heart was a good follow-up to Comanche Moon. I say \\"good\\" because I didn't think it was quite as entertaining as it's predecessor. I did, however, really enjoy the love story between Swift and Amy. It's just that at some points in the book, I felt that the author almost copied some of the scenes from \\"Moon\\" and only sweeked them a little for the latter book. I still feel it was a very worthwhile read and can't wait for the next book in the series to become available on Kindle."},{"Title":"Comanche Heart","review":"This book was sooo beautifully written! I honestly had no idea it was in a series because the book stands alone. I don't want to give the whole plot away but so much suspense builds up to the moment when Swift and Amy finally get together. I will tell you that you will not regret reading this!"},{"Title":"Comanche Heart","review":"I could asked for nothing more this sellter send their book on time. For a used book it's in really good shape. Bravo."},{"Title":"Comanche Heart","review":"This is the follow up to Comanche Moon. the author is a wonderful story teller and you can almost feel some of the descriptions."},{"Title":"Comanche Heart","review":"The premise of this book is that at the age of 12 Amy was gang raped repeatedly by over 20 men. Given that there is no way that she would have overcome the mental damage as easily as this author portrayed. I doubt she would have ever recovered from such an experience. This novel is totally unrealistic. Buy something else."},{"Title":"Comanche Heart","review":"This was definitely my favorite book of the Comanche series. I absolutely love Swift. He is, in my opinion, the best hero of any romance novel I have read. This story picks up 15 years after Comanche Moon ended. Loretta and Hunter are in this novel as well. I loved that this book gave closure to their story, and then sets up the scene for more stories in this series. Amy and Swift go through so much to be together, and the ending is dynamic. This book kept me at the edge of my seat, hoping that they would make it in the end. Swift is the most kind and loving character. He does everything in his power to prove himself to Amy. It is a must read. I would recommend it to anyone that loves to read. Unlike other romance novels, this isn't full of the cheesy and flowery language. It reads just like any other novel, with just a little bit of a romantic edge. It makes the whole thing seem so much more realistic and better in the end. I love that at the end of this story, I felt like I actually knew the character.Read it!!!!"},{"Title":"Comanche Heart","review":"It's been twelve years since Amy Masters survived a two-week captivity by a band of comancheros. During that time, the 12-year-old girl endured repeated gang rape and often wished herself dead. A Comanche boy named Swift Antelope helped her to find her way back to happiness, and she betrothed herself to him - a permanent commitment despite her young age - before his people. Swift Antelope promised to come for Amy and fulfill their betrothal, one day when he was through fighting with his tribe in their war against the U.S. government. In the meantime, he believed she would be safe at her stepfather's Texas farm.Amy is now a little Oregon town's schoolteacher. She came there to join her sister Loretta, and Loretta's half Comanche husband, Hunter, who is Swift Antelope's closest friend. Amy has lost the peace that she regained during her time among Swift's people. Something haunts her and gives her nightmares that send screams echoing across the small settlement. What else can it be except her memories of the comancheros? When Swift arrives in town, clad in a comanchero's garb and with two silver six-shooters at his belt, Amy's reaction makes that belief even more credible. Swift, who now calls himself Swift Lopez, frightens her half to death just by being in the same room. He says that he has come to claim her as his promised wife, and as far as Hunter and Loretta are concerned that is only right. In the patriarchal society of the 19th Century U.S. frontier, Hunter is Amy's only protector. So if he is on Swift's side, who else can she turn to? Must she surrender herself to this gun-slinging stranger, in whom she only dimly glimpses the boy she still loves?I'm glad I trusted Catherine Anderson enough to keep reading, because after the first third or so of this book I'd begun to wonder if it would ever break away from the tired (and to me, deeply offensive) formula of \\"strong man breaks down scared woman's resistance, and forces her to love him.\\" Anderson is the only romance novelist published by the genre's mainstream whose books I enjoy reading, and that's because she always turns that stereotype neatly onto its head. She did that here, too, and when the reversal came it worked beautifully. A terrific read!--Reviewed by Nina M. Osier, author of \\"Granite Island\\""},{"Title":"Comanche Heart","review":"I was so excited to read this book after reading the first in the series, Comanche Moon\\". I was praying it would not let me down and knew it would be hard pressed to compare to \\"Comanche Moon\\". Well I can honestly say it was every bit as good as the first. Great, gritty characters, full of life and substance. This book drew me in from the beginning and just got better with each chapter. I love a great book that supplies several elements of love, hate, danger, grit and passion and these books nail it all!Definitely the best series I have read in my 20 yrs of reading Old West and Native American Romance books! Thank you Catherine Anderson for going above and beyond with this fantastic series. Can't wait to get the last two."},{"Title":"Comanche Heart","review":"I hunted down and purchased COMANCHE HEART, because I am a die-hard Catherine Anderson fan. Usually this truly gifted author can do no wrong, but COMANCHE HEART and its plot just didn't ring true. Swift Antelope, the strong and noble Comanche warrior, promised Amy Masters he would come back for her. Swift did keep his promise, he did return, but fifteen years too late. Time had moved on and these childhood lovers had changed.Amy Masters is a survivor. As a child, she was brutally kidnapped and violently raped by savage men and yet she survived. Amy Masters is a victim. She was cruelly abused, mentally and physically, by her stepfather and yet she escaped. Yes, Amy Master is both a victim and a survivor, but Amy Masters is hardly normal. She quietly lives in her sheltered life, and hides behind safe daydreams, while she endures inhuman nightmares. She trusts no man, especially when her daydream has turned into a nightmare. Swift Antelope is back!Anderson again pulls out her ultimate male hero. Swift Antelope is understanding and compassionate; he is tough when required, and a sweetheart when needed. And when it comes to dealing with Amy Masters, being a sweetheart is very much needed. Upon his return, Amy Masters does not fall gratefully at his feet, nor is she glad to see him. Amy has learned to live a free safe life -- alone.But what brought them together in the first place is still there -- the deep-seated respect, the loyal friendship, the romantic spark. But before the lovers can go on, Amy has much to overcome. Now the reader questions the author's logical. Could Amy EVER get over her past? Could any woman EVER get over THAT past? Yes, Swift Antelope IS tender and gentle and yes he IS the man to fall in love with, but would that EVER be enough?Catherine Anderson uses a slow, excruciatingly pace to convince her reader that the healing can and does take place, but somewhere along the way, Anderson mission fails. Yes, the idea of reuniting lost lovers has great appeal and both Amy and Swift are very likeable characters, but the core of the story just doesn't sell.This is the second in Anderson's \`Comanche series', but regrettably this entry seems too illogical and too inconceivable to recommend. I truly want to believe in Amy's healing - that a handsome, kind man could rescue her from her haunting horrors, but somehow I can't! Grade: CReviewer for: www.romancedesigns.com"},{"Title":"Comanche Heart","review":"Catherin Anderson is undoubtedly one of best writers. I loveall of her books. This is one of three books - Commanche Moonand Indigo Blue. Thanks to AmazonI was able to read all three.Must Read."},{"Title":"Comanche Heart","review":"I almost didn't read this because of someone's review about Hunter not being as strong. I am glad I ignored that review! This story was beautiful! It had my giggling, frustrated, and falling in love with all of the characters!

Too bad there aren't more books in this series!"},{"Title":"Comanche Heart","review":"This story is the sequel to Comanche Moon and deals with the story of Amy and Swift. In Comanche Moon, Amy had been brutally attacked and raped at age 12 and was rescued by Hunter after Loretta came to him for help. A young Native American named Swift Antelope took the time to befriend Amy and eventually in a Comanche ceremony they committed to eachother.Swift then left to fight for is people and left Amy to grow up.This is where This story begins... After many years apart, Swift returned and thought Amy was dead. He went on to Hunter and Loretta's home in Oregon. It is in this small town that he finds that Amy is still alive. Amy is not too thrilled that Swift is back and worries that he will still hold her to a comittment that she made all those years ago. The attack that she lived through seems to never have left her and this story is about her personal struggles to move beyond what happened. Can she allow Swift back into her life to help heal her heart as he did so many years ago?At times I thought the book had a few slow parts but overall, I really liked it. If you have not read Comanche Moon, you won't understand this story as well. Be sure you read that first. This is a great sequel."},{"Title":"Comanche Heart","review":"I read the first book in one day and I couldn't wait to start the second. I have to admit I was a little disappointed. I understand that Amy was withdrawn because of everything that happened to her but I don't feel like it changed enough in the end. I also didn't find the romance in this book as compelling as Comanche Moon. I think that Swift went out of his way to show his love for Amy but, I don't think it was shown back to him enough. I feel like everything between them was a little forced and I don't really enjoy that in romance novels. I did love getting the update of all the characters though! All in all not a terrible read but not very note worthy either."},{"Title":"Comanche Heart","review":"Another great read by Catherine Anderson. Kept me interested from the first page to last page. I have never been disappointed with this author's story telling ability."},{"Title":"Comanche Heart","review":"Very good book..... The historical significance and detail are outstanding.Found myself skipping through the sex scenes as the \\"story\\" was super without that detail."},{"Title":"Comanche Heart","review":"This is a very nice love story. Amy Masters, the heroine, has suffered a lot in the past and she only wants a peaceful and secure life, just to be left alone. The hero, Swift Antelope L&oacute;pez, is a dangerous gun man half comanche half mexican (I haven't read the first book of the series so I am not very sure about this) who wants to start a new life. And when he discovers that she is alive, well, he wants that new life with her as his wife, as it was promised fifteen years ago. She has been through terrible experiences, although they are not described in detail. She doesn't want to risk her security and would like to be free of her promise.So both of them have to make the effort, to change a little bit to find a way of being happy together. The amorous scenes are tender, not very steamy. Sometimes, it looks as if Swift is not really aware of her terror. And he could have gone more slowly. He shouldn't impose his way of doing things. Sometimes such behaviour in relation to a person who has suffered a traumatic experience sounded a bit risky.The book is worth reading because of the characters, even some colourful minor characters. Although not very deeply studied, you can catch glimpses of the female condition, how you were not protected from abuse, or rape, or mistreatment. One of the most attractive traits in Swift is that he fights for the defenseless people, he tries to protect those who are weak, in his one way.The background, a frontier Western village, is very poorly described, so in this point there's nothing special or interesting."},{"Title":"Comanche Heart","review":"This was a great book. I actually enjoyed this book more than the first. My only complaint is that the issues being dealt with in book 2 were the same issues dealt with in book 1. There was a bit of a been there done that feel because of this."},{"Title":"Comanche Heart","review":"This is a really cool series. I have the other ones and can't wait to read the next one because they all go together. She is a very good writer. It doesn't get boring.

I have all her stuff."},{"Title":"Comanche Heart","review":"What I Loved: Swift's journey to becoming the man both him and Amy needed him to be. Amy's journey to overcoming her past to become the woman that Swift needed her to be. The fact that this was not simply one or the other having to overcome something made this story so rich and fulfilling to read!What I Liked: Seeing Hunter and Loretta again and meeting their children. I also really enjoyed a glimpse into town life set during that time and the adjustments everyone made to make a town work.Complaints: none for this one!Why I gave it a 4: I enjoyed every moment of this book. It was nice seeing old characters, meeting new ones, and the journey of Amy and Swift was very satisfying!Who I would recommend this too: Anyone who likes Historical Romances from the early 90's.

I gave both books 4 stars, mainly because they are extremely well-written, though I did find some repeat material in the sequel.What I liked about CH: The chemistry between Amy and Swift is good; I found them believable characters and could sympathize with their plight. I liked the continuing story of Hunter & Loretta and the introduction of their children, Indigo and Chase. I liked that it continued to speak to the historical Native Americans (the People) and its culture, though in a much limited manner than CM. And I liked that Anderson continues the themes of \\"hope\\" and \\"keeping your eyes on the horizon\\" in this sequel.What I disliked about CH: SPOILER ALERT: The author used (abused) the theme of rape in the story. We found this in CM when Loretta was almost raped and Amy was, indeed, gang raped. Now in CH we discover that Amy has been raped again by her stepfather and almost raped again while in her sanctuary of Oregon. On top of this, there is an attempted rape on Hunter's daughter Indigo. Surely the author is clever and skillful enough to use another tool to demonstrate tragedy in her story. I also found a bit too much repeat material in CH, like the intimate scene between Amy and Swift and how he attempted to soothe her fears -- quite similar to Loretta and Hunter's in CM.Having said all this, I still believe CH is worth the read for the positive things I mentioned. There seems to be a consensus that Comanche Moon is the better of the two and I tend to agree. I'd also like to suggest another book, \\"Courting Morrow Little\\", by Laura Frantz, another excellent historical romance that deals with the relations between Native Americans and whites."},{"Title":"Comanche Heart","review":"I normally read romance, usually something with vampires.

When I saw the reissue at Borders, I scooped it up and reread it to see if it was as good as I remembered. It was.

When she allowed Swift to take part in the spelling bee, I cried because of the way she allowed his pride to be hurt. He was a brave warrior and she knew he didn't know how to read and write.

One should not interpret them in some totally random or ad-hoc ways, otherwise they do not make sense. This first part of the book (Ch. 1-5) also includes an interesting chapter (Ch.5) on hermeneutics which is useful.After that comes four chapters on the the four gospels, expectedly. These are quite standard but at times there are interesting insights.Finally, the last part of the book (Ch. 10-13) discusses the \\"use\\" of the gospels - how it is \\"performed\\", \\"contemplated upon\\" and \\"used\\" in ethics. The relationship between the gospels and the creed is also explained (Ch. 10).Overall - easy reading, enough materials to fulfil one's inquisitive appetite. Four stars."},{"Title":"The Cambridge Companion to the Gospels (Cambridge Companions to Religion)","review":"This collection of learned essays starts off rather studious, with a lot of notes on the scriptural sources of Christological doctrines. But the later essays grow into a theme of how the Gospels have changed history. And here we see a record of people moved, not by doctrines and creeds, but by what Jesus actually taught. I'd especially recommend the inspiring essays, \\"The gospels embodied: the lives of saints and martyrs\\", by David Matzko McCarthy, and \\"Living the gospels: morality and politics\\", by Scott Bader-Saye.--author of Correcting Jesus"},{"Title":"Noir Anxiety","review":"Using Freudian theory as a base, this scholarly treatise postulates that film noir is premised on conflicts involving gender, race, and nationality. Since much of the text necessarily examines psychoanalytical concepts, the reading requires patience and careful scrutiny. The authors' conclusions are at best edifying and at worst eye-opening--and almost certainly will cause readers to view familiar movies in a brighter light. Touch of Evil, for example, well known to most noir mavens, is thoroughly probed in its treatment of sexuality and ethnicism. The writers' judgments can thus be assessed as to their plausibility in accordance with readers' beliefs concerning Freudianism or simply in their evaluation of the motives of director Orson Welles. If the reader has not seen the film, however--as in the lesser known Secret Beyond the Door--it will be impossible to apply such a deduction. Surely, any of the authors' conclusions can be theorized to be intentional on the film creators' parts, or subliminally driven, or simply done for a technical reason. For instance, in Touch of Evil, the writers contend that Welles had Charlton Heston translate a Spanish statement into English in order to demarcate linguistic (and thus ethnic) identity. But might this not have been done merely to clue in the audience? Regardless, this text is very well researched and composed and should be of major interest to serious students of film noir."},{"Title":"The ships and aircraft of the U.S. fleet","review":"Ordinarily, either a complete review of the ships \\"or\\" the aircraft of the US Fleet would provide sufficient material for such a book as this. To include both, however, provides the reader with a complete description of just about every single aspect of the ships and aircraft in service in the US Navy at the time each edition of this book is published. What surprised me was the detailed descriptions of some items of sensitive equipment which much surely have been \\"classified.\\" For example, whilst it may be fair to say that a picture of a particular type of antennae does not reveal exactly how it works, a photograph showing the \\"Reverse side of a SPY-1A antennae during assembly\\" might appear to show too much...How strange that in most (if not all) countries, the perimeter fences of their military airfields proclaim \\"The taking of Photographs is prohibited\\" as though secret equipment might be frequently on display. When it comes to Naval ships and Aircraft and the equipment they display, however, it's as though the sign reads \\"Hey Buddy, go get your camera and see what I've got!\\"Those comments, however, are not a reflection of the author's work, on the contrary, they simply reinforce the simple fact that this is a most thorough review of the subject in hand.NM"},{"Title":"Bedrooms: 30 Instant Bedroom Transformations (Decorating)","review":"Es un escrito super sensacional para todas aquellas personas que no sabaemos mucho de decoracion y debemos estar actualizadas.

This book will captivate the reader. I read it in one sitting and was amazed not only of the horrific violence the author experienced, but the persecution by fellow Christians and church leaders. However, the author does not leave the reader at the point of abuse and rejection from the church, which is what makes the book so amazing. The author takes the reader through the steps of recovery (i.e., looking for acceptance, wanting to be left alone, the emotional and physical scars, etc.) and deals with the whole gamut of emotions from that of rejection to final acceptance by a Godly Pastor. &quot;If He Doesn't Deliver&quot; does not just tell the story of the Author (Marilyn Joyce). It asks and answers poignant questions that the author obviously had to answer on her road to recovery. These questions will empower anyone currently going through abuse. I take my hat off to the author - Marilyn Joyce - for having the guts to openly and honestly share her story, in order that more women could be freed from such relationships, especially those occurring in the church."},{"Title":"If He Doesn't Deliver, When Women Have Nowhere to Turn","review":"This book had a huge impact on my life.

But Michael Horigan's 2002 book about a northern camp helps set the record straight: Elmira was just as bad and probably worse.Horigan spent years researching, lecturing about and writing \\"Elmira: Death Camp of the North\\" and he makes strong arguments that support the idea that Elmira's abuse of its prisoners was intentional, and the South's abuse of theirs was more a matter of a lack of resources and funds. He reports strong evidence to support his claims, including records that show the Elmira prison camp officers sat on a $239,000 fund without shelling out for food or clothing, and mail between officers showing bureaucracy at its worst.In fact, much of the book focuses on the decision-makers at the camp, in Albany and in Washington who dragged their feet or ignored problems. It took them nearly half a year to approve a plan to drain Foster's Pond, an open cesspool that likely contributed to illness and disease. The commanding officer, Col. Benjamin F. Tracy, instituted a policy to reject about half the beef intended for Confederate prisoners, which Horigan says essentially helped starve many men to death. By the time the camp closed in July 1865 after just one year in operation, nearly 3,000 men had died there along the banks of the Chemung River.Horigan's book is engaging, lively and well-researched. Later chapters reiterate earlier points without boring. Even if you're not into the Civil War or prison history, you'll find this book a good, brisk read."},{"Title":"Elmira: Death Camp of the North","review":"Mr Horigan's detailed report shows the other side of the Andersonville(Ga) coin - the Northern prison at Elmira! While gut reaction to civil war prison life makes one usually think of the horrors of the Georgia settlement, Horigan deftly outlines the shameful treatment of Confederate prisoners at this installation in an area relatively untouched by the hardships of war. While one could argue many \\"excuses\\" for the ill-treatment of Federal troop at Andersonville, Horigan details that NO excuse could exist for the probably deliberate hardships suffered by those at Elmira. Adequate transportation and abundant food existed in the surrounding area, but little was done to offer humane treatment to the incarcerated. Horigan attempts to \\"name names\\" and offers insights into the real \\"villains\\" in this shameful episode.Although the text reads a bit static or flat, Horigan makes his points with emphasis. The last chapter summary is well done, too. I'd have like a map or sketch of the grounds and environs, however."},{"Title":"Elmira: Death Camp of the North","review":"When I was eight or nine, my family took a Civil War summer vacation: we visited Gettysburg, Antietam, Harper's Ferry, Manassas. We toured battlefields. We went to museums that showed artifacts - minie balls and cannon balls, examples of uniforms and swords, flags of various regiments, photos and paintings showing scenes from the critical days. We saw films, wax museums, displays. It was fascinating, and brought history to life for me. I've always been thankful to have traveled to these places when I was so young.What I didn't realize is how much Civil War history there was to learn about right here in the Twin Tiers.Because of my father's ongoing interest in history, and my own interest in books, I knew of MacKinlay Kantor's Pulitzer Prize winning book, \\"Andersonville\\", an intricate novel detailing life in and around the infamous prison camp in the South. I learned that the Andersonville Prison was a place of horror, where Union soldiers were taken to die by neglect and appalling conditions. Many of us learn of this, at least in passing, because the North won, and winners get to focus on their perspective of the events, people, and places that make up the stories that become history. And then there are books written - several excellent books have been researched and published on Andersonville - and movies made. Eventually, though, enough time passes and people become interested in their local history without feeling indicted by the shame in it. And so, as Michael Horigan explains in the introduction to his book, \\"Elmira: Death Camp of the North\\", in 1974 he was asked to teach a graduate workshop on the history of the Civil War prison camp in our backyard.Over the years of teaching this class for Elmira College, Michael Horigan's file on the prison camp and the history of Elmira leading up to the Civil War grew, as did his interest. After a year-long sabbatical for research, as well as weekends and summers for many years after, Stackpole Books finally published the definitive, authoritative work on the camp where over 12,000 Confederate soldiers were brought to \\"Helmira\\". Horigan's book is a wonderful testament to the years of work that went in to researching and writing it. Each page, each paragraph, is loaded with details, footnotes, and facts, but the sentences flow smoothly, and the reading never feels weighed down. This is a history which explains and evokes the era, fascinates, elucidates, saddens, cautions, differentiates. Though the Elmira Prison Camp had a death rate almost as high as that of Andersonville, Horigan is careful to explain the differences in the reasons behind those statistics. Ultimately, \\"Elmira: Death Camp of the North\\" is a compelling read, because it's much more than a collection of facts: it's the story of America cementing its identity as the United States, shown through the microcosm of a town we know."},{"Title":"Elmira: Death Camp of the North","review":"This book provieds plenty of ammunition for debates, when people say how terrible Andersonville was.The North NEVER had a food shortage, Never had an embargo, with-holding food, medicine or clothing. Yet, all this was PURPOSELY with held from the Southern POW's at NOT only Elmira, but other Northern POW camps for pure and simple revenge. This book contains the documents by General Halleck and Col. Hoffman, who ordered the suffering of these poor Southern soldiers.Using information from this book, has already IN MANY OF MY DISCUSSIONS, quickly halted the accusations of The Terrible Southern POW camps.The facts are extremely well documented, and the book, while a great read, does a vivid description of the horrors of Elmira. ( Called, \\"Hell-mira\\"--by the POW's) ( This book does include photos)In conclusion, after reading this book, one may wonder how can civilized people, treat their fellow human beings this way. Unfortunatly, this is another chapter of Americas shameful history."},{"Title":"Elmira: Death Camp of the North","review":"Mike Horrigan initiated my interest in the civil war many years ago when he first started his course on the Civil War prison camp in Elmira, New York. I ice skated on Foster's Pond as a child, which was in the middle of the prison camp compound. Being on the site of the camp during winter brings it home as to how the prisoners must have suffered there. Mike has done a masterful job at weaving his research in to a thought provoking tapestry. This is a very good read!!Pat Patterson"},{"Title":"Elmira: Death Camp of the North","review":"Elmira, located just a few miles north of the Pennsylvania/New York border, was undoubtedly the worst Federal prisoner of war camp during the Civil War. It was in operation only from July 1864 to July 1865, and held a grand total of slightly over 12,000 Confederate prisoners. Astoundingly, its death rate was almost a full one-quarter.I say \\"astoundingly\\" because most of the deaths were unnecessary. No one wants to defend the terrible conditions in Confederate-run prisoner of war camps. But at least it is arguable that a good deal of their harshness is attributable to a scarcity of food, clothing, medicines, and building supplies in the increasingly war-impoverished south. As Michael Horigan argues in his Elmira: Death Camp of the North, the federal camps had no such excuse. The north was rich in men and material. The deaths at Elmira seem attributable to deliberate negligence, outright retribution, or criminal inefficiency.Horigan's history of Elmira carefully defends this claim. The camp was thrown together in a hodge-podge fashion, with way too few barracks built and way too many prisoners of war crammed onto the camp grounds. As late as November and December of 1864, both of which were bitterly cold, overflow prisoners were living in tents. Moreover, continuous bickering between medical officers and camp commanders led to stonewalling in the camp when it came to draining a pond whose pollution was contaminating drinking water and red-tape confusion in communications about supplies between the camp and Washington DC. Inefficiency, short-sightedness, and indifference made bad conditions worse.But Horigan argues that mistreatment of prisoners was also deliberate policy. Secretary of War Stanton, responding to reports about harsh conditions in Libby Prison, Belle Isle, and Andersonville, ordered that rations for Confederate prisoners be cut by 20%. Winter clothing, blankets, and medical supplies were also held up as retributory measures. And at the local level, orders were issued that drastically reduced daily rations of beef, under the false pretense that the beef was tainted.Horigan's book tends to be redundant--it could probably have been cut by some fifty pages--and the style is a bit flat. But the author does a really fine job of documenting the prisoner abuse that took place at the prison camp that came to be called \\"Helmira.\\" One of the more shocking details of his story is the apparent indifference of many of the civilian residents of Elmira to the prisoners' fate. In fact, observation towers were built just outside the prison walls by creative entrepeneurs. For just one dime, curious civilians could climb the towers to gawk at the Confederate prisoners.Civil wars are always brutal, and our own Civil War was no exception. There are few more dramatic encapsulations of the hatred each side felt for the other than prisoner of war camps. It's important to remember this side of the American Civil War, lest we fall into the temptation to romanticize it. (Please note that reenactors never simulate prison camps.) Horigan is to be commended for reminding us of the ugly truth about the war's treatment of prisoners.______* Comment of G.T. Taylor, 1st Alabama Battalion of Heavy Artillery and an Elmira prisoner. Quoted on page 101."},{"Title":"Elmira: Death Camp of the North","review":"I read the book from start to finish. And I cannot believe that no one was ever punished. The restrictions on food was alarming.There was more personnel that should have been punished,starting with Secretay Stanton."},{"Title":"Elmira: Death Camp of the North","review":"There was no excuse for Elmira. The Union had plenty of food and clothing, POWs did not have to starve and freeze at this death camp. Andersonville was an equally horrible place, but the South couldn't feed even its own troops or citizens and the POWs they held fared only a bit worse than the citizenry of the CSA. Elmira was pure hatred and retaliation -- and puts the lie to the moral high-ground the Union claimed. It was Grant's decision to end parole of prisoners that largely created these hell-holes on both sides. He had a steady supply of new cannon fodder drafted right off the boats in New York -- the South did not, so attrition was Grant's way to win a war when his military talent proved lacking.It's true that history is written by the victorious, but some events like Elmira just stink too much for disinfectant and dirt to cover up. This book shines some light on events as they actually were as opposed to the white-washed crap in school history books."},{"Title":"Elmira: Death Camp of the North","review":"I was so irritated by the numerous syntax and diction errors in this book that I went to the publisher's website to try to complain. Unfortunately, there is no contact button. So, I'm reduced to this forum. I actually marked the errors in the book for the first 50 pages or so. Sight used to mean site, perpetuate used to mean perpetrate can be excused as simple spelling errors. Lines such as \\"mastered a command of the French language,\\" \\"unfettered depiction of Indian life were captured on canvas,\\" \\"Disabilities and diseases that accrued in the line of duty,\\" \\"was within a military orthodoxy that was tantamount to dogma,\\" are a few of the examples which really bothered me in the first 30 pages. Redundant language, tortured phraseology, mismatched subject-verb structures were bad, but worse were sentences which just plain made no sense.This is a real shame since the story is interesting, needed to be told, and the research seems well done. The author just needed an editor to insist on simple, direct, compelling language."},{"Title":"Elmira: Death Camp of the North","review":"The subtitled of this book might bring a reflection that there was a \\"final solution\\" created by Northern government to the Confederate POWs problems and that the solution will take place at Elmira.I think the author tries too hard to paint a gruesome picture of Elmira prison camp and tries too hard to compared it with some of the worst stuff that was going on in the south. Its like comparing apple and pineapple. Even by the author's account, most of the deaths at the prison camp was caused by illnesses and dieases, contributing factors may been prison officials indifference, ignorance and politics. Author stated that retaliation against southern mistreatment of northern prisoners had a major factor in determining treatment. Still, the photos I have seen of Confederate POWs coming out of Elmira contrast heavily to the human ruins that came out of Andersonville.Its pretty obvious that the author do seem to be an authority on the Elmira camp but I questioned his objectivity and his perception. While Elmira may have been a callous disregard, Andersonville was a criminal disregard for prisoners' welfare. Author who appears to live in that area of New York State, can't seem to understand the difference between the two as some of the previous reviewers of this book. But the book reads very well, some parts seem to be bit redundant at times but I found it to be an interesting read despite of some objectionable opinions.Thus while the book do have some merits, comparing it with Andersonville isn't one of them. Making excuses for southern treatments of northern prisoners isn't one of them. Of 600,000 deaths during the American Civil War, most were due to illnesses and dieases and in hindsight, many of them could have been prevented through proper hygenic codes, better food, better clothing and more. Maybe Elmira could have been handled better but I have read where regiments have lost 20-30% of their numbers to the same causes in open camps, probably for the same reasons. Elmira may have been a bad place but I am sure most Union prisoners at Andersonville would gladly change places with their Confederate counterparts."},{"Title":"Elmira: Death Camp of the North","review":"An interesting book, but it doesn't obviate the horrors of Andersonville or any other Confederate prison as some of the reviewers here contend. One need only read accounts of Union prisoners captured early in the war, especially at the Seven Days battles (\\"Fallen Soldier\\" by Andrew Roy comes to mind), to see that poor treatment of Federal POWs was a hallmark of Confederate captivity from almost the beginning of war and preceded the likes of Elmira by two years. Union soldiers who were exchanged and sent back home or returned to the army reported that Libby and the other tobacco warehouse prisons in Richmond were full of wounded men not being properly cared for, that prisoners had to sleep on floors covered with excrement, had bad drinking water, poor rations, and could barely even breath in the fetid atmosphere of buildings designed to store tobacco, not hold prisoners. This attitude toward Union prisoners, even while the exchange system was still operating, fostered a like-minded attitude in the North toward prisoners. I'm not saying that two wrongs make a right, but today's neo-secessionists blind themselves to the fact that bad treatment of prisoners was first initiated by the Confederates. I give this book two stars as a compromise: four-stars for the research, but only one-star for drawing narrow conclusions and obviously playing up to an audience of neo-Confederate revisionists who seem to think the only way to somehow explain Andersonville is to scream \\"Elmira\\" while deliberately forgetting about the early-war Richmond warehouse-prisons had no early-war Union counterpart."},{"Title":"DOCTOR AT THE CROSSROADS","review":"Excellent -- too bad there aren't classy romances like these anymore."},{"Title":"China's Trial by Fire: The Shanghai War of 1932","review":"The Japanese attack on Shanghai in 1932 has been overshadowed by the second assault five years later, and then by the Second World War. But it was a key moment in the long build-up to the world conflict, and Professor Jordan has done it full justice in this book.Drawing on a multiplicity of sources, he tells the gripping story from the pretexts set up by a Japanese army major to the final search for a truce so that the Japanese could turn their attention to conquest elsewhere in China. In the course of his narrative, he also puts the record straight on a number of key areas where politics subsequently distorted the account of what happened during the five weeks of Shanghai's trial for bombing, artillery and fire.As in his earlier book on the Northern Expedition by the Nationalists to take control of China, Professor Jordan cuts through the propaganda which surrounds much of the country's history to produce an authoritative picture of an episode which, in many ways, presaged later events such as the bombing of unprotected civilian areas and the failure of the democracies to resists militrarism. His book also raises the interesting question of why so many historical accounts of China in this period have unquestioningly accepted conventional wisdom that gets some important aspects of the Shanghai attack wrong, despite contemporary evidence to the contrary."},{"Title":"Was Jesus Crucified?","review":"Brother Ahmed Deedat did a very fine job writing a book and giving evidences right from the Bible that Jesus peace be upon him was not crucified. What I don't agree with him is that he says so strongly that Jesus peace be upon him did go to the cross and he did go in the grave. The Quran does not tell us how he was saved.The Quran only tells us &quot;That they said (in boast), &quot;We killed Christ Jesus the son of Mary, the Messenger of Allah.;- but they killed him not, nor crucified him, but so it was made to appear to them, and those who differ therein are full of doubts, with no (certain) knowledge, but only conjecture to follow, for of a surety they killed him not:- Quran 4:157&quot;So it is very possible that Jesus peace be upon him did not go to the cross and the grave at all. It is also possible that what brother Deedat told us is all true because the Quran does not tell us how exactly he was saved.We Muslims do believe in the Torah of Moses, Psalm of David, and Gospel of Jesus peace be upon them all. But it is clear that the Bible that exists today is not the original that was given to the various Prophets of God. However we Muslims don't say that all of the Bible that exists today is false. We believe that it is a part Message of God and a part work and ideas of men.So the way to determine what is True in the Bible and what is False is this:1. Anything in the Bible that parallels with the Hadith and the Quran is 100% the Message of God. 2. Anything in the Bible that contradicts with what it says in the Quran and Hadith is 100% work and ideas of men. 3. Anything in the Bible that is not told in the Hadith or in the Quran we say, &quot;we don't know.&quot; It can be the True Message of God or it can be the work and ideas of men.Most of the evidenses/proofs that brother Deedat give fall in the third catagory. So it can be True and it can be False. We don't know."},{"Title":"Was Jesus Crucified?","review":"I have read several of Ahmed Deedat's books. I find them to contain good arguments overall, but each individual point may not always be relevent. Sometimes he makes leaps of logic in his interpretations, or sometimes I (as a muslim and former christian) would consider his interpretations judgement calls.That being said, he makes arguments that are made up of several points to support his contentions. Disassebling one point is frequently not enough to discount his entire point. I encourage you, if you read his books to look at the argument as a whole and decide what you think, even if some non-essential points may not hold up.If you are looking to criticize what he has to say, you can find things to criticize. But if you objectively look at the overall arguments, they generally can not be easily dismissed.I think most Christians are well intentioned and the Biblical values they have make them good people. But for those who are questioning if the Bible is as it was originally revealed, I would encourage you to read what it has to say about how Judas died. Two different parts of the Bible say he died in two different ways. I know there are 2 Judases. But at least in the Bibles I have seen, it clearly is referring to the Judas said to have betrayed Jesus (peace be upon Jesus).Now surely GOD knows how Judas died!So that leaves a couple possible conclusions:1. The Bible never was revealed by God2. The basic message of the Bible was revealed by God but has been changed by humans3. Judas died twice and we are supposed to go on pure faith even though it conflicts with our logic. (You could make this argument. The reason I don't personally believe this is that there does not seem to be any REASON for Judas to have died twice . I do believe sometimes faith has to overcome reason. But in this case Judas's dying twice would seem to serve only as a stumbling block for sincerely inquiring people to make a mistake and discount the message of God with no up-side. The other miracles in the Bible seem to have the overall intent of showing the people at the time it was revealed that it was the message of GOD. For example, Jesus is said to walk on water. Clearly this is not something a human being could do of one's own power. So assuming this really happened, it would show that Jesus was either empowered by God beyond what other people could do, as Muslims believe, or was himself a god, as most Christians believe. I can not think of any other example in the Bible where God made a miracle that would cause people to DOUBT that it was His messaage by seeming to place parts of the message in contradiction with each other. Especially since specifically stating that Judas died twice would have clarified it and prevented the potential mistake.) God knows best what He intended. This is the best conclusion I am able to draw.I believe that the second conclusion is correct.So the next question is, if God sent us someone to give people a message about how to live and the people corrupted it, can it be relied upon? For example, assuming the Bible contains a mistake about Judas' death, can we rely upon it to know about the death of Jesus (peace be upon him)?If not, what are we supposed to do?The Bible tells us that the Law is written upon each person's heart. (I don't remember the exact verse. You can look it up if you are interested.) So we can fairly be held accountable by God for not following God's desires, for causing injustice, for being greedy, etc. etc.Muslims believe that the scriptures (including the original messages of the Torah and Bible) were sent as a mercy by God to remind us of the right way to live and help us avoid punishment.They also correct the human corruption of earlier books. (Jesus came to remind people of the original message of the Torah and to correct what had been changed so that people would live in accordance with God's wishes. He was a true servant of God and one of the best examples of humanity. We don't believe that he was a god. We sincerely do not mean this to disparage him in any way, and in fact, if a person does not believe that he faithfully carried the message of God to humanity, that person is not considered a Muslim. We believe that he never claimed to be more than a prophet.)I believe that the Quran is the next revelation sent from God and clarifies things that have been changed over time in the Bible. Non-muslim writers have agreed that the Quran in its Arabic form has not changed over time or distance with the exception of punctuation and the addition of vowel marks. (All true Qurans are in Arabic and can not be translated. This is not because Islam views Arabs as better than other people. It is clearly stated by Muhammad, (sws)- an Arab- that Arabs as a group are NOT better than other people just by virtue of their ethnicity. It is most likely because of the way that Arabic words can convey great depth of meaning (or multiple meanings) concisely. This is because of the great history of very expressive oral poetry that refined the language over hundreds of years. There are \\"interpretations\\" of the Quran in other languages to help learning, but these are not considered by muslims to be equal to the Quran.) In the Quran, God tells us that the Arabic Quran will not change, and in my opinion from reading Muslim and non-Muslim writings by historians, this has been the case. We believe that is because the message of the Quran is the last written revelation before the Day of Judgement.You may not agree with my conclusions, but you may be interested in knowing more about what Muslims believe or in forming your own answers to the question raised above. Ahmed Deedat's books may help you to consider the various angles."},{"Title":"Was Jesus Crucified?","review":"HelloAfter looking through the pamphlet many of Mr Deedat's arguments are unbalanced. Muslims tell us that to have a proper understanding of the Koran, one must know Arabic, Islamic theology, history etc. . However Mr Deedat's understanding of the Christian holy text appears devoid of any such scholarship.My studies concerning Islam and conversations with Muslim friends informs me that if one wants to truly understand the Koran then knowledge concerning Arabic is essential. Mr. Deedat has not treated the Bible in the same manner. Sadly he rages on about passages and beliefs that are often solved by an understanding of Koine Greek, the passages context and/or Christian theology/thought (A studied/holistic approach considering other writings, history culture etc.). Christian resources are there to help him discern many of the claimed difficulties though Mr Deedat appears ignorant of these works. Proudly boasting within his Islamic worldview, he believes himself triumphant yet sadly few of his questions demand much attention. Though Mr Deedat might be a scholar of Islam ,his arguments against Christianity are no better than a man with a little bit of knowledge raging against Christianity while being applauded by those of like mind.Why is this important? Muslims that I have met always appeal too many of the same devices listed in the questions above when understanding the Koran. Why is this work devoid of any honest attempt to do the same for the Bible? For example, no thoughtful Muslim would take a section or verse from one of the Surahs and try to interpret its mysteries without looking to the whole passage ,the Surah ,the Koran, the Hadiths etc. for context. Mr. Deedat does take sections, verses from the Christians \\"inspired\\" book without care to any such devices, assuming he knows what he does not. My question to Muslims here is why not treat the Bible with at least the same level of fairness? My life is filled with conversations and deep friendships among Muslims. In my journey (not complete), I found misconceptions by many Muslims about Christians and vise-versa. Conversations that have sprung from these encounters enriched all of our lives. Perhaps those here who read my review might see the fairness/reasonableness of listening first to learn what is honestly debatable and then argue as one should.Frankly Mr. Deedat is cut from the same cloth as some of Christianities hard right wingers. Proud, arrogant, angry, Mr. Deedat boldly marches forward carrying forth the banner of Islam, running over his reader by force of will or might, not solid arguments. The truly disappointing thing is that when Mr. Deedat does fall over an interesting point or two of contention, that has sparked some debate even in Christendom, he fails to flush out the issue. He simply triumphantly boasts, prods, laughs through his prose at all Christendom, as a madman might.However I must confess that this is a strange book to review as I do not wish to dismiss everything here. The pamphlet does give one insight into how some Muslims view the crucifixion as well as Christianity. But whether one is a Christian, Muslim, Atheist, or Agnostic (hopefully without the same issues) the first thing you will notice is the harsh and triumphant tone of the pamphlet. I personally find many angry agenda driven authors suffer from a lack of depth in their arguments. This is no exception. So if you are looking for a scholarly text that attempts to disprove the crucifixion this is not it. But if you are looking for a read that gives interesting insight into the mindset of such peoples, then this might be an interesting read."},{"Title":"Was Jesus Crucified?","review":"Mr. Deedat, now deceased, has written a tremendous work that anyone, Christian, Muslim or other, should read. He does what many who argue against the crucifixion often do not do -- he uses the New Testament texts. Keeping in mind that he is reading it as a Muslim and not through the lens of Christianity as it is traditionally understood (understandable considering that Christians read the Quran through the lens of Christian belief), his conclusions are striking.Christians who read this should give it serious consideration if not to rethink their own beliefs then to at least consider that the New Testament evidence is not so plainly obvious and it is forged through years and years of teaching and exegesis. One must truly learn to strip away what is explanatory and get back to what the text actually says. Far too many Christians know how to argue from Scripture framed in explanation and have not really digested the Scriptures and made it their own.This is not to say by any means that Mr. Deedat is in fact accurate in his conclusions. This is merely to say that the use of logic and reason can find in Scripture many conclusions, as can be seen here. If it was so cut and dry, there would not be so many divisions within Christianity itself (or in any religion for that matter). He does uses Biblical scripture thoroughly and his conclusions do deserve serious consideration.I think most importantly his conclusions help explain how it is that Jesus is understood in Islam and how Islam itself is understood. In this regard this is a highly valuable book.Why four stars? There is a certain level of showmanship, even braggadocio that is a bit disconcerting and one notices not what is said but the attitude of the one speaking. He comes across in many places as a bit smug. Granted, many Christians bash Islam and its Prophet also in similar manner, but I found this to be a distraction.All in all, however, this is a valuable piece of literature for anyone interested in the subject of the crucifixion and also in the differences between the worldview of Christianity and/or Islam."},{"Title":"Was Jesus Crucified?","review":"In this book Mr. Deedat explains why Jesus (pbuh) was not crucified but was taken to sky by God and supports this with facts from various backgrounds, he also explains it from Islamic perspective.

I objectively took at look at what he has to say and thought through his challenges. Here is what the facts are:1. In public debates he is simply insulting to the person he is debating and the Christians who are there. Is this the type of person who you want representing Islam? Is this loving and respectful? Even muslims I know admit that he is &quot;not for Christians&quot; to hear, but for Muslims because of how rude he can be.2. He is NOT a Biblical scholar as he claims. He is skilled not a understanding the Bible, but at twisting what it has to say to fit his own purposes. He does not understand the Christian doctrine of revelation and heaps insults at the bible.3. He is inconsitent in his arguments. Is it &quot;objective&quot; to only accept everything in the Bible that agrees with the Qu'ran? If he quotes Scripture,as he tries to do, he refuses to look at the context of any of the passages, or any other passages that give it a meaning that is more along the lines of biblical thought. I admit, even Christians do this, but true scholars point out when Christians make that mistake.3. Therefore, &quot;Was Jesus Crucified&quot; is only answered in light of the Qu'ran. And his logic does not even match basic Islamic belief except for the refusal to accept that Jesus died. For example, he takes the &quot;swoon&quot; theory where Jesus SEEMED to die. This is the same belief if the heretical islamic sects, the Ahmadiyas.4. He, like much is Islam, uses strongly Platonic and not biblical arguments. Islam is rife with Platonism, not the God of the Bible. His argument that if Jesus was resurrected, that he would only have a &quot;spiritual&quot; body is flwaed, becuase he never admits this is an ASSUMPTION. But Christians have never believed that the resurrected body is some fint &quot;spiritual&quot; body, but rather a whole body.Deedat is far from a biblical scholar.

However, the tables and examples are bland, as is the color scheme of the book (printed in 2 colors).

I have used older editions of this book because they have been easy for students to understand. With the eighth edition I have had to pass out lists of corrections and mistakes in the book. They are nothing major, but often confuse students."},{"Title":"Statistics","review":"This textbook was selected for me to use in teaching statistics to undergraduates. I've just finished reading it and I am, on the whole, very pleased. It is much easier to understand than any of the statistics texts I used in upper division courses or graduate school. It is straight forward and concise yet has a fairly conversational style. The only downside is the need for text corrections (about a page worth) but these are available from the book's companion website and can be handed out the first day of class to avoid student frustration."},{"Title":"Statistics","review":"My intermediate statistics professor is convinced that this is \\"the best intro stats textbook out there,\\" but I'm not so sure. It's quite competent, yes, but some of the details are a little funky. For instance, the chapter on correlation precedes the discussion of power, so there is no mention in the book of appropriate sample sizes for a correlational study. Also, the ninth edition has very few substantive changes from the eighth. There are a few subtle differences in, for instance, the numbers used in examples and questions. On the other hand, there is a random number table and a good discussion of how to use it, and the z, t, and F tables are set up well and their use is explained clearly. As a student, I wish that there were pages of formulas, but I suppose making my own is a learning experience. If you are looking for a statistics text that incorporates PASW (SPSS), this book is not for you. There is mention that the software exists, but that's it. It sounds as though I really dislike this textbook, but I don't. The language is clear and the examples are appropriate and interesting, which is more than I can say for some statistics textbooks! The explanation of the sampling distribution is particularly skillful."},{"Title":"Statistics","review":"The chapters are very easy to read and understand.

The chapters are well organized and easy to work through. Examples are clearly presented. The authors have done an outstanding job of breaking down the tasks into understandable language.

I grew up in the &quot;Faith Camp&quot; and have seen many &quot;shipwrecked&quot; Christians that never understood the principles taught in this book. Pastor Barbara Plilar walks you through the major reasons Christians often find themselves in &quot;the Pits&quot; of life. She also shows you the way out of &quot;the Pit&quot; you may be in. She is no novice when it comes to the walk of Faith. The examples she uses from her own life are supernatural and inspirational. The &quot;Faith Message&quot; has been criticized by many in the Church because of their lack of understanding of the things discussed in this &quot;Faith Saving&quot; book. If you believe that God really does want you to be blessed and successful in this life - OR if you are beginning to have your doubts - this book will save your faith!

I found and read a few good books on this topic, but this one is by far the best one I found. It is very thorough, but explained well. Every family going thru Leukemia, should have this book.

I can not thank enough Dr. Baker for this remarkable book."},{"Title":"550 Dakota Verbs","review":"This book is set up for use by people hoping to learn how to speak Dakota. This makes it a step above many texts out there written for linguists. Its focus on verbs and verb tenses because this is a very vital part of the Dakota language and diffcult to find the correct form in the older dictionaries. This focus means it is a more advanced book for people with other sources or books covering the basics of the langauge, but it is still very useful for beginners(like me). I have found this book to be very useful in learning the spoken langauge. That is what the purpose of this book is, to aid in learning the spoken langauge. The nicest feature is that not only does it have 550 different verbs and their tenses, it also has them translated from english to dakota and dakota to english. Don't get me wrong it is invaluable for the more linquistily inclined as well. The older dictionaries are hard to navigate and find these verbs and find the conjugated forms as you need them. I hope more come out like it in the future. There are very few like it for the D-speakers at the moment. Books like this are a step towards books helping the spoken language thrive by being understandable by people without linguistic degrees."},{"Title":"550 Dakota Verbs","review":"This is a useful books for someone who wants to memorize verb conjugation instead of learning the pattern. Dakota doesn't have to many verb conjugation patterns so conjugation is not very hard to learn. But the book is good fro reference.My only wish is that it used the spelling system used in theNew Lakota Dictionarybecause it is so much easier to read - the differences between similliar letters are so much clearer. Eyas wowapi kagapi kin hena tanyan echunpi."},{"Title":"The Black House","review":"Paul Theroux is remarkable among contemporary novelists for his stylistic range. He's written a range of unique travelogues, short stories, semi-autobiographies, science fiction, essays and with The Black House, a ghost story that evokes the feel of the great ghost stories of the Victorian era, but in a thoroughly modern setting.The Black House tells the story of a middle aged couple, the Mundays, recently returned from nearly a decade in Africa where the husband was an anthropologist studying a tribe called the Bwamba. They've returned, ostensibly because of his heart trouble, to a dreary cottage in a small and not terribly friendly town where he can work on his book. Disturbing things began to happen almost immediately; figures are seen peering in windows. A Bwamba spearpoint dissappears from a collection passed around at a public lecture. And Munday's wife begins to suffer from unexplained maladies.To tell more would be to reveal too much of this wonderfully dark and horrific tale. If you're a fan of the ghost stories of M. R. James (as is Theroux) or such classic tales as &quot;August Heat&quot; or de Maupaussant's &quot;The Horla&quot;, read &quot;The Black House&quot; for a treat."},{"Title":"The Black House","review":"English anthropologist Alfred Munday has returned to his homeland for health reasons after a decade in Uganda studying the Bwamba tribe. Frustrated by this forced change in his life, Munday finds himself unable to begin preparing his research for publication. His marriage sits on precarious ground, and he and his wife have just taken on a domestic disaster: the home they leased site-unseen--Bowood House, \\"the Black House\\" to locals--is ruinous, inhospitable, and apparently haunted. Munday's superior, intellectual airs quickly alienate the couple from their neighbors in the town of Four Ashes. Then the beautiful Caroline appears, and she initiates a torrid, reckless affair with Munday, whose old troubles are quickly exchanged for new ones.There is a prevailing tone of despair, even damnation, to Paul Theroux's ghost story, THE BLACK HOUSE. Munday is a pathetic creature, a surly egoist unable to make or keep friends or to fill his roles as husband and scholar. He allows the trappings of his identity slowly to be stripped away until he is only a shadow of his formerly serious and professional self. He invites an African acquaintance to Four Ashes for a visit, but Munday, under the influence of this growing malaise, becomes suddenly embarrassed by the very sight of the man and abuses him at every turn. Though clearly he needs no help at it, some of his new neighbors are more than willing to aid Munday's decline: while giving a presentation at a local church about his anthropological work in Africa, a valuable and dangerous Bwamba artifact is stolen from him; the theft drives Munday to distraction, sensing that if he should ever see the object again it will not be under happy circumstances. The great irony which unfolds over the course of the novel is that this anthropologist, who considers it his vocation to make one African tribe comprehensible to the outside world, cannot himself adapt to the simple community of Four Ashes. In placing himself above small town life, Munday rejects the basic principals of social integration, thus making himself ideal prey for the mysterious Caroline.The quality of Theroux's writing and the dark mix of psychology, intense sensuality, and metaphysical unease place THE BLACK HOUSE in the estimable company of Richard Adams' THE GIRL IN A SWING and Robert Aickman's \\"strange stories.\\" This is a territory in which unexpected and inexplicable episodes drive the narrative: Munday glimpses two mutilated dogs under a tarp in a local man's garden; a woman applying for a maid's position at Bowood House leaves information leading the Mundays to the wrong address; the scorching eroticism of Caroline's surprise visits threaten to leave the Mundays' home in flames. Such incidents accumulate over the course of the novel, tempered by Theroux's cool but entrancing prose. From this grows a palpable tension that--perhaps in keeping with its nature--never actually resolves. One almost anticipates the novel's vague, indecipherable ending, a point at which Theroux compels his readers to share, for a moment, Munday's banishment to a maddening limbo."},{"Title":"The Black House","review":"As a great Theroux fan, I approached The Black House with enthusiasm which soon faded. The prose is ponderous and the main characters are dull. An anthropologist returned to England after ten years in Uganda, the haunted Munday (a bad-tempered, stuffed shirt if ever there was one) becomes an incongruous partner in a steaming affair with the apparition, Caroline. Their clandestine meetings are occasioned by Caroline's invasion of the conscious mind of Munday's wife, Emma. She finds herself compelled to send her husband off on irrational errands which culminate in more sexual encounters with a waiting Caroline. (Difficult to swallow? Yes, indeed) The promised horror and haunting don't really make the grade and the most entertaining portion of the book, in my opinion, was the unwelcome visit of the African Silvano to the English village where the Mundays were not regarded kindly. This, at least, was worth an occasional chuckle."},{"Title":"The Black House","review":"I love Paul Theroux, I've read most of his work, but this cruelly disappoints. He can write great fiction : look at The Family Arsenal, but this is not great fiction. I couldn't get into the book at all, the characters didn't grab me, the plot seemed forced, and the sex scenes towards the close of the book seemed almost to be there to encourage the reader to actually finish the book. Disappointed."},{"Title":"The Black House","review":"I could only bear the first 110 pages. I can't stand reading anymore. Argh! I gave it this much time of my life because he is a renowned author and deserved some respect, but, one can only take so much boredom. Sorry to all the Theroux lovers."},{"Title":"The Black House","review":"This is the first book that I have read by Paul Theroux. I am generally a Stephen King reader but unfortunally my English teacher does not allow him for a book report. Anyways, I had an oral presentation to do today on The Black House, and since this book didn't catch my intrest, I only read to page 25. Come on! I was falling asleep.

Valentine Daniel is Professor of Anthropology at Columbia University, the author of several important anthropological works and co-editor of the professional journal 'Culture/Contexture.'\\"Fluid Signs: Being a Person in the Tamil Way\\" is the result of anthropological field research undertaken amongst Tamil-speaking residents of Kalappur, a predominantly Hindu village in the Southern Indian state of Tamil Nadu.The author's richly textured ethnographic detail is combined with with a challenging and innovative theoretical analysis: Daniel argues that symbolic anthropologists have yet to appreciate the multifaceted function of the sign and its role in the creation of culture. This provocative study underscores the need for Western intellectual traditions in general and anthropology in particular to deepen its discourse with South Asian cultural and religious thought.This work is a brilliant product of the author's capacity for imagination and expression. His flawless scholarship is on display throughout the work, and his translations are accurate as well as so gifted and so evocative that that they are charming and make what could otherwise have turned into a ponderous tome most readable and a pleasure to read.Daniel's discussions of concepts dealt with in the book are set in the full context of his previous scholarship; and quite often very humorous, so that his depictions of the foibles and flaws of his informants, as well as his own, are a joy to read. The author manages to bring the theoretical considerations of his discipline he grapples with to a level which is easily digested to a non-anthropologist.This is one of the best, most readable and most engaging ethnographies I have read, providing rich insights into the habits and mode of everyday living of a specific village of southernmost India, but also with implications for the rest of the Indian subcontinent, and further, for humankind globally.I would unhesitatingly recommend this book to the lay reader and the anthropologist alike with an interest in southern India and Tamil studies."},{"Title":"Fluid Signs: Being a Person the Tamil Way","review":"I was disappointed by this book. The author focusses almost exclusively on matters that probably never concerned more than a few Tamils and certainly aren't taken seriously today. Reading this book to learn about &quot;Being a Person the Tamil Way&quot; would be like studying the fine details of feng shui to learn about being a person the Chinese way. Putting it another way, imagine reading a whole chapter in a book about what we mean when we speak of &quot;home&quot;. Do we mean our present house? Our parents' house? Our town, our region, our country? How would we define the boundaries of our &quot;home&quot;? Maybe this book makes sense to a particular type of academic or intellectual, but for anyone who merely wishes to read an ethnography about Tamil culture, this book would be a waste of time."},{"Title":"1968 Body By Fisher (Service Manual)","review":"This publication contains the essential removal, installation, adjustment and maintenance procedures for servicing all U.S. and Canadian built 1968 Fisher Body Styles.

You can read the book by Tanenbaum Computer networks to find it out. Which requirements have I to meet to design a network? And the book Practical Computer Network Analysis and Design by McCabe is good for this task. How can I design it in order to integrate required services and choose the right equipment to build it? And the book by Taylor does NOT provide an answer, not even useful hints. Maybe it tries to, maybe it is obsolete, the author takes more than five hundred pages (plus appendixes) to say actually nothing but a long and never ending chat, in which many subjects are often repeated, using a vague language. More details are explained about protocols, but, despite the title of the book and inside chapters, very little is said about their relation to network design. However, you can find almost everywhere publications providing any detail you need about protocols, so you don't need to purchase a textbook about network design. And a bit more, but just a bit, can be found in the last chapters about bridging and routing (that is why I think the book deserves two stars instead of one). But for these last subjects, in my opinion, the book provides you material to speak about networks in a pub in the same way other people speak about sport or girls. But nothing else."},{"Title":"The Network Architecture Design Handbook","review":"I found The Network Architecture Design Handbook to be one of the best books on the subject of hybrid and LAN\\\\WAN networking.

Some of them are laugh out loud funny, brutal and full of venom. One even said that I WAS A MALE WAR BRIDE was not for the \\"squeamish\\"! What the hell?Besides the films, there is a solid, but short, biography featuring dozens of great personal and behind the scenes photographs. And if that's not enough there's a listing of all of Cary's radio and television appearances and even a list of his special appearances in movies, including war effort shorts.I've read this book cover to cover many times and still pick it up just to browse and for reference.

He keeps the necessary technical babble to a minimum, making this book (mostly) accessible to any lay person. Some of the charts were confusing to me, but I got the gist of things. The chapters are well organized, and his method of making the book a \\"geological mystery\\" is very well executed.I also appreciate the author's introspective style; he doesn't have all the answers, nor does he pretend to. Credit is given to fellow geologists for their field and lab work, and overall the reader gets a good sense of life (and death) on this planet 250 million years ago.If I were a paleontologist, no doubt this would be a 5 star read. As is, it's an excellent overview of a very intriguing period of time in our planet's history that anyone can enjoy, regardless of their level of knowledge for the subject at hand.I am keeping this book nearby as I plan to re-read it in the near future; I found it that engaging."},{"Title":"Extinction: How Life on Earth Nearly Ended 250 Million Years Ago","review":"While the subject matter in the book may seem a bit dry to some, and lacks the pizzazz of the story of the Dinosaur Killer Asteroid at the end of the Cretacious, I have found it quite riveting. Dr Erwin obviously knows his stuff on the subject, and has put together a truly excellent rundown on current popular theories of how it all happened. He goes the full extent of being fair and pretty unbiased as to what was the proximate cause of the most extensive extinction event in Earth's history. He goes into very extensive detail on the different theories; the meteor impact, general climate change, ocean water anoxia, and several other possible causes of the disaster. This is not a book for those who are the average reader. It is quite scholarly, and remarkably succinct in describing the possible causes and effects of things that happened back then. A great detective story, but you need to be able to handle a book that describes a truly important event, but without many great moments if you're the type of person who likes their history in great moments.I'm quite glad I bought it."},{"Title":"Extinction: How Life on Earth Nearly Ended 250 Million Years Ago","review":"I am loving this book but besides all my highlighting of truly interesting text, I am having to edit a lot of punctuation, style and grammar errors.

Erwin is an expert in the area of the Permian extinction, and when he tries, he can write well. Unfortunately, he does not seem to try often. There are just too many sentences here that need to be read two or three times before their meaning becomes clear. The meaning of many of the graphics never become clear!

At that point, I was as confused about the Permian extinction as I was at the beginning, and I cannot even say I was confused at a higher level."},{"Title":"Extinction: How Life on Earth Nearly Ended 250 Million Years Ago","review":"The Permian-Triassic End Event, 256 MY ago, caused the extinction of 95% of this planet's marine species and 70% of all land species.

Foer sets the background by comparing the great extinction of the Cretaceous Age sixty- five million years ago with the even more devastating extinctions of the Permian two- hundred and fifty million years ago. While there is a fair consensus that it was the great comet which landed in Yucatan that led to death of the Dinosaurs, the scientific community is far less united in regard to the earlier and more larger Extinction. Here are the possible causes as Foer lists them.\\" The list of indicted suspects includes -- -- plate tectonics, volcanoes, glaciation, a meteor, a supernova, a massive methane burp from the depths of the sea, oxygen-deprived oceans, an overly complex global ecosystem that collapsed under its own weight and, most fantastic of all, a buildup of cancer-inducing dark matter in the Earth's core. Dream up a way of killing off life on Earth, and chances are some reputable scientist has already proposed it as a cause of the Permian extinction.\\"Foer says that Ervin does a very careful job of evaluating each of the possible causes, a task which involves sifting evidence from a wide variety of locales along the globe. One part of the puzzle may relate to the formation of Pangea , the that vast unification of continents which may have increased competition between species without providing them adequate access to water resources.Foer says that Ervin comes to no final definite conclusion but rather presents the reader with the significant evidence in a most fascinating way.One thought which I think will come to the mind of many readers has to do with the fact of these great destructions. Obviously the forces involved are well- beyond anything even are present technologically advanced Civilization would be able to contend with.The two great 'kill-outs' suggest that we all have, not simply as individuals , but as community and species a 'dangling sword' above us which could surpisingly and suddenly fall and take with it all that is dear.This in itself is a horrifying and humbling thought.For those of us who do have a faith in a personal God, I suppose this may prompt us to an intensification of our prayer for a kind of Divine Mercy beyond our understanding."},{"Title":"Extinction: How Life on Earth Nearly Ended 250 Million Years Ago","review":"It is always gratifying to see popular books about science get rave reviews because we scientists benefit from public enthusiasm about what we do. Erwin has a chatty and disarming style that is a joy to read. Unfortunately, it is a public disservice to distort reality as Erwin has done in this book. In depicting his role in the whodunit, Erwin has liberally embellished his own contributions and those of his colleagues. After proclaiming for years that the extinction was unrelated to the Siberian volcanism, this book now implies that such a relationship was his idea. The whitewashing treatment of his team's blunder in misdating the extinction and related events is worthy of the most guileful politician explaining away some scandalous act.As long as you don't mind the plethora of factual errors and self-promotional aspects, it is a fine book.

Moreover, since the truly remarkable work of his colleagues and him has not provided the answer, we will never know just how it happened.Irwin likewise concludes that the greatest extinction of all time was quite irrelevant and had no effect on evolutionary patterns that followed.

The sky may or may not be falling, but it's happened before."},{"Title":"Extinction: How Life on Earth Nearly Ended 250 Million Years Ago","review":"In Kentucky, there's a museum with a lifesize model of a dinosaur with a saddle on it. This is a hymn in fiberglass to young Earth creationism, the idea that the Universe was created about 6,000 years ago.It costs $1,500 to become a charter member (family rate) of this museum. A much better investment would be $24.95 for Douglas Erwin's thriller about the Permian extinction.More than nine-tenths of all species died out 251 million years ago. Erwin, a researcher with the Smithsonian Institution's National Museum of Natural History and the Santa Fe Institute, finds the end-Permian \\"enigma far more compelling than the end of the dinosaurs,\\" a relatively minor event from 65 million years ago.For an event that Kentuckians think never happened, the end-Permian event left a lot of debris, of which the most interesting is in China. Until 20 years ago, the paleontological record there was unknown to the outside world.What the evidence is telling us is difficult to say. Erwin says \\"Extinction\\" was \\"frankly written as a mystery story.\\" In this one, the clever detective does not wrap up all the loose ends on the last page.Instead, we learn that there are at least seven major theories of what might have happened. These range from a big meteorite to gigantic volcanic eruptions in Siberia to a climatic or biological or geological change that drove oxygen out of the oceans.The first chapters set the stage. Life was very different in the Permian. There were reefs in warm oceans, and they contained corals, but the corals were only distantly related to those of today and they were not as important as crinoids and lampshells, animals that still exist in out-of-the-way places.On land, flowering plants had not yet evolved, nor mammals, dinosaurs or saddles. In South Africa's Karoo basin, fossils remain of a fabulous, lost fauna.There were widespread extinctions on land as well as in the sea during the end-Permian event, but it is hard to say whether the land extinction was as complete as in the sea, where 94 percent of species disappeared in a short time. Erwin's team and their Chinese collaborators have found evidence that it all happened in less than 160,000 years -- maybe a lot less.It is also not proved that the big land extinction exactly coincided with the sea kill, but it seems likely. The land kill was a whopper, too. This was apparently the only time in history when a mass extinction had any real impact on insects.Whatever the cause, it did set up the modern world. \\"Mass extinction is a powerful creative force,\\" says Erwin.Or did it? As they learn more and more of the details, scientists are also learning to question the easy assumptions of more innocent decades.Evolutionary biologists are vigorously debating whether the animals and plants that dominated the Permian were already being outcompeted by the early forerunners of modern flora and fauna, or whether they would have maintained their control of resources.Erwin, splendidly agnostic about this and other debates, lays out the questions but leaves the resolution for some other time. Perhaps not too far in the future. He notes that his 1993 book on the Permian extinction already is out of date in many ways.In fact, after decades researching the extinction itself, he has now concluded that \\"understanding the recovery from the extinction poses a far greater intellectual challenge.\\""},{"Title":"Extinction: How Life on Earth Nearly Ended 250 Million Years Ago","review":"Any scientist who opens [and closes!] a book by saying \\"We [I] don't know!\\" is worthy of your attention and respect. Too many others have taken up a theme and defended against all comers. Erwin's examination of the catastrophic close of the Permian Age is complete, admirably researched and exquisitely written. Within its pages, this work examines the various ideas on the massive loss of life 250 million years ago. These days, not to have heard of an meteor's killing off the dinosaurs 65 million years ago suggests you've lived hidden in a cave for a generation. Erwin opens with a brief overview of that event, reminding us that extinctions, particularly \\"impact events\\", have loomed large in discussions of the history of life ever since Walter and Luis Alvarez proposed the idea.It's easy to rattle off the numbers: when the dinosaurs \\"went West\\", perhaps 75% of life was also extinguished. When the Permian ended, over 95% of living things disappeared. Erwin asks: \\"How do we know this? What life forms disappeared? Did they all go at the same time? How long did it take to recover?\\" Most important, of course, \\"What killed them off?\\" Instead of dull statistics, Erwin asks the important questions. Acknowledging that \\"Triassic rocks are boring\\", he explains why this is so. Fossils are scarce is the obvious answer, but why they are missing is his quest. With most of his attention focussed on ocean life, he details what causes shifts in benthic populations. The seas rise and fall - for a variety of reasons. Glaciation takes up sea water and leaves continental shelves high and dry. Oceans need to \\"turn over\\" an oxygen supply. What is the result of that failing? Carbon, with its various isotopes, passes through life selectively. Tracing that path provides insights into where it's been - and where not. When did the Siberian \\"traps\\" form? How much lava spewed from that rift, and what other products did it bring along or destroy? Finally, is there evidence that Earth was pelted by another bolide to provide an easy answer to all those questions? That reply is almost surely negative.Erwin would like to couch this narrative as a detective story, but it doesn't really work. There are too many victims - unless you count life as one entity. There is also a phalanx of detectives all trying assiduously to solve the case. If you thought there were too many cooks spoiling the broth, wait until you meet this mob. Nearly all of them have an agenda and they have a disturbing tendency to trumpet a single tune. Erwin should have portrayed them as an orchestra, with himself as conductor. Van Kariajan would go emerald with envy. Each investigator supplies a theme, striving for a solo performance. Erwin cautiously assesses the tune, fits it nicely into a grander theme and produces a symphony instead of a cacophony. It's quite a performance. To keep himself from the sin of hubris, he points out his own flaws in a previous effort. The strain wasn't discordant, but the composition needed refinement.Erwin fastidiously acknowledges his contributors. Jack Sepkowski comes in for deserved accolades, as do Bruce Rubridge, Yugan Jin and many others. Their methods, results and further work - including that incomplete but \\"promised\\" - are given a full hearing. Even those whose suggestions are highly suspicious, such as Luann Becker's Bedout \\"crater\\" are given a respectful hearing. Nobody's work is chastised or rejected. \\"We need more investigation\\" is the running theme of Erwin's account. The reason the ongoing search is important lies in understanding what is happening around us today. Are we, in Dave Sepkowski's words a \\"Dead Clade Walking\\"? Or can we glean enough information from the rocks to find the means to succeed through the extinction we seem to be part of - and likely creating? The \\"95%\\" means life had to restart the clock after the Permian. There were a few \\"Lazarus species\\" that re-emerged after the cataclysm. Will the human species manage to revive itself when so much life around us has been decimated? No more pertinent question confronts us.

When I was a kid, the dinosaur extinction was a big mystery, but there has been good evidence, now broadly accepted, that 65 million years ago a meteor as big as a mountain smashed into the Yucatan, turning everything for miles around into ash, wrapping the world in a cloud, and blocking the sunlight that runs all life. Everything all over the world changed, and we mammals got our try at reproductive success. The horrendous extinction that ended the Cretaceous age, however, wasn't the worst our old Earth had seen. 250 million years ago, there was an extinction that ended the Permian and began the Triassic periods (which is also the border between the larger, more general Paleozoic and Mesozoic eras). This Permo-Triassic event extinguished around 95 percent of all living species, and was as close as we have ever come to having all life wiped out. In fact, in the 19th century, geologists thought that life had been wiped out and a separate creation had occurred to start the Triassic. What really happened, and how, are the subjects of _Extinction: How Life on Earth Nearly Ended 250 Million Years Ago_ (Princeton University Press) by Douglas H. Erwin, Senior Scientist and Curator of the Department of Paleobiology at the Smithsonian. He has made the end-Permian mass extinction his research interest for the past twenty years, and has traveled all over the world to the fossil beds and geologic boundary layers remaining from around the time of the catastrophe. Looking back so many millions of years ago is not easy, and the picture is not as clear as that of the dinosaur extinction. Erwin's book, however, is a fine demonstration of how geologists and paleobiologists have come to some admittedly limited understanding of what happened.There are many factors that have been suspects in the great killing, and Erwin likes to think of himself as a detective out of Agatha Christie set to finger the actual culprit. It's not that easy, of course. Catastrophic explanations for the end-Permian abound, and Erwin's book is an examination of the more likely causes, about six of them. Of course, a main one, borrowing from the success of the impact explanation of 65 million years ago, is an extraterrestrial impact. It is certainly a plausible explanation, since it is accepted as the cause of the more recent extinction. There are problems, however. The impact that wiped out the dinosaurs left clues like an iridium layer in geological strata (there is lots of iridium in meteorites, not so much on Earth) and \\"shocked quartz\\" impact crystals, but such clues are lacking for the earlier event. Another explanation might be volcanism, resulting in dust and acidic chemicals and basalts that cover a countryside \\"much as honey fills in the roughness of an English muffin.\\" Yet another is that continental drift (plate tectonics) was causing collisions at the time, forcing species that had not previously met each other to compete, and changing the global climate by newly formed landmasses. Vast glaciation may have caused cooling and a decrease in sea level. Perhaps there was a drop in oxygen levels of the oceans. Maybe sea levels dropped and caused a huge release of methane from sediments.He has not, however, wrapped everything up, as, say, Hercule Poirot might. He does, indeed, call his own proposal at explanation the _Murder on the Orient Express_ hypothesis, based on Agatha Christie's book which is a who-didn't-do-it rather than a whodunit. The explanation calls on aspects of many of the other explanations, but Erwin admits this makes it hard to test. One of his colleagues had dubbed it \\"Erwin's kitchen sink hypothesis\\", and, as Erwin says, was not being complimentary. There are implications for our own times in this story, since we are now in another period of great extinctions and our climate may be changing irrevocably, but Erwin does not stress these. His book is a fine summary of current thinking on the extinction. Readers will come up against sentences like, \\"Some surviving ammonoids with extreme morphology died out in the Griesbachian, but new Dienerian ammonoids were more similar to the norm...\\" (all the terms are well explained, but will be new to most readers), but then a few pages later readers will learn that the \\"quality of many Early Triassic fossils is really pretty lousy.\\" There may be fewer hard answers here than in a murder mystery, but the explanations about how scientists came up with ideas about the extinction make this a fascinating look at experts confronting profound and distant mysteries."},{"Title":"Extinction: How Life on Earth Nearly Ended 250 Million Years Ago","review":"Some months ago, I read (and reviewed) the book Mass Extinctions by Hallam and Wignall (whose names appear frequently in Erwin's book). I had difficulty with that book because it had a lot of technical terms with which I wasn't familiar. When I learned of Erwin's book, which deals with only one of the major extinctions, I thought it would be helpful because it wouldn't cover as many different topics all in the same place. It turned out to be even easier than I expected, because Extinction was written for non-scientists. Anyone who is interested in mass extinctions should be able to read it.While I was disappointed at first, Erwin used a method that made the book worth reading for me: he gradually introduced enough technical concepts to explain how the scientists are examining the evidence. It is gradual enough for most readers to absorb the material as they go along.For example, the division of time in which the extinction occurred is called the Permian period. This has two subdivisions of interest here, called the Guadalupian and Lopingian epochs, and there was really one extinction in each. One occurred in the subdivision of the Guadalupian epoch called the Capitanian stage, and the other occurred in the Chinghsingian stage of the Lopingian. By the time you get to the post-extinction recovery, near the end of the book, there are even subdivisions of the stages. This kind of thng made Hallam and Wignall hard reading but, as I said, Erwin introduces them gradually. In the early part of the book, he just calls the extinctions the first and the second; by the time you get to substages, you'll be ready for them. Also, Erwin has charts of the time periods. I recommend you keep a bookmark at each chart. This is just one example of how he introduces technical matters gradually.Another thing that threw me with Hallam and Wignall was the consideration of ratios of carbon isotopes. Erwin gives a much longer and clearer discussion. But it is still necessary to read carefully. At one point he says that an increase in delta-13-C indicates more inorganic carbon, but shortly later he says that an increase indicates that more organic carbon is being deposited. Keep in mind that the first refers to carbon in the seawater and the latter is carbon in organic sediment. The carbon in limestone deposits isn't affected by life processes and so the carbon isotope ratio matches that of the seawater. Since limestone is carbonate, this explains his later distinction between carbonate and organic carbon. This is the only spot in the book where I had to work hard at understanding. If my discussion looks too technical, remember that Erwin spreads it out over a few pages.Other reviews pretty much describe the contents, so I'll skip those details. If you're looking for an introduction to the causes of extinctions, I recommend this book. If you already know something about delta-13-C, marine anoxia, et al. and you're looking for a systematic, technical treatment, consider the Hallam and Wignall book. Click above on \\"See all my reviews\\"; it's low on the third page, with only Hallam's name. If you finish Erwin's book and feel you want more, Hallam and Wignall might be right for you.[Added 4 July 2006] I have just finished rereading Hallam and Wignall's book. With the knowledge gained from Erwin, and from my first reading of H & W, I found it much more readable. I still recommend Erwin for readers without some background in the field, but I am even more convinced that many who have read Erwin will like H & W.[Added 31 Jan 2007] I just noticed that I didn't say anything about evolution, even though my main interest in extinction is in its influence on evolution. In the wake of the Permian extinction, after a period of slow recovery, there was a period of very rapid diversification (i.e. evolution) during which total diversity reached the level it would probably been at if the extinction hadn't happened. But the particular forms were very different from those before the extinction. Other authors have called this period the birth of the modern sorld."},{"Title":"Extinction: How Life on Earth Nearly Ended 250 Million Years Ago","review":"Educated as a geologist, I have read extensively on the issue of mass extinctions and am familiar with the many arguments about the ambiguities of just what happened at the end of the Permian. Taken in by the title of the book, I hoped to get better educated on what the leading hypotheses are. I did get that from this book but was ultimately disappointed that Erwin would not plant a flag in the ground about how HE really felt about this issue.In that respect, the sub-title is misleading. Instead of \\"How Life on Earth Nearly Ended 250 Million Years Ago\\", it should have said \\"Ideas about How Life on Earth Nearly Ended 250 Million Years Ago\\".Erwin also does not go into some of the more intriguing concepts bandied about regarding the recovery from that extinction. For instance, why is it that the major reptilian group to emerge from the event, the dinosaurs, were so efficient at using oxygen? Evolutionary pressures driven by an extended period of low atmospheric oxygen favored them it seems - yet he does not really discuss this aspect at all.I was very impressed with how Erwin brought together the details of the work now being done at the Permian Triassic boundary but I did not find the book very satisfying from the larger perspective."},{"Title":"Extinction: How Life on Earth Nearly Ended 250 Million Years Ago","review":"Reading this book gave me the same sort of headache that reading Paul Gallico's THE POSEIDON ADVENTURE did -- I kept stumbling and wincing over badly puncutated sentences, mis-applied terminology, and a host of other stylistic and grammatical problems probably due to the fact that instead of properly proofreading this first edition work, somebody relied on a spell-checker to do the whole job and ignored everything else. That said, however, like THE POSEIDON ADVENTURE as well as Gallico's other work -- and like the work of Ceremonial Magickian Aleister Crowley, essentially an engineer writing for other engineers who would be able to fill in the blanks and make mental corrections of technical boo-boss as needed, not for a public who neither know nor care about the nuts and bolts of the Magickal aspects of reality -- I couldn't put the damned thing down. Like Gallico, Erwin has a powerful sense of story, far and away THE essential ingredient of a great literary work, and what is paleontology all about, anyway, but the study of the long, long story of Earthly life? He also has just as powerful a sens of humor, as well. And his analysis of the problem and possible avenues to its ultimate solution -- an understanding of what caused the End-Permian catastrophe -- is meticulous, painstaking, and fascinating. A wonderful read. I hope that by the time the paperback version comes out the editorial problems will have been corrected -- but even if not, I'll buy it anyway. This is a must for the library of anyone who has any interest at all in the history of living creatures, their tenure on Earth, and what their story has to tell us about our own probable futures.

You may get a lot more people thinking."},{"Title":"Extinction: How Life on Earth Nearly Ended 250 Million Years Ago","review":"This book reads like a murder mystery, with the victim being 95% of all marine life and 70% of terrestrial vertebrates species. This crime, the Permian Extinction, occurred over 250 million years ago but still has not been solved. The author Douglas Erwin, a paleobiologist who has been working on the extinction for the past few decades, identifies identifies possible culprits and the known evidence, but ultimately comes to no conclusion. This makes the book both exciting and fresh (even three years after its initial publication).Erwin names six possible culprits to the extinction:1) a meteor/comet impact, similar to the one that killed the dinosaurs;2) climatic changes from massive volcanic flood basalts in Siberia;3) invasion of invasive species following the creation of the supercontinent Pangea;4) glaciations causing global cooling and a fall in sea level;5) disappearance of oxygen from the oceans (anoxia); and6) a combination of the above.Because the extinction happened so quickly (estimated less than 160,000 years), he suggests that explanation 3, 4, and 6 are less likely. He also isn't convinced by the evidence of a large meteor impact (1) around this time. Furthermore, explanation 5 does not account for the extinctions on land. Thus, the book tentatively concludes that the volcanic flood basalts seem to have played the largest role in the extinction, perhaps by causing runaway global warming.This is a science book, not a book about the scientists. Too many popular books about paleontology, especially those written by journalists, seem to focus on the scientists themselves rather than the actual science. Fortunately, Erwin goes deep into the scientific evidence and presents detailed arguments for each explanation.Perhaps more important than the hard scientific evidence (which may well become outdated by the time you read the book, if it hasn't already), Erwin does a magnificent job showing the process and reasoning that goes into collecting and interpreting the evidence. Rather than state his interpretation of the evidence, Erwin takes the reader through the existing evidence and the questions or concerns he has with it. Most of the book consists of his summary of paleobiologists' toolkit and the research on the Permian extinction. He only brings the evidence together to discuss the potential culprits in the last few chapters. However, by writing the book this way, the reader is able to assess the evidence for himself.Erwin's style also encourages readers to keep a healthy sense of doubt, especially since more than once he admits his past positions on the extinction were probably wrong. In fact, he does suggest that more evidence regarding a meteor impact has recently emerged and may contradict his \\"preferred\\" theory.Overall this is a very interesting book, but is a long read, especially for those readers who - like me - have no formal training in paleontology or geology. However, the books provides a great science education for those willing to put in the time."},{"Title":"Extinction: How Life on Earth Nearly Ended 250 Million Years Ago","review":"This book is a reappraisal of his previous book on the same subject \\"The Great Paleozoic crisis\\". That was a good book, scientifically rigorous, but also a hard slog to read. This one keeps the same careful approach, and improves on its ancestor in two ways.

Secondly he tries to make it more accessible with a few more personal anecdotes. It still isn't an easy read, but definitely a worthwhile account of a subject that is often lost amongst the attention given to dinosaurs and their spectacular extinction."},{"Title":"Extinction: How Life on Earth Nearly Ended 250 Million Years Ago","review":"I found this book very easy to read.

It arrived a few days later.First of all, many many kudos on this WONDERFUL book! It makes it easy, simple, exciting and inspiring for a 50 year old to learn to embroider, so I can only imagine that a kid would really love it, too.However, when I actually commenced to using the items from the kit part of the book, they failed miserably. The tiny square cloth is so thin that when I ironed on the transfers, following the directions exactly, they went all the way through to the ironing board cover leaving a nice crisp impression there, but actually began bleeding and fading right before my eyes on the white cloth. In addition, the hoop itself doesn't work. The thumb screw is jammed and will not tighten nor loosen, but remains fixed in one position, and this was from the first moment of trying to use it. The cloth does not stay taut because of this.The other disappointment I had was where to store the transfers as I use them once since they give more than one impression. But that is minor compared to my disappointment with the hoop and the cloth.This really is an EXCELLENT book for introducing a kid or adult to Simple Embroidery, but the Klutz Company went far too cheap on the materials in the kit part. As an adult, I was disappointed. As a kid, I would have been devastated, I am sure.I have sent an email to the Klutz Company asking them to rethink using better materials for the kit part of the book. I would ship mine back for a refund, but unfortunately, I have altered the book by adding an envelope to store the transfers in and cutting off the piece with the box of materials so that it would be easier to refer to while learning each stitch. I did this prior to using the iron on transfers, cloth, and hoop. Therefore, I am sure that Amazon would not refund my money on this book. And it's not the book that I have any problems with--just the materials in the kit.As an artist, I have plans to open an art gallery and gift store in 2 years, and had hoped to carry Klutz products so that the kids will have exciting ways to experience various arts and crafts. But this experience with vastly inferior materials is causing me to reconsider the Klutz products. Still, their books ARE really awesome.

The instructions are very easy to follow as well the diagrams in the book. The hoop and needles are fine specially the hoop, which I liked and use for other projects. The practice piece of fabric is kind of thin, so maybe there could be some improvement there, as for the floss is alright. Once you get the hang of it you can buy your own materials, which are very afordable. The patterns are cute and practical for kids (the book is target to kids) and for an adult beginner since they are not complicated.There are additional pictures on how you could use or apply the stitches learned. This book will be a great starting book for beginners !!!"},{"Title":"Simple Embroidery (Klutz)","review":"I can get \\"beginner knowledge\\" in several places online, and in books I already own. I bought the book mostly for the iron on transfers that were included. The back & front cover photographs showed lots of darling designs on the child-models'clothes. Only a few patterns were included in this book, which I feel was deceptive of the publisher."},{"Title":"Kamikaze Lust","review":"It seems as though it's either one extreme or the other with this book, and I am one of those who didn't like it at all. If Sanders kept to one major plot instead of trying to develop three, it wouldn't be so bad. I think the author was trying to write a hip, cutting edge novel which got muddled down by trying to go in too many directions. I was bored by the time I was a quarter way through the novel and struggled to finish."},{"Title":"Kamikaze Lust","review":"I should have been suspicious since this book has hardly been reviewed in the press. After reading it, it's clear why it has been virtually ignored. In short, it is pure dreck. There is lots of sex but that does not make for a good book. The author fails to develop any of the characters, choosing to try to titillate readers rather than engage us emotionally."},{"Title":"Kamikaze Lust","review":"Lauren Sanders' first novel is terrific. Sanders writes very,very well and she weaves a story that is sexy, disturbing and, atpoints, laugh out loud funny. Once I got to the middle of the book I kept finding excuses to put the rest of my life on hold so I could stay in my chair and keep reading. This is a serious book about serious things that does not preach but, rather, gets its point across while entertaining the reader to no end. Now THAT is refreshing. I, for one, can't wait to read her next book. Sanders is a writer to cheer about. A good book."},{"Title":"Kamikaze Lust","review":"I have read and enjoyed other Akashic titles but this book was a disappointment. Is Kamikaze Lust a trashy novel on the pornography industry? Or is it a love story between two women? Sanders can't decide, making for an unfulfilling, disjointed mess. It's too bad because Sanders has a flair for dialogue and description. Better luck next time."},{"Title":"Kamikaze Lust","review":"I am quite surprised to see so many negative reviews of this book. I think they come from those for whom terms like \\"pussy\\" and \\"anal sex\\" are shocking. They see these words and think the author is going for shock value.But for many of us, these terms are not shocking. Sex in all of its forms rolls with and influences the ebbs and tides of existence, and can be talked about in any and every way without being \\"shocking\\".Thus, Kamikaze Lust revisits the relationship between the feelings of erotic attraction and feelings of mortal dread (fear of death). On one level it simply draws a parallel, a sort of yin-yang of sex and death. A young woman dabbles with getting her feet (and other things) wet as a porn actress, and at the same time she's thinking over helping her terminally ill aunt die.Yet somehow this is still a quaint, almost homey, fairy-tale of a novel. It is like something Hermann Hesse would have written as a young man. Rachel (protagonist) experiments with both lesbian sex, and for her, yet unexplored types of heterosexual sex. In both cases, the scenes carry a wistful, wandering feeling. The character is venturing into the unknown and the prose confers this to the reader.Kamikaze Lust is neither a gay/lesbian \\"coming out\\" story, nor a preachy \\"feminist\\" novel. It is the story of someone lost in the ocean of emotions, an existential story where a young woman who does not take the value of anything at first glance struggles to make what is temporary mean something. It's also about how she keeps her sanity when confronting the things in life so many see as either naturally horrible or horribly natural. In the end, Rachel seems to discover sex and death are both. How she makes this discovery is worth reading the book for."},{"Title":"Kamikaze Lust","review":"Kamikaze Lust rates at the bottom of the list of all books I have read. That is not to say that it doesn't have a few redeeming features: the story line is unique, the characters could be interesting, and Sanders appears to have a sense of humor. However, she does almost nothing to produce an interesting novel from those features.The development of her characters is extremely limited; it is almost as if we have to look at them as though we suffer from extreme myopia and tunnel vision. We learn little about them beyond the fact that they have limited working vocabularies, with most of their words learned in the gutter.Sanders squanders about half of her book on what she supposes will be titillating bedroom scenes; in reality, that half of the book is about as arousing as a medical textbook. It is the sort of writing a twelve-year-old kid would read in the dark recesses of a library's open stacks or behind the sofa at home. Does Sanders not know that excitement in writing requires stimulating the imagination of the reader? In these parts of the book she leaves nothing to the imagination, essentially saying, \\"Here's your manual for this particular form of sex play: Step 1..., Step 2..., etc.\\"The only chapter in the book that has literary value is the final one. Finally, we get some insight on a couple of the characters (other than that they can or cannot successfully do heavy breathing). Interestingly, this is the only chapter in which Sanders does not attempt to be arousing.The book received the 2000 Lambda Literary Award...utterly amazing! The gay/lesbian community is blessed with an amazing array of highly talented, sensitive, fun loving, eloquent people. Is this amateur effort really worthy of award from them? Are they giving out the award based simply on the number of pages in which one or more characters demonstrate that they may not be totally straight? To my knowledge, I have never before read a Lambda winner, but I would certainly have expected to find the winner at the opposite end of the literary scale!I believe that Sanders is a frustrated new age \\"feminist.\\" I put the word feminist in quotes because she does not represent to me what a feminist really is; only what some people think that they should be. To Sanders, it seems that a feminist must exhibit as many anti-establishment characteristics as possible (since by their definition the establishment is male dominated). So, she goes out of her way to write in a non-traditional way: her writing must be crude, it must be explicit, and it must have all of the worthy characters be female and all of the unworthy characters be male (unless those males happen to be gay...she introduced some very appealing gay characters, but utterly failed to develop them). In my opinion, this book does nothing for the feminist movement or the gay/lesbian community, or for that matter, Sanders herself."},{"Title":"Kamikaze Lust","review":"This book is incredible. I kept reading and reading, loving Sanders' great dialogue, vivid descriptions and great sex scenes. The Thanksgiving scene is a classic, and the book is sexy and smart at the same time, a rarity these days. It covers such wide topics as family, love, work and death. Reading this made me wish I could meet the author and find out where she gets her ideas from, they are so imaginative. I am giving this book to all my friends as a gift and also recommending it to my book club."},{"Title":"Kamikaze Lust","review":"What a compelling read. Emotionally intense, culturally relevant, and deeply and seamlessy driven by its rich characters. Reading this book reminded me of Rick Moody's Ice Storm--so sad at times I wanted to throw it across the room yet too engaging to put down until the end. This is an ambitious and often lonely ride through mainstream media and hardore pornography, a quest for love and identity, and yes, the heartbreaking fragility of one typically eerie nuclear family. Sanders has the heart and stomach to pull it all off and the sharp mind to tie it all together. I look forward to reading more of her work."},{"Title":"Kamikaze Lust","review":"This first novel is hip, sexy and daring, blending such seemingly disparate elements as the porn industry, assisted suicide and the quest for a fulfilling relationship into a seamless whole. Though the book has a lot of sexual elements, it's more about the need to be loved. Sanders is an Erica Jong for the new Millenium."},{"Title":"Kamikaze Lust","review":"I really didn't like the book, it did not have my attention and by the last half of the first chapter I was bored. I wouldn't recommend this book as a remainder. It would be best to use this book as a door stopper."},{"Title":"Kamikaze Lust","review":"That's really all I can say. I'm stunned that something so amateurish found its way to the printing press!"},{"Title":"Kamikaze Lust","review":"The scenes on the porno set read like some bored housewife's fantasy. I kept rereading them and laughing my head off. The book is awful, only worth buying for a laugh."},{"Title":"Kamikaze Lust","review":"After reading Sanders' first novel, I am convinced she is going to be big. Her use of language is brilliant and her building of a sexy yet poignant plot leads to a compelling conclusion. I could not put this book down! Be prepared for a wild ride - sex, pornography and death all make this one hell of a read."},{"Title":"Kamikaze Lust","review":"Great work. I heard Lauren Read at City College and she just rocks! I was waiting for the publication of this book for a long time. It's funny, smart, sexy, and very literate. Really great. She is bound to go down with the likes of Duras, Rhys, Cisneros, with a hell of a lot more wit."},{"Title":"Kamikaze Lust","review":"Unlike the above reviewer, I read the whole book. Ms. Sanders has a keen sense of humor, quirky surprises and a sparkling use of language to carry us through the unusual and challenging situations in her novel. The characters are well constructed and complex, and tremendously interesting. The erotic content is hot and delightfully twisted. I loved this book."},{"Title":"Kamikaze Lust","review":"How refreshing it is to read a novel that is a novel and not some feeble attempt at a thinly veiled memoir. Sanders creates characters that make me love, that make me squirm, and that make me feel something profound. This book took me on a rollercoaster ride; it was thrilling, it was scary, and it brought my heart right up to my mouth. Once the book came to an end, I took a breath, I placed it by my nightstand, and yes it's calling to me to read it again. If you want something skillful and intelligent buy this book."},{"Title":"Kamikaze Lust","review":"Although Sanders can put a sentence together just fine, this novel never gets off the ground. It's totally glib and soulless and flat... I couldn't connect to any of the characters, got very annoyed at the self-conscious prose and irritating narrator, gave it a hundred pages and gave up."},{"Title":"Making of Star Trek Deep Space Nine","review":"A monster of a book, like a phone book and worth it. It illustrates and comments extensively on the progressive designs of the station, the evolution of the crew, the preparation of the story and the SFX. Every little detail, enhanced with B&amp;W and colour photos, excerpts from draft and final scripts -- this is more than piddly interviews with the cast and a few expos arguments. This covers DS9 from start to..well, not finish, but it's one heck of a start, and well worth it to pick it up if you're a DS9 fan. It's extremely fun."},{"Title":"The Dwarf and the Demon Tongue","review":"When I started this ebook, the story of Willum Proud, I was a little apprehensive since I wasn't really a fantasy fan. The story immediately sucked me inside, though, and I couldn't stop reading. It was like I was right there beside Willum during all the fights, chases and adventures. What a rush - the story ended much too soon! Jones' masterful storytelling ability took me on a wild ride from the depths of the Delven mines through worlds I couldn't have imagined on my own. This is a great read for any action/adventure fan, and the fantasy elements make it all the more magical!"},{"Title":"The Dwarf and the Demon Tongue","review":"Ronald Wayne Jones weaves a fascinating fantasy filled with textured writing, fun artwork, and interesting characters. He's a voice to look for in the future."},{"Title":"The End of Software: Transforming Your Business for the On Demand Future","review":"Although titled The End of Software, the book really doesn't mean that. It's about outsourcing the IT function along the lines of EDS, IBM's Global Services, or Oracle On Demand. As president of Oracle On Demand, most of the busines stories concern successful contracts where Oracle On Demand has set up or replaced the IT department in a number of companies. What the title means is that the end user does not buy the software, he buys the service provided by that software. There's still an awful lot of software involved.There are clear advantages to this kind of outsourcing. The big outsourcing companies have exonomies of scale, they can buy dozens or thousands of computers, all just alike. This minimizes the maintenance effort, they can upgrade the software on all units cheaper than a company can do it on a few machines. It improves reliability, they can use this machine if that one is broken. They can fully understand the laws, such as the privacy laws relating to human resources information. And they have many other advantages.Unfortunately this does come with some disadvantages as well. For one thing, they use standardized software packages, if your application fits, that's great, otherwise, well....Then you have to be of the right size. Too small and they're not interested. Too large and you probably have your own legacy systems that switching off may lose you a lot of historical information.This is an interesting book, well worth reading if you are in the IT department of a middle sized business. It clearly explains the advantages of the outsourcing business model."},{"Title":"The End of Software: Transforming Your Business for the On Demand Future","review":"While there are strong arguments in favor of the software on demand model of usage and Dr. Chou makes most of them, he also sometimes descends into a rambling state. There is some repetition and some irrelevancies; my estimate is that ten percent of the material could have been left out. Dr. Chou is the president of Oracle on Demand, so of course he has a vested interest in praising the software on demand model. Nevertheless, he does a reasonably good job of keeping his prose from reaching the level of evangelisms.The software on demand model is one where the user essentially rents the software on an on-demand basis. When needed, the latest version is either downloaded or run directly on a server. The primary advantage is one of remaining current. The present situation regarding regular security patches is only marginally viable. Nearly all system managers live in fear of failures whenever a new service pack or patch is installed. The recent situation with the latest Microsoft XP service pack is a case in point. When a vendor has to include a list of all the applications that will fail after the service pack is installed and how to get them functional again, then there is a major problem. If the software runs on the vendor's server, then this problem is alleviated.This will also prevent the current problems with unpatched systems. IT people are generally swamped and the fear of crashes after installing a patch is one of the primary reasons why patches are not applied. Many of the recent systemic viral/worm attacks occurred well after a patch that could prevent it was available.Of course, there are problems with the distributed computing model. It will require that all vendors have bulletproof servers and connections. It would only take a small amount of downtime or a major security breach to convince many customers that they prefer to have the software on their machines. Also, the current model forces application developers to create significant upgrades. For if they don't, users will continue to use the older versions and the revenue stream will dry up. Therefore, if an oligarchy or monopoly were to develop, innovation could suffer. Finally, since the models for on demand software are not yet clearly delineated, no one knows how providers will interact with their customers. Many people have doubts about how this will work, and the recording industry has recently engaged in some disturbing legal actions. These actions could be unique to the recording industry or a precursor to how the on demand world would function. While Chou does mention some of these problems, they are not delved into in great detail, which is a weakness of the book.If you are someone whose portfolio includes the planning of organizational software usage, then you should read this book. The strengths outnumber the weaknesses, so if you read it keeping the perspective of the author in mind, then you will learn the most significant aspects of a new way of \\"consuming\\" software."},{"Title":"The End of Software: Transforming Your Business for the On Demand Future","review":"Directed at a nontechnical reader, Chou suggests why a radical turn towards a new model of on demand software might help your company. He cites the massive cost that companies already pay, in maintaining software. From annual licensing fees to the cost of sysadmins to manually install patches and upgrades. Chou points out, as have others, that the Total Cost of Ownership can be several multiples of an initial outlay.Therefore, his branch of Oracle advocates a utility-like approach. You buy capacity on an as-needed basis. There are possible trends, like an increased automation of patches and upgrades, that aid his case.Left unsaid in all this is how Oracle is playing catchup. For example, IBM has devoted massive resources in this field, under such names as Globus, utility, grid, autonomous and on-demand computing. This book is rather skimpy. Apart from general statements, I kept searching in it for more details. A far more substantial book is \\"On Demand Computing\\" by Fellenstein (IBM Press). You may want to check that book instead."},{"Title":"The End of Software: Transforming Your Business for the On Demand Future","review":"The End of Software is a well written book about the opportunities and challenges of Software as a Service (SaaS). Not only does it go over key concepts, but it illuminates these with apt examples.Software as a Service has tremendous potential and this book explains why.The book focuses definitely more on the benefits of SaaS and does not cover some of the challenges that SaaS has, e.g. usability, service integration and others. HTML is very good for several scenarios, but it does fall short in some areas and simply should not be used. But today with Flash/Flex and Silverlight there are solutions that address several of these short comings in the usability area. Similarly, integration products make it easier to integrate SaaS solutions with on-premises software, so the barriers for getting more SaaS solutions to the market are getting less and less.For anyone getting a good grounding on SaaS I can definitely recommend this book."},{"Title":"Popout-Popout Zurich, Switzerland (Popout Maps Double)","review":"This entire line of maps are perfect for navigating through cities while traveling.

The first being Mr. Mitrione's account of seeing the poster of Joan Butler and how it led to the writing of this book. From there the reader gets a horrifying glimpse into the mind of a cold blooded killer, but also gains an appreciation for the dedication of the law enforcement officers who brought him to justice, largely on circumstantial evidence. Most importantly, Mr. Mitrione makes us feel the pain of loss of the families of the missing girls and the agony of never being able to lay them to rest. I know that I will be much more careful after reading this book."},{"Title":"Suddenly Gone: The Kansas Murders of Serial Killer Richard Grissom","review":"My Aunt was one of the women this book was written about. For the people who feel the women weren't \\"honored\\" or the families were intruded on, they are misinformed or just ignorant. Mr. Mitrione was respectful and showed great concern to try to get details correct for our family's sake. For those who feel he just got too close to the families involved to write an objective book, that's your opinion. I have to disagree. I feel this was an important piece needed to bring a personal side to this cold, senseless crime.Thank you Mr. Mitrione for acknowledging our pain and feelings. We miss Theresa every day."},{"Title":"Suddenly Gone: The Kansas Murders of Serial Killer Richard Grissom","review":"Overall this book is ok reading. The beginning starts out talking about the first murders and the reading is very interesting, but as the book progressed, there were spots in the book that were so long and boring. For the most part, the boring parts talked about how the police weren't able to find any evidence or what had to be done in order to find the evidence. I guess the book wasn't made to be extremely interesting in the first place. It was made to tell the stories of the murdered girls in Kansas and show the loss of their families. Other than those boring spots, the book was actually quite good. The author was very descriptive and always gave a good sense of what was going on. I beleive that this author told the story of what happened to these four girls really well. I give a lot of credit to Dan Mitrione for taking on this project and going through all of the trouble of interviewing all of the people involved with this case to accurately tell his story."},{"Title":"Suddenly Gone: The Kansas Murders of Serial Killer Richard Grissom","review":"I have read the commments on this book and I disagree. I found it easy fast-paced reading, not confusing or boring."},{"Title":"Suddenly Gone: The Kansas Murders of Serial Killer Richard Grissom","review":"This is a top true crime book. Five stars.The eight prior posted criticisms, made over nearly six years, are, in my view, inconsistent. The previous reviewers stated reasons for complaint do not go to the merits of this very good read.The first poster on 3 January 2000 explained that this is a compelling read, then rated the book at one star complaining that the author became too close to the crime victim's families. The key part of the review is that this book is a \\"compelling read,\\" because that is what readers seek.That reviewer's complaint that the writer felt a great deal of empathy for the victims may say something about the status of the reviewer's emotional intelligence, but does not address how that makes this a bad book. Others may find the author's empathy for the victim's to be positive.The first poster also complained that the book lacked details, then the second poster praised the book's \\"detailed job\\" in telling this tragic story. This book is detail rich.The third poster explained that this book changed his or her life because the poster will be much more careful from now on, but then rated the book at only three stars. Rating a life changing book at three stars makes one wonder about how the poster rates less influential books. Three stars may be this person's top rating.The fourth poster complained that she or he was bored by reading about the detective work. The poster was specific about what was boring: what the police did in order to find evidence. Because detective work IS the seeking of evidence, to criticize the author for writing about that means that the reviewer should have been reading in a different genre. True crime readers traditionally want to read of detective work.The fifth poster complained that the killer was not \\"linked\\" to the first murder victim discussed in the book. The reviewer apparently did not apprehend that the killer was a suspect in that woman's murder. Because the killer was not charged in that woman's murder -- no one was charged in that woman's murder -- does not mean that the killer was not linked to the woman. The killer WAS a suspect in that woman's murder. This was the first time the killer was a suspect in any murder. Including that information in the book made much more sense than excluding it.The sixth poster explained that he or she read a lot of the work of a DIFFERENT true crime author and was disappointed that this author does not write like that other author. To my view, because strawberry does not taste like orange does not make strawberry bad. Go ahead and read the orange author if she is your favorite, but other readers may prefer the strawberry author.The seventh poster wrote that \\"this story should have been told\\" but also wished that it had been written by a different author. Again, that does not go to the merits of this good book.The final prior poster complained that this was not the best book she or he ever read. For each of us there can be only one \\"best\\" book read, so that criticism is like saying your child's second best drawing is not her best drawing. That does not mean your child's second best drawing is bad.Also, readers interested in the BTK investigation will find this book fascinating. Detective Ken Landwehr is described as a trained profiler who investigated a 1989 Wichita murder in part by writing a profile of the killer. In 2004 Landwehr became head of the BTK Task Force, so according to author and former FBI agent Dan Mitrione, the BTK Task Force was headed by a long time profiler.Suddenly Gone is a good true crime book. If this is your genre, read it."},{"Title":"Suddenly Gone: The Kansas Murders of Serial Killer Richard Grissom","review":"This book is one of the best true crimes I've read.

The narrative is disjointed and hard to follow. There is very little information about the psychology of the killer. The writing is insulting to the reader - it almost seems as though the book was written for children. If you read a lot of true crime like I do (Ann Rule, etc.) then you probably won't enjoy this book - it is horrendous writing. However, this case of Richard Grissom, probably the most heinous murderer in the history of Kansas, deserves more attention."},{"Title":"Suddenly Gone: The Kansas Murders of Serial Killer Richard Grissom","review":"In the begining of the book, before the story even started it mentioned that several women's lives were ruined by this killer yet only 5 were actually mentioned with one not really being linked to Grissom. So who were the other two? But other than that, it was a good book. It could have delved more deeply into Grissom's childhood. There had to be more to him then just a bad seed. Was he made or born to be a killer? I feel bad for the poor women who had no idea that this predator was lurking in their neighborhood."},{"Title":"Suddenly Gone: The Kansas Murders of Serial Killer Richard Grissom","review":"This book compelled me to read it through, but I kept waiting for details.

Heaven knows I'm not perfect, but I wish they'd let a high-schooler edit the thing before they published it."},{"Title":"Suddenly Gone: The Kansas Murders of Serial Killer Richard Grissom","review":"To say that I am appalled at Mr. Mitrione's writing of this book, more specifically the book's subject matter, is an understatement. Having lived in South Florida during the time of Mitrione's employment as an FBI agent there, I am very familiar with his career and the circumstances which ended that career. It is chilling to contemplate how Mitrione researched this book by gaining information from the honest, hardworking investigators who were able to bring Grissom to justice. Even more disturbing is how Mitrione intruded into the lives and the pain of the victim's families. I agree that this story should have been told to honor the victims-especially the young women whose bodies were not recovered-their families, and the incredible dedication of the law enforcement officers. I am sorry that Mr. Mitrione was the one to tell it, and I am left wondering why he did."},{"Title":"Suddenly Gone: The Kansas Murders of Serial Killer Richard Grissom","review":"The book Suddenly Gone, was not the best I have read. I knew two of these girls and why Grissom wont give the families a chance to locate and burry the victims is beyond me. This case brought to life the Death Penalty in the state of KS. And if not for one mans driving force through it all its hard to say that Grissom would have been convicted. Thank you Paul Morrison, for caring so much for the girls and the families. I am from Overland Park Ks. and also know that Grissom most likely killed at least one other girl, Terri. Our town was in tears as the search continued for years. If you didn't live through that trial and feel first hand what went on you can't possibly know the effect it had and still has on many of the KCMO and KCK Overland Park and Olathe Ks areas. You are still loved and missed so very much.

I was disappointed.The book sets out a good case for index investing, specifically the use of ETFs'. For this the book must be commended. The author points out the shortcomings of a buy-and-hold strategy, as well as the pitfalls of active investment management, using traditional approaches. This sets the reader up to think there a panacea in store, which there is not.He specifically goes to length to tell the reader that picking stocks and timing markets are futile attempts at building a portfolio, and yet his solution for an indexed portfolio? Pick ETFs' and time markets, neatly disguised as \\"tactical asset allocation\\" and \\"stop loss\\" strategies.He states that strategic asset allocations are rigid, and therefore tactical asset allocations need to be applied, namely over/under weighting a portfolio according to what YOU think MIGHT happen in the market. This is nonsense. My research indicates that strategic asset allocations need not be rigid, and in fact I have found that by scientifically evaluating the strategic asset allocation periodically as much as 90 percent of a portfolio's expected return can be realised. No guesswork.Surely the author knows that guesswork is subject to being correct a large part of the time. In fact research indicates at leat 80 percent of the time to match the market, so I find it bizarre that the entire buildup is deflated by offering nothing more than tired, useless strategies. To wit, he suggests applying tactical asset allocations to take advantage of the January effect. Has he not heard of the efficient market theory which is a fundamental part of index investing?As for compiling a portfolio, he makes no mention of how this should be done, or explains modern portfolio theory. He indicates the futility of trying to find the next Microsoft, and yet shows how choosing the \\"right\\" indexes would yield higher returns than the market. A very confusing approach.As for risk management, he espouses the use of stop losses. How bizarre. This is a market timing technique that could lead to excessive trading costs, and leaves one in a dilemma as to when to re-enter the market. A far more prudent approach is what is known as value averaging. If a required return has been breached on the upside remove money from the market. On the down side reinvest the surplus money. This technique yields a significantly higher IRR than a buy-and-hold strategy.He proclaims that markets always move up in the long term. If you are Japanese I wonder how you feel about that.The author does offer insights in the form of indexing, ETFs', asset allocation, rebalancing and other tidbits, but the book does not deliver any \\"revolutionary\\" approaches. A pity since he is on the right track. The work is sorely lacking in research and new insights."},{"Title":"Strategic Index Investing","review":"This book will convert you from a traditional mutual fund investor immediately. Even if you currently own stocks you will find that investing in exchange-traded index funds makes more sense. The book describes in detail the reasons why a portfolio of ETFs is more cost effective, more tax efficient and much more flexible than other investments previously used. It is easy to read for anyone and describes how to implement strategies using ETFs to maximize your performance while minimizing your risk. I have over 20 years in the financial services industry and know too many people who try to pick stocks hoping to hit it big or mutual funds, only to find most don't outperform the indexes.

He examines the occupation through the eyes of all involved parties--from the soldiers and marines who serve there to the Iraqis whose country has fallen into complete chaos. Parenti takes us to the land where \\"the freedom\\" lays waste a country, and it's here, Parenti argues that we see \\"the Conradian end of the river where empire's lawless opportunities mix with personal madness to form a potent political and psychedelic cocktail.\\"In a sympathetic fashion, Parenti interviews several members of 3rd Battalion of the 124th Infantry--National Guardsmen from North Florida. When not on patrol, the guardsmen live in cramped quarters where the men suffer from water rationing, chronic boredom, and ever-delayed, morale-crushing departure dates.With his faithful and colourful translator, Akeel, Parenti makes several dangerous sorties into Iraq--beyond the fortified Green Zone (\\"a clean air-conditioned oasis\\") and talks to Iraqis who are willing to tell their stories. Some are victims of checkpoint incidents; others survive after their families are wiped out in incidents hurriedly covered up and termed 'mistakes'. And some Iraqis make the trip to Abu Gharib to see their incarcerated family members.Parenti also details the carpet-bagging atmosphere in Iraq--the ridiculous so-called 'reconstruction' that has escalated into a free-for-all. \\"The idea of American imperial beneficence and competence\\" in action is an opportunity to loot millions in reconstruction money. \\"Iraqi reconstruction is a racket\\", says Parenti as he describes the projects which, according to reconstruction companies, are underway, when in reality, the country is in ruins, and billions are 'missing'. \\"One 'repaired' school, for example was overflowing with raw sewage.\\" Parenti interviews many Iraqis who hated Saddam, but are dismayed, distraught, and angry at America's dismantling of their economic and civil structure. Billions earmarked for Iraq has ended up in the pockets of contractors--one of whom--Halliburton--Parenti speculates would be facing bankruptcy without all those overly generous contracts from the U.S government. In a system smacking of nepotism, the book details the fact that many companies banned from gaining government contracts (for past fraud) are now happily engaged in the great Iraqi reconstruction rip-off--and this great rip-off had left Iraqis without electricity, water, and extremely angry. Gangs roam the streets raping girls--kidnappings and murders are daily events. Ironically, there's even a juicy quote from Dick Cheney made in 1991 predicting the anarchy that would follow the removal of Saddam.Parenti lived in Iraq--and not in a protected, guarded area. This book is not a compilation of regurgitated approved PR reports--this is a record of a country's disintegration, and the details are simply mind-boggling. The author's powerful, brilliantly descriptive writing captures the chaos, the pathos, and the human tragedy of the war in Iraq. Thank you, Mr. Parenti for going beyond the milquetoast journalism of the masses--your book challenges us to \\"unplug from the Matrix\\" and judge for ourselves--displacedhuman"},{"Title":"The Freedom: Shadows And Hallucinations in Occupied Iraq","review":"This book has been compared to Michael Herr's Dispatches and I think that's deserved. This is a crazy, creepy, scary, tragic and sometimes really funny story about the US occupation of Iraq. The author traveled around the Sunni Triangle over the first year and a half of the occupation. Unlike many books on Iraq that either cover US troops or just the civilian perspective, this guy embedded with US troops, saw some combat, met the resistance, hung with normal Iraqis and has some weird insights on the journalists and civilian occupiers. It's all combined into a vividly real and surreal portrait of the disaster that is unfolding in Iraq. He also works a lot of information about Iraq and Iraqis. I particularity like that the author, though harsh on American policy is sympathetic to the troops stuck with the job of carrying out the policy. It's a quick read, worth checking out."},{"Title":"The Freedom: Shadows And Hallucinations in Occupied Iraq","review":"This book is a genuine depiction of my experiences in Al Fallujah. Mr. Parenti was one of few journalists to truly imbed himself with my platoon; often displaying more regard for his craft than his personal safety. I recommend \\"The Freedom\\" to the serious reader seeking a true depiction of our struggle to simultaneously fulfill the roles of warrior and statesman."},{"Title":"The Freedom: Shadows And Hallucinations in Occupied Iraq","review":"Fantastic! Is worth more than a year's worth of CNN, NPR, and New York Times rolled into one. Parenti's foremost accomplishment is in letting his concise description of events in occupied Iraq speak for themselves. He has no heavy-handed agenda - just a clear sense of justice betrayed. The hypocrisy and ineptness of American policies glow frightfully from the pages of this priceless book."},{"Title":"The Freedom: Shadows And Hallucinations in Occupied Iraq","review":"Parenti's book provides a first-hand description of life in occupied Iraq, primarily the life of the occupiers, but also that of the occupied. None of this has been seen on the network news or read about in the corporate transcriptions of Pentagon PR that pass for newspapers in the United States. Yet much of it will be familiar - primarily from movies based on the war on Vietnam.Through Parenti's well-told accounts of people and events, we see the horrors and blunders of war, the cruelty that can result from a language barrier, the trigger-happy fear, the pharmaceutical-induced courage, the bureaucratic nightmare for victims' families, the sociopathic humor of the deeply disturbed, and the conflicts between the corporate profiteers and decision makers and the U.S. National Guard troops brought in to do their bidding.Parenti is a talented writer and observer, and he throws in asides about his own exploits that can occasionally seem out of place but serve as comic relief, bits that could have come from Hunter S. Thompson or Henry Miller. So, the book is entertaining. It's also honest - about the suffering caused by the Saddam Hussein regime, by those who have replaced it, and by the resistance.If anything were to change the minds of those Americans still supporting this war - short of persuading television news to show images of what war does to human flesh and human families - it would be an account like this of what life is like on the ground in Iraq. But I'm afraid this account may not reach as many people as it otherwise might, because the dust-jacket and the early pages label this a book from the \\"liberal elite.\\"Parenti's preface says: \\"I have chosen descriptive reportage over a more analytical approach for a number of reasons. One is the surfeit of already existing radical analyses of the Iraq debacle....\\" Fine, but couldn't this explanation have come in an afterword? And, then, couldn't it have been followed more strictly? The few bits of analysis that slip into the book are mostly found toward the beginning and could have been moved to the end. The book could have opened with narrative and been packaged as simply an account of what's happening in Iraq. Instead, the dust-jacket carries praise from various lefties, a description of the book as an account of disastrously bad planning, and this quote from a Baghdad resident:\\"Ah, the freedom. Look, we have the gas-line freedom, the looting freedom, the killing freedom, the rape freedom, the hash-smoking freedom. I don't know what to do with all this freedom.\\"That quote could have appeared in its place in the book, following descriptions that would have made it comprehensible to red staters who support their president.What did Parenti hope to accomplish with this book? It's not clear that he believes in the possibility of convincing anyone of anything they do not already agree with. He describes U.S. soldiers stationed in Iraq as wondering what the war is for but having no answers:\\"Talking to these young soldiers, I begin to feel that many of them didn't have the skills to answer their own questions. They have satellite TV and internet access, but putting the bits and pieces together - some BBC here, a critical article from the Net there - is a rare thing on most military bases. Usually the war is framed as patriotic duty or through the narrative of private personal trauma.\\"Parenti closes the book with a description of the intense struggle soldiers have fitting into peaceful society when they make it back to the Unites States. And he finds no increase in the soldiers' understanding of the war:\\"This group of guys, recently forced to spend a year of their young lives fighting an imperial war with global implications, are politically mute. They are neither pro-war, hopped up on patriotism, nor bitter, cynical and anti-war. Even when prodded by my occasional questions they are reluctant, or unable, to discuss the larger politics of what they have just lived.\\"All right, but what if a greater effort were made than occasional questions? What if a serious discussion were to follow the reading of this book?"},{"Title":"The Freedom: Shadows And Hallucinations in Occupied Iraq","review":"Parenti's book is a great account of the many defiencies of our occupation in Iraq. Parenti searched many corners to get the truth that our media doesn't want people to get. I met Parenti when I was in Al Fallujah serving with the 82nd Airborne. I have to retort to the ridiculous accusations made by a certain Mike Tucker that Parenti is a liar and a coward. Parenti is no liar and no coward. Mike Tucker is just upset that Parenti portrayed him as a bumbling idiot. It is not an inaccurate portrayal at all. I can honestly say that myself and my cohorts thought Mike Tucker was some crazy burned-out vigilante type trying to get a piece of the action. As for the events of January 9th, 2004, I wasn't there so I can't say what actually happened. However, being the company armorer for Alpha 1-505, I was a part of the AAR (after action review) which took place later on that night. In AAR's, all the platoon leaders and platoon sergeants of our company gather with the company commander and first sergeant and discuss the mission, giving feedback. I remember Mike Tucker's name popping up in this certain AAR and there were complaints that he was trying to take matters into his own hands and that he was acting inappropriately as an embed. It was requested that he not be allowed to ride along on any further missions with our company. I guess you can take that for what it's worth."},{"Title":"The Freedom: Shadows And Hallucinations in Occupied Iraq","review":"I've noticed, in some of the other reviews, a sad trend. To allow personal issues to turn people off to otherwise great literature is the first sign of despotism. Writing is about informing your audience, showing them what you've seen, not ridiculing and tearing down anyone who thinks differently than you do. I was in Baghdad, in Sector 17 when Parenti showed up. He was both professional and courteous. Months after his return stateside, he was still sending care packages and letters to us; even calling family members to let them know we were ok. To accuse someone who disagrees with your stance a coward and a liar is both excessive and juvenile. The Freedom painted a truthful, albeit unpopular picture of the war. Parenti refused to stick with the mainstream press coming out of Iraq, and instead wrote with his conscience, and I for one commend him for it. It is all to easy to write a \\"knee deep in it\\" type book. Parenti and I do not always agree on the politics involved, but he is no liar, and I can no more call him one than he can me. I have never read Mike Tucker's work, and now i never will. Not because i believe he is a poor writer, or a coward, or even a liar; but because the level to which he stooped with that review is so asinine that I no longer think he is deserving of my attention."},{"Title":"The Freedom: Shadows And Hallucinations in Occupied Iraq","review":"This excellent book gives a vivid picture of the horrors of the US-British occupation of Iraq. It is now three and a half years since Bush promised to get \`the people who knocked these buildings down'. Instead, he attacked the one Middle Eastern country where there was no Al Qa'ida.What does the occupation mean? 40,000 prisoners, torture, atrocities, beatings, humiliation, intimidation, killings, death squads, house searches, raids, demolitions. No jobs, no water, no electricity, no rebuilding, no security. Power plants, telephone exchanges, sewage and sanitation systems all still in ruins.The US government pledged $18.4 billion for rebuilding Iraq, but any money goes straight through to firms like Halliburton, which gets $1 billion of taxpayers' money every month, saving it from bankruptcy. (Cheney had bought Dresser Industries for $7.7 billion, without noticing that it owed billions in damages.)Bechtel got the $1.8 billion contract to rebuild Iraq's water, sewage and electricity systems. Both Halliburton and Bechtel have been fined for corrupt practice. Another US firm got a $780 million contract, despite convictions for fraud on three federal projects and a total ban on receiving US government work.The coalition gets ever smaller, the insurgency ever larger: the longer the occupiers stay, the more insurgents there seem to be.Rumsfeld, while publicly promising a swift victory, said in a private memo that the USA is in for a \`long, hard slog' in Iraq and Afghanistan. Cheney said in April 1991, \\"I think to have American military forces engaged in a civil war inside Iraq would fit the definition of quagmire, and we have absolutely no desire to get bogged down in that fashion.\\"It's an old story. T. E. Lawrence wrote in August 1920, \\"The people of England have been led in Mesopotamia into a trap from which it will be hard to escape with dignity and honour. They have been tricked into it by a steady withholding of information. The Baghdad communiqu&eacute;s are belated, insincere, incomplete. Things have been far worse that we have been told, our administration more bloody and inefficient than the public knows.\\"We should be demanding that the troops come home, and let the people of Iraq run their country in the way that they want to. Imposing foreign rule is not democratic, but despotic."},{"Title":"The Freedom: Shadows And Hallucinations in Occupied Iraq","review":"No one who has met Mike Tucker could doubt his courage, ethusiasm and unique flamboyance. That said, Christian Parenti is no liar or coward, and the accusation goes too far for a book review on a sales site. Much of Mr. Tucker's vehemence appears to be the result of Parenti's portrayal of him in \\"The Freedom.\\" He is well within his rights to be angry and to judge the book in any way he sees fit, but personal attacks by writers against other writers are more appropriate in the editorial pages of magazines.I was present for all of Operation Dozer on the day in question. My filmmaking partner, Ian Olds and I followed Sgt. Corcione and Lt. Bacik for the entire day, and throughout the period of contact Tucker refers to. Christian Parenti, Mike Tucker, Ian Olds and I were visible to each other throughout the operation. I never saw anyone cowering and Parenti's account of the day is consistent with my memory. I haven't yet had the privilege of reading Mike Tucker's account, but I doubt anyone would accuse him of making up events. Why start with Parenti?"},{"Title":"The Freedom: Shadows And Hallucinations in Occupied Iraq","review":"Christian Parenti's The Freedom is an invaluable account of the crime and tragedy that is the US occupation of Iraq. His work challenges a mainstream American media that refuses to even question Washington's \\"hallucinatory\\" proclamations of triumph in Iraq by more accurately documenting the destruction and chaos that US imperialism has wrought.The author provides a compelling account of the grim facts of war, particularly through tales of his own gutsy forays far beyond the Green Zone into resistance strongholds like Falluja. But even more than that, the author shows a great compassion toward the people of Iraq who are suffering through occupation, and toward the US soldiers who are often unconvinced about the legitimacy of their mission. Parenti's sensitivity obviously elicits a mutual respect between himself and his subjects, which is particularly evident in his description of a post-Iraq follow-up with members of the Florida National Guard unit in which he had been embedded.This book is a must read not only for the urgent wake-up call it provides in this age of imperialism, but also for its eloquent and thoroughly entertaining writing - both of which combine to make it one of the most important and relevant literary works of our day."},{"Title":"The Freedom: Shadows And Hallucinations in Occupied Iraq","review":"I am Mike Tucker, counter-terrorism specialist, author of HELL IS OVER and AMONG WARRIORS IN IRAQ, and Marine infantry veteran. I was in Iraq for 14 months, solid, and only saw Parenti for the sum total of five days in Fallujah. So the title of this book is fitting, as Parenti cast a very small shadow on American and Coalition operations in post-Saddam, post-dictatorship, and thank God it's liberated Iraq. Christian Parenti is lying his hindquarters off in this book, on the actions he covers concerning in Fallujah. Yes, there are many shadows in this book, especially concerning what he intentionally left out, concerning his own cowardice. I personally witnessed Mr. Parenti refusing to continue reporting on raids in Fallujah, against Al Qaeda cells, Zarqawi cells and Iraqi feydayeen insurgent cells---raids led by 1st Lt. Basik, 2nd Platoon Leader, Alpha Company, 1st Battalion-505th Parachute Infantry Regiment. At two in the afternoon on January 9th 2004, as 1st Lt. Basik led hasty raids down streets we had taken RPG fire and AK fire from just moments earlier, Christian Parenti turned tail, hid behind a gun truck on a street corner (Specialist Cane was manning a M-240-B heavy machine gun), and Parenti was still there three hours later, still hiding, still refusing to report on the actions of brave American paratroopers on the tip of the spear in the most dangerous area of operations in Iraq. Still cowering in the shadows cast by Americans like Lt. Basik and Staff Sergeant Corcione and Specialist Morales, who raided brilliantly on January 9th 2004 in Fallujah. And you find no mention of their professional, competent and magnificent raiding in Parenti's obscenity of a book, because he didn't have the guts to simply continue to go forward with them and document their actions. That is reflective of Parenti's overall gaping hole in the heart of this book: he came into Iraq with the intent of disparaging the Coalition's liberation of Iraq, and he does little in this book but throw stones at whatever American targets he finds useful. Turnabout is fair play, Parenti: you forgot what every American kid on a kindergarten playground knows well. People in glass houses shouldn't throw stones. Considering that the successes in Iraq are profound, and worthy of American praise--note that Saddam is no longer gassing Kurds, murdering Kurds in cold blood in the hundreds of thousands, murdering Shias in the hundreds of thousands, and Iraqis, much to Parenti's dismay, defied the Iraqi insurgency and voted under threat of death in January 2005--this book strikes a shallow cord, indeed."},{"Title":"The Freedom: Shadows And Hallucinations in Occupied Iraq","review":"Was definitely a mistake to buy this on Monday. It's Friday now and the only thing I bought all week that I wish I hadn't. No guts to this book, no soul. No guts, no glory. Very much an agenda-driven book. And no scope. Pass on it."},{"Title":"The Freedom: Shadows And Hallucinations in Occupied Iraq","review":"Under normal circumstances I would not feel inclined to add to the chaos of this forum, but the viciousness with which Christian Parenti has been attacked here demands a response. I was embedded with the 82nd Airborne in Falluja for six weeks as a documentary filmmaker and was there on January 9th, 2004 during the events that Mr. Tucker describes. I have no interest in maligning Mr. Tucker's character, but his assertion that Parenti in some way refused to report the truth out of cowardice and political shortsightedness is both ridiculous and patently false. I was there shooting videotape and Parenti's descriptions are accurate. I cannot in good conscience stand by and let Christian Parenti be called a liar when I know firsthand that it is not so. Even beyond the events of that day, in every circumstance that I witnessed Parenti working in Iraq, he was always forthright, compassionate and genuinely inquisitive. It was this approach that consistently won him the respect of American soldiers and Iraqi civilians alike. Christian Parenti's book is an honest and incisive account of life on the ground in Iraq; a truly invaluable piece of writing."},{"Title":"The Freedom: Shadows And Hallucinations in Occupied Iraq","review":"What Parenti offers here is an articulate account of cause and effect. Mainstream media organizations adroitly postulate intellectualized accounts of cause, but fail miserably to explore, analyze and depict effect. This is the void that Parenti fills with his simmering account of the travails involved simply in surviving in Iraq. He reports the front line experiences of soldiers, \`insurgents', citizens, NGOs and journalists; those unfortunates who make up the episode of madness that is the Iraq war.Parenti avoids the pitfall of painting himself into the Bush-bashing corner. His is not an overtly political polemic (although he cannot on occasion resist the temptation to thrust his knife between the ribs of the corpulent political leadership gorging at the trough of the Iraq war), but is instead an honest account of what the decisions made a world away mean to the people left to live out these megalomaniacal fantasies.The Freedom is cinematic in its expression; Parenti captures the palpitations of fear, the stench of total societal destruction and the grinding heat of the desert, and he serves up a cast of desperate, angry, terrified and bewildered characters. Parenti's vivid prose unquestionably entertains, but the success of The Freedom is in relating the thrilling but morbid account of what passes for life in Iraq to the audacious claims of \`progress' made by Bush and his puppet-masters. Piety, greed and hubris are the cause, Parenti offers us the effect. The meaningless rhetoric of the grand architects who sweep their hands over maps of Arabia is translated into the taut prose of survival. Parenti is courageous, honest, rational and talented and this book should be read by all who value those qualities."},{"Title":"The Freedom: Shadows And Hallucinations in Occupied Iraq","review":"This is the first book I've ever read by Christian Parenti.It says on the back of my edition from the Las Vegas Mercury'[Parenti] has an eye for the pefect image, a wonderful ear for dialogue, and a prose style that floats across the page'This is superbly apposite. Christian Parenti does have a really arresting, muscular, lithe and subtle way with words.He zooms onto an intensely personal detail in one paragraph and then zooms out into the much larger picture in the next. He does this beautifully though.This writing seems like it could have dictated in a stream of consciousness, but my guess is that Parenti is a heavy self-editor. I don't think anyone in a rush will write\\"It is as if the very landscape of America has been flooded with an odorless, anesthetic gas that prohibits analysis.\\"or\\"Considering all these dynamics, it seems that failure is, in fact, America's only option. And when the full history of this bloody circus is written, people will look back slack-jawed at the scale and brazenness of the occupation's corruption and incompetence. History will record Haliburton's colossal greed; The Bush administration's reckless ideological delusions; Paul Bremer's capricious mismanagement; the venality and duplicity of Chalhabi, Allawi and the other disobedient, incompetent puppets. And this criminal farce will be visually linked to images of bombed mosques in Falluja, the burning Baghdad library with idle US troops watching, sexual torture and humiliation in Abu Ghraib, and the swollen skulls of children sick from radiation poisoning.\\"I will be definitely reading everything else he has written.I meant to give it 5 stars, I don't know why I've only ended up with 4."},{"Title":"The Freedom: Shadows And Hallucinations in Occupied Iraq","review":"I stumbled upon this book in the library, and thought it might offer a different view of Iraq than what Americans see on the news.

He gives a stark political overview backed with first hand knowledge. I must say his writing style is superb and me manages a sense of humor throughout. The war has been fought for obscene millitary contracts to the Bechtels and Halliburtons of the world. Also, for oil control. Interestingly, he posits that it is not for our use but to inhibit future powers such as China and India from controlling oil. If we control the areas where they purchase their oil, we can engage in diplomatic blackmail.Parenti also outlines the plight of women in Iraq as they are subjected to \\"misery gangs\\" who rape and beat them, leaving them on the side of the roads. Many of these women are then killed by their relatives to preserve their honor.He sits in on dubious press conferences in which millitary spokesman sidestep every question. He rides with the grunts and talks to the freedom fighters. On a few occasions, he is in the right place at the right time, witnessing an IED that takes out a convoy and a marine.

This is gonzo journalism at its finest."},{"Title":"The Freedom: Shadows And Hallucinations in Occupied Iraq","review":"Can you contain all that is Iraq in 211 little pages? No? Then you must leave something out. What did Parenti leave out?It's clear what he left in: An interview with a leader of the Communist Party in Iraq, another interview with insurgent cell leaders, and several interviews with friends both Iraqi and American who vehemently disagree with some aspect of the war. Are we to expect these anti-war and anti-American (not the same) interviewees possess the entire Iraq experience?That's all there is to Iraq?The war dissenters in the book are described in detail, with heart and in a sympathetic style. The war advocates are patriotic, mono-syllabic dullards.Is this accurate? Complete? Why not strike up a friendship with a \\"John Wayne,\\" flag waving, all-American soldier and interview him in more than just a token fashion? There are plenty out there. Could it be that such a warrior has nothing in common with Parenti? There is something more here that CP is not telling the reader. Furthermore, he never claims to be writing an article. This is pure editorial. He even mentions the fact that his opinions have colored his writing in this book. Oh, he says it's the truth alright. It's the \\"truth\\" plus his opinion.Let us not expect the plain and simple facts from a book like this. \\"The Freedom\\" is one man's opinion. Read it if you don't agree with the war.

I wanted to know what one person has to say on the war who's opinion is radically different from my own and who can effectively write.Parenti expressed his opinion and gave me insight into one reporter's mind: Report the tragic. Report the struggle. Report the conflict. This is grist for the mill. Give the readers a story--a cliff hanger. Report the truth only when it supports the story.One more note of caution. Remember: he is a reporter not a soldier. He is a writer, not a State Department nation builder, strategist, tactician, politician or warrior.

I found insights which would please both those who are partial to the Transcendentalist movement, and those who find that it the 'missing link' between orthodox Christianity and the growing agnosticism of the Western World and specifically the USA in the 19th century. For instance, on p. 25, RWEmerson is quoted as believing that \\"family, church and state [are] decomposing\\" in his time. Did he ever consider that his writings contributed to that decomposition? The fact that the Transcendentalists were proud \\"to make liberation from the 'supulchres of the fathers' the exiliarating (and covertly anxious) center of their social world view' is cited approvingly by Charles Capper on p. 30. But isn't making this the center of your world view inherently adolescent, even infantile? Did the Transcendentalists, and anyone else who rejects tradition completely, believe that their ideas emerged from the brow of Zeus? Were they so egotistical to think that no one who lived before them was as wise and intelligent as they?I found it interesting that, although the Transcendentalists usually prided themselves on their social justice stances, that Emerson lived very comfortably, and when Parker died, his estate indicated that he was in the top 1% of wealth in Massachusetts. However, Emerson did call Andrew Jackson, one of the co-founders of the Democratic party, along with Thomas Jefferson, \\"a charlatan, a frivolous nobody.\\" And Emerson was for removing regulations on trade, and on p. 239, John Patrick Diggins summarizes Emerson's economic outlook as \\"the basis of political economy is non-interference,\\" attitudes out of line with 21st century liberalism.I found the articles by Nancy Stula and Michael Broyles/Denise von Glahn, on the relationship of Transcendentalism to art and music respectively, particularly valuable, especially since i am a non-specialist in those areas.I think it safe to say that the San Francisco Chronicle, as quoted on p. 502, was a bit over the top in ranking Emerson up there with \\"Dante, Galileo, Montaigne, Newton and Darwin' in their obituary for the sage of Concord.On p. x of the Preface, the editors state that \\"the essays in this collection attempt to capture New England's Transcendentalists in all their complexity.\\" The authors' and editors' attempt was successful."},{"Title":"Pattillo's Geographical catechism (University reprints)","review":"I'm prejudiced, as I should be, as Henry and his brother, Robert (My ancestor) emmigrated to the US from Blairgowrie Scotland in 1741 (I've traveled extensively in Scotland, particularly in the Perthshire area where Blairgowrie is located).

After the author's excellent _In the Shadow of the Shaman_ I am not surprised. Just the many well drawn and meaningful little line illustrations done by the author tells me that this was a labor of love and not simply something slapped together. Amber Wolf understands the Path. You see that on the first page when she states that a shaman is one who helps people in their dealings with other worlds. That's the core of it exactly.In this book she manages to touch upon everything from the basics of Lakota wisdom (her orientation is primarily Native American- wolf clan), to power objects, power object ceremony, altered states of consciousness, shamanic healing, spirit walks, harmony with the universe, methods for entering the shamanic worlds, divination through elements of nature, etc. Just reading this isn't going to make you a shaman, but chances are, if you are drawn to this path it will clarify and validate what you've already experienced to varying degrees.The only disagreement I have with the author's approach is that she suggests that the old shamanic paths of vision quest and of physical and psychic trauma are a thing of the past. She seems to think that anyone can cross the threshold through more gentle methods of communion with the universe. Maybe it is so. All I know is, that traditionally a price had to paid for the gift. After all, it is the shaman's way to be the wounded healer. It is in the ordeal of our hard won wounds, of even death and rebirth, that we bridge the worlds. There have been many gifted medicine people who have never undergone the Shaman's ordeal, but then they are medicine people and not true shamans.Yet perhaps it is possible in these new times for everyone to attune with all the worlds in harmony with Spirit without undergoing the old trials. In any case, we agree on the goal- to be the bridge between worlds, to restore the balance, to serve as a living channel for the flow of subtle energies."},{"Title":"Distant Vision: Romance and Discovery of an Invisible Frontier","review":"This is a loving biography of television pioneer Philo Farnsworth by his widow. Her affection and admiration for him do not allow for much admission of errors of judgement in technical, personal, or business matters.

There is little in the way of technical information or photographs of the technologies that Farnsworth invented and developed, nor are there references for the interested reader to follow up on.

But after all, what is there to do with ships that have reached the end of their useful life?"},{"Title":"Outlaw Sea","review":"Curious about the real world of the sea and what can happen when you lose sight of land? This fabulous book explains it all and more. Currently the most dangerous sea lanes appear to be in the Gulf of Aden and the Indian Ocean, but Mr.Langewiesche describes the dangers of the South China Sea and the Java Sea as well. It's not just the sea faring pirates that cause the misery and heart break, those corporate ones sitting behind oaken desks cause just as much or more grief.As always, greed kills and absolute greed kills even more; from abused registries, and bogus inspections to the cost cutting methods of recycling mamouth tankers, it's a corrupt and evil world of business and government run amuck and William Langewiesche gets to the bottom of it. It's a great and fascinating read."},{"Title":"Outlaw Sea","review":"The Outlaw Sea is about the immensity of the sea and the essential lawlessness of commercial shipping. There is far more ocean than there is land. \\"International Waters\\" are just that - not part of any country.The book consists of four main sections. The first is about freighters in general, the law of the sea and the story of the Kristal, a 550-ft all-purpose tanker, registered in Malta, owned in Italy and crewed by Croatians, Pakistanis and Spaniards. The ship had grown decrepit, but the owners kept on sailing it. It broke into two sections off the coast of Spain, dumping a cargo of molasses and drowning a third of its crew.The second is about pirates who captured a freighter. It shows how dangerous the shipping lanes are even today, and how hard it is to catch the criminals.The third part is about the loss of a huge Estonian car ferry, in the Baltic on its way to Sweden. Storm waves broke open the car deck. Passengers played in the bars until the ship began to sag to starboard. There are stories of death and survival. A lot of it is about the investigation of the loss, and international politics.The last part is about ship-breaking, focusing on a beach in India. The author watched a ship deliberately driven onto the beach, then cut to pieces by low-paid workers. The author describes the work of Greenpeace and others to promote skip-breaking that is not so bad for the environment, or so unhealthy for the workers.The book is well-written throughout. There's plenty of detail, but it never gets boring."},{"Title":"Outlaw Sea","review":"Wm. Langewiesche is a favorite author of mine, having produced several previous delicious reading experiences for me, most recently his book about the Sahara. He is a skillful wordsmith and travel raconteur with an eye for detail almost as keen as Paul Theroux's. So I leapt at the chance to read The Outlaw Sea, thinking it would help explain the piracy issue in great detail. (How is it the world's strongest navies can't stop a few Somalis in outboards from highjacking yachts in 2008?) Instead, while devoting a chapter on South China sea pirates, he devotes two very lengthy chapters on the Baltic Sea ferry disaster that was so regrettable but presented by the author in such detail one leaves the book thinking he has seen every rivet and chain link of the Estonia, the ship that sunk--this book. I'll continue to seek out Mr. Langewiesche's work, but with skepticism and a little less enthusiasm."},{"Title":"Outlaw Sea","review":"The sea covers most of the world's surface area. Most people have a passing knowledge of the sea's history, of pirates and hidden treasure. Langewiesche's book brings up the modern issues the sea presents to the world and the different countries that border it.The overarching theme of the book is that no matter what humans do, the sea cannot be tamed. Langewiesche's book is divided into different vignettes that inform the reader of the many different issues of the sea. All are impeccably researched and written. The most interesting to me was the final section on shipbreaking. I had no idea of the work and loss of human life involved in reducing a ship to scrap.This is a great book to give to anyone who wants to know more about how the sea figures into our modern existence."},{"Title":"Outlaw Sea","review":"Sea stories have long been among my favorite subjects.

I'm going by airplane!"},{"Title":"Outlaw Sea","review":"As other have noted, it is a little disjointed as it is a compilation of some previously published material. However, as someone with little knowledge about how the economics of ocean transport works, I found it insightful, infuriating and interesting.The blurbs on the cover make you think it is about \\"corporate malfeasance\\" and while the author does seem to want more control over the oceans, it is a bit more nuanced than that. He does recognize the impossibility of regulating such a vast expanse. Even on the environmental issue of how to control the business of scrapping ships (which is done these days on heavily polluted beaches in India) he is not willing to make the scrappers the villains. Rather, he notes that while the work is dangerous and not environmentally friendly, to simply outlaw the practice would increase insurance fraud and put a large number of poor people out of work.Langewiesche does not provide much in the way of answers, but the book is a good place perhaps to start the conversation."},{"Title":"Outlaw Sea","review":"As others have said, basically a number of more or less independent articles pasted together with the running theme of the law-free ocean and the global marketplace.

Langewiesche takes the reader on a tour of the perils afflicting modern maritime shipping and attempts to trace the origins of those perils through the attempts of nations to establish some kind of regulatory control over the seas. While I'm sure Langewiesche meant his book to be, at least in part, a cautionary tale about the Wild West nature of much of the world's oceans (underscored by his caveats regarding how easy it would be for terrorists to sail explosives into the US aboard a cargo ship), the book better serves the reader as an introduction to the world of maritime shipping and its laws (or lack thereof). Langewiesche doesn't try to make his work exhaustive - it's actually too brief, I think, owing in part to its readability and the fascinating nature of the source material - but rather he tackles three episodes in modern shipping history and describes them within his greater framework. I gave the book four stars because I found the subject interesting enough that I wanted more details, more stories - The Outlaw Sea was, to be frank, just too damned little of a good thing."},{"Title":"Outlaw Sea","review":"The Outlaw Sea is a short book with a wide-scope, including the history of international regulatory efforts, the problem of piracy, the practical effects of international regulations, terrorism, the sinking and investigation of the Estonia ferry accident in 1994, and the global \`ship-breaking' industry and its malcontents. William Langewiesche is a talented writer and his description of what it was like to be on the sinking Estonia is breath-taking. Here is an excerpt:\\"Survival that night was a very tight race, and savagely simple. People who started out early and moved fast had some chance of winning. People who started late or hesitated for any reason had no chance at all. Action paid. Contemplation did not. The mere act of getting dressed was enough to condemn people to death, and although many who escaped to the water succumbed to the cold, most of the winners endured the ordeal simply naked or in their underwear. In any event, the survivors all seem to have grasped the nature of this race, the first stage of which involved getting to the Deck 7 promenade without delay. There was no God to turn to for mercy. There was no government to provide order. Civilization was ancient history. Europe was a faint and faraway place. Inside the ship, as the heel (angle) increased, even the most primitive social organization, the human chain, crumbled apart. Love only slowed people down. A pitiless clock was running. The ocean was completely in control.\\"\`Love only slowed people down...' This is one powerful sentence. One reads about ferry accidents from time-to-time in the paper, and then moves quickly to the sports section. The name of the ship and country fades quickly from memory. But after reading Langewiesche's chapter on the Estonia, you will have a new appreciation of how hellish these accidents are for passenger and crew.The book bogs down in places - in particular, in the detailed forensic analysis on the investigation of the Estonia disaster and some other places. Langewiesche heroically describes the detective work but it would have been useful to include a few photographs - or even some drawings - to help people without a nautical background understand various parts of the ship. The chapters are self-contained, and overall the book has the feel of several unrelated long articles put together for a book. There should have been an afterword to bring the disparate topics all together.At the end of the book, Langewiesche offers up another excellent chapter on the beaches in Southeast Asia (India in particular) where ships go to die, and be scrapped. The danger, slave-wages, and ecological catastrophes are brought to life in a very visual, compelling way. This chapter, and the minute-by-minute account of the Estonia disaster, spotlight the author's talent at bringing extraordinary scenes to your mind's eye."},{"Title":"Outlaw Sea","review":"This book is a compilation of previously published materials that lack a unifying theme. Although the information presented is interesting, the author fails to tie together the topics into a meaningful whole. In the end, he reaches no conclusions. Worth reading from the library, but I wouldn't buy the book again."},{"Title":"Outlaw Sea","review":"THE OUTLAW SEA takes the reader on a journey across the seas and examines the variety of ways that life on the ocean functions without the rule of law. Each section examines a different concern, from vessels that should never be sent out to sea because of age and their decrepit condition to modern day pirates; Langewiesche brings each problem to the forefront but merely scratches the surface of each. Rather than focus on a particular type of maritime calamity, Langewiesche decides to give the reader a cursory examination of the many problems that are out on the oceans. The final section, an examination of the shipbreaking industry on the beach at Alang, India gives the reader a taste of what could have been. A fascinating look at a little known and dangerous venture which Langewiesche handles with compassion and aplomb that makes you realize that any one of these concerns would have been a valid problem to examine in greater detail. As it stands THE OUTLAW SEA serves merely as brief glance at many serious problems, but not giving any one problem the investigation it deserves. Couple this with the occasional example of purple prose:\\"There was no God to turn to for mercy. There was no government to provide order....Love only slowed people down. A pitiless clock was running. The ocean was completely in control.\\"And you end up with a book that was a great idea but lacks the intensity of research to make it anything more than a curiosity."},{"Title":"Outlaw Sea","review":"An exceptional investigation written with great descriptive detail and empathy."},{"Title":"Outlaw Sea","review":"Description of this book did not live up to the actual writing. not very memorable"},{"Title":"Outlaw Sea","review":"the writer knows how to write but one and one half short story(maybe for esquire?) for an expensive book, means short-changing the readerhalf this mini- book is exciting, but the other half reads like a boring report from some boring committee"},{"Title":"Outlaw Sea","review":"The author is a good writer, BUT, where in this piece of nonfiction are the index, bibliography, and footnotes.

Written in a suspenseful style, William Langewiesche, carefully constructs his plot that the sea remains untamed and uncontrolled.

Especially interesting to me was the story of the Estonia, the major ferry that tragically sunk in less than 20 killing almost 700 people. I recommend this to those who enjoy non-fiction, investigative reporting."},{"Title":"Outlaw Sea","review":"As Melville knew, we look to the sea as a symbol for freedom, and &quot;freedom of the seas&quot; is proverbial. But freedom at sea can lead to such manifestations as piracy, and not just in the swashbuckling days of yore; it could also lead to corporate irresponsibility and malfeasance. William Langewiesche's _The Outlaw Sea: A World of Freedom, Chaos, and Crime_ (North Point Press) collects and expands upon his previous magazine articles on this theme. All of us are dependent upon international trade, and few of us understand how it works or in what ways it is working badly or dangerously, unless we hear about a capsizing or an oil spill. There are a lot more of those than we hear about, and a lot more crime on the sea than even governments acknowledge. Langewiesche's book is a fine way for lubbers to get to know how traditional maritime freedom is endangering them.Before World War II, ships were customarily built in a country, were registered in that country, flew the flag of that country, and sailed for the profit of businessmen in that country. Ironically, the United States began the current anarchical system in a pretense of neutrality during the pre-Pearl Harbor war, registering in Panama ships bringing needed supplies to Britain. The practice became widespread in the succeeding decades, with many ships now sailing under &quot;flags of convenience.&quot; They might be registered in countries that have no navy and even no coastline, and the countries involved can get relatively small fees, which are actually almost pure profit. The countries don't pursue administrative niceties like taxes, labor laws, safety inspections, and so on, and the corporations which own the ships don't mind avoiding such things, either. Among the cases described here are a too-old ship (with full inspection documents) broken in half by stormy seas. Pirates can take advantage of the lax laws by making a ship disappear; capture, repaint, rename, and reflag the vessel, and it vanishes from the seas. Seas are big, ships leave no tracks, and patrol ships and aircraft can see only a tiny percentage of any hunting ground. Policing the oceans from such attacks is not now possible.The longest episode in the book tells of the _Estonia_, a giant luxury ferry that sank in the Baltic in 1994, with a loss of 852 of 989 passengers and crew. A victim of faulty design, poor maintenance, or even a bomb (none of the extensive investigations afterwards has satisfied everyone), the narrative here of well-chosen characters trying to escape from the swiftly-sinking ship is fast and terrifying. The book ends with a part of the maritime business that few people ever consider: what happens to the worn-out ships? Salvaging used to be a thriving business in our country and others; reclaiming the metal and reusing it was good for profits and good for the environment. However, showing the same pattern of lack of regulation and reduction of the job to the cheapest source available, shipwrecking has gone to places like India, where poorly equipped and poorly paid workers are glad of the job, even if it means almost constant danger from the unplanned movement of heavy objects or the inhalation of poisons. The shipping industry, Langewiesche writes, is &quot;not exactly a criminal industry, but it is an amoral and stubbornly anarchic one.&quot; This is a deeply disturbing book, written with cool detachment. Technology and international organizations have not made improvements in the way the vital global trade is conducted. Profits are more important than anything, the sea promises the freest of trading, no one seems to be learning from the lessons described here, and no one should expect these dangerous situations to be changed anytime soon."},{"Title":"Outlaw Sea","review":"William Langewiesche is an excellent journalist, and his writing is hard-hitting and unvarnished. This book is a great read, but its scope is quite narrow. Unusually, I would have enjoyed it more had it been twice as long. Readers are treated to in depth profiles of a few incidents that support the book's thesis, but the separate threads are not satisfactorily tied together. The stories he does tell, however, are gripping and frightening. I couldn't put it down."},{"Title":"Outlaw Sea","review":"I picked up William Langewiesche's The Outlaw Sea after having read his compelling series of articles for the Atlantic Monthly that make the bulk of this book. The tale of modern-day piracy he explored in the Atlantic was amazing and something I had never thought possible before. In this book, Langewiesche expands on his thesis: that the sea is immune to the laws of man.With the probing, empathic narrative of an investigative journalist, Langewiesche shows how modern shipping is almost completely unregulated, run by shadowy figures, and accountable to no one. The result is piracy on the open seas, official corruption, and environmental havoc. For instance, he explains how when megaships reach the end of their lives, they are rammed onto the coast of India where workers take apart the polluted hulls for scrap. Langewiesche notes the devastation to beach and the unsafe conditions the workers face. But he also points out that workers are far better off for having these jobs than they otherwise would be working at best in subsistence agriculture. He also poignantly recounts the stories of the Kristal and the Estonia, victims of legal unaccountability and the cold viciousness of the sea.Langewiesche outlines the bureaucratic impotence, and sometimes obstructionism, of the international system regulating the oceans, but he offers no recommendations or solutions. It seems he doesn't think there is a solution, and he is sadly convincing in this pessimistic outlook.If you read Langewiesche's Atlantic articles, you have already read much of this book, but it might be still worth getting it if only for the final chapter on India. Otherwise, this book is wonderfully written and very interesting."},{"Title":"Outlaw Sea","review":"I came to this book as a person who spent over a dozen years in the ocean shipping industry. For me, William Langewische's The Outlaw Sea is a fascinating look at a subject with which I am intimately familiar.Langewiesche's gloomy, albeit accurate, portrayal of life at sea for the \`low-end' portion of the ocean shipping industry is marked by excellent research and even better writing. The book has some of the hallmarks of the best fiction. It unfolds dramatically and keeps the reader's attention. Langewiesche's portrayal of the passenger ferry Estonia is heartbreaking. The author pulls no punches. At one point, Langewiesche discusses the horror of the loss of 852 lives on the Estonia, notes the worldwide outpouring of grief (particularly in Northern Europe) but then pauses to mention that ferry accidents such as this are a routine way of life in the third world (in Asia and Africa in particular) and yet these accidents barely attract our attention. The terse, matter-of-fact fashion in which Langewiesche imparts this information has a greater impact than it would have if set out in a dogmatic fashion.Last, Langewiesche turns his eye to the ship breaking business in India. Vessels that have reached the end of their useful life (and as set out in the book a ship owner's definition of useful life is far longer than may be prudent for safe operation) are run onto beaches in India, Bangladesh, and Pakistan where they are dismantled in a manner that endangers everyone involved. Life for these ship breakers is nasty, brutal and short. Langewiesche's portrayal is so well written that one can almost smell the befouled air that lingers over the work area. The author also sets out the political confrontation between the ship breakers and Greenpeace. It is an excellent overview of the conflict that arises between first-world political activists and third world throngs struggling to make a life for their families.I only take two minor issues with the author. First, in discussing the sinking of the oil tanker Prestige off the coast of Spain, I think the author did not pay sufficient attention to the horrible decision of the Spanish government to deny safe harbor to the damaged vessel. It is mentioned in passing. The decision to force the Prestige out to sea, before she was damaged beyond repair and before there was a major loss of oil, into stormy and unsafe seas was as much, if not more, to blame for the environmental disaster that followed as the general condition of the vessel before the accident. The actions of the Spanish government in this regard were reprehensible. Second, Langewiesche makes much (rightfully) of the negative impact on foreign flag registration, specifically flags of convenience, in terms of vessel safety, poorly trained seamen, etc. However, it would have been useful to point out as a counterbalance the fact that the Exxon Valdez, the vessel responsible for one of the largest oil spills in U.S. history, was a U.S. flag vessel, built to U.S. flag standards, fully accountable to all U.S. maritime laws and regulations with U.S. officers and crew.This book is well written, informative, and interesting, whether or not one happens to be in this business. I highly recommend it to anyone interested in first rate, well researched and written non fiction."},{"Title":"Outlaw Sea","review":"This is one scary book. Pirates, murders, breakups at sea, the loss of the huge ferry Estonia with many innocent passengers and so on. It is well written, but it is sort of like if somebody wrote a book about all the people who had been horribly murdered in public restrooms. I don't know how many of those there have been in the last 100 years, but let's say there were fifty and suppose I were to gruesomely describe ten of those. After reading that book you'd never be able to walk into the men's (or ladies) room again without getting the shudders. You'd likely be buying adult Huggies to avoid the whole possiblity of having to take the chance.Well, that's the way this book is. It's scary, and after you read it you will have to think twice about getting within a hundred miles of any large body of water. That's you, of course. Now I live on an island, so what the hell am I supposed to do."},{"Title":"Outlaw Sea","review":"The book as a whole provides a detailed and engaging sense of the lawlessness and disorder that takes place on the ocean and near its coasts. The stories are based on current events and add a great deal of drama to his investigative writing. Its the kind of book I was eager to discuss with my friends and family after reading each chapter. As an ocean lover, but not a frequent sailor, its a great find and gives a rarely told perspective on what actually takes place with the world's ships. The threats of terrorism, piracy, the difficulties of scrapping ships, and the contrast of the way governments try to regulate the ocean with the practical realities of the ocean are thought provoking and fascinating. What a pleasure this book was!"},{"Title":"Outlaw Sea","review":"I come from a commercial fishing background and I'm always looking for a good sea story. This one happens to be true, terrifyingly so. It inspired the plot for my first thriller, Blindfold Game."},{"Title":"Outlaw Sea","review":"\\"The Outlaw Sea\\" is a real page-turner about a wild, lawless frontier that affects all of us. With so much of the raw materials of civilization shipped by freighter -- machinery, vehicles, food, oil -- you'd think shipping would be more closely regulated and better protected. But the author shows us how it's in the best interests of those who own the shipping lanes for there NOT to be much regulation. Ships, crews, and cargos are all, ultimately, expendable. It's more profitable to lose a ship here and there than for the navies and marine authorities of the world to get serious about policing the waves. Hence, we learn that inspections, even in ports where the authorities are relatively uncorrupt (which is rare) mean very little, and piracy is surprisingly common in the 21st century. You also get a look at the lives of mercantile sailors, which are not at all romantic or glamorous, but dirty, dangerous, grueling, and underpaid.You'll be particularly appalled at how easily a ship can be taken, and the possibilities for terrorism are chilling as well...This isn't really a single book, though, or at least it doesn't read like one. It's a collection of several different marine-related themes. First, Langewiesche talks about the law of the sea, or rather, the lack thereof. He covers regulation, naval enforcement, the shadowy, mutable world of ship owners and registries, and why the world depends on shipping and why shipping remains \\"a world of freedom, chaos, and crime.\\"Then he spends a huge chunk of the book talking about a single disaster, the sinking of the ferry Estonia. This is practically a minute-by-minute account, complete with descriptions of crew and passengers, survivors and non-survivors, and plenty of after-the-fact analysis of exactly what went wrong and the legal and political ramifications.Finally, Langewiesche describes the ship-breaking yards in India, \\"hell on Earth,\\" where the poorest of the poor break apart condemned vessels for low pay, crawling over shards of metal and puddles of toxic waste.This book started out as several different essays, but each one holds up on its own, and the complete work is an eye-opening expose of both life on the high seas and the people who work to keep the world's shipping afloat."},{"Title":"Outlaw Sea","review":"I enjoyed this book. I'm fascinated by the subject, and the writing is terrific. I was a bit disappointed with it, though, for reasons shared by many other reviewers.Of the 240 pages in the book, the first hundred pages move along well. So do the last forty. From page 100-200, though, the book bogs down in the story of the sinking of the Estonia. While it is a gripping story, it should have been limited to 50 pages-- the book's title is not \\"The Sinking of the Estonia\\". Issues like piracy and shipping finance could have healthily stretched the book to 300 pages total.Overall, though, I would recommend it-- with the proviso that it is not a full treatment of it's subject."},{"Title":"Outlaw Sea","review":"Langewiesche is a correspondent for The Atlantic Monthly and has written several books that combine hard reportage with the more ephemeral qualities of a travel writer. In this case, Langewiesche's goal is to illustrate with bold examples the ungovernability of the sea. For him, this is a law of nature, but it is also a consequence of the inability of the laws of men to deal with sea's expanses. His case studies, if you will, are many, but he spends the most time on a few memorable stories: the modern day pirate attack on the Alondra Rainbow in 1999; the post-apocalyptic landscape of the world's most heavily trafficked ship graveyard, the beaches of Alang, India; and the wreck of the ferry Estonia on which at least 852 people died when it went down in a storm in the Baltic Sea in 1994. The subtext in all of these stories is that the tragedies contained within are, at least partly, a result of the inability of modern societies to govern the seas. The greater implication, as Langewiesche makes clear, is that such lawlessness and statelessness make the sea fertile for the operations of lawless, stateless terrorists. The sea is everywhere, but it is nowhere in the eyes of the law. These timely concerns, and Langewiesche's sturdy prose elevate a book of riveting tales of disasters at sea to a book of more weighty importance."},{"Title":"Outlaw Sea","review":"How do you pronounce this man's name? He has a wonderful way with words and I think I am going to subscribe to the Atlantic Monthly just so I can read more of his writing. This book was really scary at times and I couldn't put it down. What I like most about the author is that he doesn't try to force his opinions on the readers. Or if he does, it isn't obtrusive. His description at the end of the shipbreaking yards in India are incredible and I would love to see pictures of them."},{"Title":"Outlaw Sea","review":"I could not put this book down. Some other reviewers' complaints (too many digressions, no central theme) are precisely what I like about it. Great stuff!Best of all, Langewiesche is a great writer. It was a joy to read poetic sentences that were not poetic for their own sake. Langewiesche is a good writer who does not write good sentences merely to dazzle but to actually tell us something.If this book is any indication, I'm ordering all of his others and look forward to reading them."},{"Title":"Outlaw Sea","review":"Some of the reviewers here have detailed some of the books short comings and I do not think they are being unfair. My review is going to be focus only on the positive, because I not only like this author, but I found the book extremely enjoyable. The author talks to us about some different aspects of the current state of ocean shipping across the world. He covers areas from recent ship wreaks to pirate encounters. He even takes the reader into the world of ship breaking where these massive structures are reduced to bite sized bits of steel. The book is fast paced and very interesting.Sure, over half of the book focuses on one car ferry sinking in the mid 90's, but unless you are familiar with the story, it is interesting. I kept wondering how he got so much detail. He covers the sinking in his somewhat off center style. If you read his other book about the World Trade Center then you can appreciate it. He just looks at the world with a bit of sly humor and an odd angle that makes his story telling that much more interesting.Overall I thought the book was great. The stories were interesting and somewhat unique. He injected just the right amount of drama and detail to make the reader hurry to the next page. Could he have spent more time on any one section of the book, probably, but he is writing as much for the readers enjoyment as to tell a story. You may want this or that changed with the book, but at the end of the day it is an interesting, and at times exciting, book that is well written."},{"Title":"Outlaw Sea","review":"The author is a journalist, and journalists are taught to keep the reader's attention by emphasizing individual stories and human interest over statistics, which are supposedly boring. Consequently, this book is a collection of stories. We get to spend time with both pirates and their victims in the Indian Ocean, with the crews of sinking, leaky oil tankers, with the investigators of the sinking of an Estonian ferry, and with shipbreakers on India's Alang beach.The stories are great, but they only paint details and leave the reader hungry for the broad picture. There are few figures. We read, for example, that there are over 40,000 large ships on the ocean, but there is no indication of where this estimate comes from. If the ocean is chaos, how do we know how many ships are on it? Also, what does \\"large\\" mean? I would have been interested in a table of number of ships by size category, with the source of the data and the author's assessment of their accuracy. We also hear that most ships sail under flags of convenience. Here also, a table of how many ships fly each flag would have given some perspective.The same pattern is repeated throughout the book. All the issues are presented through anecdotes, without quantification. For example, we know there is piracy, but not how prevalent it is. At the end of the book, we don't know whether the stories are examples of trends with broad significance or are simply random isolated cases.The book is also lacking in cross-referencing information. There is only a table of contents with cryptic titles like \\"The wave makers\\" and no index. The only maps are in the lining of the cover, and there are no photographs, which leaves too much to the imagination."},{"Title":"Outlaw Sea","review":"This book is on several different aspects of the merchant shipping industry. As a former radio officer on U.S. merchant tankers from 1986 to 1995, I can say that lawlessness, choas and crime does not apply much to U.S. vessels. For other vessels that are flags of convenience the story is a lot different. I think this author is a gifted writer. The story about the hijacking of the Alondra Rainbow in the Malacca Straits is very interesting and suspenseful. There can't be a better read about the sinking of the Ro/Ro vessel Estonia than this book offers. It is worth the price of purchase just for this narrative alone. The end of the book about the shipbreaking operations in India is also interesting. The author seems to get into a bit of the \\"save the environment\\" mentality though, and since I think this guy lives in Seattle he may be a bit of an environmental nut. But that doesn't come out much in the book except a little towards the end. His overall theme is the damage that is caused to merchant vessels (and the people riding them) due to the carlessness or fraud of owners, governments, ship's agents, maritime authorities, etc.A very good book about merchant ships disasters (from both natural and human causes) is Disasters at Sea by Richard Cahill.The merchant shipping industry is not quite as outlaw as the author might suggest. The only way any nation could put a nuke on a merchant vessel and light it off in one of our ports would be to do it in complete secrecy. I believe it would have to be done by a state government. Having a more in depth knowledge of how the merchant shipping industry works, I don't think a bunch of terrorist could pull this off. The author does not go into this possible scenario, but given the theme of the book it does perhaps lead people to draw their own conclusions about that.Very good work by the author on this book though. I highly recommend it. His research is excellent and his style of writing is also excellent. That combination makes for a very good read IMHO."},{"Title":"Outlaw Sea","review":"William Langewiesche's excellent book could be seen on one level as just a collection of harrowing, if wonderfully told, sea stories. His writing, though vivid, is understated, and can carry as much freight, so to speak, in one or two sentences as some writers pack into entire chapter. Even on this very superficial level, this title is both riveting and educational reading.But the deeper you look into this book, the more there is to uncover. I read it during a news cycle when the threat of seaborne terrorism was once again in the headlines, and it was certainly sobering to see how easily how ships in what one reviewer called &quot;the low end of the shipping industry&quot; can disappear almost at will from the world's seas, reappearing in a new port under a new name, with a new flag, and even a markedly different appearance.Langewiesche's key point is that the world's oceans are an outlaw place -- in the original, literal definition of the word as outside the protection, or even beyond the reach, of law. On the high seas, each ship is to one or another degree, its own absolute monarchy. When crimes occur, where can they be prosecuted -- by whom, and under what authority? (The author's recounting of one memorable case where modern-day pirates were tried in India vividly proves his point.)Law and order tend to break down at sea in another way too, as the sinking of the ferry Estonia made clear. As the ferry began to go under, Langewiesche tells how civilization fell apart under the simple and inescapable need for survival. Thieves even began stealing jewelry right off the bodies of their fellow passengers -- before themselves going to their deaths, appropriately enough. Disaster at sea provides horrible proof for how thin the veneer of civilized society really is.All this makes for disturbing, as well as fascinating, reading. The ocean is a world where few humans feel at home, and fewer would be able to survive for any length of time if their comfortable ships or planes were taken away from them. William Langewiesche's understated but revealing book illuminates this world in a way that should replace romantic visions with a very sobering understanding of reality."},{"Title":"Outlaw Sea","review":"This book reads like 4 or 5 magazine articles that have been strung together. Each article focuses on some sort of disaster involving the seas - ship wreck due to poor maintenance, oil spills, piracy, loss of life in a ferry disaster, and the tear down of old ships in India. There is a loose connection between the articles involving chaos on the seas (mostly man-made but also natural) but not enough to make a coherent book. There are times when I wondered what the point of the book was besides passing on some interesting stories. In the introduction he tried to link the \\"outlaw sea\\" to terrorism but that idea was never reintroduced or significantly supported.Read the book if you're interested in maritime disasters. Skip the chapters that don't interest you because none are essential. (The Estonia ferry disaster drags on for over a hundred pages and I was never quite sure what the point was.)"},{"Title":"Outlaw Sea","review":"With the news exploding about pirates off the Somali coast, it diverts the public's attention from the more threatening area of piracy in the Straits of Malacca and other nearby waters of southern Asia.Thankfully, this book exposes that nefarious world to us but it doesn't just stop there. The focus is on how our oceans are the last frontier where rules really have no effect at all. Issues such as shipbreaking (mainly seen by the Western world as something which happens exclusively in a certain part of India yet is exists all over the map), ship safety relating to inspections, safety standards and how the pressure to deliver cargoes in less than seaworthy ships leads to disasters also are brought to light.The only strange thing was the choice to devote close to 200 pages on the passenger ferry sinking of the Estonia in the Baltic Sea. After I read the one chapter, I thought the author wrapped up the topic well but he went on for another chapter which I eventually gave up on as I felt it was too much detail on ground already covered."},{"Title":"Outlaw Sea","review":"I acquired Mr. Langewiesche's book based, I believe, on a flattering review in The Economist and that by itself shows that the book has to be good. It is definitely and it provides an enjoyable read. Mr. Langewiesche's mastery of his subject is obvious. He has done a lot of research and commendably interviewed lots of people before writing an authoritative and serious book, yet without pomposity or any pretense to save the world.His premise is most enjoyable: the more you regulate the High Seas - through international organizations or otherwise - the more messy and ungovernable they become ! Quite interesting indeed and probably required reading for bureaucrats, particularly those in Brussels purporting to regulate the minutiae of Europeans' lives.....The chapter on piracy is great, but the book was published in 2004 so the information is out of date as it could not include the new \\"Pirates of the Caribbean\\" environment in Somalia. Too bad because I am sure Mr. Langewiesche would have written some most enjoyable pages on that topic.This being said, the chapters devoted to the story of the Estonia - a ferry that sank in the Baltic in 1994 with considerable loss of life - are too long in my view. A horrible tragedy it was, for sure, and the characters trying to turn it into a conspiracy by the CIA and the like - some of them real crackpots - are amusing but after a while one understands the reasons for the ship's demise and the rest of the minutiae of the story loses interest.On the other hand, the final chapter dealing with the shipwrecking in industry in Gujarat is required reading for anyone with an interest in what actually happens to modern ships when they become so old that they cannot carry even the safest cargo, such as sugar molasses - the stuff will simply melt away in the sea if the pile of floating rust the ship has become just breaks up and sinks and who cares about the crew anyway....- and frankly the tale is quite frightening.A nice and interesting book it is. Do read it but remember that it was written some years ago and perhaps some of the details of the Erika story can be skipped."},{"Title":"Outlaw Sea","review":"I think a lot of people graded this low, not based on the books itself, but because they thought it would be something else. Either they thought it would be a story about pirates, etc, or they didn't agree with the authors more liberal ideas. One person even gave it 2 stars because it had no pictures! Can you believe that?Other than that, this book is excellent. I was shocked to read about many things that we never hear about, things that happen daily beyond any jurisdiction. It isn't very long, it doesn't go into a lot of detail on each subject. It is more of a broad introductory book into the world of shipping."},{"Title":"Outlaw Sea","review":"Despite complaints by certain other reviewers, I was overall quite completely satisfied by Langewiesche's treatment of the topic of global commericial shipping. No single author can write a work that will satisfy all readers. Among the questions he must ask as he composes: Where shall I focus? In how much detail? Shall I be dry and matter-of-fact, or zoom in on the human drama and tragedy?To me, Langewiesche strikes just the right balance. In this slim, compact book he covers the major bases: dilapidated freighters transporting hazardous cargoes, slipshod maintenance, the desperate lives/careers of their crews, nefarious \\"shell corporations\\" that exploit 'globalism' in the further fattening of their Swiss bank accounts, smuggling, piracy, and terrorism. A frightening and otherwise-uncommented fact stated in the book is that Osama Bin Laden himself controls (or did at time of publication) a \\"ghost fleet\\" of some 20+ freighters for the transport of jihadists and arms. Couple this with Langewiesche's portrayal of the inherent lawlessness of the global ocean and you have the makings of our next 9/11.The middle portion of the book (the two chapters \\"On a Captive Sea\\" pg. 101 to \\"The Ocean's Way\\" ends on page 195) chronicle the Estonia ferry disaster. Think \\"Titanic\\" meets \\"Poseiden Adventure\\". Langewiesche's shocking portrayal of the Estonia's passengers climbing for their lives in a capsizing ship is like nothing to be found anywhere else. He knows just how to zoom in on dire individual plights, then pan out to the political in-fighting of the investigation boards comprised of Estonian, Finnish, and Swedish officialdom. Add to this the incindiary workings of the third-party conspirationalists (namely one Jutta Rabe). Then throw in the German shipbuilder Meyer Werft -- desperate to defend their technical reputation -- making their own investigation in order to sully the offical one and thus shift blame to the Estonians and Swedes. This narrative ranks with the Challenger and Chernobyl episodes in terms of technical-versus-political drama.In his last chapter \\"On the Beach\\" Langewiesche exposes the reality of the commercial shipbreaking business, centered on India's Alang region. Certainly it will come as a revelation, as it did to me, to learn that each year some 700 commercial tankkers and freighters, each massing some 10,000 plus tons each, are cut up for scrap on this forlorn island of desperate third-world poverty. The author brings out the catastrophic environmental and human toll this \\"business\\" brings. As said by one Indian in the book (unnamed), \\"Would you rather die first of starvation or by pollution?\\" Some choice.All in all, one will either like or dislike this book as a matter of ideology. The reader can either view it as an indictment of our global capitalistic materialistic hedonistic \\"free-trade\\" society (as if), or as a paramount example of \\"creative destruction\\" and opportunistic exploitation of the underdeveloped world's cheap labor and throwaway material resources. I choose the former."},{"Title":"Outlaw Sea","review":"In William Langewiesche's \\"The Outlaw Sea\\", we learn about the politics, or lack there of, in the oceans that dominate our world. This is not a book that looks at the mysteries of the ocean like giant squids, tidal waves, perfect storms, etc. This is a book about how big, usally unnamed and European, capitalist squeeze out every dime of profit they can from the tanker trade.Once his theme is established the books then braches off into three main problems of sea trafficking, the surprisly high number of still sinking vessels, modern pirates, and the enviromental problems associated with dismantling ships.It's a fasinating report, all be it a tad dry at times, condensed into a brief 239 pages."},{"Title":"Outlaw Sea","review":"Disappointed. Title is great, but content is lacking. Mostly an excruciating recap of some notable maritime tragedies rather than a discussion of the issues associated with governance of the seas, UNCLOS, inability of coastal states to manage their coastlines, flags of convenience, etc."},{"Title":"Outlaw Sea","review":"I cant wait for the great wars of the sea. This book was a great read about the current state of the sea. Can't help but make me think its the place for me. Sound like a fun game of cat and mouse. I wounder what its like to be a repo man of the sea."},{"Title":"Outlaw Sea","review":"Considering that the subject matter of this book is shipwrecks, smuggling, castaways, piracy, and a host of other lurid ocean-related themes, I was surprised to find it on the tedious side.Langewiesche's basic strategy is to discuss shipwreck after shipwreck, and then investigate the seamy underworld of the shipping companies lurking behind the disasters, and the laws that have helped to engender the situation.But the book is poorly organized and Langewiesche gets distracted easily: for example, after going on and on about the wreck of the Estonia, he continues for a couple of dozen pages about the various conspiracy theories surrounding its sinking. Digressions like this are common.The book also has no logical beginning or ending, and I can't see why Langewiesche even divides the work into chapters. A glimpse at the titles of the chapters (e.g., \\"To the Ramparts,\\" \\"On a Captive Sea,\\" \\"The Ocean's Way\\") is enough to suggest that there is no progression of thought being realized in the book, and other than a general lament on the rough and shady nature of international shipping, the book ends up having little to offer.Certainly not in the way of entertainment!"},{"Title":"Outlaw Sea","review":"The book should have been named \\" the Tragedy of Estonia\\".Langwiesche is an excellent contributor to the Atlantic monthly, unfortunately he seems to be under the impression that a book is simply a compilation of several articles strung together.You will hardly learn anything new from this book.Although he is an excellent writer he should really just sick to periodicals.See other 2 and 3 star reviews for more detail, they hit the nail on the head."},{"Title":"Outlaw Sea","review":"Hi , I can't review this book because I never received it ! All attempts to try to contact amazon failed .This sucks!"},{"Title":"Outlaw Sea","review":"While the cover blurbs on the book promise another \\"Prefect Storm\\" quality reading experience, it's a fine read, but it's not quite that good. The book is broken up into 3 sections, a pirate hijacking in the Asian seas, the Estonia ferry sinking in heavy seas, and the ship breaking beach at Alang, India. The pirate section is great. The ferry sinking less so because in explaining the political fallout, he goes over the same information multiple times. (Though I was shocked at the statistic he threw out that supposedly 20% of all Germans believe that the 9/11 World Trade Center attack was actually done by the United States against its own people.) The 3rd section about the ship breaking industry was the reason I'd picked up the book, but it spends most its space on the Greenpeace efforts to shut down Alang. The author admires Greenpeace more than I do. When during an interview with Greenpeace, he keeps asking what I think is a very interesting question and the Greenpeace representative keeps refusing to answer it, the author says that it's really his fault for asking the wrong question. And since the ship breaking section of the book is over 10 years old (even 5 years old when the book was published in 2004), it leaves the question unanswered about what happened with the whole Greenpeace movement to shut down Alang because I believe ships are still being broken down there, that they have not shut down."},{"Title":"Outlaw Sea","review":"This book covers a wide range of subjects related to shipping and explains that many aspects of life at sea are unregulated, or regulated only on a voluntary or theoretical level, and that consequently, maritime life is just as dangerous as it has ever been. The book discusses flags of convenience, negligence in maintenance and inspections, piracy, and shipbreaking. Most of these topics stand alone as decent essays. However, Langewiesche tries to tie them together with vague lines in each chapter about the uncontrollable quality of the sea and anything having to do with it, a device that looks like a last-minute, unconvincing way of binding a collection of essays into a book. The longest essay is the excessive, 94-page treatment (out of a total of 239 pages) of the 1994 wreck of the Baltic ferry Estonia. Much of this section concerns media vampires and conspiracy theorists drawn to the tragedy. In this section, it is easy to forget that one is reading a book about the sea."},{"Title":"Outlaw Sea","review":"This is not the book I was expecting. Normally it would only have gotten three stars, for recycling three articles, only one of which was really of interest to me (on piracy), but the author is gifted, and his articulation of detail lifts the book to four stars and caused me to appreciate his final story on the poisonous deadly exportation of ship \\"break-up\\" by hand. It is a double-spaced book, stretched a bit, and not a research book per se.Two high points for came early on.

For me, William Langewische's The Outlaw Sea is a fascinating look at a subject with which I am intimately familiar.Langewiesche's gloomy, albeit accurate, portrayal of life at sea for the \`low-end' portion of the ocean shipping industry is marked by excellent research and even better writing. The book has some of the hallmarks of the best fiction. It unfolds dramatically and keeps the reader's attention. Langewiesche's portrayal of the passenger ferry Estonia is heartbreaking. The author pulls no punches. At one point, Langewiesche discusses the horror of the loss of 852 lives on the Estonia, notes the worldwide outpouring of grief (particularly in Northern Europe) but then pauses to mention that ferry accidents such as this are a routine way of life in the third world (in Asia and Africa in particular) and yet these accidents barely attract our attention. The terse, matter-of-fact fashion in which Langewiesche imparts this information has a greater impact than it would have if set out in a dogmatic fashion.Last, Langewiesche turns his eye to the ship breaking business in India. Vessels that have reached the end of their useful life (and as set out in the book a ship owner's definition of useful life is far longer than may be prudent for safe operation) are run onto beaches in India, Bangladesh, and Pakistan where they are dismantled in a manner that endangers everyone involved. Life for these ship breakers is nasty, brutal and short. Langewiesche's portrayal is so well written that one can almost smell the befouled air that lingers over the work area. The author also sets out the political confrontation between the ship breakers and Greenpeace. It is an excellent overview of the conflict that arises between first-world political activists and third world throngs struggling to make a life for their families.I only take two minor issues with the author. First, in discussing the sinking of the oil tanker Prestige off the coast of Spain, I think the author did not pay sufficient attention to the horrible decision of the Spanish government to deny safe harbor to the damaged vessel. It is mentioned in passing. The decision to force the Prestige out to sea, before she was damaged beyond repair and before there was a major loss of oil, into stormy and unsafe seas was as much, if not more, to blame for the environmental disaster that followed as the general condition of the vessel before the accident. The actions of the Spanish government in this regard were reprehensible. Second, Langewiesche makes much (rightfully) of the negative impact on foreign flag registration, specifically flags of convenience, in terms of vessel safety, poorly trained seamen, etc. However, it would have been useful to point out as a counterbalance the fact that the Exxon Valdez, the vessel responsible for one of the largest oil spills in U.S. history, was a U.S. flag vessel, built to U.S. flag standards, fully accountable to all U.S. maritime laws and regulations with U.S. officers and crew.This book is well written, informative, and interesting, whether or not one happens to be in this business. I highly recommend it to anyone interested in first rate, well researched and written non fiction."},{"Title":"Outlaw Sea","review":"This is not the book I was expecting.

The six chapters function as semi-independent essays (bits of which appeared in The Atlantic), within an overall thesis that the world's oceans are essentially places of anarchy, and civilization exists only tenuously (at best) aboard seagoing vessels.Chapter One introduces the reader to this anarchic world of flags of convenience, shadow ownership, holding companies, the cheapest crews money can buy, and unsafe, decrepit ships. This is done via the case of the Kristal, a 27-year-old tanker carrying molasses and a Croatian, Spanish, and Pakistani crew when it split in two and sank in off the coast of Spain in February 2001. The disaster is reconstructed from the testimony of the few survivors, and concludes with furtive settlements to them and an utter inability to determine who actually owned the ship. Through this, Langewiesche describes how most shipping is regulated by the International Marine Organization (a UN agency), and, rather depressingly, how -- despite all kinds of conventions, agreements, regulations, and inspections -- ships are constantly sinking at sea and lives are being lost.Chapter Two is about security, both of ports and of ships. The vast majority of modern commercial piracy takes place near the Straights of Malacca, and Langewiesche takes the reader through one such case -- the October 1999 hijacking of the $10 million Japanese cargo ship Alondra Rainbow and its $10 million cargo of aluminum. Again, Langewiesche reconstructs the event through individual testimony and court records: from the Indonesian pirate leader's planning via cell phone with a Chinese boss, to the storming of the ship by multinational gang of Malays, Thais, Chinese, and others, to the ship's disappearance, and the pirates' eventual capture and prosecution by India. The disappearance is especially fascinating in this era of GPS and satellite imaging, and an important digression is made on the impossibility of tracking, never mind identifying all the ships at sea (some 30 million by one U.S. Coast Guard estimate). Anyone concerned about terrorists using boats or ports to deliver WMDs to the doorstep of the U.S. will probably not want to read this section, as it is rather chilling stuff.The very brief third chapter provides a little more background on how international regulations work in practice, here in the case of oil spills. This first grew into a major concern following a series of incidents in the mid-1970s, and blossomed into a full political issue after the Exxon Valdez crash. Langewiesche shows how American and European bureaucracies have responded over the last several decades, and how ineffectual these new rules regulations have been.Chapters four and five (totaling around 100 pages) deal with the September 1994 sinking of the ferry Estonia in rough Baltic waters, killing more than 850 people. And if you thought \\"The Perfect Storm\\" was heartbreaking, wait until you read this. The reconstruction (again, from survivors and the massive legal record) makes for terrifying reading, and no one who reads it will ever take a ride on a Baltic ferry. It's brilliant writing, tackling both the furious legal and technical debate about the cause of the disaster, and the harrowing human side, as people literally claw and climb over each other to survive. At times, the reconstruction gets a little too colorful as the attempts to show how most of the people become Darwinian animals get a bit much, but it's still nightmare-inducing stuff. It's an incredibly convoluted and contested tale, but one that does a very effective job of showing how the ocean can quickly reduce order to chaos and how the failure of regulation can lead to large tragedy.The final chapter is somewhat tangential to the book's main thrust, as it deals with what happens to ships at the end of their lives rather than the chaos that rules the high seas. Here, Langewiesche covers the shipbreaking beach at Alang, India. Here, ships come to die, driven ashore and then manually broken down in scrap metal and salvageable parts by poorly paid crews who live in squalid work camps and are exposed to all manner of toxins from the dead ships. Various activist campaigns have brought world attention to the plight of these workers, but Langewiesche points out that shipbreaking is a booming field and even more wretched facilities exist elsewhere in South Asia. What the responsibility of shipbuilding nations is becomes a very murky matter and there are no easy answers.This is a very good book, and each chapter stands on its own as an accessible introduction to one or two maritime topics which could easily merit entire books. Langewiesche is very good at blending travel reportage, investigative interviews, and archival research to create very compelling stories. Throughout, even though the topics can be rather abstract legally or technically arcane, he always writes with great compassion and clarity about the people who are affected."},{"Title":"Outlaw Sea","review":"\\"The Outlaw Sea\\" is as good an introduction as one can find to the marvel and mystique of the ocean world-a frontier were states, businesses, pirates, crewmen, and scavengers vie for freedom, livelihood, and control. It is a world that is as exciting as it is dangerous-a perennial clash between the desire to place under control and the reality that the open seas are simply too vast to be governed.William Langewiesche, writer for the Atlantic, looks at the various aspects of the shipping industry and chronicles its main characteristics and hazards. He writes about old ships that pass lax inspections and end up in accidents that damage the environment or kill people; he narrates the hazards of traversing though waters mired with pirates; and he even discusses the end-point of many ships, as they sold for scrap, usually in South Asia.Throughout this story comes the dialectic between the chaos of the sea and the attempts by governments to bring the whole edifice under control. Characteristically, he tells of the various efforts and fears of the US Coast Guard about the potential of a terrorist attack carried out through a merchant ship-a likelihood that is much feared but almost impossible to protect against.In the end comes a balanced account of the realities of the sea. Save one narrative that is slightly overdrawn, the story is poised and well-focused, though at times it could have used more background and analysis instead of storytelling. But the underlying theme-that the chaos of the sea is unlikely to managed, comes across as powerfully as it could."},{"Title":"Outlaw Sea","review":"The book begins strongly, colorfully describing the byzantine world of ship registry, possible terrorism, and modern-day pirates. But when it turns to maritime disasters, the author chooses a selection of ship sinkings which take entirely too much of the book. His exhaustive description of the wreck and great loss of life of the auto ferry Estonia in 1994 takes up almost an entire third of the book and exhausts the reader. And somehow he misses the point of the book. The book ends on stronger ground with his coverage of the largely unregulated salvage of hundreds of commercial vessels each year, raising important ecological and social issues, though the book kind of dribbles to a close as if the author needed to complete the book by page 239.I liked the book for all that. The author's coverage is a bit shallow (pun intended) of a vastly important and interesting subject. He would do well with a follow-up, picking up where this one leaves off."},{"Title":"Outlaw Sea","review":"Control of the world's oceans was once considered a primal goal of the foreign policy of many nations. The advent and spread of air, then jet travel has reduced the importance of the sea, especially in terms of human transportation. But the sea is still the medium by which most of our goods are shipped, and as world trade increases, more and more produce is shipped over the ocean every day. This dichotomy then leads to an interesting situation. As people increasingly move about by air, the importance, and danger of sea travel recedes from public attention and the political limelight. But as more and more of the goods we use everyday are brought to us from places oceans away, the importance of oceanic commerce grows. Hence the growth in the shipping and shipbuilding industries and piracy. This then is the subject of this book, industry, crime, chaos and anarchy on the world's oceans.The book focuses on several parts of man's current relation with the sea. One chapter is devoted to shipbreaking, or the destruction of old ships. This environmentally hazardous and dangerous job often gets relegated to third world countries such as India. Another chapter examines piracy, and shows how some of the world's most traveled waters are often some of the most dangerous. Case in point are the waters between Malaysia and Indonesia. A third chapter examines the international shipping industry, and shows how shipping companies often sail under flags of multiple nations to help the bottom line and avoid government inspections.All told, this book shows how the world's oceans are a world apart from the land-based countries we are all used to. Rules that apply on land often do not on the high seas, and greed is often the determining factor in what goes and what does not. This book is especially relevant given the current war on terror."},{"Title":"Outlaw Sea","review":"The title is the premise.The premise is interesting. The writing journalistic and a bit pedantic (though highly acclaimed on the books back cover).It's interesting in parts, like the \\"recycling\\" that goes onin India and the fact that almost all carriers fly flags ofconvenience, the real owners often hidden behinddouble blind dummy corporations. It is a real warning note on the dangers inherent in the lack of regulation in shipping.I was surprised to find that large scale piracy of freightersexists today (on the order of roughly 1-2 ships a week, world-wide).The book is essentially a collection of 4 or so articles.While interesting, I think it lacked overall cohesion."},{"Title":"Outlaw Sea","review":"Exploring the edges of order in the modern age, Langewiesche again demonstrates that the world is getting larger, not smaller.In a recurring theme (compare the 'pencil whipping' ValuJet employees certifying the payload of flight 592), The Outlaw Sea highlights the contrast between the bureaucratic fictions of the regulators (in this case, the IMO) and the sobering vastness of the world's oceans and the consequent intrinsic unruliness of their traffic.With crisp, distilled, yet lyrical prose, and examples ranging from Spanish sailors to supranational pirates, from devastatingly impoverished shipbreakers of South Asia to paternalistic European environmentalists, Langewiesche uses the sea as a lens through which to focus on the unbridgeable gaps in perspective between rich and poor, East and West, order and chaos."},{"Title":"Outlaw Sea","review":"If the attacks on the World Trade Center towers made you nervous, then this book will load you with solid reasons to be fully frightened about the potential for even more destructive terrorist attacks.&quot;The challenge is daunting. The United States has ninety-five thousand miles of coastline and more than a hundred seaports capable of handling large ships. It is the most active sea-trading nation on earth, accounting for a large percentage of long-distance maritime traffic worldwide and annually accomodating more than sixty-thousand port calls by oceangoing ships, the great majority of which are foreign flagged, owned by offshore companies, and crewed by anonymous sailors -- almost all of whom come from troubled parts of the world where America is resented, corruption is rife, and authentic documentation can easily be bought,&quot; Langewiesche explains.The attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, focused attention on aircraft smashing into buildings. Ships are mostly ignored, except for &quot;big bang&quot; fantasies generated by Sept. 11, 2001. However, an equal or worse disruption of trade is possible simply by running a large oil tanker onto shore in a vulerable region -- think Exxon Valdez, and the impact of a larger spill on San Francisco, or Seattle, or Boston, or any other of those hundred US seaports.Can terrorists get a ship? Pirates already seize dozens of ships every year, and it often takes weeks before the ship is recovered. Al Qaeda already owns 20 ocean-going ships. Tankers have inflicted billions of dollars of damage on coastal regions for decades; now, think of this being done deliberately. The federal building in Oklahoma City was demolished by fertilizer and fuel oil -- in 1917, a French munitions ship blew up in Halifax, Nova Scotia, in a blast so massive that it briefly bared the bottom of the harbour.Despite an impressive bureaucratic and paper facade, ocean shipping is virtually unregulated. The total chaos of trade is an open invitation to the greedy, the pirates, the terrorists and anyone else with modest means and massive hatreds. Ships are the world's best cargo carriers, they are the essence of globalization and low prices in the US; in the hands of the world's world terrorists, they are also awesome weapons.In brief, it leaves Americans and the industrial world with a choice: either live with the &quot;Russian Roulette&quot; of ocean-bound terrorism, or develop a system equivalent to NORAD that was created to provide aerial security during the Cold War.This book is awesome. Read it, and you'll weep with rage at the $200 billion War on Iraq while leaving the &quot;cargo door entrance&quot; to America as an open, unprotected and deadly invitation to each and every terrorist."},{"Title":"Plane trigonometry with practical applications,","review":"I found Dickson's book at my college library 4 years ago and studied it with much enthusiasm.

Chatman offers helpful concepts for analyzing both written and film narratives. He tries to create a synthesis of all narrative theory before his book, and he does a very good job. Instead of getting lost in a collection of different approaches, you actually find yourself connecting them all, seeing where they fit together.Among all the books on narratology and narrative analysis I've read, this is the one most helpful not only for analyzing film narratives but also written narratives (although I would always recommend you also read &quot;Narratology: An Introduction&quot;, &quot;Narrative Fiction&quot; and perhaps Bordwell and Thompson's &quot; Film Art : An Introduction&quot;, if you want to focus especially on films).This book and the way Chatman dissects the narrative are also interesting for people more interested in writing than in analysis: I believe the parts Chatman splits the narrative into resemble very closely those writers use in putting one together. So this book may actually help writers gain new insights into what they are doing instinctively.First and foremost, however, it is a very useful book for the student and scholar of literature."},{"Title":"Story and Discourse: Narrative Structure in Fiction and Film","review":"Chatman's book has been around for a while, but it is still probably the best summary of structuralist narrative theory out there. Chatman makes the very important connection beetween narrative theory and its rhetorical effects on audience. His treatment of the construction of time in narrative summarizes several other prominent narrative theorists, but his terminology is perhaps the most useful. His clear presentation of the distinction between &quot;story&quot; and &quot;discourse&quot; (often called &quot;l'histoire&quot; and &quot;recit&quot; after Genette) and the linking of discourse to rhetorical theory is perhaps the book's most useful feature. Chatman, whose early works included a treatise on poetic meter, is known primarily as a film theorist, but his work analyzes narrative in many media and in many forms. I have used this book as an introduction to narrative theory in my classes."},{"Title":"Story and Discourse: Narrative Structure in Fiction and Film","review":"This is a terrifically useful book and is quite well known in graduate student circles.

If you're looking for a 'way into' literary theory concepts, this one will be very helpful.The title, story and discourse - refers to the basic distinction literary theorists make between a story (chronological set of events) and its narration (chronology can be manipulated to produce various rhetorical effects such as suspense, etc)."},{"Title":"Story and Discourse: Narrative Structure in Fiction and Film","review":"Remember those books from English Literature in highschool?

The only thing I can disagree with are Cioran's opinions, and even then I am merely naive. I have little right to criticize him otherwise: to give these ... singular essays, these pages fertile with cerebral energy, this relentless gnawing at obstructing myth... to give it a spit in the face with my insignificant Amazon.com review? Well it would be unfathomable insolence! If, on the other hand, I seem hopelessly reverent toward Cioran... well, ya got me.This book isn't for casual reading while on the can or in the dentist's office waiting to get drilled.

Her versions remain closer in spirit to the originals than any of the later translations, most of which (if you'll pardon my French) suck, from the bland lazy word-for-word of the Penguin Classics edition, to the innumerable &quot;interpreters&quot; (Paul Schmidt and his shameless ilk) who make of his poems what they will (sometimes to further lengths than JR Ullman did with &quot;The Day On Fire&quot;) and then call their work &quot;translations.&quot; Anyway, if you know Rimbaud I'm probably preaching to the converted, and if you don't, and don't read French, the two New Directions/Varese translations are probably the best place to start, along with Pierre Petitfils' user-friendly biography."},{"Title":"ILLUMINATIONS (in French) (TEXTES LITTERAIRES FRANCAIS)","review":"For me, modern poetry is Rimbaud. Sometimes I think modern writing in general is Rimbaud, but usually only after a few drinks. In any case, this is one of two books that are essential for anyone interested; Louise Varese (wife of composer Edgard) was one of the first and is still the best English translator that Rimbaud has ever had; her versions are as faithful as possible, but have a swing and an energy (even in these prose poems) that nobody else has reached. A mighty book."},{"Title":"ILLUMINATIONS (in French) (TEXTES LITTERAIRES FRANCAIS)","review":"The works of Rimbaud have become as famous for the character of the writer as for the writings themselves. However, with any work of art, the true test will be the content of the work rather than the person behind the pen. That said, the prose poetry of this child-man artist was an attempt to break away from all types of oppression in all forms (as viewed by Rimbaud): tradition, social expectation, as well as literary convention. First and foremost, Rimbaud was a thinker and then a writer but, unlike many philosophical writers (verses aesthetic writers, i.e.--Proust), he rarely lapses into didacticism. As for the content of his writing, one must consider that Rimbaud prefaced many literary movements, including psychoanalysis in his attempt to let one's \\"true self\\" write by \\"deranging the senses\\"; his focus on synesthesia predated the Dada movement and allowed him to become a godfather to the Surrealists; his themes of impotence and suffering foreshadowed the existentialists; and his use of multiple narrators foresaw the upcoming modernists in 20th century America."},{"Title":"ILLUMINATIONS (in French) (TEXTES LITTERAIRES FRANCAIS)","review":"The mark of an extraordinary writer to me has always had something to do with whether the writer's genre was enhanced by the writer. This is a tall order, I know, but the very best writers change the way that their genre is perceived. Rimbaud's prose poems challenged the traditonal style of the Romantics who wrote before him. He brought a sharp, new incandescence, a flaring literary reality, a breakthrough perception to poetry expressed by his point of view. His stirring soul is seared by his epiphanies expressed in simple, clean and gleaming imagery. At times, he reminded me of Blake and Yeats. But his poetry is so original and personal and inventive that the genre metamorphosed by his unique literary perspective. Rimbaud believed that the poet must deliberately become an antagonist and work to place one's sensibilities into constant upheaveal in order to write poetry that is truly revelatory. His life was lived to the hilt as he traveled worldwide with Paul Verlaine and traded adventure incessantly. His destitution, lust for life and piquant sensibilities abound in the light and shadow of his poetry. The genre is indebted to the invention, passion and beauty expressed by this tormented soul who simply couldn't get enough of life."},{"Title":"ILLUMINATIONS (in French) (TEXTES LITTERAIRES FRANCAIS)","review":"After reading the poetry of Rimbaud, especially any of the Illuminations, it's hard to forget. If the role of the poet truly is to find something new, then Rimbaud surpasses anyone's imaginations. They are a torment. You can recognize immediately that they are creations of genius, but understanding what they truly are is nearly impossible - and that's what make the Illuminations great. A hundred readings of one of them will still leave you baffled, but will also leave you with the feeling that there is something out there that you don't know, that will explain everything.

Edward had just abdicated in July 1936 to become Edward Windsor and marry the (twice divorced German spy) woman he loved. As an attempt to thwart Churchill's pressure, Walter Schellenberg the youg nazi evil genius had been sent to Portugal where the Duke was staying to prevent the couple from leaving for the Bahamas and bring them back into Spain. Edward was to be lured into regaining his throne with Wallis as Queen of England and Hitler was prepared to make a peace with England if he could put his hand on the British fleet. Then he could turn against Stalin with a quiet westeern fornt.Michael Bloch who is very supportive of the British Crown's concern with its image delivers a very factual report of Operation Willi itself.But...The book starts after a brief chapter on Edward official relationship with the nazis presented as a normal peaceful attempt towads the Reich.It doesn't mention the FBI report conocerning the affair between Ribbentrop and the duchess.It fails to underline that Wallis Simpson, according to FBI reports, had passed secret information to the nazis in 1935/1936 and had been constantly reporting to von Ribbentrop during the battle of France.It doesn't indicate that during his British-French mission in 1938/1939 the duke had inspected the Maginot line precisely where von Manstein would cut it in the Blitzkrieg.It fails to report on Anthony Blunt's mission confided by King George VI in Germany to retrieve all the correspondance of the Duke and the Duchess with their German cousins.It does not question the production of the Duke's reports by the British SI after Blunt's mission, presenting them as good intelligence reports in favor of the British. (When Churchill decided to check on the Maginot he just asked the French, he didn't have to spy on it.It doesn't underline that both Blunt and Schellenberg who knew too much about the Duke and the Duchess were protected against the court sentence each of them they deserved.Despite these essential lacks which leave the subject open, this book remains the most complete and the most documented on the sequence of events purely pertaining to Operation Willi.There are still archives on this matter,which are kept secret both in England and in the US : why if not owing to something which cannot be known by the general public?If you have an interest in the debate around Edward Windsor, and want only one book: this is the one, it goes further than any other, but will not tell you the end of the story"},{"Title":"Gradiva (Old Edition) (Sun and Moon Classics)","review":"Freud shines here in a largely non-reductive analytic look at Jensen's well-plotted and psychologically rich but literarily mediocre novella Gravida: A Fancy, written about an archeologist who falls under the spell of a beautiful feminine image and travels to Pompeii to meet the authentic woman who reminds him of it. Or rather, the reverse....Although I can't follow Freud's evocation of the dream censor, that device which scrambles images and feelings to keep them unconscious, or the classification of Hanold's state of possession as a delusion (not meant by Freud as &quot;false,&quot; however), this well-written study is a nice example of a fair-minded psychoanalytic interpretation--in this case, one that uncovers a repressed but potentially passionate love for a flesh-and-blood woman.To Freud's description of the Vesuvius dream as anxiety caused by repressed erotism--certainly true in this case--I would add that the woman buried under ash also represents the very real possibility that Hanold's capacity for relating to women, the world, and humanity is in danger of being repressed for good. His soul is on the line, and it requires the cleverness and insight of Zoe to awaken it and fulfill its promptings.In general, the Standard Edition translation into English, though comprehensive, has done Freud's literary voice little credit. Where he'd have written that &quot;the beloved becomes infused with desire,&quot; Strackey would have interpreted that &quot;the object achieves a libidinal cathexis.&quot; Helen Downey's translation brings out the warmth and wit of Freud's immense eloquence while remaining true to his scientific formulations."},{"Title":"The Treasury Of Knowledge Book 6, Part 4: Systems Of Buddhist Tantra","review":"The Treasury Of Knowledge: Systems Of Buddhist Tantra is book six, part four of an encyclopedic set relating the entire breadth of Buddhist teachings as they were preserved in Tibet.

The format, however, remains the same-translation, grammatical analysis, setting and form, verse commentary, and theological overview of each chapter or periscope. The bibliography is exhaustive, and while the work targets a professional audience [e.g., educators] there is much here of use for a motivated lay person who wishes to study the Bible with literary and theological precision.I am going out on a limb here and assuming that very few readers begin Biblical search with 2 Kings. My assumption would be that the reader of this commentary has digested an overview of the Hebrew Canon in general and is somewhat familiar with what has already transpired. 2 Kings begins, so to speak, in the middle of things. It is the second half of a five century narrative of the kings of Israel. 1 Kings begins with the glory of Solomon; 2 Kings ends with the Babylonian Captivity. Clearly the challenge of any commentator is an explanation of what happened.For the Deuteronomistic author of Kings, the theological reason for the decline of Israel, including its division into northern and southern kingdoms and ultimate subjugation, was the failure of its kings to preserve the Law, worship, and humility before Yahweh. True heirs of David and Solomon were hard to come by. To use an American analogy, there were a dozen Warren Harding for every Theodore Roosevelt. Josiah is a notable exception, though as Hobbs comments, even this king's efforts at reform are too little and too late. [343] Centuries of neglect, indifference, active idolatrous dalliances, social injustice and regional involvements with pagan neighbors were culminating toward an inexorable denouement. One example: the repeated recourse to exchange the temple's worship finery for political expediency. One is hard pressed to imagine Joshua resorting to such tactics.The reader will probably surmise that 2 Kings comes to us through a particular religious and cosmic outlook. This does not diminish the work in any way, but it does raise questions about what else was undermining this royal line. Hobbs provides insightful information regarding both the dating of the narrated events--vis-&agrave;-vis other known happenings in the Middle East--and the demographic/military/political developments of Israel's neighbors. It is more than a little surprising, for example, to read that Israel conducted treaties and other intercourse with its old nemesis, Egypt, when pressures on other fronts became precarious. It should be recalled, too, that from a pagan/secular vantage point, Israel had lost its virginity the day that Joshua led his armies across the Jordan to claim a settled populace by the sword. It was a nation to be reckoned with, bought off, or subjugated as circumstances warranted.2 Kings also provides evidence of the internal social developments in Israel, for better or worse. Temple practice was developing a hierarchy of sorts, with inevitable innate tendencies toward structure and stasis. The need for radical revival may have been a major role in the Deuteronomic emergence of the two great prophetic figures of Kings, Elijah and Elisha. Elijah had figured prominently at the conclusion of 1 Kings, and his prot&eacute;g&eacute; Elisha, the \\"Man of God,\\" dominates the opening chapters of 2 Kings. Elisha's miracles are breathtaking, though even this gargantuan figure of the book seems to stand outside the currents of the historical flow. Hobbs does note, however, that Isaiah and other classical prophets were preaching in the final segments of the age of kings, prophets with a different emphasis and certainly a different style by the seventh century BCE.A third factor is the division of Judah and Israel. Already an accomplished fact at the opening of 2 Kings, Hobbs traces the interworking of north and south, a strange and lengthy period where two parallel monarchies claim a real, if at times tenuous, claim to the legacy of David. At times the two units worked together; more often, the weaker northern kingdom created innumerable economic and defensive liabilities upon Judah. It is a strange and ultimately fatal state of affairs, and neither the commentator of 1 Kings [DeVries] nor 2 Kings [Hobbs] in this series ever really approaches this arrangement philosophically. Hobbs goes to great pains to coordinate the dating of the parallel kings, but I feel this misses the bigger question.The end of the line of kings, north and south, comes to an end in approximately 588 BCE. The northern kingdom, not surprisingly, falls first. But Hobbs gives valuable background into a very confusing state of affairs. Judah was in effect already a vassal state of Assyria and found itself enmeshed in a seven nation fight for dominance of the region prior to the seizure of thousands of its citizens by Babylonia, a situation made worse by a belated and ill-conceived Judean revolt after the first transportation.Hobbs' volume appeared in 1986, and its sources range through the mid twentieth century. Although several more recent commentaries on Kings have appeared, I have not found any to have focused exclusively on 2 Kings alone. The quality of the work makes this a worthy investment with a valuable shelf life for the foreseeable future."},{"Title":"Word Biblical Commentary Vol. 13, 2 Kings","review":"A well written commentary on 2Kings. That is what I call a commentary of high standard evangelicalism combining both faith and scholarship and showing respectful treatment of biblical history. Hobbs considers 2Kings to be a composition of only a single author. For theological reasons the assumed author has placed emphasis on several topics - Elijah, Elisha, Jehu, Hezekiah and Isaiah, Josiah - from the source material available which he has dealt with more in-depth rather than other events more important in the view of modern historians. Hobbs offers a lot of explanations on the Hebrew, discusses different opinions, but focuses mainly on the major issues and has produced an in-depth commentary."},{"Title":"A few minutes past midnight: A Toby Peters mystery","review":"Mr. Kaminsky is one of the best cosy mystery writers in the business.His Toby Peters mysteries take place in the late 30's and early 40's.Lots of old movie, song, war and product trivia.He also wraps his mysteries around some old well known movie actor.The mysteries give you enough clues so you are miles ahead of Toby Peters in solving them.I especially like these mysteries as I was born during Herbert Hoover's presidency.Mr. Kaminsky's books are all great."},{"Title":"Holy Bible Liberty Family Heritage Edition [The Jerry Falwell Bible]","review":"The \\"Family Bible\\" is large 11\\"x9\\"x3\\" and over 1200 pages.

Yugoslavia was in second place (108/1,000). (If Europe's Jews are counted separately, then their losses are 545/1000, and Polish-gentile deaths are at 110/1000, still ahead of Yugoslavia).Hanson provides a solid discussion of German-occupied Poland before the Uprising. She details the murderous and exploitative German policies and comments: \\"An increasing nervousness accompanied the growth of German terror. A report written in March 1942 made the observation that as the occupation continued there was a greater breakdown in morals. This was at its worst among the youth. Children stole and Jew-baited, and smuggling, which was practiced by people from all walks of life, only contributed to the demoralization.\\" (p. 45). One wonders how many instances of Poles mocking, blackmailing, or denouncing Jews, automatically blamed on anti-Semitism, was actually caused by this pervasive demoralization.Hanson elaborates on public morale during the course of the Uprising. As the German siege and onslaught continued, the population faced increasingly impossible difficulties with the provision of food and water, sanitation, medical care for the wounded, housing of the homeless, etc. She discusses Underground courts and their sentencing and execution of Volksdeutsche and Polish collaborators (pp. 238-240), including \\"...Polish [Blue] policemen during the occupation, \`Granatowy' who had gone beyond the demands of their service in the interest of the occupier...\\" (p. 238)Hanson mentions the attitude of Warsaw's population in the face of what turned out to be Soviet perfidy: \\"The question was continually asked as to why the Allies did not force Russia to help Warsaw. Some blamed the Polish government. Suggestions were put forward for coercing the Allies into greater activity, e. g. Polish soldiers in England, France, and Italy should ignore all Allied orders, or wear black armbands in mourning.\\" (p. 138)As for long-term effects, she comments: \\"The bitterness felt by the Poles towards the Soviet Union as a result of the Uprising was very deep and it has left an indelible mark on the city and nation. This virulence was demonstrated publicly again in 1956 and 1968.\\" (p. 255). (Hanson's work, published in 1982, couldn't have foreseen the events leading up to and including 1989)."},{"Title":"The Civilian Population and the Warsaw Uprising of 1944","review":"This book will not be easy to procure anywhere except at the most well stocked library or ones that deal with Poland and World War II. As a work to buy, it is fairly expensive, probably because it is hard to find. It is based on Hanson's dissertation project and is concerned with how the population of Warsaw lived in desperate circumstances during the time leading up to and during the rising of 1944. Although the work narrows its title to the uprising itself, the author provides a view of how Poles organized their lives during the years of the occupation as well. This provides context for understanding and comparing life among the population before as well as during those 63 days. It also paints a chilling picture of the terror under which the Poles had to live before the rising, and how that terror did not stamp out their indomitable spirit.As a work of scholarship, this is outstanding for its thoroughness and its meticulous reference to copious primary sources, many of which the author had to translate from Polish in order to fulfill the requirements for her dissertation in England. Hanson is exhaustive in portraying life during the Nazi occupation and during the rising and what that day to day life looked like for ordinary Poles. It is amazing how many details are involved in maintaining a life, beginning at the foundation of Mazlow's hierarchy of needs and expanding beyond. Hence Hanson tells us under what circumstances Poles lived in their homes, their cellars, with blown out windows and no glass, what they ate, what they drank, how they communicated and the way that they tried to exist in myriad ways that many of us take for granted.Hanson is to be commended on taking on this project, which few have had the courage to do. I suspect that due to the utter devastation that followed the rising, that many sources that may have been valuable to such a stud were lost. But Hanson does the best that she can, and this stands as one of the only empirical sources on everyday life during the rising that has been published. This is not battle strategy or political strategy; this is struggle for survival and normalcy strategy -- if that makes sense. As such, it will appeal to those who are interested less in grand narratives of war, and more in how people make sense of their worlds when they are shattered. It is a celebration of life and human resilience.The book is well organized and divided into logical sections having to do with living conditions during and after the insurgency. She deals with life within each section of Warsaw (Old Town, Srodmiescie, Wola etc.) and how it played out during . With respect to how the book is written, it is always refreshing for me to read a piece of scholarship that is as accessible as this. Goodness knows, the subject of this work is hard enough to read, without it being written dryly. Hanson is a vivid writer and she writes with immediacy. Here and there she lets a hint of her sympathy for the plight of the Warsawians, but just as I thought I could criticize her for lack of objectivity as a historian in this regard, her subtlety and understated way of narrating actually seemed appropriate. Of course, I might not be the most neutral of reviewers in this respect.I did appreciate Hanson's talking about the tensions over the Uprising and bringing out the fact that although it had broad support, it was not universally endorsed by Poles. I do think that too often some of these tensions and the presence of disagreeable (and even dangerous) Poles among the population and among the insurgency are not given sufficient attention. She also deals with the issue of morale, and some of the reasons for why it waned in some subsections of Warsaw."},{"Title":"The Civilian Population and the Warsaw Uprising of 1944","review":"It is the 60th anniversary of the Warsaw uprising and the world still does not know much about it. Confused with the Warsaw Ghetto uprising more often than not, any and all publications are a welcome addition to the historians bookshelf to bring the self sacrifice to light.Hanson does an excellent job of describing the feelings, actions and life of the non-combatans invovlved in the 63-day battle. She appears to objectively describe but the positive and negative about how the population felt about the rising and their leaders.One short coming I feel is that there was not a chapter or two devoted to what happened to the population after the battle and what tragedies they suffered."},{"Title":"Fighting Finish: The Volvo Ocean Race: Round the World 2001-2002","review":"This is a visually stunning book, with hundreds of photos from the Volvo Ocean Race as well as past Whitbred races. The photos alone make this book a worthy addition to your library. However, there's also text, and while it isn't as in depth as I'd have liked, it still conveys much of the excitement from the races. The quotes from the racers are also well picked, and help the flow of the book."},{"Title":"The Fairytale Tarot Kit: For a Happy Ever After...","review":"Okay, I should say outright that I'm biased. I wrote the foreword for the book on this deck, and have followed its progress from before publication. But I didn't see the full art until it was published, and didn't try to read with it until then as well. The colors are stunning, bright and clear without being too dark or too pastel, and all the pictures truly have the quality of a story. While the art all holds together there are stylistic varations that evoke the different cultures. When I got my full copy I experimented with readings. I found that you can look up the story for the card in the book (which in itself is a terrific collection of retold tales from all over the world). But you also can see new stories in the pictures, letting the exciting scenes spark your own imagination. My favorite way to read with this deck is to ask questions like \\"What story am I in?\\" and \\"what story do I want to avoid?\\" We all tend to act out certain stories--or try to, such as the woman who avoids the messiness of relatonships because she is waiting for Prince Charming to sweep her away. The Fairytale Tarot helps us see the many *kinds* of stories we act out, and make conscious choices to enhance or alter or change those stories to enrich our lives. As far as I'm concerned, that is what Tarot is all about.I asked the cards what story we enter when we read with this deck. The card was the Page of Cups, the story for which is called Sadko. The picture shows an elegant young man who seems to have stepped off a dragon-headed sailboat. He holds a cup with a lid. The lid has tipped back because inside is a golden fish. When we read with this deck we sail to a magical world. The deck is like the cup. Open it and inside there are wonders. In the book the story tells of a musician bard, who sings to a lake and learns of a magic fish, that if you eat it you become young again. Most of us learned fairytales as children, and when we read from this deck we indeed can return to a childlike state of wonder and delight.So--given that the writer of this review is not an impartial observer, I hope people find it worthwhile."},{"Title":"The Fairytale Tarot Kit: For a Happy Ever After...","review":"\\"Fairy stories open out a parallel and hidden world in our own minds-and therein lies their power and fascination, and their great potential as a partner for tarot. Because after all, isn't tarot at its best, also a form of story?\\" - From The Fairytale Tarot companion bookLike the tarot, fairy tales weave layers of shadow and light, with interpretation often in the eye of the beholder. Containing brutality and beauty, the obvious and the ambiguous, the complexity of fairy tales seemed a suitable partnership to the tarot in the mind of Karen Mahony. The designer of The Fairytale Tarot, she and Alex Ukolov (illustrator) and Irena Triskova (artist) have created an exquisite set of 78 cards reflecting mostly European tales-in addition to several Asian, Indian, and Middle Eastern stories.Rather than merely grafting fairytales to fit Rider-Waite-Smith iconography, the Magic Realist Press team selected stories and designed images that are congruent with acceptable card meaning, yet expand these correlations into something more: a deck that is fresh, thought provoking, and potentially transformative.Blending the transcendent and the ordinary, fairy tales have captured the imagination of children around the world for centuries. However, The Fairytale Tarot doesn't \\"Disney-fy\\" the stories, making this deck decidedly adult. For example, the stepsisters hacking parts off their feet to fit into the glass slipper in Cinderella (The Empress) preserves the vision of the Brothers Grimm. Hans Christian Anderson's tale of The Little Mermaid (Nine of Swords) finds the mermaid permitting the sea witch to take her singing voice by cutting out her tongue in exchange for \\"legs...that felt like walking on knife blades.\\"Like life itself, both fairy tales and tarot reflect sorrow, sacrifice, betrayal, and loss-as well as the happier themes of marriage, recovery, justice, and fortune. As is often the case, some stories lack satisfactory resolution-and Ms. Mahony is sure to include several of these untidy tales which stir the imagination and beg for a closer look. However, even the well-known stories that are chosen-The Ugly Duckling (Ace of Cups), The Sorcerer's Apprentice (10 of Wands), and Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (Judgement) offer new, intriguing insights into the cards. This is in large part to the magnificent prose of Ms. Mahony, whose astute observations make the companion book a treasure in itself. But when these tales-many unfamiliar-are coupled with the exquisite artwork and illustration of Mr. Ukolov and Ms. Triskova, the result is truly magical.The Fairytale Tarot uses the suits of Swords (Air), Cups (Water), Wands (Fire) and Coins (Earth), with the Court cards following the Page, Knight, Queen, and King designation. Cards measure approximately 5 x 3 inches, and although the card stock is flexible, they appear to hold up acceptably. Nevertheless, I've noticed a few of the edges beginning to turn up, so you may want to take extra care with this deck. At first glance, the backs appear fully reversible, but upon closer inspection, they are not. However, since the design is rather intricate and filigreed, you'd only notice the position if you paid particular attention to the four corners.As previously mentioned, the Fairytale Tarot comes with a companion book: 232 glossy pages that feature a smaller version of the card image, corresponding fairy tale, keywords and phrases, Ms. Mahony's adept commentary, and additional artwork. Several spreads, with interpretations, are also included, as is some historical background and a bibliography. A unique addition to the companion book is a tale created for the 10 of Coins by Rachel Pollack. Ms. Pollack did not know the original tale and used the picture to suggest a fresh story culled from her own imagination-The Girl Who Was Too Shy. In the book proper, Ms. Mahony provides the actual tale for the 10 of Coins-The Goose Girl by the Brothers Grimm.As a professional Tarot reader, I've used The Fairytale Tarot the last several weeks with great success-especially with a 3-card Life Purpose spread using a \\"separated\\" deck (dividing the deck up in Majors, Courts, and Minors). My clients report amazing accuracy, and reading with this deck has been a joy. The expressiveness of the images lends itself to personal intuitive interpretation, and the tales themselves add depth to readings. There are many symbolic \\"jump off points\\" in the Fairytale Tarot!I thoroughly enjoyed reading the companion book, especially discovering new tales and gaining fresh insights into several tarot cards. Some of the tales-such as The Nightingale and the Rose (3 of Swords) and The Constant Tin Solider (10 of Swords) were positively heartbreaking. Other stories-such as The Emperor and the Nightingale (The Emperor) and Water and Salt (Temperance) seem ordinary at first (as far as fairytales go!), but their lessons add depth and breadth to these two Majors. I look forward to re-reading the tales and working further with the Fairytale Tarot. Kudos goes to Ms. Mahony, Mr. Ukolov, and Ms. Triskova for creating a most delightful deck! It may not be a good deck for beginners, but for those who enjoy the complexity of fairytales, it is a very readable, very engaging deck.(To see 10 images from The Fairytale Tarot, visit the Reviews--Decks section at [...])Janet Boyer, author of The Back in Time Tarot Book: Picture the Past, Experience the Cards, Understand the Present (coming Fall 2008 from Hampton Roads Publishing)"},{"Title":"The Fairytale Tarot Kit: For a Happy Ever After...","review":"I got these cards just as a collectibles. Or so I thought. When I ordered them, I already had The Tarot of Prague from The Magic Realist Press and had a very strong connection to it. I was convinced I'd never use another deck. Still, my life-long love of fairytales and the quality of the Prague deck compelled me to send for this deck too. Just for curiosity's sake - I wasn't actually planning on reading with the cards, I was only going to add them to my collection. Well, that theory was pretty much blown out of the water as soon as I actually saw these cards: there's no way you can have this deck and not want to use it.Visually, this is an entirely different deck from my beloved Tarot of Prague. True to what the name promises, The Fairytale Tarot is a deck of illustrations for a wide assortment of fairytales. Beautiful illustrations. The rich and vibrant colours and the luminous quality of the cards are perfect for the fairytale worlds the cards portray: they are magical and somehow mysterious yet without being dark. And, much care and thought has clearly gone into marrying the style of each illustration to the part of the world each tale comes from be it Asia, the far east, Russia, or central Europe among others.But I don't just like this deck because it allows me to revisit the world of fairytales I read as a child. I've been using the cards for several months now and I actually love reading with them. Yes, doing a multi-card spread takes a bit more time than with a standard Rider Waite facsimile, but the readings gain so much new depth from the fairytales that the extra time is well compensated for. My readings have gained a whole new layer of meaning as I find the themes of the stories, so intelligently linked to each card, greatly embellish the cards' traditional associations. Plus, I generally don't do a reading of more than five cards anyway so, for me, this deck works wonderfully.I definitely recommend the book as well. Even those who aren't familiar with the stories, and there are many stories that will be new to even fairytale experts, can learn all they'll need to know from the book. And, as with Karen Mahony's other writings, the book is witty and wise and wholly enjoyable to read. It gives an excellent synopsis of each story used as well as providing the traditional meanings for each card. When I first got these cards I went through them one by one, reading a different story each night- a treat at bedtime.If you're considering this deck because you a) like fairytales or b) you like lovely illustrations or c) you're looking for a new slant to your readings, these cards will not disappoint.

A small press located in Prague has created another thought-provoking and interesting Tarot deck. I have been a student of Tarot since 1972 and a lover of Fairy Tales since I learned to read-my mother gave me the un-Bowderlized Grimm and Anderson complete tales in first grade. When this deck arrived on my door step, I wanted to study it in depth, so I agreed to be the Deck Moderator on an internet group. The more I think about the cards and the tales chosen and ponder the way they work withinthe Waite-Smith system, the more impressed I am with the amount of thought which went into this deck.The art is delightful. It follows the Czech-Eastern European tradition-edgey and weird, which I like.

The colours are perfect - it's not bright, like the inner child cards - nor pastelly - but neither is it dark. The book gives the tale behind each card - there are some I knew, and many I didn't. I recommend buying the kit, as the tales give more to the meanings of the cards.Is this a Rider-Waite clone? I have no idea. You'd need to visit one of the many tarot review websites to get their more professional opinion - I'm just a collector of cards with beautiful artwork - not an expert.The cards are made nicely too - reversible backs, nice stock which should stand up to use. And the book has an illustration of each card at the beginning of the relevant story, which is a plus for me.Note: This is definitely not for use with children, like Inner Child and the other fairytale deck by I can't quite remember who.

Anyway, I ordered in November, and no reply from anyone. :("},{"Title":"The Fairytale Tarot Kit: For a Happy Ever After...","review":"A friend gave me this deck as a birthday present. I was had high hopes for this deck but have to admit that I'm dissappointed. The art is okay and I know the vintage illustration look the artist was going for, but for me it just seems a bit too stilted and forced. There are some nice cards, but one the whole I found the illustrations dissappointing. I could probably still read with it, but it does not draw me in.Another big issue is that while I was flipping through it, I noticed that I had 2 of one of the cards. After checking through it carefully I realized that one was missing. I asked around and found that this has been a problem with the initial printing of the deck. Lucky me! :( I don't want to hurt my friend's feeling so will probably just hang on to the deck, but any thoughts of reading with it are now gone.It's not a bad tarot deck, but I think it could have been done better. The companion book has some interesting backstories for the cards, but seems like it was rushed to print. I can't recommend it though because there is no telling if you will get the complete package or not."},{"Title":"Aging is NOT an Option!","review":"This is a very good, common sense book with a goal of taking you step by step to a more healthy and longer life. It convinced me that each of us has significant control of our health and quality of life. While the book's 10 step plan is not painless, it is not terribly difficult either. The results are very much worth the effort. In my opinion, using natural and common sense methods to promote better health is far superior to having to rely on drugs and medications. The author uses some &quot;interesting&quot; humor throughout but the message is clear and critically important. I am very glad I read the book."},{"Title":"Aging is NOT an Option!","review":"There are no big secrets in this book, but there's the very obvious stuff that we choose to ignore.

I recommend this book to anyone (and everyone... Oh yes), both as a &quot;what if...&quot; science fiction tale (of which there are few good ones being written these days... shame on those authors who jump on the disater bandwangon peddling asteroids and deep impacts for quick cash), and as a indepth look into what some would save and some would leave behind if the world was indeed going to be destroyed. A shame it can't be bought right off the shelf in any bookstore.

Indeed, this paramount science fiction creation was as captivating as it was definitional for the disaster genre it founded, but after reading book two I was left with so many questions. Who were the Other People? Were they still alive? Were there more survivors from Earth? More and more questions left me wondering . . . why didn't Wylie create a third novel?Deciding to answer these questions for myself, I began putting my thoughts to paper, and another story began to unfold. After realizing the scope of the project I was getting into, I decided it was time for a rewrite, and I started writing the story to present to an audience.Now complete, the third and final novel of Philip Wylie's phenomenal series is available for print and Kindle. This dramatic, action packed finale to the series is titled \\"The Terrans of Beta\\", and is nearly the size of the first two books combined. Don't miss out on the conclusion to an epic adventure started nearly 80 years ago. As a true fan of Wylie's works I have gone to great lengths to pay homage to his original creation while elaborating on the original story. Let's hope Paramount Pictures pays the same respect to their 2012 remake of the original 1951 film.People who bought \\"When Worlds Collide\\" also bought \\"The Terrans of Beta\\" as you can see on Amazon-suggestion link above (links provided below too, Kindle on bottom).

Now, kudos to Bison Frontiers of Imagination for republishing this fantastic work -- both When Worlds Collide AND After Worlds Collide in an omnibus edition! The movie -- great fun though it may be -- doesn't do the first book justice in the least, and the equally exciting and absorbing sequel is ignored. The books were written in the 1930s and apart from a few scientific miscalculations -- remember, they were only guessing at the time! -- the book is remarkably believable. The awesome spectacle of the first book is followed by the fascinating scenes set on Earth's successor planet, Bronson Beta.

Well, here is another point of view about this book. It was written during a major Depression in the world economy and many people were in desperate conditions. WHEN WORLDS COLLIDE took people away from their own issues and thrust them into a new reality. For me, the book has served as a place to turn when you need to flee things for a while. It has that power with its sequel - AFTER WORLDS COLLIDE. Keep it tucked away as a safety net that will help you get through hard times. It works!"},{"Title":"When worlds collide","review":"I've enjoyed this book since I first read it back in grade school almost 50 years ago.

I will continue to read my newly acquired copy of the stories (yes, both books are contained in the Bison printing) every few years.But there are weaknesses. The dialogue is overwrought to the point of silliness (example: the frequent use of &quot;Oh&quot;, as in the following quote when the valiant band of survivor/explorers are being attacked by an armed mob: &quot;Fall back! Oh, fall back!&quot; Can you really imagine someone saying it that way?). Also, you may forgive the social/political angle of the second book, but the denouement seems very rushed, as if the authors had to speed up to meet a deadline.But the descriptions of Bronson Beta and its cities, by themselves, make this story well worth reading. Although flawed, this is indeed a classic."},{"Title":"When worlds collide","review":"I wasn't much of a reader when I first picked up this book in Junior High School, but it quickly grabbed my interest - I couldn't put it down!

This book is a well written classic which reads like a documentary, with the lifes, fears, loves and other emotions of people attempting to try to escape the doomed Earth.

It detailed the efforts of rocket scientists to build a rocket to escape a doomed earth.That did it. I decided I wanted to be a writer. I sat down and wrote my two-page epic \\"Third Company Advance.\\" This told the story of an infantry commander who orders the third company to advance and \\"it '''felt good.\\"My father, the former World War II infantry company commander upon whom I patterned my fearless lead character, was delighted with my work.

Finding a Pocketbook edition of When Worlds Collide, he gave it to me.

This remains great science fiction."},{"Title":"When worlds collide","review":"Philip Wylie and Edwin Balmer have produced possibly the earliest of global disaster novels. The most frightening thing about this book is its plausibility; there is the ever-present danger it could very well happen! If you read this story, you'll be well-prepared to view the George Pal 1951 film of the same title which is loosely based on this novel, and appreciate its presentation. Two more recent films, &quot;Deep Impact&quot;, and &quot;Armageddon&quot;, appear to have been inspired by this book."},{"Title":"When worlds collide","review":"It must seem repetitious when looking at all these five star reviews, but it deserves it, as does its brilliant sequel, After Worlds Collide. Even when the book is so clearly dated -- it was, after all, written in the 1930s -- it is nevertheless riveting. I can only concur with the many other reviewers in calling for a reissue of this book -- preferable in an omnibus edition with its sequel (as in fact has been done in the past). And if only Steven Spielberg would work on doing a remake, not only of When Worlds Collide itself, but its remarkable sequel, perhaps updating it and correcting the (remarkably few!) scientific flaws.

In April of 1972 I was fortunate enough to find When Worlds Collide and After Worlds Collide published in 1 book, published by J.B. Lippincott Company It is bound as 1 book with both books in it. Both are about 340 pages long. To me After Worlds Collide was the better of the 2 books, but you need the lead-in When Worlds Collide to prepare you for After. I was intrigued by the old civilization found on the new planet. Especially since this was written in the 1930's. A super combination book. A REAL CLASSIC !!!"},{"Title":"When worlds collide","review":"It's remarkable how well this book holds up after 70 years. It's not exactly =hard= science-fiction, and it emphasizes a lot of social issues, which is probably one of the reasons it has aged so well. Most importantly, it tells the story expertly, with a good amount of suspense and intrigue (and a lot less misanthropy than can be found in the excellent film adaptation).The sequel (&quot;After Worlds Collide&quot;) on the other hand, is =far= more dated, thoroughly permeated with '30s notions of nationalism. By today's standards it's more than just politically incorrect, it's borderline racist. But that aside--and it doesn't serve to try to read old novels with modern prejudices--it doesn't have the same sense of urgency (the impending doom of all mankind) found in the first book."},{"Title":"When worlds collide","review":"I read this book, for a class; we were supposed to pick any book we wanted to. Me not being into reading books that much, went into one of our cupboards in our living room. There I started looking thru some of the books my dad got at a Library sale. This when i found the book entitled &quot;When Worlds Collide&quot; I open it up thinking its going to be about something that is metaphorical, i was wrong. This book is literally about 2 worlds colliding. I started reading it, right there on the floor and i couldn't stop reading it; i was reading the book in school, at times when i wasn't supposed to be reading; like history class. I read all day all night, I didn't want it to end. I read this one part i still remeber in history class, the description of the mathematician, was spot on just like me. I did notice some fallacies in the book, about space, and the spaceship being made out of a material that is radioactive, but i thought nothing of it since the book was so old, they wouldn't be able to know certain things about space. I kinda read over the part really fast while they were in space, because of the schema i already had about space.I read the whole book in before the project was supposed to be completed, thats when i realised, that i was only about half-way thru the book. It didn't say on the cover, it did say on the inside cover it contained, both &quot;when world collide&quot; and &quot;after worlds collide&quot; I did not know this, so when i reached the second book, i stopped; I didn't want the book to end. I later read the second part, it was great, it was just like how i would imagine exploring a new planet would be. I did think the ending of the second part was little too abrupt, i was somewhat dissapointed of the ending, it seemed like they ran out of ideas and raced to the finish.One thing i did notice being different with my book was there were lots of spelling errors, and wierd symbols in the words. eg. &quot;&quot; they were all over and i had trouble finding the deffinitions for those words. I later found out that my copy is an original copy. So thats why there are all those spelling errors and stuff.This is truly my favorite book of all time, and it has brought me into the world of reading more than anything else."},{"Title":"When worlds collide","review":"I found this an enjoyable listen over all (I listened to the Audible audiobook version), however the writing style is is quaint, highly embellished and somewhat stilted to 21st century ears. In fact, I can't believe people actually spoke like that in the 30's. The narrator does an excellent job of interpreting it, reflecting the formal tone but embellishing with good characterisation. The formality of the narrator's tone took some getting used to it, but once I realised it reflected the writing style, I appreciated it far more.The science is quite outdated - pre-space travel and pre-nuclear trying to imagine both. It must have been thrilling when it was written and while even to layman's ears is obviously wrong, it doesn't detract from the story and the search for a suitable casement for the nuclear reactor adds to the tension. A novel set in the 21st century would be very different, but probably wouldn't have the same drama as technology would be at hand to overcome many of the obstacles. The 1930's, however, provides a far more challenging and thus interesting setting.I'm looking forward to the sequel."},{"Title":"When worlds collide","review":"This book, written prior to World War II, presents a quite dated look at the end of the world. A pair of runaway planets are on a collision course with earth. The world is doomed--but humanity might have a chance to survive, if the best and brightest minds in the scientific world can succeed in building a spaceship to take a few lucky pioneers to resettle on one of the approaching planets.Without question, this book was ahead of its time in a number of respects. The description of space travel, for example, is remarkable, given that the book was written more than a decade before the earliest high-atmosphere rocket launches. Likewise, the use of atomic energy in the book predates the actual use of fission power by a number of years. The apocalyptic genre is similarly prescient; nowadays, this kind of book is everywhere, but in the 1930s, prior to the doom-and-gloom days of the Cold War, the end of the world was not something too many people were writing about.The writing quality, narrative style, and characterizations all betray the book's age. One glaring example of this is the main character, who is horribly sexist, bordering on misogynistic, and this is portrayed as perfectly normal and acceptable. This is doubtless a fairly accurate depiction of society's view of women at the time, but it's distracting nonetheless. I found myself rolling my eyes at least once a chapter.The story itself is pretty good, particularly the imaginative natural-disaster scenarios that play out as the planets approach earth. As \\"modern\\" society descends into chaos, only the strongest and smartest survive, and the authors did a good job of showing what that might look like.When Worlds Collide is a worth reading if you enjoy science fiction, particularly early science fiction. It's not exactly on a level with Ray Bradbury, but it's a good story and will hold your interest."},{"Title":"When worlds collide","review":"I remember clearly going to a Saturday matinee as a child to see the movie version of this book. It made a huge impact on me and I went to the library so I could read the book. I loved it, but time passed and I forgot all about it except that it fueled my love of science fiction which I've pursued my whole life. I was very excited to see that the book was available again, so ordered it from Amazon - I just had to have it in my library. Nostalgia aside, it's clear when reading it that it influenced many books and movies that came after it. That said, some of the references are jarring to a 21st century reader. References to the hero's \\"Jap\\" servant, a comment about Prohibition and the realization that neither the Great Depression or the Second World War had occurred when this was written (1933) though there was a passing reference to Hitler, do make one realize just how much attitudes have changed. When the earth is totally destroyed by a roving planet and an \\"ark\\" is created to carry people to a new planet, the only minority included is the before mentioned \\"Jap.\\" Nevertheless, it's an amazing, imaginative book of it's time, reflecting prevailing attitudes. If you can get past some of the references, you'll enjoy it and even search out the sequel, After World's Collide, by the same authors."},{"Title":"When worlds collide","review":"Like so many people who have read this book, I too have read it many times. It is that type of book. I read it the first time as a young boy, and over the years (when I can find a copy)I read it again. It captured my imagination from the beginning and has not let go in over 40 years. I believe this book, with its vivid scenes of catastrophe, and its portrayal of the triumph of human ingenuity, affected me deeply for the rest of my life. This book illuminates ones imagination, sense of wonder and longing for adventure. I heartily recommend it for readers of all ages, and sincerely wish that this book will be published again for a new generation.

While there was a satisfying resolution, I have always wanted to know what happened to this brave new world in the making after the story ended. I did not enjoy the 1951 movie, though many people did. Someone, please reprint both of these jewels!"},{"Title":"When worlds collide","review":"The school nurse recommended this book to me when I was in the fifth grade. It was the first science fiction book I ever read. After Worlds Collide was the second one. Like many other people, I re-read these books at least a dozen times--and would love to read them again. With all the recent talk of &quot;near miss&quot; (we hope!) asteroids in our neighborhood, these books would be of particular interest to lots of people who've never heard of them. They need to be back in print.By the way, if you haven't seen the movie---don't bother. Someone might be able to remake it more true to the book (in which case I'd check it out), but it would probably be just another dumb disaster film. I'd rather see a film version of After Worlds Collide. I still explore those cities in my dreams....Another book I read back in the fifth grade was Earth Abides, by George Stewart. It, too, is timely albeit for another reason. An unknown disease destroys most of humankind. No miracle cures just in time to save us---just a few survivors, and what happens after that. Much of the story takes place in the San Francisco Bay Area, which made it very real to me when I read it in 1960. Sometimes, when the bridge is not crowded I still look for a certain abandoned car.... I'd love to see this one made into a film, too."},{"Title":"When worlds collide","review":"Like many others, I too first encountered (and read for the first of many re-readings) When Worlds Collide and its sequel After Worlds Collide when I was in seventh grade.

Even by today's standards, it is an excellent example of sci-fi cinematography. It is a crime that this is not available for purchase.

Worth). But I am in constant look out for this book. I fell in love with reading just by reading this book"},{"Title":"When worlds collide","review":"This is one of the books I read from the library of my home town as a youngster that started my addiction to science fiction. I loved it then and would love to find a copy of it! I've periodically searched but I've never been able to find it in either hard cover or paperback. Anybody know where I can find a copy"},{"Title":"When worlds collide","review":"I discovered this one when I was in 5th grade. Buying it now, 30 years later, I was worried that it just wouldn't hold up. To my delight, it stands up to the test of time magnificently.We've seen movies and TV specials in the past few years on the impact of some cosmic body with Earth (Deep Impact, Armageddon, Meteor). Balmer and Wylie did it decades ago, and did it on a scale and with an attention to (then-current) detail that's still staggeringly convincing, if dated, today.Written before WWII (1933 and 34), When Worlds Collide features the destruction of the Earth in the most complete manner possible, and focuses on the efforts of a few people to find a way to escape that destruction. The manner in which they do so is brilliantly thought out and detailed, the progressive deterioration of both society and of the Earth itself is heartwrenchingly chronicled, and the final flight from the doomed planet is a classic. Yes, we have super-science, purple prose, and sometimes overly-simplistic characters (not to mention outdated concepts), but this is an example of the Golden Age that can still stand on its own. It DEFINED the disaster novel, and set the bar so high that few who came after even dared attempt the grand scale that Balmer and Wylie achieved. The sequel has its own charm, a combination of aftermath and exploration, with some eerie scenes that still give me a bit of the creeps to read."},{"Title":"When worlds collide","review":"Many of the earlier reviews on this site call for a reissue of the sequel, \\"After Worlds Collide\\". Please note: BOTH STORIES, \\"When Worlds Collide\\" and \\"After Worlds Collide\\", are contained in this paperback version. The title is misleading because it only includes \\"When...\\" -- but both stories are there.Other reviewers have correctlly noted that there are some scientific inaccuracies, and some 1930s political and social views that seem out of place today. Who cares?! This is a wonderful story. In part 1, the authors concoct an excellent apocalyptic scenario. And in part 2, their conception of the alien planet is brilliant.This is a very well-told yarn."},{"Title":"When worlds collide","review":"Probably the best science fiction story of all times! A &quot;gas giant&quot; planet about the size of Uranus was dragged away from its original orbit around its sun in a distant solar system by a passing star, perhaps millions of years ago. Also dragged away was the gigantic planet's satellite, an earthlike planet. The two bodies retain their original orbital influence and wonder for eons, frozen in the absolute zero of space, until they come close enough to our solar system and are pulled in, attracted by the gravity of our own sun, their speeds increased several times in their endless travel through space. Star gazers soon discover that at least one of the newly discovered bodies will collide with and destroy the earth. Upon being discovered by a South African astronomer Professor Bronson, the two bodies are named by scientists after its discoverer. The larger one, the gaseous &quot;Bronson Alpha&quot;, will destroy the earth, so a Noah's Ark rocket is built at a franctic pace to provide escape of 100 chosen would be travelers, so they can start a new life in Alpha's companion, the earthlike &quot;Bronson Beta&quot; which will replace the Earth in its orbital position. Time is of essence in this classic sci-fi thriller which should be remade by Hollywood in state or the art computerized special effects and sound!"},{"Title":"When worlds collide","review":"Two rogue planets, one the satellite of the other, are heading directly toward the earth. The scientists who make this horrifying discovery have a plan to save a small remnant of humanity.The story is engaging enough that I was content to suspend my disbelief at the implausibility of the disaster and especially of the opportunity for survival. Much of the entertainment value of the book is in its being old: news of the impending disaster is spread by newspaper; atomic power is being hastily developed; and the attraction between two main characters is expressed only in passionate kisses.There's plenty of apocalyptic fiction I'd recommend over this (e.g., \\"The Road,\\" \\"Earth Abides,\\" \\"The Stand,\\" and \\"Alas, Babylon\\"), but \\"When Worlds Collide\\" is entertaining enough for a rainy Saturday."},{"Title":"When worlds collide","review":"I first read this book more than thirty years ago. I have read it many times since and it will always remain on my list of all-time favorites. This is a book in the tradition of Verne and Wells in that it brings many basic scientific principles to life and makes them understandable to the reader.Against the backdrop of universal disaster, Wylie and Balmer manage to tell a story that has real human dimensions. Love, hate, ingenuity, and compassion all play out here in characters that will truly engage the reader. Furthermore, the scope of adventure the book gives will compel the reader to keep turning the pages, eager to see what happens next. In this way the book is a true success. However, for the discerning reader, the story also raises some perplexing and even disturbing questions, giving it a depth that mere adventure can't.My career as a geographer and mathematician can trace its genesis to one book, and that book is WHEN WORLDS COLLIDE. So I personally owe its authors a great deal, and so does all science-fiction because this book epitomizes the genre's greatest strengths."},{"Title":"When worlds collide","review":"I first read When Worlds Collide/After Worlds Collide in the 1960's, while in junior high school. They were my introduction into what I considered adult science fiction, and I was hooked! After thinking about them for years, I finally ordered them, hoping the books would not disapoint so years many later. The themes are just as current today, though the prejudices and some science are certainly outdated. I highly recommend this book for pleasurable reading as well as a look into science fiction writing from the 1930's. Note that this volumn contains BOTH books bound together."},{"Title":"When worlds collide","review":"This book and its sequel are two of the greatest sci-fi books I have ever read and read and read. I have re-read them at least 5 times since I first read them as a teenager. In fact I still have the books I bought as a teenager!It's a monumental epic struggle to save the human race and the trials and tribulations of a group of scientists as they prepare to save the human race. It's also a look in to the dark side of man when faced with annihilation and too much time to contemplate it.I would recommend this book and the second book, After Worlds Collide, to anyone, you won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"When worlds collide","review":"This is a true science-fiction classic. The reason is simple: it is plausible. I first read this story almost forty years ago when I was in junior high school, and in the intervening years, it has lost none of its' fascination for me. I especially was taken by the sequel. The basic story is this: an astronomer discovers two planets from outside the solar system that are on a collision course with earth. One of them is a gas giant the size of Uranus, the other is a planet similar to earth, which will be destroyed. The other planet will assume the approximate orbit that the earth had. The scientists of earth build space vehicles in an attempt to save the human race. When I heard it was back in print, I orderd a copy and was very happy to find that the sequel was included. After Worlds Collide deals with the adventures of the people who land on the new planet.Some of the criticisms of these books are somewhat understandable. For example, the dialogue is sometimes--to be charitable--unrealistic. And the absence of diversity will offend some. There were only whites and Asians mentioned, and the &quot;Asiatics&quot; were, for the most part,the villains. Ignoring these relatively minor flaws however, still leaves a story that fascinates.One disappointment in the Bison reprints is that they do not have the maps of the new planet in it, but I am still glad it is back in print.If your local bookstore does not have it, order it. I doubt that you will be disappointed."},{"Title":"When worlds collide","review":"Once the reader remembers that this work and its sequel, After Worlds Collide, were written in the 1930s prior to WWII the imagination of Balmer and Wylie regarding space and rocket development, as well as the psychology of the &quot;hate cultures&quot; was brillant. As a young man my imagination soared while reading these novels. The screen play discarded too much of the character development available in the the book. I strongly urge any lover of good science fiction to get a copy for a great read. I only scored the original as 4 stars, but if you are fortunate to have &quot;When&quot; and &quot;After&quot; to read concurrently, then you will have a 5 star experience."},{"Title":"When worlds collide","review":"Though this book was written back in the thirties and has a very strong political bias, it's got an ingenious idea and an exciting and realistic plot. The existence of the human civilization is threatened by an asteroid which is about to collide with Earth. Frantic preparations begin to save the mankind from disaster. Read and see what happens.This novel has a follow-up \\"After Worlds Collide\\" which isn't good at all."},{"Title":"When worlds collide","review":"Back in July 1969 when we had landed on the moon, just about every TV station was showing science fiction movies.Our local ABC station played two movies back to back - 'Satellite in the Sky' and 'When Worlds Collide'.I watched both with youthful amazment but it was 'Worlds' that really caught my imagination.Two years later when I started high school I blundered in to the book in the library. It was very different from the movie and I found I liked it better than the movie. Much to my surprise the book also had 'After Worlds Collide'The dreams I had about living on the new planet and in the domed cities....I wore out two paperback copies over the next thirty odd years.The books were written almost eighty years ago and although a bit dated in science and dialog are still a good read.I am very happy that Amazon had this copy and I enjoyed them all over again."},{"Title":"When worlds collide","review":"Countless books have been written about the end of the world, it's not a new concept. Back in the 1930's it was. What War of the Worlds did for the alien invasion concept, When Worlds Collide does for end of the world stories. Truely brillent novel! Too be sure there are some outdated ideas as one would expect for a novel written 80 years ago, but considering the scienctific understanding and what was the social nornal at the time it's very believable. The desription of space ship construction is almost NASA-like. Interesting Biblical references without being preachy which is not the norm today as well. There are few novels where the end of the world really means the end of the world like When Worlds Collide. Apocalyptic desrciptions of destruction in heart renching detail that have a very modern fell to it.

It was the first long book I really enjoyed and finished. It's science fiction. That's what was so astonishing, because I never did like that kind of genre.

I would recommend this for all ages."},{"Title":"When worlds collide","review":"I gave this book to my 14-year-old grandson, who is a Sci-Fi fan, for Christmas.

An American original whose theme still resonates almost 80 years after it was first published."},{"Title":"When worlds collide","review":"I thought this was a very interesting book. Around 80 years old, it gives great perspective not only into the scientific knowledge of the time, but also to the cultural biases that existed. 80 years is less than some lifetimes yet so much has changed...That said, while the story moves along at a good pace, I never really found it to be very fun to read. The characters were a bit cardboard I thought, simple solutions were often applied to complicated problems, and often the actual action - the resolution of conflict - was done in as little as a simple sentence (for example the resolution of the Tony / Eve / Ransdell triangle).I would recommend this book to anyone with some interest in classic science fiction, or in apocalypse stories. However expect more of a simple ride through an interesting story than a deep, thoughtful book."},{"Title":"When worlds collide","review":"This is one of a handful of books I've read twice. Wonderful for introducing a young person to science fiction. I've also read the sequel, which I delightfully discovered in a second-hand store. It is also quite good."},{"Title":"When worlds collide","review":"It just doesn't get better than this. I had of course heard about this book all my life but somehow never got around to reading it. The terrific Bison series has reissued it, and so I finally got my chance. There are actually two books here, the second being \\"After Worlds Collide.\\" Amazing but true: they are equally wonderful, each in its own way.The first book delivers on its promise to depict the end of the world. That's not so easy to do! Furthermore, I found the underlying science to be surprisingly plausible and even timely, given our new understanding of how asteroids and comets have shaped Earth's history and could do it again. Yes, the characters are all two-dimensional, and of course various social details are dated. But the plot is so compelling that: who cares!Anyway, the first book leaves you hankering for more, and the second book more than satisfies that hankering. Again there is edge-of-your-seat adventure. But for me the overriding pleasurable impression is of mystery. I won't give away the details, but suffice it to say: they are an excellent surprise, and I wish this had been a trilogy! Nevertheless, the book is actually more true-to-life in that some things remain unanswered and unknown. Really, the mysterious aura of the second book provides a kind of satisfaction in its own right.Now I've got to find other books by Wylie!"},{"Title":"When worlds collide","review":"I first read this back in the early 80's and because of it, fell in love with science fiction.The book describes the death of the Earth in horrifying detail. The Noah's Ark theme is classic, where a group of survivors board rockets (arks) in order to escape the destruction of the planet. All in all, the authors give a good story, rich with adventure, emotion and incredible new worlds.Not perfectly explainable in terms of science, but enjoyable even today."},{"Title":"When worlds collide","review":"I too read this book when I was young boy.

RileyTIME'S ENDAmErica House, Baltimore, 2001I like science fiction when it does the following: (1) tells a cautionary tale of what happens when science goes off on a tangent, producing more detriments than benefits; and (2) spins an absorbing adventure of good guys vs. bad guys (like Westerns have done in previous eras). TIME'S END is a great example of both.The scientific scenario is premised on a totalitarian regime that society adopts in the aftermath of cataclysmic natural disasters and widespread social collapse. High-tech restores a semblance of civilization, but only at the cost of extreme social control through massive surveillance, hermetically-sealed living quarters, drug-induced compliance, and thought-control for and by the elites. The result is that people live a &quot;timeless&quot; existence -- hence the title TIME'S END. If all of this reminds you of certain current tendencies, that's exactly the point -- this is a projection of where trends could lead if the public continues to shirk its civic responsibilities.The adventure pits an accidental hero from the hinterlands against the establishment in the form of its leader, the chief of security, the head of the death squad, and various and sundry other evil antagonists. As the hero runs for his life and eludes the authorities, the structure of the system and the unsavory character of the villains is revealed by way of their paranoiac responses and vicious tactics during the chase.The establishment's ongoing problems, both with the hero and other situations, stem from the typical combination of bureaucratic lethargy and elitist arrogance. This is something all previous totalitarian societies have encountered, and it provides a continuing source of both ironical humour and insouciant hope throughout the story. And in the end, the battle between the forces of repression and freedom continues, albeit on significantly changed terms.The pace of events is fast, the action engaging, reciting of trivial details is eschewed, and sentimentalizing of motivation is avoided. The book is an enjoyable read, and I stayed up until one o'clock in the morning to finish it. AND it would make a great science fiction movie."},{"Title":"Time's End","review":"This book, set in a very near future, sets out a scenario of where societiesmight go if we continue to abuse drugs and technology in society.

Martin Van Creveld concisely covers the entirety of warfare in a way that allows the reader to reasonably understand the subject matter in a very short amount of time. The pictures are well-chosen, beautiful, and evocative of the periods they represent. This book is a fine addition to the library of a military professional, a historian, or a layman. Excellent purchase!"},{"Title":"The Art Of War: War and Military Thought","review":"War has been both a hugely important activity and a challenging subject for thinkers. This very good historical survey of military thought gives you a sense of the kinds of challenges that war presents to a thinker. The author is described as Israel's most prominent military historian with fifteen books on military history and strategy to his credit, and it is clear that he has actually carefully thought about the subject. Besides indicating the things that must be considered (for instance, understanding the enemy's strengths and weaknesses as well as your own, the political effects of violence, and technology), he attempts to describe what each of the chief surviving documents on military theory (by Sun Tzu, Clausewitz, and others) has contributed. There are nice descriptions of the changing nature of war. There is a helpful time line, an annotated list of thirty-four leading military thinkers, a decent index, and a list of recommendations for further reading. I found two minor faults: He repeatedly mentions \\"operational art\\" as intermediate between tactics and strategy without offering any clarifying definition of operational art to go with his definitions of the other two, and he lists Grotius' \\"The Law of War and Peace\\" in the time line but neglects to mention it in the text or the index. I suppose the misleading phrase \\"tactics, operational art, and strategy\\" is just an unusually sloppy attempt to introduce the question of lines of operation, a feature of war that he eventually points out first became important in the eighteenth century."},{"Title":"The Art Of War: War and Military Thought","review":"This book covers the most important parts of the history of the art of war (war strategy). The only thing missing is that the military theorists of this century are not mentioned, maybe because Martin Van Creveld is one of them and does not want to name his \\"competitors\\". I especially miss the mentioning of Boyd.Overall this book is awesome. If you want to know about strategy this book is it. He, Martin Van Creveld, makes good judgement on what is important and what is not and the book is an east read."},{"Title":"The Art Of War: War and Military Thought","review":"To echo the comments of reviewers &quot;wanchob&quot; and &quot;a reader from Israel,&quot; Martin Van Creveld has done exactly what he stated he would in presenting &quot;The Art of War.&quot; Long on breadth and short on depth, this work touches on the ideas of the most well-known military theorists in history. It is a good starting point for new students of military history, and a convenient reference. I was pleased to see a listing of notable military thinkers at the end of the book, as I was a list of suggested further reading.Once the reader has absorbed what Creveld has to say, they may seek a more detailed analysis of war in, for example, Donald Kagan's &quot;On the Origins of War&quot; (Anchor Books, 1995). For a discussion on a true theory of combat, a good companion work is Trevor Dupuy's &quot;Understanding War: History and Theory of Combat&quot; (Paragon House, 1987)."},{"Title":"The Art Of War: War and Military Thought","review":"This work by van Creveld is part of the History of War series from Cassell and is edited by notable historian John Keegan. It attempts to cover in single readable volume the development of military thought from ancient to modern times. Such a broad &quot;Military Theory Survey 101&quot; is necessarily shallow in depth. It is notable for several points: 1. It discusses Eastern theories of warfare from the ancient Chinense and other non-European viewpoints. 2. It discusses naval (Mahan, Corbett) and air power theories (Mitchell, Duhuet). 3. It gives proper credit of the concept of &quot;total war&quot;, that is a whole nation or peoples in a struggle, to early civilization, such as the Romans.Unfortunately because of the shallowness, it has occasionally, a &quot;if it is chapter 5, it must be Clausewitz&quot; feeling of hurrying along. It drops tantilizing clues about some controversies - i.e. was Liddel Hart really an proto-theorist of maneuver warfare or was it a post-WWII creation? Were air power theorists of the 1920's predicating the effectiveness of strategic bombing on the use of mass destruction weapons? (for their time, 1920's, gas bombs)Finally though there is a wonderful map showing how the campaigns of the One Hundred Year's War were fought not just along political/geographic lines, but also along available areas for plunder and forage, much more could have been said about the rising importance of military logistics, especially as van Creveld is an expert in this area.In short, an excellent survey of the major ideas in military thought. All of the usual suspects are there, Sun Tzu, Clauswitz, and Mahan along with those thinkers more usually associated with the world of politics. If you have to blitz through 2,500 years of theory in one night, this is the book."},{"Title":"The Art Of War: War and Military Thought","review":"Martin van Creveld has impeccable references as a much soughtafter military analyst. This book does what it is suppose to do - that is to introduce the subject on the Art of war to lay readers. I think that he does a decent job of summarising military thoughts and theories from various sources and there are no major surprises in his coverage. I was unclear as to whether the coverage was mainly theoreticians or practitioners of the art. The author states the former. Given the title, I would have thought that it should include the latter also.However, there is a some uneveness in the scope in specific areas. I was surprised that the following examples were not featured: Nathan Forrest 'get there fustest with the mostest' maxim; General Guderian's thoughts on Blitzkrieg; General Rommel's book on infantry tactics; Lawrence's ideas on guerilla warfare; Hap Arnold's on carpet bombing and so on.The text is also not rigorously edited. Poor sentence construction include various subjects leading to ambiguity, numerous conjunctions and phrases which lead to confusion. I had to do constant double-takes to understand the flow of the narrative.The pictures also do not necessarily complement the text and includes poor captions in some instances."},{"Title":"The Art Of War: War and Military Thought","review":"I thought The Art of War was an good book - albeit slightly different than what I expected. Its literally a basic survey of military theorists, not a survey of military practice (this can be very weird in terms of structure since major conflicts are usually skipped over - everybody being too busy fighting to write much about war).A quick read (many of its pages are devoted to large and completely irrelevant illustrations and historical paintings), I thought it was disappointingly light in articulating the core theories of the many theorists it discusses (the maps describing key battles which supposedly illustrate key principles of the various theorists are uniformly awful). Its other great weakness is the author's continual need to gloss over details \\"which everyone must know\\" despite the fact that the tone and depth of the material is clearly aimed at one who has no knowledge of the subject whatsoever (like yours truly). Thus the reader is 'spared' arguably unnecessary details such as who stole credit and back-stapped who after the Second World War, but also spared even a brief biographical sketch of Clauswitz (all the more baffling because he considers such information critical to the understanding of many other theorists).Yet I still liked the book and thought I met my basic needs. Overall I think it presents a very balanced and necessary broad picture of the history of military theory, and I now feel completely comfortable diving into, The Art of War, On War, Strategy, etc. Knowing more or less what period of history they fit into, what those who followed thought of them, how those writings influenced actual conflicts an what conflicts they came from. In short, twenty dollars well spent to bypass a year of reading and cross-referencing just to get a good context for my studies. I really wish this book really delved into detailed explorations of the theories (with good examples and illustrations please!) in which case it would have been easily worth twice the price."},{"Title":"The Art Of War: War and Military Thought","review":"This book by Van Creveld might disappoint his hard core followers. But not me, or the general public, to the broader audience for which it was intended.So here we have a very good description of the evolution of military theory and strategy. The basic outline of chinese military thought, of Onasander, Frontinus, Asclepiodotus and others from antiquity util the middle ages, puts things in perspective. Then the author takes us on a excursion through the Middle ages,Machiavelli, Guibert, and some others until Clausewitz.The importance of Jomini, Liddel Hart, Mahan, Ludendorff and many others is briefly outlined due to the nature and purpose of the book. At the end, for those that want to further explore, the author also has basic suggestions. Those that criticize this book for the brevity of the exploration of certain periods or authors, miss the point. Not everybody can read the direct sources and not everyone is involved in waging war.For those who seek an understanding of how military thought evolved to the present stage, this is the right book to start with ( or to end, if you are not seriously committed to the matter at hand)"},{"Title":"The Art Of War: War and Military Thought","review":"Martin van Creveld is one of the better military historians of the last half-century or so. He writes clearly and intelligently, and produces books that are timely and innovative. He has at times gotten himself into controversies with various other authors over his interpretations of events, but he does at least think innovatively and ananlytically. If he has a weakness as a writer, it's that he's too scholarly for the general public, and his ideas are therefore somewhat inaccessible.The present volume is an attempt at an overview of the progress of military theory, as opposed to the evolution of warfare itself. It is structured, therefore, as a review of each work on warfare, one after the other in turn. As another reviewer noted, this leads to the weird phenomenon of a book about warfare (indirectly anyway) which jumps right over both World Wars without a blink. The author also attempts to keep to his subjects (the works themselves) and as a result gives the lives of the writers short shrift, at some points. Also he avoids discussing several controversies much (notably the question of how much influence Liddell Hart *really* had on the German Blitzkrieg) claiming that they've been dealt with elsewhere. This is no doubt true, but since this is supposed to be an introductory volume on the subject, saying this without even directing the reader to another volume is a bit annoying.Taking all of the above into consideration, I enjoyed this book a great deal. Why not five stars then? Well the book is peppered with illustrations that are only marginally connected to the text of the book. Some of them are portraits of military thinkers or generals, and are reasonably worthwhile, though one that is supposed to be Sherman looks more like Grant. But also there are many elaborate maps (a standout feature of the Cassell History of Warfare series) and here they have nothing to do with the text and are superfluous. The only thing they do is take up space. The last one, for instance, depicts the war in Bosnia, and that's not even mentioned in the text at all, really. So I enjoyed the book, but I would hope they would rerelease it as a monograph without the useless pretty pictures."},{"Title":"The Art Of War: War and Military Thought","review":"This book is a very good starting point to anyone who wishes to gain a basic knowledge of military theory. The book covers all the major periods of history - ancient China, ancient Europe, the Middle Ages, Modern History, with a chapter on Naval Warfare theory, and a chapter on war from 1945.The author, as he states, meant the book to be broad rather than deep, and this is certainly true. Although all important military theorists are present, many are dealt with in rather short order. In addition, van Creveld makes no attempt to explain the various concepts used in military theory, focusing more on the development of theory and the distinction between tactics, strategy and grand strategy.The book is well writen, and has many helpful illustrations and pictures. Those who have previously read van Creveld will easily identify his unique style, including asides. I especially enjoyed van Creveld's discussion on Fuller and Lidell Hart's importance in 20th century military theory.In addition to the index and short sketches of thinkers, there is a nice list of further suggested reading.To sum up: If you want an introduction to the development of military theory and its main thinkers, this book is very good. If you want to deeply understand the various concepts employed in military theory - this is not the book for you."},{"Title":"The Art Of War: War and Military Thought","review":"Martin van Creveld is one of the better military historians of the last half-century or so.

That said, however, Creveld's book provides a very decent, very solid introduction to and overview of military thought, and I do think that this was the purpose of the volume--to make the material accessible and enjoyable to a very broad audience.The opening timeline, I thought, was extremely helpful, and the illustrations throughout were, contrary to what some others have said, quite useful and also very vivid. The maps, diagrams, paintings, and photos definitely enhanced the text. All the greats are here, and their ideas are seen in practice and also placed, if briefly, in their broader political and social perspectives.For those already well versed in military history and strategy, you will probably want to look elsewhere (unless you're a Creveld devotee or like lots of illustrations peppered throughout your history). But if you're looking for a dependable, not-too dense overview of the history of warfare, I would certainly recommend this as a safe starting point."},{"Title":"The Art Of War: War and Military Thought","review":"This book is visually impressive, but too brief and light to get a reccomendation from me. Van Creveld and Keegan are real heavyweights, and two of my favourites. Perhaps it is only because I consider their standards so high that this volume is a disappointment."},{"Title":"Margaret Sanger: Father of Modern Society","review":"One of the modern world's most controversial and influential women, Margaret Sanger certainly shaped the entire artificial birth control industry and the abortion establishment.Drogin's relatively short biography, complete with family photos and cuts from the Birth Control Review, contrasts Sanger's methods, propaganda and prevaricative style with the relevant pronouncements and personae of the Catholic Church, from which she apostasized early in life. The book emphasizes her racist and eugenic tendencies, not her disciples' favorite topics.If one is seeking a balanced or hagiographic approach, this is not a book to read by itself. The author is occasionally witty, but mostly outraged at a woman who led a quintessentially outrageous lifestyle. Drogin, surely with tongue in cheek, does record the eulogy given at her funeral by the late Reverend George Ferguson, rector of St. Philip's in the Hills Church of Tucson: &quot;all the elements of sainthood were personified many times in her life.&quot; Either the Episcopal divine meant &quot;exemplified,&quot; or he was accusing her of multiple-personality disorder."},{"Title":"Margaret Sanger: Father of Modern Society","review":"Excellent pamphlet. Well written and well sourced. Gives and accurate telling of all the hard truths about Margaret Sanger and the abortion industry known as Planned Parenthood, as well as all their motives. The author would know firsthand as she experienced the &#34;free&#34; lifestyle encouraged by Sanger, full with an active sex life as well as an abortion; she experienced this prior to her own conversion giving her research and writing plenty of validation. If the founder of Planned Parenthood is such a racist, eugenicist monster, how can the very organization she founded and instilled with her own principles be so different? Drogin certainly gives the reader plenty to think about."},{"Title":"ISO 9000 Requirements, 92 Requirements Checklist and Compliance Guide","review":"The author does a decent job explaining ISO requirements. Contrary to the other reviewer's claims, there are \\"no\\" examples in the book. Another useful tool would have been examples of ISO systems / process flowchart. Instead, the author tries to get you to buy his software if you want to see any example at all. I give the book 2 stars because it tries to do marketing instead of doing it's job of giving buyers useful information.Based on the title of the book \\"ISO 9001 Requirements\\", the author did do his job explaining what the requirements are.

Lois Duncan did not fail to entertain, and even creep the daylights out of me in the modernization of Daughters of Eve, which was first published in 1979. Truthfully, I was not expecting the dark, edginess that was present in this book, but I thought that it was brilliantly done and not all to unreasonable which is what made it so scary.The thing that makes Daughters of Eve such an additively creepy read is the change that comes over each of the girls throughout the book. The majority of them go from being nice, easy going girls (and very naive) to callous vengeance seeking crazies. I loved how Ms. Duncan made the changes so subtle that their new personalities just slowly crept up on you, and when they snapped and went berserk it was like watching a train wreck and you just cannot help but stare.Generally, I don't like books where the main theme is feminism. They typically rub me the wrong way because the majority of the time the story runs in loops and never progress, and it just seems like a way for the author to get on their soapbox, so while one of the biggest themes in Daughters of Eve was feminism it didn't come across like most books. Ms. Duncan, in my opinion, did an excellent job of adding in feminism without shoving it in your face and making you wish you were reading anything else.The theory behind the group at school, Daughters of Eve, was interesting; a group of girls who would be like sisters to one another and loyal to each other as well. But take that same close knit group of naive, pliable girls and throw in one who is embittered against the whole male population and you have the makings of the trouble that begins to brew with the newest additions to the group. The DoE's turn towards that dark is what had me unable to pull my eyes from the page because it was kind of creepy to see the whole thing unfold and how much of an impact those few months had on the lives of each of the girls.Since Daughters of Eve follows more than one character, I'm just going to mention one or two of them.My favorite character would have to have been Tammy. I liked her because she was the only one who thought that they had gone too far when the Daughters of Eve began taking revenge upon the men/boys who had wronged them. while I liked her for that, I wish that she had had the nerve to report them since each attack seemed to escalate in destruction.In the first half of the book I really liked Madison, I thought that she was a great character because she seemed to have a lot of inner strength. So I was very disappointed when she fell in with the rest of the girls on taking revenge on those who wronged them. It was especially disappointing because she was in some ways one of the worst offenders, even though she had plenty to be angered over.What I liked the best about Daughters of Eve would have to be (hands down) Lois Duncan's writing. Her writing style never fails to pull me in to the story and the lives of her characters, and she is one of the few authors whose books I would pick up without even bothering to read a synopsis (because she hasn't disappointed me yet).If I had to peg just one things about Daughters of Eve that I didn't like, it would have to be the end of the book. Now don't go and get me wrong, I thought the ending of the book was really good, I just would have liked to have seen them have to pay the consequences for all the things that they had done. Although, I did really enjoy how there was an epilogue and you got to see what happened to each of the characters.Final Verdict: Daughters of Eve a absolutely creepy read about sisterhood and the poisonous influence of one of their own. An absolute page turner.Daughters of Eve earns 5 out of 5 pineapples."},{"Title":"Daughters Of Eve","review":"Having been a long-time fan of Lois Duncan, I went into Daughters of Eve expecting a lot less, and a lot more. In many ways, the book is exemplary of Duncan. In others, it is completely different from anything she has ever written.She normally does a good job of telling stories from multiple points of view, and Daughters of Eve is as good an example of this as you can expect to find. Daughters has not three or four, but ten! main characters. The problem with this, of course, is that it makes it almost impossible to remember who's who, and to keep track of everything going on.Duncan's plots are normally fairly hard to explain without plot spoilers, and Daughters is no exception, so suffice to say, it's about a group of girls who get some bad guidance from an prejudiced adult, and the resulting consequences. It's not an action oriented story, and there's not really a whole lot here that quantifies this book as a thriller. Most of the book is occupied by telling of the injustices perpetrated against the girls in this book by men and their overreactions to them.Many reviewers have hammered this book for \\"not portraying reality,\\" and making feminism look ridiculous. However, these reviewers are mostly mistaken. Duncan is not trying to make feminism look ridiculous, and name one book by Lois Duncan that does portray reality. The main theme of the book seems to be, that people should be careful not to take ideas to extremes. The girls in this book have some genuine complaints against the men in their town, but instead of trying to help these girls to solve their problems, their teacher teaches them to hate men and as one character in the book puts it, \\"You're treating them the same way you think they're treating you!\\"Ok, so the book has some flaws. Some of the characters are implausible, as are some of the events of the book. It's not your typical Lois Duncan book in that it doesn't have any key story line, but rather concentrates on the girls in the Daughters of Eve over a year of adjustment. But it tackles fairly weighty issues in a simplistic way, and has good messages about family, love, and life. It doesn't make a point for feminism or against it, nor does it come over as overtly against sex before marriage or abortion. (I won't state my own opinion on these issues, because that's not what this page is here for.)The ending is the most shocking ending I have read in any of her books, but it loses some of its power due to the epilogue inserted immediately afterwards. Overall, a dark dreary book that asks hard questions and gives hard answers. I would give the book a three out of five, but I think that Daughters is at least as good as all of her other books, and therefore doesn't deserve the fairly low rating that it receives on this site.PS: Being a teenage boy, I found this book slightly less relevant than I think most teenage girls will.Conservative parents should be warned that there are some sexual themes (a boy seduces an overweight young woman and then dumps her; another young woman ends up pregnant after spending the night with her boyfriend; None of this is described very explicitly, but there are some sexual references) and language (half a dozen or so s-words and about that many b-words. The word \\"screwing\\" is used in reference to sex.) in this book. Also, due to the nature of some of the issues faced in the book, I think, although listed as a novel for twelve and up, that it is more suitable for fifteen and up because it has more relevance for this age group."},{"Title":"Daughters Of Eve","review":"At Modesta High School there is a chapter of the Daughters of Eve who are sending out invitations for their new members. They have a new teacher, Irene Stark, who is going to mix things up a bit--you know--really get things done. With Irene leading them, this social club quickly turns into a group of girls who will test their social and moral boundaries at every chance they get.I actually had a hard time with parts of the book. The extreme levels that were taken had me with the feeling that these ideas gave feminism a bad stereotype. I started the book thinking it would be milder but Duncan definitely has you questioning the actions of some of the characters.I couldn't wait to get to the end (and boy did it end with a bang!!) to see if I would feel better about their actions. I am pleased to say, when I closed the book and though about their actions as a whole, I was kind of in love with it. I think Duncan was right in writing it with the extremes she did because she smacks you with something that you MUST think about. Irene may be a bit insane at times, but haven't we all been there? I remember literally seeing red after a comment about women from a guy in college. I was literally blind with rage and wanted to punch him--I didn't punch him, but I guess I'm a softy that way. The point is that the book was a bit extreme, but I get it.The best part was that Irene reminded me of a college professor I had for Women's Studies. She had that passion and enraged fire that made you want to go out and change the world. I love that when I closed the book I felt like I had just gotten out of one of her lectures.This is an excellent book that may have you questioning both sides but the important thing is that it will make you think."},{"Title":"Daughters Of Eve","review":"This book is well written, but there are flaws about it that make it seem too extreme. Although some might find that attractive, I found it too farfetched. Despite its strong sense of feminism and anti-discrimination, which I support, I thought it took that message too far. When violence erupts, and the end subtly parallels problems of the beginning, it seemed like Lois Duncan was supporting all the events that occurred. Also, the characters' situations, although their problems are problems of today, seemed to the EXTREME. The daughter's of Eve decisions that followed were very irrational and overdramatic. However, I suppose that is why the book keeps its fast-pace.However, if Lois Duncan truly wished to convey the sense of \\"environment and situations can greatly influence a person\\" she should have changed some of the events' outcomes to reflect a positive lesson learned. This might have more of an impact upon the reader, rather than having them complain about the book's flaws in an Amazon review.Overall, I think that one should read it due to its interesting plotline, but should remember the book's decisions are somewhat illogical and extreme."},{"Title":"Daughters Of Eve","review":"I have to say, out of all the books 've ever read, this is at the top of my list!

Another girl, Kelly Johnson, is angry about her parent's divorce. And Bambi (my favorite person- she is so smart and strong) is being pressured and lied to by her jerk of a boyfriend.

I put it down. I may finish it someday, but I'm not sure. Hope this helps!! :) mwazxOx Krista Marie"},{"Title":"Daughters Of Eve","review":"I have high opinions of Lois Duncan as a writer. She has written several thrilling stories including Daughters Of Eve. Though I wouldn't consider Daughters Of Eve a suspenseful drama, I would consider it a dramatic mystery.It all starts when the most popular club in school is assigned to a new leader, Irene Stark, who has a malicious hate and relentless grudges towards all men. Her past is haunted by a confrontation at her old school where she taught another Daughters Of Eve chapter, when she was forced to resign and replaced by a male. Bitterness run through her veins as she is put leader to another Daughters Of Eve club in a school called Modesta High. While comforting her students through their troubles and teenage problems, she at the same time brainwashes all of them into believing all men are trying to dissolve woman's rights to be independent.Her sly words and sneaky exploitation builds the same kind of hate that she feels for men instilled into the girls of Daughter Of Eve. When one of the girls leaves town after trying to commit suicide because a boy broke her heart, the Daughters Of Eve takes drastic actions in creating revenge. This leading to other kinds of horrible plots and broken friendships towards all men that they accuse of doing wrong. Making awful accusations to not only men, but to the innocent.And when another girl leaves the group because she feels the club is becoming too violent and deceptive, Irene doesn't only do what she can to keep the girl quiet, but also telling lies to the other girls in the process of her manipulation.Even though this isn't one of Lois Duncan's most suspenseful books, it is one of my favorites."},{"Title":"Daughters Of Eve","review":"This book was really good with a intricate plot, but it took a while for the plot to heat up. i think i was two-thirds into the book until i found a real plot and some adventure. it is i treasure for those who take the time to read the whole book."},{"Title":"Daughters Of Eve","review":"I really liked this in-depth book by Lois Duncan.

It helps them to know that they are never alone as long as they have each other. They are sisters. Their group consists of seven girls who all have their own talents or problems. They take on three new girls who have some skill or problem, yet are alone, or have no one to talk to. Men and boys they know or love mistreat all these girls throughout the story. Their leader Irene, who is the teacher during school hours, but sister after school has been hurt by men plenty of times and she feels that they need to pay for all the wrong they have done. She convinces some of them to go on the warpath for men. This novel was a pleasure to read. It made you kind of wonder if men really try to discriminate against women when they think they or their friends could do a better job.

However, this particular book gets average marks not only for lack of characterization, but lack of discernible logic. Irene Stark is an art teacher at Modesta High who also organizes a girls' club called &quot;The Daughters of Eve&quot;. Irene, you see, was mistreated by dear old dad and various boyfriends, etc., so she has an extremely low opinion of men and is a rabid feminist who uses any example of unfair sexist behavior as further evidence that ALL men are scum.The problem? Well, this brainwashing cult stuff might work if there are no other outside forces influencing the girls, and if the girls are susceptible to the idea that there are no POSITIVE examples of males in the world. In this case, it's a big stretch to assume a group of bright, &quot;cream-of-the-crop&quot; girls wouldn't see Irene for the loon she is. Nevertheless, this book is written as if the general population of the small town of Modesta, Michigan, never got out of the 1950's. The only one who senses Irene's insanity is &quot;psychic&quot; Tammy, and she doesn't use plain old logic to notice this; she has visions of BLEEDING CANDLES, for God's sake. It takes her far longer than it should to realize her teacher has a screw loose, even with ESP. She can predict who her best friend will marry, but doesn't notice a raving lunatic in front of her. Some psychic.However, that still makes Tammy one up on the rest of them. Fran, the &quot;brain&quot; of the group, doesn't even catch on to Irene's lack of mental stability until the group decides to take up organized violence as a hobby. Some honor student, huh? Ann, the &quot;artist&quot;, is given a dilemna that's insulting simply because the advice Crazy Irene gives her is presented as the &quot;feminist&quot; viewpoint. Hopefully, most readers will realize that feminism has nothing to do with the &quot;rights&quot; that Irene advocates, but Duncan is unfortunately very hazy with the correct viewpoint that women want equal rights but are NOT man-haters. (Only one character, Fran, is representative of this idea.)Meanwhile, there are too many unnecessary characters, in my view. Most likely, Duncan tried to populate the club with every possible stereotype: brain, beauty, artist, Miss Sensitive Psychic, athlete, musician, fat (of course) lonely outcast, lone girl in a family full of MCP's, daughter of domestic abuse victim, and bitter, disillusioned daughter of recently divorced parents. Ten major characters! Geez, couldn't Duncan have combined a few of these, such as give the MCP family girl musical ability, make the recently divorced parents' daughter the beauty of the group, domestic abuse daughter becomes the athlete, etc. It's not as if the characterization goes any further than that anyway. And some of these names have got to go, like &quot;Ruth&quot; (archaic), &quot;Jane&quot; (generic), and worst of all, &quot;Bambi&quot;! Who, other than a porno star, has a name like that? Just let her be 'Kelly', let the MCP girl be 'Holly', 'Paula' can be the athletic/domestic abuse daughter, and 'Holly's' boyfriend in the book can be Tammy's brother. What difference does it make? Too late now, but Lois, you could have saved yourself the time and space it took to create 3 extra cardboard characters and gave more dimension to the other 7, which is still a few too many MAIN CHARACTERS in my book. Better luck next time. And P.S. next time make sure your characters' names don't all SOUND alike. I mean, Holly, Kelly, Paula, Laura, too many L's. Not to mention RHYMING names like Ann &amp; Fran. Geez, no wonder readers here are mixing them up. Try names like Karen, Sandy, Heather, Diana, &amp; Amy--names that are DISTINCT from each other. Just a suggestion.As for the rest of the book, the male chauvinist pigs, particularly the Grange family and Jane Rheardon's father, are one-dimensional and downright hateful. Unfortunately, that makes it difficult for the reader to see how irrational Irene and her group is, because the MCP characters don't generate any sympathy whatsoever. The few male characters who ARE positive are not featured prominently enough, so they get little sympathy as well. Overall, the plot showed promise, but the execution...well, was literally an execution.The annoying aspects of this story notwithstanding, it's still worth checking out of the library. If nothing else, Duncan's ending proves she has a wicked sense of irony. Consider the object mentioned in the last paragraph and the usual &quot;domestic&quot; image that one conjures from it. That image will be forever altered in the reader's mind."},{"Title":"Daughters Of Eve","review":"What a fascinating page turner! I loved the various charactors in this book and the plot was great! I also loved the surprise ending. The book is great from the first page to the very last page. Daughters of Eve is definately one of Duncan's best books. It ranks right up there with &quot;I Know What You Did Last Summer&quot; and &quot;Don't Look Behind You.&quot;"},{"Title":"Daughters Of Eve","review":"I was very dissapointed when I read this book because I have loved all of the other books Lois Duncan has written. The plot is all about getting revenge and it puts down women so much that it really seems out dated."},{"Title":"Daughters Of Eve","review":"I liked this book. I really did, but i didn't like how all the characters ended up. The book could have ended way differently, but over all it was an OK book. i wouldn't recommend this book to a friend though."},{"Title":"Daughters Of Eve","review":"It's been so long since I read this book - I have the original - with the girls on the cover - this is one of my all time favorite books and thought it's been over 20 years since I read it (I reread it 1000 times) I always considered this her best - I forgot she had written it until I was reading Ann Rule talk about the death of Ms. Duncan's daughter (in real life) and then I went over her books and thought - THAT WAS HER - I just remember one part vividly when they (SPOIL ALERT!) shave the boys head...but I was haunted by the characters and for some bizarre reason as a teen wanted to be a part of the daughters of eve....not much of a review because I am having trouble remembering it - but I just remember it being my absolute favorite book ever when I was younger,,,"},{"Title":"Daughters Of Eve","review":"I can honestly say that I think this has been my favorite audiobook that I have listened to so far. The narrator's voice was awesome. I was able to distinguish between all of the characters that were speaking. She really was able to get her voice to sound just like the guys. I was in awe.The book starts off introducing each character and it does not take the listener long to realize all of their different situations. Next, we are introduced to The Daughters of Eve society at their monthly meeting. Daughters of Eve is a national organization that holds fundraisers, dances and raffles to raise money for their school. You need to be invited by invitation only and the club is very exclusive. It is considered an honor to be invited.\\"I pledge myself to the spirit of sisterhood--and to warmth of friendship. I promise to do my best--as a member of the Daughters of Eve-- to follow the code of loyalty, love and service--laid out for womankind since time's beginning--and to divulge to no one words spoken in confidence--within this sacred circle.\\"The listener needs to remember that this book was originally published in 1979 when it was believed that a womans \\"place\\" was in the kitchen barefoot and pregnant. So, there are a lot of feminist aspects to the writing. The twist of the story begins when one of the \\"sisters\\" is hurt by a boy at school. The rest of the club decides to take matters into their own hands. They begin to believe that all men are against woman and it does not take very long for the situation to spiral out of control.At first, I was not really bothered by what the girls were doing. Pete actually had it coming and I agree that they should have taken Niles down with him. But, as the story went on, I could tell that it was only getting worse! I have to give kudos to Tammy for sticking up for herself!My favorite part is that the author does not let the reader hanging and actually lets us know what had happened a couple of years down the line after the fact. It was interesting to hear what turn each character took with their lives and if their time with the Daughters of Eve had impacted them at all and their decisions.In conclusion, I would just like to tell the boys out there to beware! Never cross a bunch of girls, you never know what could happen:) LOL If you are looking for a great read and would like to gain back some confidence in woman, this is the book for you!Audiobook given by Hachette Audio for this review."},{"Title":"Daughters Of Eve","review":"Lois Duncan is an amazing author and she really out did herself with Daughters of Eve. It kept me wondering what was going to happen next and I keep rereading it!"},{"Title":"Daughters Of Eve","review":"I loved it! The ending was awsome, I give this book two thumbs up! I don't understand the bad reviews. They were probably expecting something like her other books, which it isn't anything like them at all!"},{"Title":"Daughters Of Eve","review":"Lois Duncan is one of my favorite authors. Although I have read most of her books Daughters of Eve is by far my favorite. There are many characters including Ruth Grange, Laura Snow, Jane Rheardon, and Tammy Carncross. Even though there are many characters I believe Duncan still develops each character well enough for you to feel like your part of their lives. Also Duncan intertwines each of their lives with one another creating a more realistic relationship between the characters. The whole story in general unravels very slowly, but for me it kept me interested because I kept wondering what would happen next. The plot of the book was about a teacher Irene Stark, and a group of students in her club (Daughters of Eve) at Modesta High. In order to be a member of the club you had to receive an invitation in the mail. Most of the girls asked to join the club their family's (mostly their father figures) either didn't care or didn't understand the idea of the club. Irene is a feminist who was mistreated by her father as a little girl and never was in a good relationship. So, Irene with her strong views about men persuades the girls to do some pretty bad things to make up for Irene's past.The only down side to this book are that because there are so many different characters and so many different scenarios and things to remember it is hard to keep all the characters straight. I often got confused and had to go back and re-read to remember what happened to whom. But even though that was a set back the book was still worth reading and I have read it about 10 times since the first. So I highly recommend going and checking out this book at your library."},{"Title":"Daughters Of Eve","review":"I read this book a week ago, and liked it a lot, but there were times when I didn't know who was who. There really isn't one main character, it's all of the members of Daughters of Eve. This book is still a good read."},{"Title":"Daughters Of Eve","review":"This book was really wonderful! I am a huge fan of Lois Duncan and I found this book, along with &quot;Ransom&quot; and &quot;Down a Dark Hall&quot; to be among her best! Buy this book...you won't regret it."},{"Title":"Daughters Of Eve","review":"Lois Duncan does a wonderful job comparing the jobs of men and woman in this realistic story. You can feel the pain in the characters as they begin to realize that the world they used to know and feel comfortable with is really a big sexist world out to take advantage of women and girls every where, or so they are told. This book is very well-written and so are many of her other books."},{"Title":"Daughters Of Eve","review":"This is one of L. Duncan's best! The characterizations are excellent, the plot is tight and fast moving and the messages (about cliques, elitism, revenge, and following the &quot;pack&quot;) are timeless. I would recommend it to any teen. Like the other reviewer, I've loved this gem for years!"},{"Title":"Daughters Of Eve","review":"I LOVED this book when I was 16. Loved it, loved it, loved it. I was totally drawn in by the horrible way the Grange family treated their only daughter (horrible-realistic, not horrible as in a horror film). I was quite \\"into\\" all 10 girl characters and disagree with the assessment that 10 is too many, although I did have to read the book several times in order to keep all ten of them straight. I was enchanted by the love story between Ann and Dave, and impressed by the very real social issues addressed in the book. Besides, I was in Rainbow Girls at the time and so I totally identified with a group of close-knit girls in an organization tied to dementia.Yet the book didn't stick with me. So many of the books I read in my childhood and teens are still wonderful to me today--books by Roald Dahl, Cynthia Voigt, L. M. Montgomery, and countless others. With Daughters of Eve, I lost interest after a few months and have never bothered to pick the book up again. Come to think of it, the characters ARE pretty flat and unrealistic. Why would Irene turn into THAT much of a nutcase, fighting men instead of injustice? Why is she apparently hiding the fact that she has a Ph.D.? And how did she earn it so fast? Is any family as really, truly sexist as the Grange family? I think Duncan made a great ATTEMPT to make her characters human, but I think she fell short of her goal.In summary, this book is great entertainment, but it isn't literature."},{"Title":"Daughters Of Eve","review":"When I was 13 or so, I read a lot of teen horror books by the likes of R.L Stine and Christopher Pike. When I found &quot;Daughters of Eve&quot; in the teen thriller section of the library I decided to give it a try--the copy I found had a blood stained candle on the cover and the description sounded &quot;spooky&quot;.Well, as I found out, R.L. Stine this ain't. I agree with the reviewer who wrote that this book is extremely mismarketed. It's not a teen thriller but a complicated story of misogyny, relations between men and women, and radical feminism. The underlying message is that a good cause (women's rights in this case) can be so severely distorted that it achieves the opposite of what it is trying to accomplish.Young readers who wanted a &quot;scary&quot; story and gave this book bad reviews should wait a few years and give it another try, this time with different expectations."},{"Title":"Daughters Of Eve","review":"This book is about an exclusive club at a high school called Daughters of Eve, that is really more like a cult. It has a lot to do with feminism, once the new teacher advisor Irene comes into the picture, and starts influencing the girls in the club to do bad things. Such as hurting people, and destroying classrooms of sexist teachers. Overall this is an excellent book, and I recommend it to anyone who is a fan of mystery/thrillers."},{"Title":"Daughters Of Eve","review":"THIS IS A GREAT BOOK.

I mean please, Lois could have done so much better! There was also no climax it seemed."},{"Title":"Daughters Of Eve","review":"Rachel MayA Club of HorrorDaughters of Eve by Lois Duncan can easily be an addicting book to read, even if you are one of those readers with little tolerance for sitting down and spending time to read, you will be hooked. It takes place in the town of Modesta, Michigan in a medium sized high school. It was a typical school setting except for the fact of the club they had, The Daughters of Eve Club. This was a mysterious club that no one could enter or even be considered for membership unless, it was approved by all previous members. The leader of this club was Fran Schneider. She ran the meetingsand decided what to do. Fran was the most popular girl in the school. There were other members like Ruth, who was also a popular girl,then there was Tammy Carncross. She was a loved girl by all members and others in the school. She was perfect except for one thing, she would get bad feelings about things. One day, at the meeting to initiate new members, she got one of these bad feelings and ran out. Due to this the new girls that were asked to join thought twice and others didn't know what to think. Later on, you find out what the bad feeling was about and why this was such an uproar. The club would never be the same again. The girls didn't know what they were headed for when they got brain washed by this club, and they all learned in the end. This was frightening and enjoyable story. If you like books like this it is a good one for you to pick up and read. Definitely a four star book."},{"Title":"Daughters Of Eve","review":"I thought the book had some good parts and som bad ones. The bad ones are that it got really annoying about all this female rights crap. But i know that was part of the book. To show you how the DOE turned from a simple club to a hateing cult. It also shows you what a adult can do to teens. If you had a teacher that let you trash people you dont like thats going to change the way you think. Well its all right but not her best."},{"Title":"Daughters Of Eve","review":"&quot;Sworn to secrecy. Bound by loyalty. It's the high school's most exclusive club--but now a twisted mind is leading it. Who will be the first victim?&quot; &quot;Wow! This book's going to be awesome!&quot; I thought. (Plus the blood on the candle on the cover) BOY, was I wrong! What happened here?! Lois Duncan can write much better than this! This is not the first Lois Duncan book I have read, but it is by far the worst. Okay. So she decides to write a book that shows how men can often mistreat women. Fine. I don't care what theme she decides to use, and I am not saying that some of the things that went on in this book don't go on in real life. The thing with which I had a problem was the way Lois Duncan displayed her theme in this book. I think she should have spent less time showing that women are mistreated and more time making the book interesting. I'm not saying that there should be something happening every second, but most of Lois Duncan's other books have been at least interesting enough to keep me reading, but this book was boring, and it wasn't interesting. The only reason I read the whole thing is because I kept telling myself &quot;it'll get good.&quot; But it didn't! It was pointless, and it went nowhere. The characters weren't well developed, and I didn't even care who was whom. Another thing is that the book struck me as brain-washing. However, this is just my opinion. As you may have guessed after reading this, I am not a girl. So this book may appeal more to girls."},{"Title":"Daughters Of Eve","review":"Daughters of EveThe book Daughters of Eve by Lois Duncan is one of my favorite books to read. It's filled with suspense, romance, and tragedies. The story takes place at a high school and at the girls' homes. A high school teacher uses her feminist strategies to control the lives of a group of girls with her hatred. The teacher despises all men for what they did to her in the past. Now, she wants to take revenge through the help of the girls which they have no idea what's going on. The girls believe that their teacher (Irene Stark) is one of their own as an older sister and understands what they feel. Irene's real intentions are to make the girls break-up any relationship with men.What I mostly love about this story is that it talks about romance most of the time. Romance to me is a really big turn on when I read books. I really hated the part where this popular girl dumps a good looking guy. I had a friend who also dumped this smooth looking guy. If I was this popular girl, I wouldn't break-up with him (unless, if he hurt me in some way).People should read this book from the viewpoints of females and learn one or two things about how women feel about men. There are some things in this book that sound so real and teach you how families act in real life (not in a dream world). It's the most realistic, detailed, and melancholy story I ever read. I can relate and visualize most of the events that have occurred in these girls' lives."},{"Title":"Daughters Of Eve","review":"Ok...I have read a lot of Lois Duncan books...in fact i've almost read all of them but this one was the worst...it had absolutely no plot and well just nothing to it!

There were a lot of grammatical errors and I was confused...no, disappointed by the ending. I felt betrayed. I did not like the idea of the evil teacher getting away with &quot;murder&quot;. The way the girls treated that boy, shaving his head and etc., was VICIOUS. Eerie. Sick. This book is being removed from our reading list at the school where I teach. At first, I thought maybe the parent was overreacting. I am not for censorship and I feel that children should be able to read whatever they want, within certain boundaries. However, in the aftermath of the highly publicized violent school shootings, maybe this is not such a good idea. After thinking about the content a little more, maybe it does need to be removed. I was just very disappointed in this novel. The ending was off and I felt there could have been a better resolution."},{"Title":"Daughters Of Eve","review":"I had to do a book report and I picked this book because I thought it would be about murder or something. I was greatly disappointed by the entire story. The characters were well written but that was about it for this novel. The feminism was messed up and taken too far. I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone. I only finished the book because I had to do a 75 point book report on it."},{"Title":"Daughters Of Eve","review":"I read Daughters of Eve for a required reading list and at first the book started off really good;most of the male characters seemed pretty realistic,like most of the guys you'd find at your local high school,but the female ones really need work.I don't think a character lyke Bambi would be that popular with boys in real life,no matter how pretty she was.I also think that this book needs 2 work on itz portrayols of peeps based on their looks.The media needs 2 change the way it portrays ugly peeps,and this book is no exception.Ugly people(Laura)are portrayed as dumb,gullible,and desperate,while beautiful people(Bambi)are portrayed as smart and clever.I also at times didn't get what the point of the book was.At first there seems to be intelligent discussions in the club but then it ends up getting all out of hand when violence happens.Is this book promoting feminism or making a statement against it?Overall though it was a good read,and I saw most of the characters in people I knew."},{"Title":"Daughters Of Eve","review":"I mean It had the weakest plot of any book I have ever read (and if you ask me that says alot!)

Sorry if I offended anyone.( Which probly didnt happen but u can never be to careful. What a Joke)"},{"Title":"Daughters Of Eve","review":"Daughters of Eve was one of the most interesting books i have ever read, but i wouldnt say it is good. I love how the characters r well built. But the moralo of the story, is there even one? is it that all men are sexist abusers? or not to listen to your art teacher? I really dont know.I could not believe how intensly developed the characters were. All of the girls and their parents, irene, peter,.When i was in the middle of the book i started thinking all guys were like the ones in this book. i started to question the men in my life and my position as a young women.At the end i was majorly shocked that nothing happened to Irene and that she just kept doing this to the club at school, and that Jane ended up in a mental hospital.!!!! wow. I really do think it is a must readw becuase of all the intense issues it raises, but dont go in it looking for a moral"},{"Title":"Daughters Of Eve","review":"I've been reading some of the reviews, and I feel I should point out in the book's defense that it was published in 1979. That explains the odd character names and much of the sexism that occurs. By today's standards, perhaps, what a lot of the male characters do seems unrealistic, but it wasn't so long ago that women were expected to stay home and raise the kiddies and put their families' needs first. It just seems like it happened way back in the Dark Ages.I do agree, however, that the author tried to develop way too many (10) characters, so that each became more of a stereotype than they might otherwise have. I would have preferred if she'd focused on three or four, rather than dropping a character for several chapters to the point where you'd forgotten who she was. There were also a ton of typos in my copy.The plot involves a group of girls who join a sorority/school spirit club, led by a charismatic, and ultimately dangerous teacher with a private axe to grind against men. Like the book \\"Foxfire,\\" and the movie \\"The Craft,\\" the girls form a sisterhood and vow to come to each other's aid if necessary. However, one act of violent revenge seems to unleash a vindictive streak in most of the members, and eventually the revenge gets out of control.I don't think the author wanted the \\"moral\\" of the book to be cut and dried. The male characters aren't as well developed, but not all of them are sexist pigs. Nor are the girls who fall under the teacher's \\"spell\\" all blind followers; some are able to think for themselves. Some of the \\"revenge\\" will seem more justified than others. I think the book was written to raise questions and cause debate, rather than giving the reader a tidy message."},{"Title":"Daughters Of Eve","review":"This was a great book! How could anyone say it wasn't! I guess a lot of young mystery readers just can't understand it. It is not just about feminism-the whole feminism issue is just an example. What Lois Duncan is trying to get across is that this Daughters of Eve club, is like a cult. It explains what a cult can do to you-how it can suck you in. It also shows how taking things too far, like feminism in this case, can be really screwed up. I loved the way it ended, I didn't expect it to end at that moment! But it did! It was so shocking. Some people say that they hated the book, but that just goes to show that some people can't read anything with a little depth....just read the book; it's awesome."},{"Title":"Daughters Of Eve","review":"I loved this book, it was very interesting and a very realistic book. It had so many real life parts to it, like how one of the girls boyfriend is a little jerk, how one of the girls (laura) worries about her weight, how another girl is mad about her parents divorce, and how another girl wants her parents to get divorced because of an abusive father. I liked this book because one of the girls could see things others couldn't. I love that especially in Lois Duncan books. The only bad part in this book i think is that it was a bit confusing in the beginning because it kept switching from one girl to the other, but thats it. I recomend this book to anyone who has ever read Lois Duncan books and ever anyone else."},{"Title":"Daughters Of Eve","review":"Lois Duncan was one of my favorite authors when I was a teenager. She wrote believable characters and also managed to spin some genuinely scary yarns (\\"Down a Dark Hall\\" is the best of these, in my opinion).However, this book gets muddled and it's hard to tell what, exactly, the point is. Is it that Irene, the leader of the high school girls' club Daughters of Eve, is nuts? That feminists hate all men? That women shouldn't fight back against injustice? That they should?The very first \\"incident\\" in which the Daughters take revenge on an offending male is described as horrible, but it actually seems downright mild, considering the male in question is a hateful cad who used one of the club members -- overweight, insecure, shy Laura -- for sex and then cruelly dumped her: they shave his head. Oooohh. Myself, I was sorry they didn't do likewise to his creep of a brother.After that, though, things do start to get violent, and the girls attack at least one undeserving man, because of Irene's prodding. A couple of the girls realize that it's getting out of hand, and withdraw themselves from the situation. Also, there are a couple of people who realize the unfairness of the situations the girls face, and take their sides: Ruthie's parents ground her after she refuses to clean up after her brothers, but Ruthie's mother eventually defies her sexist husband and revokes the grounding; Ann gets pregnant and tells her father she's thinking about an abortion, and he tells her she has his support no matter what decision she makes.So I guess the point of the book is that non-violent solutions to unfairness and injustice are best. Though again, I'm not sure that is actually the point."},{"Title":"Daughters Of Eve","review":"I thought Daughters of Eve was a great book. A lot of people had mixed feelings about it, but I really enjoyed it. The concept of the book and the plot are very creative, and they kept me reading until the last page. The book is about a high school club called the Daughters of Eve. The club isn't like any ordinary school club, though. It's more like a cult. In order to become a member of the club you have to receive an invitation. The club's sponsor, Irene Stark, is a former high school outcast who has been hurt by several men during her lifetime. Irene tries to push her strong feminist views onto the girls of the club. She \\"brainwashes\\" the girls into having the same views as her towards men. She eventually ends up getting the girls to do some pretty shocking things. I loved how the book went back and forth through each of the girls' lives, so you knew what was going on with every member of the Daughters of Eve. The way Louis Duncan tied all the characters' personal lives together was great! The way she ended the book was really suspenseful, and it definitely left me thinking. Some of the scenes really shocked me too. Especially the part when they get revenge on Ruth's brother, and how all the girls look up to Irene, and trust her so much. I really admired Tammy thought, she was able to stand up for herself, and she knew when she was getting herself into trouble with the group. But overall, the book was great!"},{"Title":"Daughters Of Eve","review":"A special club for young girls at Modesta High School encourages them not to feel ashamed. It helps them to know they are never alone as long as they have each other. The group contains seven girls with men problems. They ask three new who are in the same boat into the club. The guys in their lives treat them badly throughout the story. Their leader Irene,who I think is crazy, convinces them to get revenge on the guys. The book was a pleasure to read. I really don't think men discriminate against women as much as the book put out. I wouldn't recommend this book to some one who can't keep track of characters."},{"Title":"Daughters Of Eve","review":"Although Duncan tried to do something different with this novel, a feminist twist on the brainwashing cult concept, it's probably her worst book. It starts to fall apart completely when the Daughters of Eve--a bunch of girls who heretofore have done nothing more radical than sell raffle tickets and volunteer at old folks' homes--decide to attack and molest a male chauvinist pig. Even if we believe they would commit such violence under the leadership of a *teacher* (which would surely just be too weird to go unquestioned), Duncan fails completely to think through what the psychological aftermath of that event would be (surely a little more complex than self-congratulatory glee). The girls seem untroubled and progress to even more violent crimes.The other really problematic aspect of this book is its villain's take on feminism, which is so obviously unbalanced and extremist. It's impossible to believe that these girls would accept it so unthinkingly.In short, the book is implausible, overcooked, and kind of a mess. Ironically, Duncan's supernatural novels feel more convincingly \\"realistic.\\" Skip this, and turn to those instead, starting with Summer of Fear, which rocks, and Stranger With my Face."},{"Title":"Daughters Of Eve","review":"I have been a long time fan of Lois Duncan, reading her books over and over again. When I bought DOE I expected to be thrilled and hung in supense. I was dissapointed as the book took a while to build and when it did, it ended quickly."},{"Title":"Daughters Of Eve","review":"Great book, I'm looking into the possibilty of turning it into a film or play, loved it as a child, love it as an adult.Very powerful message, especially for a young adult book.As someone who is interested in cliques, elite groups, sororities and the like, this book says it all.Even for fiction, it's very realistic.It's Duncans best."},{"Title":"Daughters Of Eve","review":"I just finished reading this book literally 10 minutes ago and it left me with a big question: What was the moral? The flap claimed that the book was about a crazy teacher brainwashing her students into taking undeserved revenge on men. However, I'm not sure the text backs this up. The \\"undeserved revenge\\" only happens three times, and while the second was underresearched, the first and third were in the right. Especially the third (the final scene in the book). It left me smiling and saying \\"Good!\\" when I think I was supposed to be shocked and horrified. But then, that's the main problem with this book. Are we supposed to agree with the Daughters of Eve, disapprove, or some combination? The author is very hazy about this. The problems the girls face are very real and easy to sympathize with--Jane's father hits her mother. Ruthie's brothers are horrible, cruel people. Ann shouldn't be tied down at 18. The club and the teacher are the only people in the entire book who even notice these problems, much less do anything about them. If the flap is correct and their response is just insane, then why no alternative viewpoint, a character who recognizes that the situations are unfair and then deals with them in a rational manner? Is the flap wrong and the author did not intend for the club's actions to seem crazy? Is Duncan advocating a world where domestic abuse, unthinking cruelty towards women and unfair labor divisions are a god-given right? Was she simply too lazy to illustrate the \\"proper\\" viewpoint? Did she never think it out beyond \\"feminism might go to far\\"? I'll probably never know, short of a conversation with Lois Duncan, but I do find it an interesting problem. The author's waffling is a huge, undeniable flaw, but the book itself is well-written enough to make Duncan's refusal to take a stand intriguing as well as infuriating. It has caused me to think about my opinions on the situations in the book, and what I think is a reasonable response. Because of the above-average quality of writing, I do recomend it, if only as a sort of Rorshach test of your own views on the issues presented."},{"Title":"Daughters Of Eve","review":"I have read Daughters of Eve several times, and each time i love it just the same. To me books with several characters suites me more because there are separate things about each one of them. It keeps you reading to find out what is going to happen to the ones that are in trouble, and with this book that is exactly what happened. To me it would relate alot to Teens and young adults."},{"Title":"Daughters Of Eve","review":"It was a good book. It was clever and it made you believe you were there. Irene was clever and the end was unbelievable. Good book."},{"Title":"Daughters Of Eve","review":"I've read many Lois Duncan books,but this was a bit of a disappointment. The story was just weird and twisted. I found myself,turning through some of the pages,and being bored. There were quite alot of characters,which caused alot of confusion. Sometimes,I forgot who they were and had turn back and see. The cover may seem interesting because it says &quot;they share everything&quot; but its really not. If you want to read something good read stranger with my face or the third eye."},{"Title":"Daughters Of Eve","review":"Despite what some of the other reviewers are saying, I thought this was a great book, one of Duncan's best. It was the first book of hers that I've read and since then I've read almost all of her others. This book was chilling, and made all the more so by the fact that I could almost see this scenario happening. Seriously, you get a bunch of teenage girls together and convince them that they're better than others and they'll do just about anything for you, which can say alot about the sad state of our society today."},{"Title":"Daughters Of Eve","review":"This book was weird. It had a very weak plot and was hard tokeep up with who was who. I would recommend not to read it. It didn'tend right either. It just left you hanging."},{"Title":"Daughters Of Eve","review":"My high school students recommended this book to me. I expected a typical shallow teen thriller--what I got was some reality that was a lot scarier than fiction. The story is top heavy with exposition and character development--more dialog than action, so the book should not be classified as mystery or thriller. This is a drama. I would redesign the book cover to reflect this. I admire Lois Duncan's ability to relate a story of human nature in an ultimately objective and neutral manner. It is her objectivity and neutrality that makes this book scary. I strongly recommend this book to anyone who considers herself a feminist."},{"Title":"Daughters Of Eve","review":"This bok made me think about the way men treat theere women. I am a little offended by the way she made her point. She made it seem as though all men mistreat women. I know however, that this is certainly not the case. As far as that character of Irene Stark goes, she turned Daughters of Eve into a club about getting revenge on men which was not the piont of the club. When the gym teacher put out the money the girls raised for new basketballs or whatever for a boys team, I did think that was unfare. The girls should have beeen able to use it in there own way. And Jane's father should marry Irene Stark because they are both completely insane. Her father was too demandind and Irene thought all men were evil. Dave was good. He didn't mean to make Anne pregnant. He just did. Overall though, I thought the book was rather boring as there was no climax at all. I thought that when they took Peter in the woods, they would kill him. Shaving his head was stupid. She should have put in something more dramatic to make it more interesting. It was very uneventful. Irene was a complete idiot. Lois, you have done better."},{"Title":"Daughters Of Eve","review":"This was a very good book, although it was very creepy. The ending was surprising and unexpected. I really liked this book."},{"Title":"Daughters Of Eve","review":"This book was da bomb! It was a very well written book. Though I give it only fours stars I loved it. If there had been more info. on how the girls did after this was done it would've gotten 5. Mrs. Duncan you did great on this book!!! Love ya bye-bye"},{"Title":"Daughters Of Eve","review":"I read this book and I thought it was great. I love all of Lois Duncan's books. I liked this book as a fiction book b/c I don't believe that all men in this world have their way and are better than women just b/c of their gender."},{"Title":"Daughters Of Eve","review":"Daughters of Eve is a great book I think everyone should read. The last chapter and it makes you wonder... what will happen next? And it gets scarier as it goes along. You have to be patient in the begining because that just shows what the details you have to pay attention too is. I don't want to give away the ending so i'll just say they'res hatred in this book and it kept you thinking so anyway. I love Lois Duncan books and they're really good so if you haven't read the book, you should try it."},{"Title":"Daughters Of Eve","review":"I read this book while I was in high school and loved it. Having just re-read it, I see that there are flaws in the story, but overall I think the book is still entertaining. The characters ARE somewhat one dimensional, but there are so many of them it would have been hard to fully develop every single one and still move the story along. I think one thing that is lacking is that Ms. Duncan might have taken more time illustrating WHY these girls feel so strongly about Irene. Is is just because she's young and different? Does she reach out to them in any way? A few reviewers have commented that the ending was not all that shocking. Just to put this in perspective, when I was in high school, school shootings were unheard of--there were no metal detectors, no security, nothing (at least not where I went to school). And when I first read it I was indeed shocked at the turn of events, and also horrified, as I recall. I also wondered why no one seemed to catch on to Irene sooner, but overall it's still a good read."},{"Title":"Daughters Of Eve","review":"The book Daughters of Eve was a very interesting book. I liked this book mostly for the fact that once I thought I knew what was going to happen the whole story changes. Most books that I read I can already tell what the ending is going to be. In the beginning of this book that was written by Lois Duncan was actually not that exciting, and I was thinking about getting a different book to read instead. Then right when I decided to get another book, it got really good. So if you like to read books that have a good ending then this book is for you, but if you are a reader that likes to have a book that is exciting from beginning to end then this book is not for you. Well if you are like me and like to have a book that has a really good ending then this is most defiantly this is the book for you. So if you like to be on the edge of your seat this is not the best book for you to read."},{"Title":"Daughters Of Eve","review":"This books really tells all about cliques. THough some parts are really disturbing i think everyone who goes to school shoud read this. The characters really speak for themseleves and althought i read this book ages ago you do think about it every so often, like a good book will do."},{"Title":"Daughters Of Eve","review":"I have high opinions of Lois Duncan as a writer. She has written several thrilling stories including Daughters Of Eve. Though I wouldn't consider Daughters Of Eve a suspenseful drama, I would consider it a dramatic mystery.It all starts when the most popular club in school is assigned to a new leader, Irene Stark, who has a malicious hate and relentless grudges towards all men. Her past is haunted by a confrontation at her old school where she taught another Daughters Of Eve chapter, when she was forced to resign and replaced by a male. Bitterness run through her veins as she is put leader to another Daughters Of Eve club in a school called Modesta High. While comforting her students through their troubles and teenage problems, she at the same time brainwashes all of them into believing all men are trying to dissolve woman's rights to be independent.Her sly words and sneaky exploitation builds the same kind of hate that she feels for men instilled into the girls of Daughter Of Eve. When one of the girls leaves town after trying to commit suicide because a boy broke her heart, the Daughters Of Eve takes drastic actions in creating revenge. This leading to other kinds of horrible plots and broken friendships towards all men that they accuse of doing wrong. Making awful accusations to not only men, but to the innocent.And when another girl leaves the group because she feels the club is becoming too violent and deceptive, Irene doesn't only do what she can to keep the girl quiet, but also telling lies to the other girls in the process of her manipulation.Even though this isn't one of Lois Duncan's most suspenseful books, it is one of my favorites."},{"Title":"Daughters Of Eve","review":"...i have read many books and i have to say that this book is my favorite. I checked this book out in my schoodl library i never knew how much i would love it. i took the book everywhere and i read it everyday day mor ethen once a day. this book is so unpredictable and when they flash you back to different places you just want to read more and see what happens. this author is one of my favorites and i recommend this book to everyone to read. there are so many secrets and lies and shocking things to read about. how can you not read it. once you start you have to finish.and at the end it tells you about every character in the book and what happend to them 3 years later."},{"Title":"Daughters Of Eve","review":"Daughters of eve was an interesting book i would recommend it to people who enjoy mysteries but it doesn't really belong to the horror genre. but it was a good read."},{"Title":"Daughters Of Eve","review":"I heard this book was compared to Lord of the Flies somewhere, which in my opinion fits it perfectly-the way it all starts out so calmly and then gradually escalates into violence. The basic idea that Irene gives to the Daughters of Eve, which is to stand up for themselves and demand equal treatment, is sound, but in her anger towards the men in her own life Irene goes too far and ultimately so do the Daughters of Eve. What I found really interesting was the \\"For the Record\\" at the end, but I'm surprised that Irene was still sponsor of Daughters of Eve after all the damage she'd caused. You'd think someone would have found out after three years."},{"Title":"Daughters Of Eve","review":"I must say that Lois Duncan is a great author, but this book does not show that.Is she not an author of mystery novels? This book lacks that twisting churning feeling that you're being watched over your shoulder and that there may be someone hiding around the corner.Nonetheless this book wasn't horrible, just NOT thrilling. It was quite interesting and strange though.About the plot, it does not make much sense. This teacher, Irene Stark assumes all men are degrading in any way. And that's only because she is selfish and a looney, just because SHE was mistreated and wants the whole world to go on her side and support her opinion.You do get a perspective of each \\"sister\\" of the Daughters of Eve Club, on what they think of everything and such, but it makes it boring. She has good detail in explaining everything but BORING.You then come to the supposedly \\"thrilling\\" part of the book where you probably presume they're gonna kill him, and all they do is shave his head and beat him up.Come on now, where's the suspense? Sure it was evil but, we want more......It leaves you hanging saying, \\"What the heck?\\" I know books leave you hanging, wanting more but this hanging makes you want an explanation.All in all this book is an \\"ok but wouldn't want to read again\\" type of book. It's good though and read it if you like novels by Lois Duncan. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Daughters Of Eve","review":"this book is about ten girls who join the social club daughters of eve, but STRANGE things start to happen, for instantce, one of the girls starts to see bloody candles,then another girl goes to the hospital and then the whole daughter's of eve club tries to seek revenge on one of the member's brother........and then a few girls start to figure out that it is their leader that is making them do this..........................................I also recommend anything and everything by Lois Duncan"},{"Title":"Daughters Of Eve","review":"This is the best Lois Duncan book I have read yet, and I am a big fan of her work. Reading this book kept me interested and mesmerized. I enjoyed the characteristic of sisterhood the book offered, as well as the plot.

Reading about each &quot;sister's&quot; point of view was interesting."},{"Title":"Daughters Of Eve","review":"I just love this book it talks about real problems girls have it's a little confusing in th e beggining because all of the charecteers. It is one of my favarite books of all time"},{"Title":"Daughters Of Eve","review":"I think that this book was a good book, although it was very, very boring in the beginning and some what boring towards the middle. Other than that I thought it was very good. Lois Duncan captured the unwanted truths about a wonderful club such as the daughters of eve. The way that Irene lead the girls with her hatred of dependence on a man. It seemed to me that just because of one bad little run-in with a man she deemed all men to be that way. To any one that feels that way they should take a look at this book before taking another step. I also highly recommend this book to high school girls with uncertainty in planning their future."},{"Title":"Daughters Of Eve","review":"It was a good look at cults, etc. Realistic and different, each characher has a distinc personality."},{"Title":"Daughters Of Eve","review":"I thought that this was a very good book. I'll admit that I thought it was a little difficult to get into, but after that I couldn't put it down. It showed me how one person can influence so many people. The ending was very suprising, but I liked it. Lois Duncan is a great writer and she really has a way of describing characters and situations. She is one of my favorite authors, and this book is just another reflection of her talent. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes to read."},{"Title":"Daughters Of Eve","review":"i don't know why this book has gotten so many bad reviews. Lois Duncan doesn't have to write 'thrillers' all the time!! anyways, i LOVED IT!!! i wanted to read it in one night but i didn't have enought time. the ending was really cool too. alot of people said that there were too many characters and that it was hard to keep up with them. i didn't think it was hard at all! the endings were really suprising. one person said that it didn't have a climax but i thought that it did. it is a great book and now i am doing my english project on it!"},{"Title":"Daughters Of Eve","review":"I would say that this is one of Duncan's best books. The characters in this book are so realistic. You can feel what they feel on a certain level of understanding that Duncan doesn't even have to write it. The book was written in all the girl's views. This made the book alot better because you really understand what is happening instead of being forced to believe one perspective. The plot was very interesting because each girl had her own plot and then when all the girl's lives get put together into the club, a whole new problem evolves. The writing style of this book is so unique and suspensful that I started reading the book, and only put it down to eat dinner. The ending was absolutely great! It ended very suddenly and leaves with your own thoughts of what happens next. I would reccomend this book to any one 13years old or older. Younger readers may not understand the whole high school scene and miss alot of important points. The book is a little hard to follow, so if you have a hard time focusing, it may be hard for you to understand this. All in all, any fan of Duncan's work should really read this book."},{"Title":"Daughters Of Eve","review":"Daughters of Eve is a story about a club of girls who are encouraged by their faculty sponser to hurt all the men that hurt them. Under her tutalage they destroy a science lab and shave a boy's head. Other events in the novel include an overdose and a girl murdering her father. I think the teacher was crazy and took the girls down with her. Read it once, let it freak out, then pick up another one of Lois' book, a better one."},{"Title":"Daughters Of Eve","review":"I feel as though Lois Duncan may have been in a deadline rush when writing this book, because it's surprisingly not that good. Lois Duncan is maybe my all-time favorite writer, but something about this book just wasn't up to par in comparsion to her other work. And as I read some of the other reviews left here, I see that I'm not the only one left feeling a little lost. Maybe it's because I've read almost every suspense book she's written before this one that I felt let down.Personally, I felt there were far too many characters to keep up with. I had to flip back after finishing the book to remember what point \\"Holly\\" held in the book without finding her name very much. I'm still confused at whose parents were whose but for \\"Jane\\" and \\"Tammy\\"'s parents. And then Ruth's family, just because of the brothers. The brothers was also a disappointment, for two characters that seemed to hold a memorable part in the beginning and middle of the book -- they were never really mentioned again as we reached the end. You could guess what came about afterward, but it was funny they were just dropped. It's almost as though Lois Duncan had planned to go one way in writing this book and picked up on the writing months later and went off in an entire different direction.I don't believe the moral has much to do with actual feminist ways, I think that's the example used to make the real moral. The moral that we're easily guided people when we're young. And sometimes when we're old. It seemed that almost everyone in the book was fooled in some way by the face value of others.Examples: Jane's mother was fooled into believing the relationship she had with her husband wasn't a problem. Laura was fooled into thinking Peter loved her. Bambi was also fooled into thinking Peter loved her. Peter's younger brother was fooled into thinking Peter was all he always said he was. Every parent seemed to be fooled by their children's lies. And, of course, all the members of the Daughters of Eve was fooled into believing (at some point) that men stood in the way of women by their scorned adult teacher, Irene. And Irene had been fooled by her boyfriend out of something she'd really wanted. Which started a lot of this cycle.There are probably more examples, but this is my belief. Lois Duncan was trying to show that we, as people, can be easily fooled. Some of us get out of it, some of us believe it, and some of us are forever effected by it -- as you can see in the follow-ups. Jane went too far when she snapped and either killed or wounded her father. Ruth and Tammy recognized the insanity and got away from it. Some of the others continued their lives believing it and didn't end up being in the dreaded housewife lives that they were told were wrong. Violence stopped or violence continued, those who kept believing it will still be effected. That's assumed by their careers and lack of marriages.All of this could be brilliant, but I don't think it was written out as well as it could have been. The overall idea was lost in having too many characters and not enough of a followable path. The violence, and the brain-washing, they're all part of being fooled and lead easily. I just believe that was the moral. We're fools at times, and we have to watch ourselves so we won't be.It just could have been better, but it was still a decent read. I'd give it a shot, but I wouldn't expect to love it as much as her other work."},{"Title":"Daughters Of Eve","review":"I have only read a few amount of lois duncans books. but i can already tell that she is a wonderful writer that always has something up her sleve! this book daughters of eve is about a after school club.They never share anything talked about in the club.

But this fun after school club soon becomes a violent cult. they are swarn by secrecy, bound by loyalty and shattered by hate. who is safe from the lies? who will be the first victim?i really enjoyed this book. it was a real page turner.

It really tells you the nuts and bolts of how to save on taxes, how to avoid being audited, and how to do simple things to keep your records in order in case you are audited. Many of the tax savings were worth the price of the book by themselves. I dont mean saving $5 here and there but saving thousands on company expenses. I really like these and listen to them over and over in the car to catch things I missed or forgot about."},{"Title":"The mathematical theory of relativity,","review":"I should take the first reviewer more seriously before buying this book. Since he received such a negative feedback, I thought - here we have another one who can't understand math. Well, there is not a single looking math equation in this book, all equations are gibberish. I'm quite familiar with General Relativity and have most of the essential books, and saw all kind of weird equations in my life, but have never seen equations like:O Afly 0X V y Ooxfjy O nx jand the rest is about the same. I feel awkward to give a single star (should get zero) to a great classic book by Sir Arthur Eddington, but it is not for the book, it is for the abuse of Amazon, or the publisher called - General Books. I think however that I understand the problem - there are two printouts; the other is by Cambridge University Press (four times more expensive), and its typesetting via Amazon's Look Inside looks fine. I bet that it worth five stars. So again, I'm referring to General Books edition, not to Eddington's book in general.(and I apologize for possible typos in my review; I've just received this book and I'm mad as hell seeing the abuse of a such an important work)."},{"Title":"From Mother and Daughter to Friends: A Memoir","review":"While I understand that separation from one's child is difficult and makes for interesting reading, I failed to understand or sympathize with Nancy Aniston. This book is neither insiteful nor hopeful. The author (for some reason or another) feels it important to express in nearly every page of the book that she is a knock-out beauty, raving intellect and talented in everything she attempts. It is important to recognize one's own self beauty and self worth, but it is also important to express humility. Nancy Aniston also goes on to say that she was responsible for her 2nd husband's career success and without her pushing him so hard, he would have never left the sofa. The author comes across as vain, bitter and misunderstanding of others' need to push her away, including her famous daughter, Jennifer. I found her self-pitying attitude hard to swallow. This book seems more like a defense tactic, rather than a book of love, insite or hope. And one more point I would like to make... I was reading others' reviews of the same book and noticed a review written by &quot;Coral Leigh&quot;, a name that looked familiar. Coral Leigh is a personal friend of Nancy Aniston's - her name is mentioned in the book itself. I can hardly recommend that anyone interpret her written review of this book as impartial and objective."},{"Title":"From Mother and Daughter to Friends: A Memoir","review":"This is one of the most trite books I have ever picked up to read. The entire story is that of a desperate woman trying to understand why her famous daughter no longer desires a relationship with her...well it is obvious! She sold her out once during a television interview and in her attempt to rekindle the relationship she sold her out again by writing this trashy novel.Throughout the book she attempts to appear deep, when really her writing comes off worse than a beginning writing course at a community college.This book is a serious waste of time and money, and frankly if I were Jennifer Aniston I wouldn't bother with a mother like that either."},{"Title":"From Mother and Daughter to Friends: A Memoir","review":"I agree wholeheartedly with the reviewer who stated that Nancy Aniston fits the profile of someone with borderline personality disorder (BPD). At the very least, she is narcissistic. My mother has BPD, and I too finally separated from her in my late 20s. Even stronger than a parent's unwavering love for her child is a child's willingness to repeatedly overlook parental transgressions, to keep coming back in the hope of &quot;getting it right this time,&quot; trying to find a way to make Mom happy, or at least a little less terrifying. I applaud Jennifer for finally putting her foot down. In typical borderline fashion, Nancy Aniston has found a way to make everything about HER, and has used her daughter to do so. This book constitutes an egregious violation of Jennifer's boundaries. I sincerely hope both of them are able to find peace -- Nancy through dialectical behavior therapy (an effective therapeutic course for BPD), and poor, manipulated Jennifer through continued connection with more emotionally healthy adults."},{"Title":"From Mother and Daughter to Friends: A Memoir","review":"This book has nothing to do with Jennifer Aniston really. Her self-absorbed neurotic mother is simply making a sad attempt to capitalize on her fame. And if that werent bad enough, it's BORING, shallow, poorly written, and completely transparent. The time I spent foolishly reading this book is regretfully several hours of my life I can never get back. Don't bother."},{"Title":"From Mother and Daughter to Friends: A Memoir","review":"I am a huge fan of Jennifer Aniston and fan of the sitcom Friends. I just finished this book. I was dying to read it to learn more about Jen and her life. I knew of the estrangement between her and her mother and was very curious to find out what had happened. Nancy Aniston wrote this book to tell about herself and her life. She has used her position in life as Jennifer's mother to promote herself. If speaking about Jennifer on a T.V. show perpetuated their estrangement, what must Jennifer think now? Did Nancy think this book would bring them back together? Think again Nancy! How can Jennifer ever trust you again. She can't leave her home without being hounded by the press, now the whole world is privy to her childhood and adolescence. Shame on you for being another mother of a celebrity who can't sit back and enjoy the fruits of your child without trying to move in on the action. Selfish and self absorbed is how you appear in this book. If your account of your childhood is accurate, then I understand that you must be desperate to find validation. In my opinion, you went about it the wrong way."},{"Title":"From Mother and Daughter to Friends: A Memoir","review":"Otherwise I cannot understand how anyone could give more than one star to this book. The woman who wrote attacking an earlier reviewer (i.e. &quot;Ignore 'How COULD she' review&quot;) and the &quot;Psychotherapist&quot; seem really like a lame and desperate attempt to legitimize this piece of celb-trash which is so common.I found the copy of this book forgotten in a bus. A bus! And as I started poring over it I soon found out why. Its style is saccharine and obvious, though I must say that it seems rather properly written, it makes an exhaustive experience for the reader making references to things one does not care about.I don't care much about books that reveal the skinny on celebs, except if they are done by celebs, and not desperate wannabes, as apparently, Jennifer Aniston's mother seems to be.Too bad. But I think that if this actress decided to put distance between her and the author of the book, my, she must have had powerful reasons and this book is one of them for sure. It's so pat it's realy offensive."},{"Title":"From Mother and Daughter to Friends: A Memoir","review":"just a quick note for anyone interested in buying this book: the entire &quot;true&quot; story relies upon a catalyst event that the author misrepresents by leaving out one key detail which she knows would dissuade serious critics and readers from buying or favoring her revelations about family estrangement. I happened to see the &quot;news&quot; interview Ms. Aniston refers to as the reason for Jennifer's distrust of their relationship. The news program which she says invited her to talk about her favorite private school and then manipulated her into talking about Jennifer's personal life is none other than HARD COPY. I saw the piece some years back and all I can say is any person who has spent five minutes in Hollywood and agrees to be interviewed on Hard Copy to talk about education is naive. But someone who claims to have as many industry &quot;friendships&quot; as Ms. Aniston, has spent years in the deception capitol of the world, has a news worthy daughter, and then goes on Hard Copy to talk about education is just plain pitiful. It is that decision and the story that unfolds because of it which becomes the greatest manipulation revealed in From Mother to Daughter to Friends. Though Ms. Aniston portrays herself as the mama bear who just wants the chance to protect her cub, it seems her cub got wise and found real shelter. And if this book is really about her and her personal revelations about single mothers why is she exploiting her famous daughter's image to sell it?"},{"Title":"From Mother and Daughter to Friends: A Memoir","review":"Please keep in mind, this is the main reason that Jennifer doesn't speak to her mother."},{"Title":"From Mother and Daughter to Friends: A Memoir","review":"I just heard a bit of an interview where it was said that Jennifer was estranged from her Mom. I thought I would check it out on the web.I found this book and read the excerpt. Nancy betrayed her own daughter, simple. What's in the family should stay in the family. It seems to me that Nancy shows signs of BPD, denial, feeling like a Saint, seeing things in black and white, living vicariously through her daughter, lying and believing your own lies and rewritting the past to fit your needs. I am sure if Jennifer said she would never forgive you there must have been many reasons leading up to that moment and this book and that interview the final straw for her. Sad. By the way, in what religion does God make deals? Seek help, BPD mom."},{"Title":"From Mother and Daughter to Friends: A Memoir","review":"Nancy Aniston is a very bitter woman. Her memoir is written with such condescension about her family and friends that one wonders if her psycho bable camaflages her self centered personality. It is clear she is jealous of her daughter's celebrity status and wants the world to know how responsible she was for Jennifers talent, only to be rejecterd by Jennifer in favor of hangers on and Jonnie come- late-lies. (lies?, that's interesting how that spilled out.)) The memoir is revenge against Jenifer, and is ugly and in bad taste."},{"Title":"From Mother and Daughter to Friends: A Memoir","review":"Since I am in a similar situation (estrangement from my daughter), I certainly appreciated Nancy Anniston's honesty in writing her story. It helped me to understand myself better.My daughter has had emotional problems. Despite this she has been a high achiever in her adulthood. She also is a performer and though she is not anywhere near the level of Nancy's daughter, this is the way I keep up with what is going on in her life. I have two sons, one daughter-in-law and my husband who is also the father of my daughter. I have a close, loving and caring relationship with all of them and this is what has helped me the most. I love my daughter and until two years ago we had an exceptionally close relationship. She is married and started to see a new therapist. She has spoken to us occasionally and does keep in sporadic contact with one of her brothers. We have kept this from the knowledge of family and friends but don't know how long that can go on.I hope Nancy is well. She describes perfectly the pain of this estrangement and has been a help to me. No matter what, we loved our daughters and tried to make them happy.Thank you, Nancy."},{"Title":"From Mother and Daughter to Friends: A Memoir","review":"Jen, I love you...

A friend, who knows I love biographies, felt I would enjoy this story. She was right! It is an excellant book written by a woman who survived three severe blows of fate, and rather than being vanuished, learned to accept them as important life lessons. I was touched and moved to tears several times to read that as a child, Nancy Aniston endured desertion of the family by her mother, then while still in her teens decided to marry hoping for the strong family life she was denied in childhood; when she finally believed she had attained this state in a more mature marriage her then actor husband left her for his leading lady; and lastly, channeling all of her energies into raising her children, determined to be the devoted mother she always wanted, she experienced her daughter's desertion because of a media ploy. Three pivotal areas of her life ended in a crumbling away of all her energies and good intentions, but, without a trace of bitterness she sees this disintegration of her hopes as an act of divine significance and necessary for growth as a human being. This book is an interesting story of one woman's journey through pain, to acceptance, to peace. Any woman who has lived her life caring for others (as millions of unappreciated homemakers do) only to find that &quot;life is a series of false bottoms&quot; will relate to this story and will find strength from it."},{"Title":"From Mother and Daughter to Friends: A Memoir","review":"Nancy Aniston is a melodramatic whiner who is trying to cash in on her daughter's fame - plain and simple.

And people thumbing through the book before buying, and seeing frequent references to&quot;Mother&quot;(actually Nancy's mother), wouldn't have been fooled into thinking Jennifer was writing something in the book about Nancy, would they? Naah. This is just an uninteresting story of the author's life of ups and downs, as if most of us don't go through the same things. But worse, several times the author refers to Jennifer as &quot;too trusting&quot;. Maybe she's right about that, for obvious reasons. Because Nancy trusts no one for any length of time. She says: &quot;Despite the deals I'd made with God the one thing I feared had happened. I'd lost my daughter&quot;. She doesn't say the one thing I feared the &quot;most&quot;. The one thing. Wow, she is way ahead of most of us on the fear list. And if you look into Jennifer's eyes,sometimes you can see some sadness, maybe about having a mother that made &quot;deals&quot; with God. It would have been nice for Jennifer's mother to have praised and recognized her daughter's great acting ability, concerning which I am sure the author hasn't the slightest understanding. PS: God doesn't make &quot;deals&quot;."},{"Title":"From Mother and Daughter to Friends: A Memoir","review":"I think abreedlove pretty much summed up my feelings on this book.

A bus! And as I started poring over it I soon found out why. Its style is saccharine and obvious, though I must say that it seems rather properly written, it makes an exhaustive experience for the reader making references to things one does not care about.I don't care much about books that reveal the skinny on celebs, except if they are done by celebs, and not desperate wannabes, as apparently, Jennifer Aniston's mother seems to be.Too bad.

I don't want to say my name ... anyway, I am from Brazil and i am 17 years old.I read the book and i really enjoyed it.I received this book as a gift from a friend of mine when i was in LA studying english. When I started to read i didn't understand english very well but when i came back to my country , i could understand everything.My friend gave me this book because he knows that i am a huge fan of FRIENDS.when i started to read, i was thinking &quot;I am reading the story about Jennifer Aniston's childhood.&quot; but then I forgot that and the Jennifer's mother's book became for me more than this.Now I think that i read a book about a mother who loves her daughter so much and wants back her relantionship with her daughter more than everything.I am an actress , too. Actually i am starting and a lot of things in that book is similar to my story with my mother.My parents also are divorced since I was little.So, when i finished to read that I started to think about my mother and I realized that everything she did for me even the things that i hated, she did because she loves me.Anyway, this book is not about the relantionship about the mother of a celebrity but it is about a mother like all.A mother who loves her daughter and suffers with their separation.I hope they can be close again.I know there is nothing to do with that what i am going to say but...

It opened my mind to the major improvemenrs in the availability of help for families living with overwhelming difficulties. There's a thread of hope, understanding and acceptance that runs through the book as the author describes the various circumstances that resulted in five unexpected separations from different family members. It also gave me a view of a normal family with high aspirations and working in the entertainment world. I felt sad at times and chuckled at other times while reading this book. The experiences she shared about raising her son and daughter as a single mom were quite wonderful. It is clearly a &quot;morally uplifting.&quot; book and should appeal to all age readers."},{"Title":"From Mother and Daughter to Friends: A Memoir","review":"From Mother and Daughter to Friends is a book full of Wisdom, Love, Peace and understanding. I could not put it down. It is the story of a woman who has overcome many overwhelming disappointments, hurts and significant losses, only to emerge as a voice of hope, encouragement and strength for others like me, who have experienced similar trials. I think it was very courageous of Nancy to share so much of her life; I found it inspiring and uplifting. I think she is a wonderful writer, and that her children ought to be proud that their mother's life story will be an inspiration for others. I both cried and laughed as I read of challenges that would have easily embittered others. It was fascinating to discover how she met and resolved them with graceful strength and insight. She is an heroic example for all of us. I keep wondering if Nancy has written any other books. I hope she plans to write many more."},{"Title":"From Mother and Daughter to Friends: A Memoir","review":"The first few chapters I found too wordy I almost stopped reading it. I could read between the lines and realized that Nancy Aniston was about as overly protective as my mom and I felt the fear and anger again and I felt that in itself was the problem. Although she acknowledged she did a terrible thing and worried about her daughter's reaction, she was surprised at how upset her daughter was. But I noticed her son did not return her calls either thus he understood Jennifer's upset.I picked up reading the book later and it got into the story of Nancy: her perspective of what happened with respect to her family and friends. That part of the book was really interesting. I came away understanding her more. Although the father did not look too good there was enough information in the book to see how the father did not see things her way and felt his struggle was his own. It's really sad because she really did care for both husband and daughter in her own way and the story tells her perspective of how that is so. After her husband left she went through a similiar struggle of trying to find herself and a career at a late age. It's very unfortunate she got in a car accident and is unable to work. It's sad that both her husband and daughter are doing so well they don't realize that even if they can't reach out to her in a relation the same as before (because they felt she was too much into their life which in a way she was) I think they should help her out alittle financially as just a token of appreciation that she was both wife and mother to them and did her very best. I wish this family well and I hope they can develop some kind of relationship even if it is a different one."},{"Title":"From Mother and Daughter to Friends: A Memoir","review":"I just finished this book, and I can't believe the reviews I've seen here. Did I read the same book as the rest of you? It seemed to me to be a thoughtful, sincere effort to understand the sad estrangement from her only daughter. One television interview warrants 8YEARS OF SILENCE? Give me a break!!! While the actors on Friends are certainly talented, no one deserves that kind of money! Her mother did without all those years, supported her, emotionally and otherwise, and this is how she is treated? I don't think the mother is self-centered, egotistical or borderline, at all. It sounds to me more like you're describing her daughter. I'm a firm believer of &quot;Karma&quot;, and I really believe this will come back around to haunt Jennifer. I would give anything to have my wonderful mother here to talk to. I think Nancy Aniston has done a courageous job of &quot;getting on with her life&quot;. I totally recommend this book. Karol Santiago"},{"Title":"From Mother and Daughter to Friends: A Memoir","review":"This is the most fascinating book I have read in the last years. It is written in such an amiable way that I just couldn't stop reading. It tells the story of a lovely woman who has to cope with a lot of obstacles and frustrations in her life, but is always strong enough to overcome them and never loses vitality. You learn a lot of intressting issues on Jennifer Anistons childhood and adolesence, which makes Jennifer even more simpatico than she already is. Unlike another reviewer said here before, I would in no way accuse Nancy of writing this book only to make money. First of all I think she just needed to rectify all the things that were written about her relationship to Jennifer in the press and secondly there are enough hints in the book that she is not out for money at all. Of course there is no guaranty that everything in this book is true, but through the way Nancy Aniston critises her own doings, she seems to be an honest person, and what comes out throughout the whole story, is that she deeply loves her daughter, whatever she may have said on TV to disappoint her. I started to read the book as I wanted to get to know as much about Jennifer as I could, because she is such a wonderful artist, but now I'm a fan of her mothers as well. I hope for both of them that they found or will find a way to reconvene."},{"Title":"From Mother and Daughter to Friends: A Memoir","review":"I bought this book from amazon and once I started reading it I could not put it down. I am a huge fan of Jennifer's and I am always interested in finding out about her. Although Nancy writes about her own childhood it is filled with sweet memories of her daughter. There are great photos and wonderful accounts of Jennifer's childhood. I love this book and I think Nancy has written a fantastic memoir of her daughter and I admire her for being so strong when Jennifer dropped all contact with her over the interview. I can see Jennifer's side and I hope that over time she can forgive Nancy.

Her mom did a good job of portraying jen in a good light and i do hope they can reconcile. I've heard that they have.

This book is not all about Jennifer Aniston.How she can treat her mom the way she has done disturbs me greatly. I think she earns far too much money, obviously uses it to give her power over family and friends, hence, no-one has told her what an idiot she is for treating her own mother the way she does. Mmmm. No wonder Brad Pitt got out of the marriage.Well done Nancy, with all the setbacks you have had in your life, you have come out on top.

I guess Jennifer does not have a forgiving bone in her body. She dumped her own mother and began clinging to Courtney Cox as her surrogate mother. If anything, Jennifer is the needy, whiney and insecure and selfish person here - not Nancy Aniston. Nancy has gone through horrifying things in her life and did not have a nervous breakdown and was able to care for and nuture Jennifer and what did Nancy get for that? A big, fat kick in the rear. Children are not perfect and neither are their mothers. Talk to each other and work things out is what you do. There are too many children who are treating their parents this way nowadays. Why? Because they don't want to be bothered - they don't want to spend time with them as they are too busy with their own lives and family. It is sickening. Family values have gone out the window. I think Nancy wrote a true and honest heartfelt account of her life which does include Jennifer whether Jennifer likes it or not. Nancy has every right to write a book if she wanted to. Everything is not all about Jennifer. What? Jennifer becomes a movie and TV star so her whole family has to stop existing and speaking?Pa-leeze..."},{"Title":"NASB Update Side-Column Reference; Black Genuine Leather; Indexed","review":"It's a matter of personal preference, but I prefer the Ultrathin edition of the NASB, ISBN: 1581350279. It has two columns in paragraph style, with concordance, cross-references, maps, optional red-letter, optional thumb indexes, optional genuine leather. I just really like compact bibles like the ultra-thin, which is half as thick as the above version.The ultra-thin version is paragraph style, whereas the above version is verse style. Verse style is lame, with one verse per line. It's harder to read, it puts breaks in the text in artificial positions, it encourages taking verses out of context, and it puts less text on each page. Do yourself a favour, go to the...NASB web site and choose an NASB version that is in paragraph style. It's time Lockman stopped making these lame verse style bibles."},{"Title":"NASB Update Side-Column Reference; Black Genuine Leather; Indexed","review":"If I had no Bible and if I could have just one and could never have another, I'd choose this version and this Lockman Foundation edition of it above all others.Reasons are not hard to find.Foremost in importance is the translation itself. The New American Standard Version has, for a sufficient number of years to lend credence to the claim, been hailed by minds far keener and better informed than mine to be the most literally accurate translation available in modern English. It is of vital concern to me to have a rendering of God's word that is truly faithful to the best manuscripts of the original biblical languages that we have.This Bible is printed in a single column across the page and set in clear 11-point type. This results in a page that is both inviting and comfortable to read. I don't experience the eye strain that often accompanies the effort to read Bibles that are printed in near-microscopic type.The side references are of two kinds: related scriptural passages and translators' notes, which are generous and extremely helpful. For example, in 2 Timothy 3:16 the phrase &quot;inspiration of God&quot; has this side note: &quot;Literally, God-breathed.&quot; In many instances the translators' notes shed more light on the passage than some of the so-called &quot;study Bibles&quot; I've seen. This is not to say that study Bibles should all be thrown in the trash heap. A few are quite good.This Bible has a fair-sized (82- page) concordance and 10 maps. The maps are adequate for general reference, although not in color.The physical characteristics of this Bible (I refer to the genuine leather edition) are commendable indeed, particularly in light of the declining quality of book-binding in America today. The leather is grained, decently thick and supple. The spine is Smyth sewn. This is important if you plan to keep the Bible for a long time and put it to daily use (a worthy goal!) Many Bibles today (even very expensive ones) have what the publishing people call &quot;perfect bindings&quot; -- but don't let the word &quot;perfect&quot; fool you. It simply means that the book is put together with glue, not thread sewn. It has been my observation that over time the binding tends to separate in clusters of pages (called signatures) which may literally come loose and fall out. Moreover, Symth-sewn Bibles will lie flat when opened. Glued ones won't.This Bible, not as bulky as most study Bibles, is easy enough to carry around, but it won't fit in your shirt pocket. On the other hand, you won't need to carry a magnifying glass with you to read it.If you are considering a good, solid, well-made reference Bible in a reliable translation -- one that with ordinary care should last you for a lifetime -- I commend this one to your attention without any reservation whatever."},{"Title":"NASB Update Side-Column Reference; Black Genuine Leather; Indexed","review":"One starts by selecting a translation and the NASB is unsurpassed for study. But then there is a confusing array of choices. I selected this particular volume because of (a) the wide margins for notes, (b) the single column format and (c) side column references. It does not disappoint.The only possible improvement would be in the opaqueness of the paper. I like to use highlighters and some (not all) will show through on the other side. Obviously, this would have added to the thickness of the volume and the publisher made a marketing choice.Nonetheless, an excellent study Bible."},{"Title":"NASB Update Side-Column Reference; Black Genuine Leather; Indexed","review":"Some of my thoughts might echo some of what others have said. Let me start with what I feel are this Bible's negatives. I have noticed that the quality of the leather cover is not very great, but I don't think I can expect it to be for this price. Another negative, albeit not catastrophic, is that several books run together. In other words, many of the books in this bible do not start on their own pages. A final negative, which I understand might be open to debate, is that the words of Christ are not in red. Now, to be fair, let me share what I feel are this Bible's positives. First, the print size is large, and I love that. Second, the single-column design is wonderful. The single-column design allows this Bible to read like a novel. Third, the wide margin style, although it's not a true wide margin style, is nice. You have more of a wide left or right margin instead of a wide margin on all four sides, including the top and the bottom. I believe that a true wide margin edition should be more centered on the page, with significant white space surrounding it. I do believe the positives far outweigh the negatives, especially for this price. I hope this review helps."},{"Title":"NASB Update Side-Column Reference; Black Genuine Leather; Indexed","review":"Other than the rather bland &quot;rose colored&quot; burgundy leather cover which I expected to be a deep burgundy with something of a sheen to it, this bible is a pleasure to use. It is heavy but not cumbersome.The point size of the font could be reduced to a 9pt and still be very readable thereby reducing the thickness and therefore the weight by some meaningful measure.This is my second copy since I sent the first back because of excessive creasing of about 20-25 pages beginning with the psalms.This is apparently a problem at Foundation since others have made the same comments as far back as 2000.The second bible is much better in that regard with creasing still present but to a lesser degree than the first.The paper is very nice indeed albeit crease-prone. Nonetheless this is a quality bible which will serve me well. It reads very nicely with the single column being a perfect length for quick reading as well as more meditative reading. The type is consistently dark and sharp. Very easy on the eyes in part due to the larger font but just a tad smaller and it still would be excellent.I think this will be one of my favorite reading bibles along with the New Jerusalem Bible.In spite of my negative comments on the creases which I pass on to forewarn people of the possibility, this is a very high quality bible. I recommend it highly since my exchange was better than the first and Amazon's handling of the return was exemplary."},{"Title":"NASB Update Side-Column Reference; Black Genuine Leather; Indexed","review":"This is an excellent study edition of the NASB.

Use of the NASB with the RSV/NRSV, NIV, REB, NLT, CEV, TEV and the venerable KJV will provide the student of the Scriptures with a wealth of information.

The leather editions are smyth sewn, which I understand produces a binding of the highest quality. My personal preference would be a slightly smaller, handier size reference bible. However, the large 11-point type and wide margins make this impossible. Overall, I would give this fine Bible a 5-star rating, especially for someone in the market for a basic reference Bible of the highest quality.(Additional comments as of July, 2002: Having owned and used a number of Bibles the past few years, I have returned to this edition from Foundation as my primary Bible. As Rev. Comninos so accurately put it, it is indeed the finest Bible I own. Besides the overall dignity, accuracy and enhanced readability of the Updated NASB, the quality workmanship found in this edition as published by Foundation is supurb. The font print size is indeed PERFECT. The binding and overall craftsmanship are excellent. By comparison, I really like the new ESV translation, but the quality workmanship of Crossway leaves a great deal to be desired.

They are not as shocking as the Mapplethorpe photographs but they are as artistic and as sensuous as his are. Unfortunately, you have to buy your copy used. That's the way I had to buy mine. I have bought many other nude photography books new but, except for Mapplethorpe's work, none of them are as good as this book. I spent a small fortune on photographer David Hamilton's book new, for example, and I look in Hamilton's book one tenth of the time I look inside this book. This book contains both nude men and women plus couples. You can't go wrong buying this book. Get it while you can as my experience with great out of print books is that the price skyrockets before long."},{"Title":"Eros","review":"I had the good fortune of buying a couple of copies of this book when it was published and finding a copy on a sale desk this year.

This book is a visual documentation of the beauty of sex. From the nude body to the act. It's erotic, yes, but it's not porn. It's not distasteful. It can be arrousing and beautiful at times, ugly and honest at others. Still, a cetain undescribable sense of art is never lost. The collaborators did an extraordinary job at finding the perfect pictures that capture the essence of eroticism without the trash of pornography. Featured artists include May Ray, Albert Watson, Robert Mapplethorpe, and Lisa Spindler (my favorites) among many others.

For me, the attraction is in the images. There's generally one B&W; photo per two-page spread, beautifully printed at a large size. A lot of the pictures show a single figure, male or female. My favorites, though, show couples embracing. Although wonderfully sensual, all these photos meet the highest standards of good taste. Still, people shy about seeing the whole body might think twice.Most two-page spreads also include extract from the literature of love. That includes everything from the classical periods of Egypt and China up to Walt Whitman, e e cummings, and Erica Jong. Like the photos, all of the chosen texts avoid vulgarity. Also like the photos, some of the passages evoked more for me than others did.I can easily imagine a couple enjoying this together, on some night warmed by a fire, a blanket, and each other.-- wiredweird"},{"Title":"Eros","review":"&quot;And all her face was honey to my mouth, And all her body pasture to mine eyes&quot; -- This book shows you a broad selection of different ways of photographing nudes.

It is much handier that the on-line references for NACA data and for doing the 'quick flip through' when thinking about design. It is not, however, for either the mathematicall un-initiated, nor for the first-time designer. The book is both thorough and rigorous in its treatment of the topics it covers. All in all, along with the other standard texts, it supplies the needed data ad information when thinking 'I wonder if that will work...'"},{"Title":"Theory of Wing Sections: Including a Summary of Airfoil Data (Dover Books on Aeronautical Engineering)","review":"Even if the book is old, it's the base of the airfoil understanding, because of the data included. Don't look for strange things here, just the classic stuff, but very complete."},{"Title":"Theory of Wing Sections: Including a Summary of Airfoil Data (Dover Books on Aeronautical Engineering)","review":"This should be the first book on the shelf of any serious aircraft designer. The first half of the book is a review of classic airfoil theory, including all of the pertinent formulas. It is a bit dry and definitely not a textbook, but rather a comprehensive reference manual. Most people skip the text and buy the book for the second half, which is a compilation of all the basic NACA airfoils. Each airfoil shape is exactly described and includes graphs of performance data. This is a &quot;must have&quot; book for anyone who wants to design airfoils, whether they are the wings of an airplane, or the fins, rudders, etc. of a sailboat."},{"Title":"Theory of Wing Sections: Including a Summary of Airfoil Data (Dover Books on Aeronautical Engineering)","review":"This book contains a historical review of the development of wing sections along with their mathematical basis and provides not only coordinates but performance data on many. Most of the source data for my shareware program came from this book."},{"Title":"Theory of Wing Sections: Including a Summary of Airfoil Data (Dover Books on Aeronautical Engineering)","review":"This is a well written book that aircraft designers and those engaged in a serious study of wing aerodynamics will find useful, helpful and handy. This is not a book for the novice but for aeronautical engineering specialists who can handle fluid dynamics theory, performance and other mathematical manipulations. Although the book has been around for some time (I first used it at university as a recommended text in aerodynamics over 25 years ago), the theory and concepts are still very much relevant and applicable today.For those seeking advanced knowledge on wing aerodynamics theory and have a flair for mathematics especially calculus, this is an excellent reference book that is well recommended."},{"Title":"Theory of Wing Sections: Including a Summary of Airfoil Data (Dover Books on Aeronautical Engineering)","review":"I use this for my Aerodynamics courses (recomended by prof.). It is a great supplement to our book &quot;Fundementals of Aerodynamics&quot; by Anderson. Great buy for the price."},{"Title":"Theory of Wing Sections: Including a Summary of Airfoil Data (Dover Books on Aeronautical Engineering)","review":"This is one of my favorite technical references. Ever since I was a child wings and airfoils absolutely fascinated me. Now, don't think for a second that this book is only useful to aerospace engineers. Anyone dealing with a foil shape traveling through a fluid can find plenty of useful information in this book, if they understand enough about wing sections. I wouldn't buy this book to learn how to calculate lift, drag, or aerodynamic forces unless you're very mathematically savvy, as of it's all explained in a rather dry and theoretical sense. I had the benefit of learning it in a classroom scenario, as part of my degree in Naval Architecture & Marine Engineering. What is truly of value is the information on all the NACA wing sections and the empirical data they collected, contained in the massive appendices."},{"Title":"Theory of Wing Sections: Including a Summary of Airfoil Data (Dover Books on Aeronautical Engineering)","review":"I've been using this book to design my own RC planes for several years now. It's chock full of all the classic NACA airfoils. The data and graphs are well laid out with consistent symbols and nomenclature though some graphs can be a bit crowded. Most of the fluid theory in the front of the book is better studied in modern textbooks like Anderson though I found the chapter on high lift devices quite helpful in my application. Since I'm designing small planes most of my work is below the Reynolds numbers of the plots but it's close enough for extrapolation. Although there are a multitude of wing sections in this awesome book there are only NACA sections which is only a sliver of whats out there. Overall, a bargain price for a great reference book!"},{"Title":"Theory of Wing Sections: Including a Summary of Airfoil Data (Dover Books on Aeronautical Engineering)","review":"I'm an aerospace student and bought this book for some complementary reading. I found it useful and informative. The airfoil section is a little dated and more modern airfoils are often better performers for certain applications but it is a good resource for NACA airfoils. Its great for becoming more familiar with drag polars and the effects that tripping the flow, high-lift devices, camber, thickness, etc all have on performance."},{"Title":"Theory of Wing Sections: Including a Summary of Airfoil Data (Dover Books on Aeronautical Engineering)","review":"I expected a difficult to understand book - something just for experts.

Other reviews have said this book is difficult to understand, but that's probably because they don't have the background to understand what this book is.That said, I am an Aeronautical Engineer and I have thoroughly enjoyed reading and using this book. 'Theory of Wing Sections' is known throughout the Aerospace industry as the 'Airfoil Bible', and has been quite useful to me in writing wing analysis codes. In this book, you'll find all of the 'classical' airfoil theory; from basic thin airfoil theory to flow models and much more.The best part of this book, however, is the extensive series of airfoil data tables in the back. You can literally find out anything you want about the NACA 4 and 5 digit series airfoils. Having all this data at your fingertips is an aerodynamicists dream. It saves us the trouble of calculating performance characteristics and also serves as a check for most kinds of wing analysis codes you write.I highly recommend this book to any Aero Engineer or Aero student. You WON'T regret having it!"},{"Title":"Theory of Wing Sections: Including a Summary of Airfoil Data (Dover Books on Aeronautical Engineering)","review":"This is a somewhat advanced reference text on wing aerodynamics and is definitely not for the beginner.

I wore out my first copy, but I was lucky enough to find a first edition hardcover.I especially liked the part that deals with flow about arbitrary wing sections. In the theory you need to know specific points to do the calculations, but with a little modification to the theory you can choose arbitrary points. I still use the program I made years ago. It's fast and it gives pretty good results (it's based on a perfect fluid so no stall characteristics)."},{"Title":"Theory of Wing Sections: Including a Summary of Airfoil Data (Dover Books on Aeronautical Engineering)","review":"I found this book very interesting and complete although it is VERY technical and i recommend it for only those who know a lot about the theme"},{"Title":"Theory of Wing Sections: Including a Summary of Airfoil Data (Dover Books on Aeronautical Engineering)","review":"I bought this book mostly as a reference.

Now he is on his way to Venice, Italy with his family for the summer. His father is part of the engineering team that is designing the floodgates the will protect Venice from floods.His family settles in immediately. His father is busy with the floodgate, his mom is doing her artist thing, even his little brother, who is enrolled at a day camp for young children, is picking up Italian at an astonishing rate. Percy is a at loose ends until he meets the mysterious Graziella who works in the nearby ice cream shop. Discovering that she also works as an animatori or counselor at his brother's day camp, he signs on as an animatori too.His friendship with Graziella connects him with other teens in the city. He discovers they care deeply about the quality of life in Venice and are fearful of the effects the Expo world's fair will have on life there. The focus on tourism in Venice is at odds with daily life there for ordinary citizens.When a huge storm threatens the city with flooding, Percy realizes the group will stop at nothing to keep the Expo out of Venice and his father's project is at risk.Napoli captures the beauty and special light of Venice. The book is a virtual vacation and a entertaining read."},{"Title":"For the Love of Venice","review":"Seventeen-year-old Percy is somewhat unexcited when his parents inform him that the family will be spending the summer in the jewel of Italy, also known as Venice. Having just graduated high school, Percy would much rather hang out with his friends, go sailing, and kick back. However, his outlook on the summer trip changes when he arrives in Venice, and realizes that he may just be bold enough to have a romantic adventure there. Soon he meets a mysterious, beautiful girl named Graziella, who works in the ice cream shop. Graziella brings Percy into parts of Venice that foreigners never get to see, and explains about the turmoil that Venetians are experiencing at the moment. Percy is shown how young Venetians make desperate plans to save their city from danger, and waves of tourists. He also finds how much Venetians hate outsiders, like himself. However, while Graziella and Percy can't change how each of their cultures looks upon the other, they can try to find a common ground for their two worlds to meet upon, during this summer in Venice.I read Donna Jo Napoli's DAUGHTER OF VENICE a few months ago, and was so mesmerized by the story, that I just knew that I had to have FOR THE LOVE OF VENICE. I was not disappointed at all. Percy was a kind character, who was sympathetic, friendly, and helpful. He definitely bears a resemblance to the prince that every girl wishes that she will someday have the chance to meet. Graziella, on the other hand, was hard-headed, and at times snippy, but that was simply her hard exterior. Inside she was warm, friendly, and kind. The two characters keep the book flowing well, and will draw in fans young and old, male or female, into the story. A must have book for anyone interested in Italian culture, or looking for a touching story of first love.Erika Sorocco"},{"Title":"For the Love of Venice","review":"Dear Looking For A Good Book To Read, You have found it.

To most people it would be a dream come true, but that is not the case when seventeen year old Percy learns his family will be spending the entire summer in Venice for a project his dad is working on. Percy feels alone in the beautiful city of Venice; his mother is always out trying to absorb the atmosphere of the city and capture it in her artwork, Percy's father is always burying himself in his blue prints of plans to create M.O.S.E., a floodgate for the Venice waterways, and Percy's six year old brother, Christopher is going to be starting a new camp at the Estate Ragazzi church. Frustrated by the loneliness and the difficult language barrier, Percy is left to wonder the great city by himself. That is when he meets Graziella, a beautiful and mysterious Italian girl who works in the gelateria or ice cream shop. They are instantly attracted to each other, although it may not seem that way. They start to see each other and Graziella shows Percy the beauty of the Venetian culture and tradition. Everything seems to be going great between the young couple, but then Percy finds out that Graziella is part of an underground extremist political group and that she stereotypes him as a gullible rich American. Percy in unable to understand the stereotype she has for him or why the political group is willing to take extreme measures such as hold ups, etc, to keep the world fair out of Venice. Percy helps Graziella see that not all Americans are rich tourists and together with a little help from Mother Nature, they stop the world fair expo from being held in Venice. Graziella and Percy's relationship becomes stronger and they both realize that they are in love with one another. For the Love of Venice, is a story of love and politics that is enjoyable for people of all ages and genders. The political side of the story deals with the city's history and tradition. The love story is one that may seem unbelievable, but is one that you will not forget."},{"Title":"For the Love of Venice","review":"I am a huge fan of Donna Jo Napoli's books. She's very talented and I love everyone of her young adult books-except this one.Not to be rude, but it was boring. I was hardly interested in it, but I decided to give it a try. When there was only just 30 pages left, I gave up on it. I flipped through to see them talking about how they love eachother. It was very strange.The story was boring and went on for too long on pretty much nothing. It just wasn't my thing. I just couldn't get into it. But perhaps you may like this book. It's your opinion.I love Donna Jo Napoli, especially Sirena, Song of the Magdelan, Beast and The Magic Circle. She is a really good author."},{"Title":"For the Love of Venice","review":"This has to be my favourite young adult novel.

I definately suggest that you read it because it was a totally cool story- it had a little romance, but it was realistic in most parts, and deals with issues that teens have."},{"Title":"WHEN THE KING COMES HOME","review":"Caroline Stevermer's latest fantasy is an elegantly written and wryly witty story about a young artist's apprentice and her encounter with a living legend -- Good King Julian, raised from the dead by a necromancer with political ambitions. Its appealing characters held my attention from the first page to the last, but like another reviewer, I found the ending somewhat disappointing. Still, I will keep an eye out for any other stories by this very original author."},{"Title":"WHEN THE KING COMES HOME","review":"but not a great one either.Set in a mythical renaissance kingdom in Central Europe, WHEN THE KING COMES home tells the story of Hail Rosmer, art student with a fascination for a long-dead artist/alchemist. When the alchemist's seal is used to return long-vanished King Julian, Hail is drafted to protect the kingdom from the necromancer.It's an interesting premise and Stevermer's world is interesting enough as well. I found it hard to get into the characters, however. Hail's fascination for Maspero drives the novel, but isn't really explained. Partly because the story is told from Hail's first person point of view, the other characters blend in together without strong differentiation.WHEN THE KING COMES HOME is a pleasant read--but it has hints that it could be so much more."},{"Title":"WHEN THE KING COMES HOME","review":"After having read many fantasy books by many different authors I must say that this book was the worst of all !Even though the style is ok, the plot is as interesting as watching a stone fall to dust...At first I thought it might improve and kept on reading up to page 184 (of 236) but then just couldn't stand it anymore and stoped.The story is very constructed, the surrounding world doesn't feel real, everything appears very static and the characters are lifeless puppets. Not even once did I have the feeling of being part of the story, instead I always forced to myself to keep on reading in hope for an improvement ...which never came, up to that point where I simply gave up, and I'm not the kinda guy who gives up easily on a book.I can't recommend this book at all."},{"Title":"WHEN THE KING COMES HOME","review":"This had been recommended to me, but I can't really do the same. The plot development was fairly poor and the ending felt truly rushed, as if the author could spend hours writing about grinding pigments and melting iron but could only right small notes about the battlefield.The concept of it was interesting and the world involved (a nearly post-Renaissance European world mixed with a bit of magic and a few locale alterations) was very unique. I just felt that the story could not keep up with the scope involved.It's an average story featuring an average cast and the few characters I wanted to learn more about...well, I never did. Which was disappointing to the extreme. I enjoyed Hail's (the heroine) attitude and actions; it was nice to see a heroine with a backbone and inability to stop meddling. But Hail's pluck and Ludo's interesting introduction are not nearly enough to keep one from yawning over pigment grinding, fresco painting and the general everyday work of apprentice artists."},{"Title":"WHEN THE KING COMES HOME","review":"I'll be the first to admit that I'm not a very good critic. I enjoy plays and books that people will think are horrible. It's not very often that I give something 2 stars but I am willing to with this book.Her writing style is gorgeous but not very fast paced. I expected a different sort of storyline because I misunderstood the dust cover. I didn't feel a strong connection with any of the characters and couldn't relate with any of them very well. Few of the characters seemed to care greatly for Hail. She often seemed foisted off onto people who tolerated her. Throughout the book people complained of her being too chatty but I did not find her so until I neared the end. Some readers complain that the book has a slow start and that's true. However it does get more exciting as it goes on. Despite this improvement the characters seemed too bland to me."},{"Title":"WHEN THE KING COMES HOME","review":"Caroline Stevermer is one of those authors who writes (it seems) a book a decade, but oh what a book, when it finally appears! _When the King Comes Home_ is a true treasure -- realistic fantasy that doesn't shy away from showing all of the trials and tribulations that we often forget when indulging in a fantasy. The narrator is a young girl, apprenticed to an artist in the capital city of her (imaginary) country, who ends up being witness and participant in the changes that come when the Good King Julian of legend (he lived several hundred years ago, and died while at war, in Europe) reappears. There is a subtle Arthurian twist to the tale, which makes the characterization of the King's Seraph and his Queen, who also are brought back by necromantic means, richer and deeper.This is a book which rewards reading and re-reading. Another classic by Stevermer."},{"Title":"WHEN THE KING COMES HOME","review":"Caroline Stevermer has a new book out, _When the King Comes Home_. It's apparently set in the same world as her fine earlier book _A College of Magics_. It's been a while since I read the earlier book, and I confess I didn't notice any close links: I'm pretty sure both books can be read independently. This new one is a decent book, though not terribly memorable.The world it's set in is very much like roughly 16th Century Europe. It's set in an imaginary country in Europe, and the other fantasy element is that magic works, though magic isn't wildly prevalent. Mostly, the feel of the setting is like our world. The narrator, Hail Rosamer, is a young apprentice to a successful artist. She lives in the capital city of their &quot;country&quot;, which is ruled by an old, dying, King, and a capable &quot;Prince-Bishop&quot;. But people remember the days of Good King Julian, 2 centuries before, with great affection. It is said &quot;When the King Comes Home&quot;, any number of miracles might happen. Wilful Hail becomes obsessed with an artist of King Julian's time, Gil Maspero, who among other things made a special medal for the King. Against her mistress' wishes, Hail makes a copy of this medal, and by happenstance ends up one day encountering a man who looks just like the old King. Soon it is clear that sorcery is afoot: an evil witch in league with the rebellious lord of one of the provinces is trying to recall King Julian's soul to a new body and bind the King to her will. Hail ends up imprisoned for a time, then trying to help track down the witch, then trying to help free the King from her spell. I liked it, it was fun to read, but in a way I felt that not quite enough happened. It's quiet, and it ends in an honest but rather muffled fashion: Stevermer worked hard to avoid an ending with any sort of heroic cliche. That's a good thing, on the one hand, but perhaps it detracts from the book, too. Or perhaps while avoiding cliche (good) the book also avoids replacing the standard cliches with something really special. Lest I seem too negative, though, I repeat that it's a fun, engaging, read. Hail is a neat character, wholly an artist, headstrong, interesting, unobservant of anything she doesn't care about, like the obviously besotted soldier who keeps encountering her. The other characters are well drawn, too, and largely good people too."},{"Title":"WHEN THE KING COMES HOME","review":"I generally love Caroline Stevermer. Her books are so well written and so subtle. They are not fast paced. If that is what you are looking for in a book, you'll be disappointed. But they are well crafted and the language is almost poetic. This book was no exception to that.That being said, I was very disappointed with the story. I felt as though I never really connected to the characters. One aspect of Stevermer's books that I enjoy is the subtlety of the romances. This book had no romance. I kept waiting for it, and nothing ever happened. Ditto for the humor. Normally there is plenty of quiet humor, little one liners that help to ease the tension of the plot. I think there was maybe one line that made me laugh out loud and think \\"Yeah, this is what I like about Stevermer.\\" But that was it. And there were a couple of questions that were raised in the book that never seemed to be answered, a couple of characters that she started to develop and then just dropped.I read the book all in one sitting. But I was left feeling very empty at the end."},{"Title":"WHEN THE KING COMES HOME","review":"This sprightly, original fantasy concerns necromancy and an apprentice artist who drives everyone into an advanced state of irritability with her determination to experience true art.The setting is a finely detailed post-Renaissance somewhere-in-Europe city. Readers of Stevermer's \\"A College of Magics\\" will recognize some of the place names, but this book takes off on its own with the very likeable Hail Rosmer and her fellow apprentices.Hail becomes obsessed with the deceased artist, Maspero who was interested in magic as well as art. She discovers a gold medallion in the palace archives that Maspero supposedly cast, with a portrait of Good King Julian on one side, the obverse being a view of the city of Aravis. She pesters the archivist into letting her sketch both sides of the medallion, then makes a wax copy, and casts it over and over again in bronze until she is satisfied with the result.The young apprentice is very pleased with her medallion until one of her jealous colleagues accuses her of counterfeiting. What could any self-respecting heroine do but clobber her accuser over the head with her heavy market basket. She then flees from the city, not knowing whether she killed her fellow apprentice.Four days into her flight along the river, it begins to rain and Hail takes shelter under a bridge. There she sees a ragged tramp catch a mudskip with his bare hands and eat it raw. This doesn't bother her half as much as the fact that the man is a dead ringer for good King Julian--who departed from life over 200 years ago. She recognizes him from her medallion.Now we're into the sorcerous part of the book, with a magician as equally nasty as any that came out of \\"A College of Magics.\\" Hail plays an important role in the battles and necromantic manipulations that follow, including the recasting of King Julian's crown (again, the original was fashioned by her favorite artist, Maspero).\\"When the King Comes Home\\" has a relatively happy ending if the reader is into artistic fulfillment rather than romance. The wicked are punished, the good deceased sail away into a starlit diminuendo of love and death. Hail's masterpiece, \\"When the King Comes Home\\" is ---well, I don't want to give away the ending. Read this subtle, graceful fantasy. There's nothing else like it."},{"Title":"WHEN THE KING COMES HOME","review":"Many of the other reviewers have complained that this book moves too slowly. If you go into it expecting a rollicking adventure, then you'll be disappointed. This is not a novel of swords and sorcery. It's not something that you could pull from transcripts of your last D&D; campaign. And that is very much in its favor.Stevermer has painted a picture of the life of her main character. She is not your typical fantasy heroine, nor is she a wilting flower waiting to be saved by the big strong men. She's an individual, and the joy of the book is learning about Hail.The book expects more of you, too. Unless you're familiar with Renaissance Europe, and have a more than passing acquaintance with the Arthurian legends, you'll find many of the references obtuse. But for the rest of us, Caroline Stevermer has given us a rich world full of memorable characters, and my only disappointment is that the book was too short."},{"Title":"WHEN THE KING COMES HOME","review":"If something is unlikely, it is said it will happen when the King comes home. This refers to Good King Julian who has been dead for 200 years.Hail Rosamer is the daughter of a sheep merchant but she has a talent for art and wishes to pursue it. She gets her wish when a talented artist agrees to accept Hail as an apprentice. Hail's studies go well and by being in the city, she gets to see fabulous and legendary works of art, including ones that accurately depict the Good King, his Champion and his Queen.But a jealous apprentice tries to frame Hail and Hail flees the city. While resting under a bridge, she encounters a strange man. A man with the face of Good King Julian!Hail then gets caught up in politics as the Prince Bishop, the man who really runs the Empire, tries to squash rumors that the Good King has returned.But he man is not the King, he is the King's Champion, accidently resurrected by necromancy. Necromancy that will try again to resurrect the King. Thus the King returns, not as the Empire's savior, but as a puppet tool of an outlaw baron and a necromancer.Can the city and the Empire survive the return of the King? Can Hail disentangle herself from the politics? Will Hail's love and knowledge of art and the King's artist provide a key for stopping the ensorcelled King? What happens if they succeed?An interesting tale of one way that a people's hopes and dreams can turn awry."},{"Title":"WHEN THE KING COMES HOME","review":"I started reading this book expecting an adventure but getting to about page 60 and having to put a 236-page book down is pretty sad. The plot just doesn't move. If this was a biography it would actually be quite interesting, but taken as a fantasy novel? At first I thought maybe she was just trying to get more into Hail's character, but I found that I really did not know that much about Hail. I knew her fellow apprentices better. I put this book down on page 58. I have only ever not finished two books in my entire life; they were Homecoming by Cynthia Voit (sp?), and The One Armed Queen by Jane Yolen. I don't recommend either. It pains me greatly to not finish a book. The whole idea of the book would have been wonderful were the plot interesting in the first 20 pages, and it was in a way, but maybe only because I like to draw and she was becoming and apprentice to an artist. If you prefer biographies and are looking into going into fantasy books I could recommend this book, but that is considering that I really don't like biographies.Sorry for rambling."},{"Title":"WHEN THE KING COMES HOME","review":"I've been a Caroline Stevemer fan since 1993 when I found one of her early books. When the King Comes Home is delightful. The mix of magic and art, her post-Renaissance pre-Reformation alternate Europe with the city state as supreme governing structure and the ateliers as the height of artistic education reminded me of Firenze, Italy. Being married to an artist, although not one myself, she caught well the creative process and how creating changes the creator as well as the object created. Delightfully written, spare and elegant, with a nice blend of characters and an unexpected ending - all elements conspire to make a wonderful read. Highly recommended; Hail Rosamer is one of those people you wish you had living near by."},{"Title":"WHEN THE KING COMES HOME","review":"Stevermer does a wonderful job of portraying what really happens when the king comes home. I really cared about the main characters - Hail Rosamer and Ludo. The one complaint I have about the book is that she didn't fall in love. Just as another reviewer said, I really wanted them to fall in love. Anyway, I really enjoyed how Hail was an artist. I liked how Maspero, the object of her obsession, was connected to everything. It is a very original fantasy and thoroughly satisfying (except for the whole not falling in love with Ludo - who is perfect for her). I think this is better than Stevermer's A College of Magics - but read that too."},{"Title":"WHEN THE KING COMES HOME","review":"There's no doubt Stevermer can write some eloquent prose, however, her ability to keep a story interesting falters in several places in this book. It took a short while for me to get into the book and start liking it, and it was a good story for half, until she threw in her major plot twist which I feel disrupted a more interesting story. By the last few chapters I was speed reading just to find out how it finished. I have hopes that her style might yet yield a better book from her, but I don't think I'll try another Stevermer."},{"Title":"Women in Control: Iron Fist, Velvet Glove","review":"One would expect (from it's title & description) a photographic journal of female dominance, but this is not what's found in this book.Granted, the photography in this book is wonderful, but the title is deceiving to it's content.

Subsequently, after being published three yearsas an annual, in its fourth year it became a quarterly publication and it is now in its 11th year of publication.There is no basis to the prior reviewer's (Bob Franklin) assertion that SEXUAL HARASSMENT AND SEXUAL CONSENT/SEXUALITY AND CULTURE is outside the purview of scholarship and lacks scholarly value. Transaction Publishers, the publisher of the aforementioned series only publishes scholarly books and periodicals and any periodical accepted by Transaction for publication is subjected to rigorous scholarly evaluation. All articles submitted for publication go thru the standard peer review, such also includes the articles whose authors are invited to submit manuscripts for special issues/editions. SEXUAL HARASSMENT AND SEXUAL CONSENT was a very special issue since it was the first issue of what was hoped to be a serial publication and was primarily devoted to one topic. The first issue became a reality due to the collaborative efforts of the founding editors all of whom were established scholars in the social sciences, humanities and the law. It is not unusual for the first issue of a periodical not to be indexed; the importance of which was somewhat diminished by the fact that this volume was also published as a book. In any case, SEXUALITY AND CULTURE , quickly became indexed in scholarly data bases, e.g., Sociological Abstracts, Psychological Abstracts, OCLC Article First. All one has to do is to look at the track record of this publication [...] to know that Mr. Richard's charge that this publication is without scholarly credibility is simply without any merit. If one chooses to read SEXUAL HARASSMENT AND SEXUAL CONSENT one will find that this volume can function as an invaluable source for scholars in search of a critical review of the sexual harassment literature and emergent sexual harassment concepts in the 1990s. What makes our publication different from many others, and this may be the source of Mr. Richard's disturbance, is that we have no loyalty to any ideology, whether it be feminism or Marxism or postmodernism, etc. Nor do we engage in what Mr.Richards calls rants. What we do engage in is a quest for truth in the context of intellectual controversy and critique.Barry M. Dank, editor-in-chief, SEXUALITY AND CULTURE, Professor Emeritus, Sociology, California State University,Long Beach"},{"Title":"Sexual Harassment and Sexual Consent (Sexuality and Culture)","review":"This is the farthest thing from a scholalrly journal I have ever seen. An abnormal number of the articles and reviews are written by members of the \\"editorial board\\" and apparently no scholarly databse indexes this publication. This means that almost no one believes this publication is credible. It's easy to see why. The \\"articles\\" look more like rants. They rarely cite sources for the broad claims contained within, and when they do they are normally second or third-hand quotes and not from the original article supposedly cited. An inordinate amount of the content of this journal seems to be decicated to complaining about being rejected for publication or receiving criticism from scholars. The authors' sense of entitlement to publish seems to cloud their powers of perception. Peer review is supposed to be a quality control mechanism that makes sure sub-par work is not published as legitimate. This journal illustrates the need for such policies. One look at the editorial board also provides some insight. Many of these people are not qualified to understand or comment on the scholarly research on sexuality and culture. They review one another's books in glowing terms. The integrity of the review process is seriously undermined by the apparently incestuous nature of the process.Don't waste your time or money. This is not credible scholarship, as the scholarly community seems completely aware."},{"Title":"Around the Year with Emmet Fox","review":"This is not a book that says whatever you want to believe is true.

There are poems, prayers, scriptural passages and their exegesis. The theme is personal transformation and the practice of the presence of God. The main theme is that there exists a power that can liberate the captive and transform one's life for the better. This power of being is the Kingdom of God within (Luke 17:21), the power indwelling in consciousness. It is the invitation of Psalm 55:22 - Cast your burden upon the Lord.The text begins with an explanation of Isaiah 9:6, the attributes of God as Wonderful, Counselor, Mighty God, Everlasting Father and Prince of Peace. God is Spirit and we must worship Him in spirit and truth. The seven main aspects of God's nature are revealed as Life, Truth, Love, Intelligence, Soul, Spirit and Principle. Compound attributes consist of 2 or more of these, for example Beauty is made up of Life and Truth whilst Wisdom is a compound of Love and Intelligence.Much information is given on the concept of scientific prayer, which is the practice of the presence. When confronting a problem for example, it is wise to think about God instead of the difficulty.

Of course he never did any of this because NO ONE knew who Fox was in his time, practically speaking. I just googled his name and you will see that there is NO scholarly work on him, no reference materials; the wiki page is almost a wisp and offers no historical DOCUMENTATION (Carnegie Hall/5,500 member church, etc.). Whether any one of these details is true; if not for AA his books would not sell enough to be in print[either true or not true!]. I will also say that, unless someone is researching AA itself, ZERO seminaries or academies (philosophy or religion or American History depts.) discuss Fox, his concepts or New Thought. Why would that be? (Because he offered nothing worthy of study!)My point is that Fox offers New Age pablum, which rides on the back of biblical teaching to [sound] authoritative but is actually just an attempt to subvert it.

He finds himself an outsider among his native people just as he's about to take the giant step into puberty.And so he grows up and becomes a seismologist, believing he can protect himself from life's shaky foundations by immersing himself in the theories of tectonic plates. Then his grandfather dies in an earthquake and Soler holes up in an LA hotel and sort of comes unglued. He obsessively lists the movies of his life in an attempt to extinguish the firestorm of nostalgic that threatens to overwhelm him.The Movies of My Life is a sly and humorous coming-of-age novel that is far deeper than it appears to be on the surface. It deals with the immigrant experience, culture shock, family connections, and contemporary family dysfunction.It's a good one."},{"Title":"The Movies of My Life: A Novel","review":"Alberto Fuguet, I have found in a few research excursions, did something new with Latin American literature. In 1996 he edited a collection of short stories called &quot;McOndo,&quot; a book containing stories written by Latin American authors under the age of thirty-five. This may not sound all that impressive, but what Fuguet did was deliver a broadside to magical realism, a literary style that has dominated Latin American literary circles for decades. Fuguet's novel, &quot;The Movies of My Life,&quot; is a logical extension of his belief that a novel about South America (in his case, Chile) should tell a story about how people move, work, and think in real life situations. What I know about this type of literature from the Southern Hemisphere could fit on the head of a pin. I have never read Mario Vargas Llosa, Gabriel Garcia Marquez, or any of those other guys who are so well known. After reading &quot;The Movies of My Life,&quot; I would vastly prefer spending my time with this type of realistic prose. This book is not merely literary realism; it is so realistic that I couldn't convince myself I wasn't reading a non-fiction biography. I actually looked up Yul Brynner on a website to check and see if he had really married one of the minor characters in the book! Some critics in South America apparently criticized Fuguet and others for internalizing American pop culture or some such nonsense, and on the surface that may look to be the case. Trust me when I say that there is much, much more to this book than such a trite analysis.&quot;This is one of the drawbacks to being a seismologist: I always look deeper, I search for the cracks, I scan for flaws and resistances.&quot; So begins the story of Beltran Soler, a Chilean earthquake specialist born in Chile but who lived in California for a few years before returning to his country of origin at the age of ten. His emotional state as an adult appears to be about as stable as one of the fault lines he examines as part of his job. While taking a trip to a conference in Japan, he learns from his sister that his grandfather died in an earthquake in El Salvador. With this knowledge already eating him up inside, he meets a woman on a plane who tells him about someone who wrote a book about the greatest movies of their life. Suddenly inspired to replicate this feat, Soler stays over in California for a few days and furiously types his own list of influential films in an e-mail to this anonymous woman. What follows is an often painful excursion through the trials and tribulations of a young boy caught between two mutually exclusive worlds. &quot;The Movies of My Life&quot; is fictional, although it is important to note that Fuguet himself lived in California as a youth just as the Beltran character did.Each movie in the list touches off an intimate memory of some aspect of Beltran Soler's life. The first twenty-five films explore his early life as a Chilean immigrant in Southern California, with a movie like &quot;Woodstock&quot; bringing to the surface a recollection of Beltran's Uncle Carlos's countercultural attitudes. Another film, &quot;Krakatoa, East of Java,&quot; provides a memory of his Grandfather Teodoro, the man who influenced Beltran to become a seismologist and the one who died recently in El Salvador. Not all of the films supply such easy connections, and for many pages the reader wonders where it is all going. As the book grows on you, and it will, a picture slowly begins to emerge about why Beltran is the way he is as a grown up. His family life was never easy, with his philandering father and sometimes touchy relatives always creating emotional rifts and fractures. When the Solers decide to pay a visit to relatives in Chile after the overthrow of the Allende regime, Beltran's world suddenly falls out from under him when his family decides to stay there permanently.The next twenty-five films outline Beltran's life in Chile. An alien world after living in California for so long, the country's language, its schools, and its new leader General Pinochet serve as nearly insurmountable obstacles for the young boy to overcome. The movies continue to focus attention on specific incidents in Beltran's life. Issues hinted at in California now become full blown problems: his father and mother suffer a serious break, puberty arrives on the scene to wreak havoc on Beltran's existence, and he meets his first serious love. The final movie and the memory it brings back is simply devastating in its shocking power. I won't ruin it for you, but you will definitely find it surprising and horrific. Of course, not all of the memories are bad. Beltran remembers the family across the street who went on a television show singing tunes from &quot;The Sound of Music,&quot; or the neighborhood friend in California who often recreated films like &quot;The Poseidon Adventure&quot; in his garage using his friends to act out the roles. There is plenty of good with the bad here, just like life, and all of it is so realistic that even now I have a difficult time thinking of &quot;The Movies of My Life&quot; as fiction.I really got the sense I was reading great literature as I made my way through this book. It is too bad that many of this author's writings have yet to find an English translation. After reading &quot;The Movies of My Life,&quot; I passed the book on to a family member who promises to give it to someone else after she finishes it. I am incredibly surprised to see no reviews for this book, but perhaps word of mouth will help spread the word about this marvelous Chilean novelist."},{"Title":"The Movies of My Life: A Novel","review":"Fuget's second novel to appear in translation (following Bad Vibes), features a gimmicky framework that actually works well and transcends merely being cute. A somewhat clunky first section introduces the reader to Beltran, a Chilean seismologist traveling from Santiago to Japan, via LA, for a conference. A conversation with a woman on the plane, a snippet of a radio interview heard in a taxi, and the news that his grandfather has died are the catalysts for his holing up in an LA hotel and feverishly writing a memoir of sorts (which forms the bulk of the book). While it is a traditional memoir in that it proceeds chronologically&oacute;from Beltran's birth in 1964 and his life in Los Angeles (Inglewood and later Encino) until 1974, when vacation in post-Allende Chile turns into a permanent stay&oacute;his recollections are arranged in a series of fifty brief sections, each corresponding to a movie.In each case, the movie serves as a launching point for exploring an event from his past and reconsidering it. What rapidly emerges is a picture of a man scarred by both the dysfunction and displacement of his upbringing. While in the LA, his life is relatively normal, and he grows up as a regular American boy, although as he looks back at that time, he recognizes the fragility of his parents' marriage and his father's distinct discomfort at being a father. However, the real damage comes at age 10, when this fully functional pop-culture saturated American boy moves back to Chile, where has a difficult time adjusting to the different language, social rules, and culture. Ultimately, this is a bittersweet and poignant coming-of-age story, as Beltran's friendless adolescence morphs into semi-acceptance as a teenager, and of course, his sexual awakening.What is clear early on is the connection between his uncertain and capricious childhood and his adult fascination with earthquakes (events that shatter any illusion of stability, get it?). This is a bit of a heavy-handed maneuver, although the presence of a seismologist grandfather makes it all coalesce more than it might have. Throughout, moderately interesting issues of class and culture are raised, amidst this backdrop of films and growing pains. Fuget is the foremost of a loose band of younger Latin American writers who have rejected magical realism, and are attempting to forge a more real, modernist approach to literature. If this book is anything to judge by, it's a welcome change of pace."},{"Title":"The Movies of My Life: A Novel","review":"Beltran Soler, a seismologist from Chile, deconstructs his life and the struggles he went through with his family in the films he watched as a child. He describes the painful things his family endured in L.A., and how the aforementioned past played part to his obsession with earthquakes.Alberto Fuguet has written a wonderful and lyrical account of a South American family. I've learned many things about Chile -- things I hadn't known about before. It is a wonderful country with an interesting history. Fuguet is known for his involvement with a literary movement called McOndo, a movement that announces the end of magical realism. He is a true literary voice and I look forward to reading his other projects."},{"Title":"The Movies of My Life: A Novel","review":"The incredibly creative plot device that steers Alberto Fuguet's novel The Movies of My Life centers around a list of 50 movies that forms a brilliant vehicle to explore a lonely childhood and a dysfunctional family that takes us from suburban Southern California to Santiago, Chile. As Beltr&aacute;n manufactures his own list, he peppers the descriptions with details remembered from his childhood and in the process, writes a touching memoir of sorts. And like seismology, he always looks deeper, searching for cracks, scanning his family for flaws and resistances. One doesn't have to be a movie buff to appreciate the beauty of Fuguet's writing (and his list) or to understand the role movies play in our lives often even without our knowing.This is very much a book about the Latin American experience in Los Angeles, and it is a terrific portrayal of a city on the brink of change. From growing up in Inglewood to the Valley, Beltr&aacute;n gives us a slice of life, that is so inimitably Los Angeles. In those days \\"Inglewood was a run-down, semi-industrial neighborhood, stacked with bodegas and Laundromats; an expensive, itinerant area that attracted immigrants fresh of the plane. The area was divided between newly arrived South Americans and lower class white Americans.\\"The Movies of My Life also serves as an ode to a movie lover. The true strength of the novel is the remarkable originality of the storytelling - the way Fuget symbolically weaves the \\"movies of his life\\" through the narrative - each movie representing a land mark event IN his life. The book says a lot about movies and the role they can play in our lives, and the movies that really speak to Beltr&aacute;n are the movies that are really about him. Beltr&aacute;n admits, that you can even feel a connection to a movie before even seeing it, because people tell you about it, or \\"because you just know that the film has sunk its claws into you for reasons you can't understand.\\" The important movies of his life are also some of my most memorable - Poseidon Adventure, Logan's Run, Earthquake, Close Encounters of the Third kind and Jaws.Just life an earthquake fault, his family cracks, and eventually the crack becomes a fault - his philandering father leaves; he becomes estranged from his grandparents. The Solars are in a unique position, back in Santiago, they are without a social class, and so far removed from \\"the place they once belonged to.\\" The Movies of My Life is a profound, intuitive and highly original piece of work.Michael"},{"Title":"The Movies of My Life: A Novel","review":"A novel about a native-born Chilean who grew up in Los Angeles and then moved back to Chile. The innovative structure of this novel gives us a narrator who is an avid movie-goer and tells us of the films he saw during his formative years (1966-1978) and how they related to what was going on in his life at that time. These are Chilean folks who are relatively high-end immigrants. (I'm reminded of the Bengalis inUnaccustomed Earth: Stories (Vintage Contemporaries).) They migrate back and forth between the two countries based on the fluctuating political situation in Chile. But the narrator is really so thoroughly Americanized that he thinks that living in a single-family house in LA where Yul Brenner is a dinner guest is \\"middle class.\\" Another theme throughout the book is that there are three generations of male geologists -- seismologists to be exact -- a perfect foil for migrating between Chile, with its history of devastating earthquakes, and San Andreas Fault territory. The author takes only a single episode or a theme from each movie to form the skeleton for his remarks -- and that's good because we don't need a bunch of mini-reviews of \\"Star Wars\\" or \\"It's A Wonderful Life,\\" and, thankfully, that is not at all what the book is. It's a coming-of-age novel within the setting of a dysfunctional family. I found myself speculating on the extent to which the back-and-forth between LA and Santiago was a cause or a result of that dysfunction. The book is translated from the Spanish."},{"Title":"The Movies of My Life: A Novel","review":"Fuguet has uniquely captured the feeling of the bicultural individual in this haunting book. His description of Chile in the last part of the Allende regieme is right on. I was living in Santiago in those days and the book brought back powerful memories. However, the reader does not have to know anything about Chile to find this book appealing. Be warned, the book has a highly ironic bent and repays a careful reading with lots of insights.If you have found other Latin authors a bit hard to access, you should definitely give this book a try. It is a unique and insightful description of a young man's evolution straddling two societies."},{"Title":"The Movies of My Life: A Novel","review":"THE MOVIES OF MY LIFE is an introduction to this reader of the enormously gifted Chilean writer, Alberto Fuguet. Just when you think you are aware of the majority of the truly gifted writers of today (and with a personal philosophy of being an audience for new music, new performers, new films, and first books I try to stay abreast of what is happening at this moment in history)up pops someone of the magnitude of Fuguet to offer a sense of wonder at the seemingly endless line of creativity that bubbles around us.This book is classified as a 'novel' but it is so richly detailed and so closely parallels the life of the author (as far as where he has actually lived, traveled etc) that it feels more like a memoir. Be that as it may, it is the style of writing that is unique, wholly entertaining, successful on every level of communication with the reader, and inventive in technique that enhances the story. Well-outlined by other reviewers, the story is centered on one Beltran Soler who as an adult seismologist begins the book with a telephone conversation with his sister Manuela, who is in Chile, that hints at a family that is in disrepair. Beltran appears to have put away his past in favor of studying earthquakes, concentrating on the subterranean fault lines that shift and destroy the earth's surfaces (in Chile, California, and in El Salvador ...etc) In a layover in Los Angeles on a trip to Tokyo to lecture on earthquakes he encounters a woman who provides the stimulus for Beltran to re-examine his past life by comparing it to his favorite 50 movies. At this point the book becomes a 'scientifically documented' list of a wide range of movies with names, cast, theater where viewed, year of movie, year of viewing - each only a matter of a few pages that stimulate Beltran to reassemble his past. He lives in Encino, CA as a child then suddenly his family moves to Santiago de Chile where he does not know the language (despite his inheritance), has no friends like those who surrounded him in Encino acting out the movies that were the center of his life. Through these brief memory capsules we learn this boys' entire life, his longings, his approaching into puberty, first love, and the surprising dismembering of his family unit. The memories are at times hilarious, touching, dreamy, tragic and maturing. And beneath it all is his early preoccupation with earthquakes. As he begins his book he writes: &quot;People think these milestones are like earthquakes, the moments in which it all comes down, but the reality is that things are always rumbling. During an earthquake, people feel all the fear they don't feel when, in their everyday lives, the ground is often taken for granted. This is natural. The human body was designed like an anti-seismic building; at most, we intuit that we're moving only because some bad's happening, but something else prevents us from grasping its true dimensions. So, for all practical purpose, for most of us, nothing much happens. Nothing. Some end up with damaged foundations, though the majority manage to weather if well enough. It's only years later that we realize just how much of a tragedy it was that befell us, but by then it's too late.&quot; And at the end he writes: &quot;Some people think that we fall out of touch with old friends or lovers or colleagues or relatives because they no longer have much in common with us. But that's not it. We fall out of touch - we avoid them - because they remind us of a time that we have no desire to remember.&quot; Small samples of this writer's gift with words and philosophy.In this thoroughly entertaining 'story' of a family bounced back and forth between Chile and California propelling the move from childhood to adulthood of a sensitive child, Alberto Fuguet manages to impart a rich dose of observations about all of our interactions with our past, our present, our memories and our current realities. It is difficult to find words to express the wonder this young author stimulates on reading this book. A stunning introduction to an author of great importance."},{"Title":"The Movies of My Life: A Novel","review":"The premise of this novel is intriguing, specifically in the way that the author taps into his childhood memories of Los Angeles vs. an adolescence living in South America, punctuated by recollections of significant movies he saw throughout this 14+ year period. However, the book feels like it's setting up a payoff that never delivers, despite numerous references to earthquakes and the Richter scale--it's all minor rumblings, no 9.0 dramatic revelations. Some nice detail helps, and the list of films is intriguing, but the author's exploration of them is often thin to negligible--on more than one occasion the movie under discussion is dispensed with in one or two sentences, and the recollection goes in an entirely different direction. The detailing of the Los Angeles family members is finely wrought, especially the emotionally remote grandparents (the grandfather hates \\"Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory\\" for uniquely amusing reasons), and the South American atmosphere dovetailing with the author's adolesence is evocative. (His awkward friendship of convenience with another boy has a punch the rest of the book notably lacks.) Ultimately, the novel says little about movies, earth science, or families that hasn't already been said, and many could probably list numerous Latino literary works more essential than this."},{"Title":"The Movies of My Life: A Novel","review":"Reviewing the fifty most memorable movies of his formative years, Fuguet's novel approach delves into the emotional issues that shaped his young life and the man he has become. Chronicling his childhood years in California and his native Chile, each film becomes a vehicle into the past. Now a seismologist of note in Chile, Beltran Soler has buried himself in scientific research and accomplishment, preferring a solitary existence, one with few family ties or sustained personal relationships.Flying from Chile to Japan, Soler has a stopover in Los Angeles, where, rather than continuing his journey, he settles into a hotel room and a painful journey through the minefield of his childhood. His memories are filled with eccentric family members and folklore, as many relatives immigrate to California, a cultural enclave in the San Fernando Valley, reminiscent of their beautiful Chilean landscape. This extended family is as culturally diverse as any in recent fiction, providing important childhood connections. When his father distances himself from wife and children, Beltran's mother, aunts, uncles and grandparents are a touchstone for the young boy.Fleeing Pinochet's Chile for Nixon's United States, the family acclimates to California, blending their cultural identity with their new lives, rejecting a description as displaced South Americans \\"relying on nothing but their foundations of supposedly being white\\", denying their Latino roots. However, the Chileans are not accepted as white in their new land. Later, returning to live in Chile with his mother and sister, Beltran is particularly influenced by his maternal grandfather, a seismologist with a significant reputation in the scientific community, who guides his grandson's future career.Although Chile is in constant political upheaval, the family is safely cocooned by their scientific pursuits. As male role models, both grandfathers have a profound influence on Beltran's development, one a frivolous poseur, the other a demanding, if respected, patriarch. Along with his father, these men are distant and emotionally unengaged. When Beltran looks back over those critical early years, it isn't surprising that he is as far removed from reality as a moviegoer, watching the drama unfold on the screen.Beltran journals compulsively day after day, confronting long-suppressed memories, secrets and anguish never acknowledged. Purging the past, Beltran faces the pain of abandonment that he has so successfully avoided. Clearly, the need to for sustained personal connections is not constricted by place or culture and Beltran is called to participate in his own life; whether he does this as a Chilean or an American is irrelevant. With elegant grace and synchronicity, the author paints a portrait of loss, the importance of family and the reality of cultural identification. Unwilling to live in this sad isolation, Beltran reaches across the miles, reconnecting to those he loves, returning to the affection of time and place that so defines him.

As some of you might not be aware of this work was done as a small hand pressed book done by Baum himself. It was done in a 99 copy edition size. So as one might imagine it is next to impossible to find. This edition is well done, but could have been a little better bound. The binding is just your normal library binding. A dark orange with black lettering on the spine is all that indicates what is inside. The complete text and illustrations are reproduced here in black and white, with a very good introduction on the history of the text. The poems are typical Baum... none of which will lead to a great romantic following. The poems are a very interesting look at Baum writing for adults.

Poirot is invited to dinner and bridge by an eccentric acquaintance, Mr Shiatana. When he arrives he finds three other detectives have been invited, enigmatic Superintendant Battle of Scotland Yard, Colonel Race of the Secret Service, and Mrs Ariadne Oliver, a writer of detective stories. The four murderers are an elderly widow, Mrs Lorrimer, dashing, adventurous Major Despard, bluff Dr. Roberts, and Anne Meredith, a young seemingly innocent girl. The two parties, murderers and detectives, settle down to play bridge in separate rooms, Mr Shiatana sits by the fire in the murderers' room, and in the course of the evening he is duly murdered. The four detectives set out to solve the crime. As with all Christie novesl there are plenty of humorous touches. One of my favourites is when Superintedant Battle calls for one of the suspects. \\"I should have kept him to the end\\" said Mrs Oliver \\"In a book, I mean\\" she added apologetically. \\"Real life's a bit different\\" said Battle. \\"I know\\" said Mrs Oliver. \\"Badly constructed.\\" The detecives find out a lot about their suspects, including the nature of the murders they committed in the past(one of them turns out to be innocent of any murder). There are lots of exciting plot twists, and you are kept guessing until the end.

Well, this book reminds me in a way of \\"And Then There Were None\\" in that all (but 1) of the fiends really are murdereres.Actually, i digress. Before i get into the meat of the book, and it's positives-let me mention its negatives. For one thing, it is assumed that you know Colonel Race, Superintendent Battle, and Miss Oliver already. Ok, i knew Race, Battle, and of course Poirot, but i don't remember Miss Oliver, so i was led quite merrily up the garden path thinking that somehow she was guilty. (She does seem quite...unusual). Also, the book assumes that you must know bridge inside out. Ok-i understand that it was written in the 30s, and in England, where Bridge is played much more than now. But even in books in contemporary times, i hate it when it is assumed that one knows things. It's like if the solving of a 2010's book was based on facebook attributes or texting lingo-not everyone does that, so the ones that don't will be at a SEVERE disadvantage!Ok-that out of the way. I like how this book breaks into 4 parts as we explore the past crimes of the 4. Once the Major was believed by Poirot (that he didn't really commit a murder), then he was off the hook for me. The older lady (i forget her name) seemed far too engrossed in the game (remembering every hand in detail (i must confess, i skipped the page with the lengthy bridge explanation)) to have committed murder, so it was left to the Doctor and the young girl. For some reason, i didn't trust her-but that might be because in my personal life, i've been hurt FAR too often by \\"sweet young things that at least to me turn out to be not so sweet\\". But just as i was congratulating myself on solving the murder, it turned out the Doctor did it! (Don't worry, that oh-so-innocent girl was a bad 'un as well!) That stunned me.I will say though that just as in And Then There Were None, all the ones who really committed murder were punished. The Major was the only one of the suspects to live happily ever after, (and as i said before, he didn't murder).The only other thing i think is a \\"slight\\" negative is that it seems too coincidental that the young girl visited the older lady just before she was killed when she had nothing to do with it, but coincidents do happen i suppose.Well, my speech is becoming far too long, so let me say again, read the book-even one of Christie's \\"stinkers\\" beats most authors best works!"},{"Title":"Cards on the table (Hercule Poirot murder mystery)","review":"Cards on the Table is one of Agatha Christie's closed-room whodunits (a format she was master of) featuring her popular detective Hercule Poirot. But as far as Agatha Christie mysteries go, this one was just \\"ok\\" -- good but not great and definitely not Christie's best.Unlike many of her other stories, this one didn't focus so much on Poirot -- as much time was spent on the activities of Sergeant Battle and Ariadne Oliver as on Poirot himself. That wasn't necessarily a bad thing, since I'm not terribly fond of the too-smug Poirot.However, for me this book had three main weaknesses that kept it from rising above the mediocre. First -- and perhaps least -- is the character of Ariadne Oliver. This is the first time I've encountered her, although according to the Wikipedia article on Christie, Oliver is a frequently recurring character in her mysteries featuring Poirot. Meant to be a spoof of herself, Ariadne Oliver is a feminist writer of popular mysteries featuring a Finnish detective. I suppose she is meant to be comic relief, but I found her to be a simply silly character who detracted from the story overall.The second weakness of the book is that it focused largely on the game of bridge. If you're not familiar with bridge, as I am not, then many of Poirot's deductions and comments will not make sense to you.But the major weakness of this book is the most fundamental. And that is, the murder was committed at a dinner party, with the 8 attendees being the only possible killers. And the weapon was found still on the body. So why didn't they just dust the stiletto for fingerprints, and then take the fingerprints of everyone present? That would quickly and easily identify the murderer. There is mention later in the book of fingerprints, so obviously fingerprint technology was available and in use in the 1930s (when this story is set). The answer is obviously that the mystery would then be over in two chapters at the most. Nevertheless, the long, drawn-out, elaborate investigation seemed needless and senseless to me from the beginning.This is not Christie's worst, but not her best, either. The narration is fine, though."},{"Title":"Cards on the table (Hercule Poirot murder mystery)","review":"Written at the height of her powers, \\"Cards on the Table\\" contains one of Christie's most intriguing set ups. The mysterious Mr Shaitana (who is repeatedly described as Mephistophelian) is a purveyor of odd collectibles, and approaches Poirot to invite him to a dinner party with a difference. The assembled guests are Poirot, Colonel Race, a Secret Service agent, Inspector Battle of Scotland Yard, and the mystery novelist Ariadne Oliver, as well as Mrs Lorrimer, a composed widow, Anne Meredith, a young ing&eacute;nue, Major Despard, a big-game safari hunter, and Doctor Roberts, a personable physician. The former group are all investigators of some kind or another; the latter are a more disparate group, but when Shaitana separates the two into bridge parties and falls asleep in a chair by the fire, none are prepared for what happens next.When Poirot and his group finish up the game and enter the drawing room, they are horrified to discover that Mr Shaitana is sitting dead in his chair, stabbed to death with a stiletto. Any of the four sitting in the room could have done it, and it soon becomes obvious that all are equally suspect. Shaitana had previously made hints to Poirot that he \\"collected\\" murderers who had gotten away with their crimes, and Poirot realizes that his death is exactly what Shaitana had planned for his dinner party.It's four detectives pitted against four murderers: each one of them had the motive and the opportunity, but only one of them is guilty. Whilst the other three detectives go about the usual methods of deduction, Poirot takes an interest in the psychological aspect of the bridge game that the would-be killers were playing.\\"Cards on the Table\\" is one of the few mysteries that contains a foreword by the author, in which Christie explains that too often she's been told by her readers that most of the time all they have to do to identify the killer is to find the least-likely suspect. In this case however, all four suspects are *already* guilty of a crime, with an equal interest in committing another. As Christie herself says: \\"they are four wildly divergent types; the motive that drives each one of them to crime is peculiar to that person, and each one would employ a different method. The deduction must, therefore, be entirely psychological.\\" Perhaps more than any other Christie mystery, the solution to the murder is found in Poirot's insight into the criminal mind.Readers who are unfamiliar with the game of bridge may be a little cross-eyed at the constant references to the bridge game, though it should not impede the possibility of deducing who the killer is. Christie still \\"plays by the rules,\\" and does not overly rely on specialized knowledge. She does - as the title implies - puts all the cards on the table.This also marks the first appearance of Ariadne Oliver, who is a very transparent fictional version of Christie herself. With her tendency to eat apples while she's writing and her frustration toward her fictional detective Sven, Christie takes the opportunity to poke fun at several aspects of her writing career - including fastidious readers, the complications in getting a plot underway, and the distaste she has for several of her own novels. She's a great character, and pops up often in subsequent mysteries.\\"Cards on the Table\\" is one of the best Christie mysteries out there, with Poirot at the top of his game."},{"Title":"Cards on the table (Hercule Poirot murder mystery)","review":"Cards on the Table by Agatha ChristieAvenel Books, 1936115 pagesMystery; Hercule Poirot4/5 starsSource: LibrarySummary: Mr Shaitana collects things; one of those things allegedly being people who have committed murder without being caught. One night he invites four renowned investigators of crime (Hercule Poirot, Colonel Race, Superintendent Battle, and writer Ariadne Oliver) and four people who presumably have committed murder. But at the end of the night, Mr Shaitana is dead and Poirot and the others must race against time to capture the culprit before s/he becomes to emboldened by success.Thoughts: This is apparently the first Poirot novel with Ariadne Oliver, a mystery writer who allows Christie to express anger toward her fictional detective, discuss detective fiction, and provide comic relief. I quite liked her although sometimes I feel like Christie doesn't much like women.The four suspects were pretty interesting and there was a lot of backstory as we tried to figure out the psychology of them in order to discern who could have committed this murder. We also got to spend a lot of time with some of them, which helped me distinguish them in my head not that it helped me solve the mystery.As there were only four suspects, I had a 1 in 4 chance of getting the right person. But with all of the plot twists and details uncovered, I ended up very confused. I should just go with the least likely person! Seriously, there are at least two major turnabouts that change things! There was also entirely too much talk about bridge.Overall: A bit confusing but very thrilling and maybe you'll have better luck figuring out the murderer!"},{"Title":"Cards on the table (Hercule Poirot murder mystery)","review":"I enjoy reading the occasional Agatha Christie title, though- nine times out of ten- there's just no way I have any chance of unraveling the undoubtedly complicated solution. Predictably, that was the case with \\"Cards on the Table\\", an unusual entry in the Christie canon in that it features several of the author's notable detective characters appearing together. But also predictably, there's clean, no-nonsense writing; sharply drawn descriptions of individual crime scenes; skillful use of mood and flavor; and colorful, well drawn characterizations. In other words, it has all the things that are the true reasons I enjoy Agatha Christie.Interestingly, though, once the murder or murders is solved, Dame Christie apparently had no more use for her characterization, descriptive, and other storytelling skills, as all her books- this one included- immediately end once there isn't a crime left to unravel. You bought a mystery, you get a mystery-- end of story! Funny, then, that I always viewed the mystery plot in any given Christie title as a kind of bonus, picking up the books mainly for the writing qualities I described above, or put another way, the well-drawn journey.And, once again, Christie's \\"Cards on the Table\\" delivers exactly that: an involving, well-drawn journey. And that's good enough for me. But I guess that also means that I'll really, really enjoy an Agatha Christie title if I find myself actually figuring out the solution before our detective hero does!"},{"Title":"Cards on the table (Hercule Poirot murder mystery)","review":"The grey cells are at it again. Mr. Hercule Poirot finds himself at a strange dinner party where the host turns up dead. His death is no big surprise to Poirot, since the host, the mysterious Mr. Shaitana, confided a strange hobby of his to Poirot before inviting him to dinner. As a collector, Mr. Shaitana had a vast array of knick knacks and souvenirs, but for this dinner party his exhibit was to be four persons who had each gotten away with murder. Combine these four persons with a mystery writer, a private investigator and two professional sleuths, and the table is set for an ominous outcome.The four possible murderers compose a variety of characterisitics. There is Mrs. Lorrimer, an excellent bridge player who recalls the entire game but little about the room it was played in. Dr. Roberts, a well-known and well-liked physician, who may have had some scandal in his past that he is desperate to cover up. Then there is Major Despard, an extremely good looking adventurer with a possible smoldering temper. And finally the seemingly innocent and naive Anne Meredith, the youngest of the party, but quite possibly the most dangerous. Before the mystery can be solved, Mr. Shaitana's murder is not the only death that must be solved, and the race is on to stop the murderer from striking again.\\"Cards on the Table\\", like all of Agatha Christie's yarns, is a fast-paced quick read. Even for readers who are unfamiliar with the game of bridge, the descriptions of the game do little to slow the pace of the narrative and actually do much to further the mysterious personalities of the four possible murderers. The story is told from a variety of viewpoints, as each of the four 'sleuths' try to gain knowledge that will solve not only the murder of Mr. Shaitana, but also try to uncover what knowledge he held over each of their heads that may have given them the motive to kill him in a room with others present. \\"Cards on the Table\\" is an enjoyable read with several intriguing plot twists that almost have Hercule Poirot scratching his head and admitting he's made a mistake - something he is not prone to do, and doesn't do by the novel's end."},{"Title":"Cards on the table (Hercule Poirot murder mystery)","review":"Mr. Shaitana, an eccentric rich man who owns exquisite objects, invites Hercule Poirot, Agatha Christie's famous detective, to dinner at his flat to show him his latest collection. Only this time, Shaitana's acquisition does not consist of snuffboxes like the ones displayed at Wessex House where he meets Poirot. Shaitana has gone beyond collecting things; he is now collecting people who have gotten away with murder. The night of the dinner Poirot meets the four suspects: Doctor Roberts, Mrs. Lorrimer, Major Despard, and Anne Meredith. He also meets Mrs. Ariadne Oliver, a writer of detective stories; Colonel Race, a secret agent; and Superintendent Battle of Scotland Yard. After dinner the guests play a game of bridge. The four sleuths play in one room, while the other four guests play in another room where Mr. Shaitana, who declines from playing, sits alone by the fire. At the end of the evening, Mr. Shaitana is found stabbed to death. Even though there are only four possible murderers, the four detectives begin an investigation, which I guarantee will delight any murder story aficionado.I was captivated by each detective's distinct way of speculating who the murderer is and how each of them has a different method of investigation. I found it interesting, for example, how Poirot uses the scores of the bridge game the suspects played the night of the murder to find out some information about the suspects. This novel presented to me the challenge Shaitana presented to Poirot: the challenge of finding out who committed the murder without any evidence except for the murder weapon and the subtle clues Shaitana mentioned while dining. The dramatic, extremely creative and suspenseful plot allured me, thus making it my favorite Agatha Christie novel so far."},{"Title":"Cards on the table (Hercule Poirot murder mystery)","review":"While at an art gallery opening Hercule Poirot makes the aquaintance of Mr. Shaitana, an eccentric collector of art and curiosities.

Shaitana decides that he would like to have a dinner party to show off his collection and to that end, he invites four murderers and four detectives. During the dinner he drops a few not so subtle hints about what he knows and sits back to watch the 'fun'. The fun takes an unexpected turn during the after dinner bridge games, the host is murdered.The detectives on the case are Poirot, Col. Race from the Foreign Office, Sgt. Battle (THE SECRET OF CHIMNEYS and THE SEVEN DIALS MYSTERY) and Ariadne Oliver, mystery writer (DEAD MAN'S FOLLY and THE PALE HORSE). The murderers include Dr. Roberts, who may have killed a patient; Col. Despard, who may have killed the husband of the woman he loved; Mrs. Lorrimar, whose husband died under 'usual circumstances' and Miss Meredith whose former employer died of an accidental poisoning.The detectives decide to try to uncover the murderer themselves, each has their own ideas about who did it and why and each goes about the investigation in their own way. The plot takes many interesting twists and turns. Just when it appears that all has been revealed Christie gives one of her characteristic twists .The main reason that I feel that this is a four, not a five star novel is the emphasis placed on the bridge game. As a non-bridge player I felt that there was a vital clue that I was missing even though it was right there in front of me. In fairness it is possible to solve the crime without the bridge game clues but it was still frustrating while reading the story."},{"Title":"Cards on the table (Hercule Poirot murder mystery)","review":"This one contains three plot twists that had me grasping at straws.

It's the first case in which Superintendent Battle, Mrs. Oliver, or Col. Race appear together with Poirot or each other, and the only case in which *all* do so at once.The story opens at an exhibition of snuffboxes, where Poirot encounters Mr. Shaitana, a collector with a catty manner and a knack for gossip. Shaitana deliberately cultivates a Mephistopholean pose, which at first makes him seem like the potential quarry in the case - but it becomes clear that he's a victim waiting to happen.For Shaitana, like a few other collectors in Christie's universe, has succumbed to a foolish temptation, and begun collecting *people* - and not just people of talent or genius, but murderers. And being a connoisseur, he collects only the best: those who have gotten away with it. He amuses himself on this occasion by boasting to Poirot of his hobby, without naming names, and inviting him to a little supper party to meet his collection of \\"tigers\\" (Poirot having just pointed out that he himself could admire a tiger, but would do so from outside the tiger's cage, having respect for the danger.)Poirot accepts the supper invitation, however, to find that there are seven other guests, including the three other detectives as well as four guests who are presumably the murderers: explorer Major Despard, a strong silent type; Mrs. Lorrimer, a middle-aged widow who is *very* serious about bridge; timid young Anne Meredith; and Dr. Roberts, a loud and jovial general practitioner.Shaitana drops hints referring to four possible methods of murder, but otherwise the subject does not come up, and the guests proceed to play bridge after supper - arising from the final game to find their host dead, stabbed sitting beside the fire in full view of the players!This is, of course, Poirot's fantasy case, as he once remarked in THE ABC MURDERS - because there is no tangible evidence against any one person more than another. There are only the people themselves, and their memories of the evening, and the bridge scores reflecting how the evening progressed. Solving the case depends entirely on being able to understand the people involved. But how to get them to reveal their true selves to an interrogator - or to uncover the crimes that Shaitana believed they'd committed and gotten away with?Rather than following Poirot's viewpoint in third person throughout, some chapters follow Battle, Race, or Mrs. Oliver as they conduct their own enquiries into the case. Each represents a different style: Battle is a professional police officer, Race an empire-builder-type secret agent, and Mrs. Oliver a writer of detective stories. Battle, of course, has a duty to investigate Shaitana's murder, and does so in an orthodox style, cultivating an image of plodding hard work that tempts one to underestimate him. Race deals with checking out Major Despard, the explorer who's most clearly his kind of person. Mrs. Oliver, for her part, works on worming information out of not only Anne Meredith, but her roommate Rhonda (whose attitude is that Anne could've lived like a duchess for the rest of her life on blackmail if she'd been paying attention).And, of course, there's Poirot. He's really fascinating to watch in this one as he interacts with each suspect in turn, pursuing two major lines of questioning:(1) Describe how the bridge games played out, and(2) Describe the scene of the murder (the elaborate collector's room in Shaitana's house where the bridge games were played).See if you can figure out where Poirot's questions lead before he reveals his reasoning to his colleagues, and what he learned from the responses he received."},{"Title":"Cards on the table (Hercule Poirot murder mystery)","review":"I've read a bunch of Agatha Christie books, and this one is certainly among the best.

In \\"Cards on the Table,\\" she has exceeded herself. It is a whodunit lovers delight.To make such a puzzle work, the circumstances have to be fairly contrived. So you will just have to accept that four of the best sleuths alive all have consented to be guests of a repellent billionaire who claims the other four guests are successful murderers. Why the four accused murderers would also accept is unimportant. The entertainment will be contract bridge with the idea that by knowing a person's bridge game, you will see the inner man (or woman as the case may be.) Actually, this is not true. Some very nice people become gargoyles at the bridge table then instantly revert to their nice selves once the game is over, but we will let this pass.The sleuths are Hercule Poirot, the observer from hell; Supt. Battle, the plodder but tenacious; Colonel Race, pragmatist and gentleman; and Ariadne Oliver, penner of detective novels and rather silly. Why Dame Agatha didn't substitute Jane Marple in Ms. Oliver's place, I do not know. Perhaps Jane didn't play bridge.The guests are stock Christie characters: the Doctor, the Ing&eacute;nue, the Stern Upper class Lady, and the Military Man. The sleuths play together in one room, the guests play 3+ rubbers in the other room (the reader is supplied with a tally). Sometime during the play, the host is murdered in the same room as the guests with no one the wiser except the murderer, of course. This is an embarrassing state of affairs for the sleuths, having the murder happen almost right under their noses, and they pool their skills to unearth the murderer. We gradually find out more and more about the guests. Each, of course, had an excellent motive for doing the host in. To keep us thoroughly confused, the guests lie at will about themselves and each other, but they cannot outthink, outwit and outplay their opponents for long. We get the solution, and then a twist and then a final twist before Poirot & Co. have successfully settled the matter.This is one of Christie's finer puzzles. It suffers from a static setting (the crime scene), but she invests enough interest in all the characters to keep our attention close and our little gray cells churning.-sweetmolly-Amazon Reviewer"},{"Title":"Cards on the table (Hercule Poirot murder mystery)","review":"If you don't play, understand, or enjoy bridge (the card game), it may be difficult for you to be completely immersed in this book.

Christie was a keen bridge player and, although you may think this makes the book dry, she is careful to only use the card game as a small part of the story. The real fun is in the uncovering of secrets, as all the guests at the dinner party meet up and discuss what happened. Although Mrs Oliver uncovers some great clues, it is M.

He invites to dinner four detectives plus four people he suspects may have gotten away with murder.Along with Poirot are two detectives we have met in earlier Christie works: Colonel Race, the trouble-shooter from the Foreign Office, and Superintendent Battle of Scotland Yard. Introduced in this book is Mrs. Ariadne Oliver, a best-selling mystery writer, who has been compared to Christie herself. Like Mrs. Christie, Mrs. Oliver eats large quantities of apples while writing and Mrs. Oliver's books are about a quirky Finn who is not unlike Mrs. Christie's quirky Belgian. Mrs. Oliver will return in six additional novels.The other four guests that evening are: Dr. Roberts, a successful physician; Mrs. Lorrimer, an affluent widow who loves to play bridge; Major Despard, an African and South American explorer and guide; and Miss Anne Meredith, a young lady Shaitana met in Switzerland.After dinner, a game of bridge is arranged. Shaitana directs the four detectives to one room while the other four guests play in a separate room. The host says he does not like the game so sits and dozes by the fire in the room where the four possible murderers are playing. When the guests prepare to leave later, it is discovered that Shaitana has been fatally stabbed at some point in the evening.All four detectives tackle this case in their own way. Bridge players will delight in the way Poirot handles the case. He concentrates on the game itself, the hands that were dealt, and the method of scoring. If you pay attention to the game, you just might guess the murderer.This is one of Christie's classic surprise endings and, in my opinion, one of her best works."},{"Title":"Cards on the table (Hercule Poirot murder mystery)","review":"This book, with its initial copyright in 1936, shows Christie at the height of her powers.One of the coziest things about a Christie mystery - especially those which were written earlier - is that they are set before so many of the great advances in forensics. There's no mention of computer databanks or DNA, no fiber analysis nor hair samples. Now, I'm all for the wonderful things that can be done with forensics for capturing criminals in the real world, and these can make for fascinating reading, too. But novels are sometimes more pleasant when they don't deal with the technical side of things, but let the readers ponder, along with Christie's detective Hercule Poirot, the psychology behind the murder.In Cards on the Table, Christie sets up an imaginative, elegant, albeit implausible scenario. Four murderers - successful ones, those who have gotten away with it - are invited to dinner by Mr Shaitana, a rich eccentric who collects only the best - including collections of people. To the same dinner party this Shaitana invites four specialists in crime - a policeman, a man in the Secret Service, a writer of detective novels and of course our protagonist, Hercule Poirot. The dinner is excellent and Shaitana then makes some provocative remarks, putting the wind up in his quartet of murderers. The two groups - murderers and crime specialists - then divide into two different rooms and play bridge for the rest of the evening. Shaitana does not play, but sits in an armchair by the fire in the same room as the murderers. The evening continues until late. The crime specialists come to bid their host farewell, when lo! - to their great surprise, they find that their host has been murdered in the chair. The deed must have been committed by one of the four bridge players during the course of the evening.Christie then proceeds to reveal much about the murderers and their history. She does her best to be fair during the course of the book, putting her own cards on the table. And of course the pool of those who could have committed the crime is also limited - in another sense, the cards are also on the table. Finally, the bridge game plays a role in the assisting Poirot in figuring out whodunit. You can enjoy this book if you don't know bridge, but it helps if you do.Another advantage of this book is that there's also no appearance of the dim Arthur Hastings, for which I'm grateful.The psychology, in my opinion, is spot on in this book, and makes it one of Christie's best. My only question - and one which she did not have to answer - is to wonder if Shaitana had any plans for the end of the evening, assuming that he had survived? But Christie is not obliged to answer this question, and she does not."},{"Title":"Cards on the table (Hercule Poirot murder mystery)","review":"Agatha Christie's preface to this book says it all. In most mystery novels, finding the murderer is easy; one merely has to focus upon the person who was least likely to have commited the crime. Needless to say, this is not that kind of book.The incomparable Hercule Poirot has always boasted of his insight into the criminal mind. And in this book, he discovers, perhaps, the case most suited to his method. Four murderers, thrown together by a slightly sardonic host. Each had a motive. An oppourtunity. At the end of a bridge game, the host was found dead, and one of the four did it.Hercule Poirot, once again, delves into the psychology of crime and exercises his &quot;little gray cells&quot;. A note: At one time or another during the book, all of the suspects will seem the least likely, and most likely to have done it. Perhaps the most obvious candidate for murder is the one that is guilty. I am saying nothing more."},{"Title":"Cards on the table (Hercule Poirot murder mystery)","review":"Think of it- four suspects, all with an equal oppertunity and motive to have killed the mysterious Mr.Shaitana. At several points, it seems as though you know exactly who has done it- until you find out that it was not them, but another suspect. A brilliant, though sometimes confusing plot, all come into focus by the charming personality of Hercule Poirot."},{"Title":"Cards on the table (Hercule Poirot murder mystery)","review":"In my personal opinion, this Christie is virtually flawless. I think it is her best book.I espceially love the beginning of the book. It is almost ritualstic, like a Japanese dance. Quite unlike, say, Ackroyd or Express.The solution is not a trick (unlike both the previous); and it is based purely on psychology. Very good characterisation, an almost surrealistic atmosphere, and a devious, devious Poirot!The only comparison to this novel is And Then There Were None, which is even more devious, but less of a joy to read. Ackroyd I still admire greatly.But this book is, overall, the best of Christie I have read.Jonathan Lim"},{"Title":"Cards on the table (Hercule Poirot murder mystery)","review":"I was extremely pleased with Cards on the Table. The premise for the book was duly intriguing, with perhaps one of the more creative plot ideas to boot. The sleuths were intelligent and delightful, the possible murderers all sufficiently suspicious, and the victim a person who played his role to the nines.Dame Agatha made a point to say during the prologue that because you knew right away who the four possible murderers were, the element of surprise during the unmasking would be slightly less than if suspicion were cast on a whole room-full of people. True, perhaps, although not the common thread in ALL mediums.Cards on the Table, despite its aforesaid lack of surprise, does manage a neat, nice, maybe even SHOCKING unmasking of the murderer. It has no qualms about turning you around, giving you the classic Christie twist that makes you suspect each of the four in turn--and all in one chapter! You then realize that the true murderer is none other than the per! son you least suspected most--and that is perhaps one reason why Poirot was known to say it was his FAVORITE case, after all."},{"Title":"Cards on the table (Hercule Poirot murder mystery)","review":"Nobody really knows Mr. Shaitana's true origins but he's clearly a suave man-about-town, if a bit of a nefarious and prickly character, who LOVES to observe human nature. He has a discussion about this very topic with Hercule Poirot at an aristocratic soiree and says that he'd like to sponsor a little dinner party where there are four \\"detectives\\" pitted against four potential murderers.Poirot warns Shaitana against such a frivolous endeavor but Shaitana is insistent and sets up his small party just as he had described -- and, of course, Hercule Poirot is one of the detective-guests as are three other folks that we've run across in other Christie tales: (mystery author) Mrs. Ariadne Oliver; Scotland Yard Superintendent Battle; and, Colonel Race, the adventurer.The evening focus is a card (bridge) party for eight guests total, with the host, Mr. Shaitana, remaining on the sidelines, walking about and reveling in his unique idea until he eventually tires and retreats to a fireside chair for a rest... where he is subsequently found dead!Which of the four prospective murderers did it? Of course, Superintendent Battle is in charge of the case but he's shrewd enough to enlist the aide of his co-detectives.This is one of my favorite Christie mysteries, especially since it involves a number of good detectives whom we already know from her other works. \\"Cards on the Table\\" was originally published in 1936 so it's a fairly early Christie entry.While not quite up to the caliber of either \\"The Mysterious Affair at Styles\\" or \\"Death on the Nile,\\" I can still highly recommend this one to any fan of a good cosy murder mystery."},{"Title":"Cards on the table (Hercule Poirot murder mystery)","review":"Mr. Shaitana, an acquaintance of Poirot's, invited him to a party to meet four people who he though got away with murder. An Inspector from the Scotland Yard, a British Secret Service and a murder fiction writer were also invited to the party. Mr. Shaitana challenged the investigators to figure out what murders the suspects had committed. The suspects, Dr. Roberts, Major Despard, Mrs. Lorrimer, and Miss Meredith, all were in the room playing bridge when Mr. Shaitana was murdered. The four investigators began working on clues using their own techniques to solve the crime. Which one of the suspects murdered Mr. Shaitana in fear of Mr. Shaitana telling the police about their crime and were they all crime that Mr. Shaitana thought? I would rate this book a 5 out of 5. All four suspects seem to be guilty and them seemed to be innocent. You don't know who did it until the end.

Don\`t read this if you haven\`t read Murder on the Orient express because Poirot gives it away in casual conversation and, frankly it is a little better than Cards on the table, although it doesn\`t matter what order you read them in.I am sure that when you read this book you will find Mrs. Oliver comical for she impersonates Agatha\`s alter ego perfectly, &#34; When it starts to get boring a bit of blood or another murder will always liven things up&#34; she quotes in the book. If you are one if those fans who like the multiple murder mysteries this is one that has three and supply\`s the books main exitement factor. Now notice that I didn\`t say entertainment, that was because the the thoughts that the text puts into your head are so interesting that you are blown away by the detail of the book.The last twenty percent of the book is edge of your seat stuff and you won\`t be able to put it down so plan for a long session near the end. Plus, Agatha masterfully convices you to believe each of the four suspects in one chapter!I am a huge Poirot fan and I have already read almost half of his books and I am just about to read The Mystery of The Blue Train so if you like this review be sure to look for mine on The Blue Train soon."},{"Title":"Cards on the table (Hercule Poirot murder mystery)","review":"Christie says in the foreword that this book is quite unlike her others, but I would have to disagree a little. There is the same subtle revealing of clues and twists and turns that her other great books have. There are a lot of twists before the real murderer is fully revealed. The ending is surprising and well worth it. Also, contrary to other reviews, I would say you don't have to know anything about the game of bridge to \\"solve-along\\" with Poirot (not really a spoiler. He makes a huge deal about the bridge hands about two pages after the murder happens). I have no idea how to play that game, but there was enough context in the book for me to follow the pertinent information. You really only need the information about bridge that is revealed in the book."},{"Title":"Cards on the table (Hercule Poirot murder mystery)","review":"Only Agatha Christie would plan a murder during a harmless game of bridge.

The novel was published in 1936 still having the power to draw the reader in to the intricate tale of murder woven by the Dame of Death.Mr. Shaiitana is a rich Italian who meets Hercule Poirot at a London exhibition of snuff boxes! Shaitana's bridge party is unique since he has invited four persons who are thought to be murderers. They are:Dr. Roberts-A popular London doctor who has a history of adultery and the death of patients through the improper use of poisons.Mrs. Lorrimer-A wealthy bridge playing expert who murdered her husband several years prior to the events related in the novel.Major Despard- A handsome womanizing African big game hunter who has been accused of killing a Safari client because he was having an affair with the victim's wife.Anne Meredith-The youngest of the card party guests; she is a plain young woman who has been hired into domestic service. One of the elderly women she labored for in a small English village was murdered. Anne lives with a young woman named Rhoda Dawes (there is no hint that the girls are lesbians).Also invited to the card party are Hercule Poirot, Superintendent Battle, Colonel Race and Ariadne Oliver. Ariadne is a crime novelist who loves to munch apples. She bears a distinct resemblance to Agatha Christie.During the course of the card party night the hapless Mr. Shaitana is murdered by the use of a sharp bejewelled stileto knife in possession of the victim. Whodunit?Poirot utilizes his powers of observation to reveal the murderer. Also during this complicated case there is a suicide; a near fatal murder attempt by drowning and a fatal injection of the poison Evipan. Also utilized in a past murder are antrhax and typhoid bacteria into the bloodstream of the murdered person. These ae not nice people we are dealing with.Christie does a good job in this book by keeping the characters few in number and delving into the past of all the suspects in the case. One of her best Hercule Poirot novels and a delight to read."},{"Title":"Cards on the table (Hercule Poirot murder mystery)","review":"Ms. Christie created another winning mystery but for one snag. Since I have never played Bridge, the scorecards and descriptions in the book were confusing. That in itself is a pretty large handicap when trying to figure out this whodunit. Her mystery is set on the premise that there are only four suspects and evidence is based solely on the psychological makeup of the people. As usual, Hercule Poirot's 14th adventure is chock-full of twists and turns. Ms. Christie's books are great mental exercises. If you like mysteries and know how to play Bridge, you'll probably enjoy this quick, fun read."},{"Title":"Cards on the table (Hercule Poirot murder mystery)","review":"Four crime-solvers are invited to a dinner party to which are also invited four people who got away with murder. The wealthy host means to entertain himself by seeing whether the sleuths can detect the murderers. After dinner two bridge tables are set up with the 4 detectives at one and the 4 murderers at the other. During the evening one of the \\"dummies\\" killed the host! Leave it to Poirot to discover the true culprit by questioning each of them about their bridge-playing methods.This book does not follow the typical Christie method and has fewer characters than usual, making it more difficult to provide necessary clues while concealing the mystery of the person who committed the deed. As usual, it has fast-paced dialogue which moves the story along nicely and multiple twists at the end.Christie is #1."},{"Title":"Cards on the table (Hercule Poirot murder mystery)","review":"Overall this book was very intriguing and one of my favorites because as Christie says, \\"This book is not that kind of book\\" where you spot the least likely person to have done the crime and find that they have done it. This is book is where all suspects are on the same playing field and they all could have done it. It is difficult to decide who it is because each person has a motive and each person is a murderer in their past. One must pay attention to the details of the character, their past, and the present murder. Christie does a very well done job of thoroughly confusing the reader by setting each suspect up in situations where they could have done it. Only those who truly understand the psychological mind will be able to deduce who really was the murderer. The only downfall to this book is for those who do not understand the game bridge. But even if you don't it's an excellent read and I recommend it to anyone who enjoys putting their own \\"little grey cells\\" to work.To summarize, Hercule Poirot runs into a Mr. Shaitana, who claims that he knows people who are so good at murder no one but him knows about their secret. Four sleuths, including Poirot, and four murderers are invited to dine and play bridge at Shaitana's. As the night continues, their host ends up dead and no one knows who did it. It is up to the four sleuths to narrow down the suspects by finding out what their past murder was like. Once they know how they murder, they will be able to make a logical deduction of who performed this one.Poirot lets his \\"little grey cells\\" go to work by asking each murderer about the room they played bridge in and also about the game and the rubbers played. \\"With eyes of the mind\\", Poirot leans back to think and is able to one by one eliminate the suspects by putting together the past murder with the present character and brilliantly uncover the true murderer."},{"Title":"Not Without Cause (The Operatives) (Harlequin Superromance No. 1338)","review":"In the final book in the series THE OPERATIVES, Meredith Santera is front and center. She is the leader of this group of agents, who are technically paid assassins, or so thinks Jack Haden. In their past, Jack and Meredith worked together and slept together, their work being as passionate and exciting as their hot steamy nights. But when Meredith mysteriously was fired from her job, Jack questioned Meredith about what was really happening, and found he couldn't continue his relationship with a woman whose morals and ethics seriously diverged with his.Meredith's mentor and boss, Dean Reynolds, asks for her help. She hasn't seen him in years because of their covert operation, but he has asked her to come into the office to talk to him personally because of the nature of his request. Meredith's new assignment is to find Jack Haden, who is reportedly in Guatemala, and kill him. He has become a rogue agent and traitor to the country, and she must put an end to it. She is also to find a man named Brad Prescott, a civilian, and bring him back alive if she can. The two are somehow connected, but Dean does not explain how.Meredith travels to Guatemala, thinks she's found Prescott but has instead accidentally found Jack in a prison, having been beaten and tortured and near death. What stops her from killing him, neither Jack nor Meredith knows, but it changes everything. And now Meredith and Jack are on the run. They aren't exactly sure who is after them, but they do know their lives are in danger, and whoever wanted Jack dead is probably one step behind them.NOT WITHOUT CAUSE is not your average Harlequin Superromance. The entire series covers the lives of various members belonging to \\"The Operatives\\", but this last book in the series seemed to be the most violent. When Meredith finds Jack, she can see the abuses that were done upon him in the prison just by looking at his face. Some of the descriptions are not for the faint-hearted. The sex scenes are also steamier than the average book in this line of romance novels, but they were well done and fit with the overall tone of the story.I'm giving this book no more than a 3.5 rating only because I had a hard time warming up to either of the main characters, but I did enjoy the adventures that Jack and Meredith had in Guatemala. There is a lot of tension-filled action as the two run for their lives, with Meredith trying her best to understand exactly who are the bad guys. The novel ties up all loose ends, explaining how The Operatives were formed and what they actually did as a unit, answering questions that may have lingered from the previous books. Meredith made appearances in all the books in this series, making the reader wonder who she really was and what made her tick. In NOT WITHOUT CAUSE, the reader will finally get introduced to this character, ending the series with a big bang. -- courtesy of Love Romances"},{"Title":"Not Without Cause (The Operatives) (Harlequin Superromance No. 1338)","review":"hi this is the last review i'll be sending for a bit like the last book i reviewed i also enjoyed this one she's a great author and i liked the suspense right through to the end thankyou"},{"Title":"Not Without Cause (The Operatives) (Harlequin Superromance No. 1338)","review":"Finally, Meredith's story, and is it ever a good one.

As this final chapter opens, Lundquist has ended up in New York, hiding in the guise of a non-union construction worker. In fact, that's what he is - amnesia from the previous chapter means that he's not even Ludquist any more, at least not to himself.The Slasher remembers Ludquist, though, as do the powerful people and the bent cops protecting The Slasher. The good cops are hunting Ludquist, too, the ones who don't realize that he was framed for killing another cop. And, amnesic, Lunquist deals with only the visible part of what's going on, not the forces behind it. As this tightly written moves forward, it becomes increasingly claustrophobic, right down to the final denouement ... which I leave for you to enjoy for yourself.The distinctive artwork makes it easy to enjoy, photos adjusted by hand, then driven to extreme contrast of black and white. The stark, hard-edged imagery matches the the stark, hard story perfectly. It's an unusual look, well done and well suited to the plot, in a way that far outweighs my esthetic quibbles.

Clause 4a clearly specified that death by suicide was excepted from coverage during the first year of the policy. Mr. Dickinson's wife, his son Stephen, and daughter Anne all considered suicide highly unlikely. The police investigation eliminated the possibility of accident. Stephen, Anne, and her fiance, Martin Johnson, undertake a private investigation to uncover evidence of murder.The plot, setting, and characters in Suicide Excepted are well developed. Inspector Mallett of Scotland Yard, one of Cyril Hare's popular, recurring characters, plays a key role at various points, but does not dominate this story. The death occurs in a locked room at Pendlebury Old Hall, a manor house converted to a bed and breakfast hotel. By happenchance, Inspector Mallett was a guest at Pendlebury that weekend. Is it really murder? Who might be the suspects? What might be the motivation? The amateur investigations by the younger members of the Dickinson family more often than not lead to dead ends, but we do learn enough about the suspects to develop credible theories. The ending is likely to be a surprise.Cyril Hare is a pseudonym of judge Alfred Alexander Gordon Clark. Having just read Suicide Excepted for a second time (October, 2006), I easily rate it as 4 stars, possibly higher.

MacAulay also shows how Sandino and his men peservered in a jungle enviornment, cut off without roads or running water, and how the first aerial attack was executed in the Americas.MacAulay does not demonize the Marines, as lesser writers and ideologues would love to.

Written with such a fine style the reader is situated in the jungles of Nicaragua experiencing guerilla warfare at its best. It is a well documented work. In addition to reviewing previous titles on the subject, Macaulay did extensive research on Marine Corps archives to produce an unbiased and scientific study of the struggle. Also, the portrait of the character is highly accurate of this little man ( only 5'-4&quot;) born as illegitimate son in a nicaraguan village, yet his nationalism and valor had monumental influence throughout generations of latin-americans. As of today his presence is still vivid and controversial."},{"Title":"The Sandino Affair","review":"Outstanding book. Excellent historical account of General Sandino and the genesis of the nationalist struggle in Nicaragua. A little vague on the extent of American commercial interest the US Marines were sent to protect. This book should be read by anyone looking to understand guerrilla warfare. Espcially useful in paralleling combat tactics used by the viet-cong or any nationalist insurgency. Should be required reading for all troopers headed to advise against the FARC and ELN."},{"Title":"Raintree County","review":"In my humble opinion, a bookshelf without \\"Gone With The Wind\\" and \\"Raintree County\\" is a like a smile missing teeth. We're all familiar with \\"Gone With The Wind,\\" the famous character-driven romance played out against the backdrop of the Civil War. Like it, \\"Raintree County\\" unfolds before, during, and after the Civil War, but unlike \\"GWTW,\\" \\"Raintree County\\" is an allegory of the state of the union as it undergoes the single most wrenching event in US history.The story centers around John Shawnessy, an idealistic youth in Indiana, his pure love for his hometown sweetheart, Nell Gaither, and his seduction by the beautiful but troubled southern belle, Susanna Drake.The plot mirrors this country as it progress from a time of relative freedom and happiness before the Civil War, through its enmeshment with another culture -- that of the deep South -- and into the terrible consequences to all concerned.There are some wars which are becoming abstractions, and the Civil War is one of them, but this book reopens the memory of the cost of this horrible war. This is a book of many layers. The more one starts to analyze it, the more depth is revealed. The writing style is unique. Like \\"John Brown's Body,\\" this book should be an integral part of any study of the Civil War.Sadly, its author, Ross Lockridge, was prone to depression. When this book was in production, Lockridge, married with young children, committed suicide. It's hard for me to imagine how he could have topped this book with any subsequent effort; perhaps he was afraid of that spectre of failure as well.In the 1950's \\"Raintree County\\" was made into a lavish cinematic reply to \\"GWTW.\\" The movie starred Montgomery Clift, Eva Marie Saint, and Elizabeth Taylor in the roles of the three principal characters; however, considerable creative license was taken with the plot, so don't make the mistake of thinking that if you've seen the movie, you've read the book. The book is much, much deeper and much darker...."},{"Title":"Raintree County","review":"This book is full of descriptive passages, people, places, situations, but, in the end, it all comes back to the central theme.

Until now, I had only a VHS set of 2 tapes for this 3+ hour movie. This is the movie that began prior to Montgomery Clifts' accident and finished afterwards.

Both he and Liz Taylor were at their best here; and the only other movie that comes close is \\"A Place in the Sun.\\""},{"Title":"Varieties of Conservatism in America (HOOVER INST PRESS PUBLICATION)","review":"Peter Berkowitz's books, Varieties of Conservatism in America and Varieties of Progressivism in America, are collections of essays by authors seeking to make the point that you need to know more about American politics than that there are conservatives and progressives. Under the big tents of conservatives and of progressives are sub-groups who even reject some others labeled as conservatives or as progressives. Over time, American politics re-balances itself via two major political parties seeking to win majorities by assembling sub-groups and their conflicting goals.According to the authors, the varieties of conservatism are: (1) classical conservatism (consisting of traditionalist and of social conservatism) (2) libertarianism (3) neoconservatism. Paleoconservatives, such as Patrick Buchanan (editor of The American Conservative magazine), have only a footnote in the chapter on traditionalist conservatism and brief mentions elsewhere.A major flaw in this book is the editor's failure to include essays by leading supporters of each variety of conservatism. The editor could claim only that each author had some sympathy for the variety of conservatism. Joseph Bottum, an editor of the neoconservative Weekly Standard, wrote the essay on social conservatism.Jacob Heilbrunn's \\"The Neoconservative Journey\\" was the best essay on neoconservatism. Unlike neoconservatives who deny or fail to mention their ties to Trotsky, Heilbrunn explained the origins of neoconservatism in the Soviet Union. Trotsky advocated exporting communist revolutions around the world. In 1920, Lenin learned from the Red Army's failed invasion of Poland that the Polish workers and peasants rallied to defend Poland against communist invaders. Lenin, Stalin, and later leaders of the Soviet Union understood, unlike Trotsky, that workers of the world will not unite to create a communist world run by the Soviet Union.To casual observers of American politics, neoconservatives are anti-communists because they opposed the d&eacute;tente policies of Presidents Nixon and Carter and they supported President Ronald Reagan's attempts to cause the collapse of the Soviet Union.The neoconservatives gained political influence by having activists in both the Democratic and Republican parties. Richard Perle, for example, is a registered Democrat who has held positions in Democratic and Republican administrations. However, Heilbrunn did not explain Richard Perle's scandals for leaking national security documents to Israel while serving on the staff of the late Senator Henry Jackson (Democrat-Washington).Tod Lindberg's \\"Neoconservatism's Liberal Legacy\\" includes a review of neoconservatism's anti-capitalist positions while centrally-planned economies were failing.The neoconservative essayists did not explain why neoconservatives are supporting using America's military power to establish communist governments in the world today. The authors ignored the MEK (or MKO or Rajavi cult), the Marxist terrorists who have murdered American military officers, Rockwell International employees, and large numbers of innocent people in Iran and in Iraq. When American troops entered Iraq in 2003, they attacked Camp Ashraf and killed many of the communists. The neoconservatives in the Department of Defense were able to reverse the policy and have American troops protect Marxist terrorists in Iraq.Neoconservatives are not Conservatives."},{"Title":"Luther and His Times: The Reformation from a New Perspective","review":"E. G. Schwiebert's Luther and His Times is a monster of a book with historical cultural, and religious backgrounds well developed; although it's over 50 years old, the book still stands up with anything current for the serious lay scholar or professional theologian.The heft of this single volume may scare some people off, but Schwiebert's style makes it easy to grasp his substance. The book is well-organized and, unlike many Luther biographies, not only gives background information about the Reformer but also enlightens the reader about the church, the universities, and the general society of the 1500s."},{"Title":"Luther and His Times: The Reformation from a New Perspective","review":"Dr. Ernest Schwiebert, who died on March 10, 2000 at the age of 104, described this book as his greatest accomplishment (Deshler, OH Flag, March 23, 2000). Researched and written on location in Germany in 1950, the book analyzes conditions surrounding the Lutheran Reformation according to history, politics, the church, and academia - a daunting task for one book. But the author organizes his material well and one of his specialties, the analysis of the Reformation as a university movement, comes through clearly and cleanly in this work. Both those familiar with Luther's life and those exploring it for the first time will appreciate how Dr. Schwiebert brought scholarly research on the topic into the reach of many people."},{"Title":"Luther and His Times: The Reformation from a New Perspective","review":"Schwiebert is lengthy and technical, written for serious students of the Reformation.

Guide to Wine&quot;, &quot;Wine for Dummies&quot;, &quot;The Complete Idiot's Guide to Wine&quot;, and &quot;The Complete Guide to Wine&quot;. Of the five books, &quot;Oz Clarke's Introducing Wine&quot; was (if I remember correctly) the most expensive of the five and, at 144 pages, the shortest--which made me question whether it was the best value. However, after comparing the five books, it's the only one I took home with me. Here's why: All five books covered my four major areas of interest (food &amp; wine pairing, the characteristics of the different grape varieties and regions, how to serve wine and how to decipher wine labels), but the Clarke book, in my mind, had the clearest, most interesting and best written material. Also, the &quot;Wine Wheel&quot; graphics (pp. 13 &amp; 18) and the Food &amp; Wine Matching Charts (pp. 61 &amp; 62) were, for me, worth the purhcase price alone. By the way, &quot;The K.I.S.S. Guide to Wine&quot; is a great choice for those wanting more in-depth coverage."},{"Title":"Oz Clarke's Introducing Wine: A Complete Guide for the Modern Wine Drinker","review":"A very good introduction to the world of wine. Clarke spends the majority of the book discussing the basics: what to expect from different varities of wine, and what to expect from the various geographical regions where wine is produced. He spends little time on specific labels (although he does offer a few suggestions), so if you are looking for a buying guide this is not your book. It does not go into much depth, but it does a fine job of covering the subject in a light, engaging manner."},{"Title":"Oz Clarke's Introducing Wine: A Complete Guide for the Modern Wine Drinker","review":"Just as I enjoy armchair travelling for its budget price, I like armchair wine books. Not all of us can afford to drink great wine daily, but it's fine to read about it and to heighten your appreciation when you do get the chance to try a great wine. This book is very easy to follow and does an especially great job on the various grape types (varietals) from gamay to nebbiolo and everything in between. It should answer almost anyone's basic questions about grapes and how wine is made. The flavor wheels and food charts are very helpful as are the regional breakdowns that make up part 3. I happen to like this breezy style, but if you want a stuffy wine book, don't buy this one.

It's easy to read with plenty of visuals that are well laid out. Wines are segmented by grape varietal, taste comparisons, and by country to enhance your learning.As a collector of wine, I also have many books on the subject,which range from basic to complex.

We drink a lot of wine, and neither of us know much at all about the stuff. Even so, at first glance I didn't think I was going to like the book. It seemed too simple, too basic, too cutesy. Clarke is fond of sweeping generalizations, and his writing style is like an enthusiastic public school boy describing his favorite pudding (\\"loads of flavor!\\"). But I must say, I think it's a great book. I use it all the time as a reference. He covers all the basic questions I've had about the production of wines, the different varieties, etc. Sometimes, I'm amazed by what I find in here. After visiting France, we decided we like the dry roses they drink there in the south (great in summer), and started buying them here. We found pretty much everything we tried to be good, until we had a bottle of Rose D'Anjou, which we hated. Looked it up in Clarke and he had singled it out as \\"one to avoid.\\" Anyway, I'm sure there are other excellent books out there on wine, but I felt moved to write this review for the simple reason that Oz Clarke has been a reliable source of information for me for over four years now. Plus, the style is unintimidating.

The mystery wasn't terribly exciting, and was kinda of predictable.

Her mother, who is ill, has remained locked in her bedroom for the past few weeks. One dark night, without an explanation, Bessie's father orders her and her little brother to get dressed and he whisks them away to their aunt in New York City, at which point he dissapears.

This one takes place in 1928. It begins with Ed Coulter taking his daughter, Bessie, and his son, Eddie, away from their North Carolina farm in the middle of the night, but leaving his wife behind. Bessie and Eddie soon find themselves living in their aunt's house in Harlem. Their father is hardly ever around and nobody will explain to them what's going on. Bessie is afraid that her family is breaking up, especially after an attractive, well-dressed woman picks her father up in a car one afternoon.My daughter rates this one about average for this series and I can see why. The mystery isn't the most compelling. There is little sense of danger and no pirates, secret tunnels, or dark forests with unseen characters lurking just out of sight. On the other hand, my daughter didn't see through it, so it maintained her interest right to the end.Personally, I found this one more humorous than any of the others. There are several funny situations, like when Bessie finds herself forced to eat oatmeal from a dish she had secretly had a big, slimy slug in earlier and had put away without washing. The situation surrounding Flo, the neighborhood hoodoo woman is also amusing.Like the others in this series, this story is good for kids. It includes real historical information and characters, and it has positive messages and role models. Originally, I gave the whole series 5-star ratings. In my opinion, however, the Harry Potter books are the heavyweights in this genre, and though I still recommend the &quot;history mysteries&quot;, they aren't as good as Harry. So, in the interest of consistency, I've changed my &quot;history mystery&quot; rating to four stars.

The police have few leads, and the lead investigator is reassigned to a homeland security force. Alex, who cannot accept that he'll never see his beloved sons again, sets out on a trail that leads to a series of revelations, each one more chilling than the last. Helped along the way by advice from police detectives, private investigators, lawyers, and his own gut instincts, Alex fights his way toward the truth. The plot assembles the history of magic, voodoo practice, and the gruesome tastes of a psychopath into a non-stop thriller that will have most readers willingly accepting their bloodshot eyes as they read late into the night.Remarkably, in all this fast-paced rush of a story, the authors never skimp on characterization and detail. From Alex's estranged wife Liz to the albino private investigator in New Orleans to the grocery clerk who gives Alex his final break, the characters are memorable and well-drawn; many, such as the one-lipped voodoo \\"houngan\\", are unforgettable. The settings are equally skillful, with the seedy underside of Las Vegas glitz contrasting with the more down-home grime of the swamps outside New Orleans. Even the Renaissance Faire, where the twins vanish, is brought to life with such convincing detail that it remains vivid even 400 pages later. The abrupt ending might leave some readers dissatisfied, but it thankfully skirts the maudlin.Readers of thrillers should not pass up this breathlessly suspenseful novel. Well-written, intelligent, and fast-paced, The Murder Artist deserves a spot among the best of the genre."},{"Title":"Murder Artist, The","review":"I loved it!If you like Thomas Harris you will probably like this book, though it's not as gory (but definitely has its James Ellroy moments).

In this case it's one with whom we can all identify, that of a parent with a missing child, or in this case two as the children are twins. Then comes the dreaded phone call, a chilling silence, slow, steady breathing, and the familiar, plaintive voice of a child -- \\"Daddy?\\"Put that down if you can.After that, it's a thriller. And those familiar with John Case know that he does scary thrillers. There's no supernatural aspect, but the 'ordinary' people that John Case creates are scary enough in their own right.Gee Im glad that my daughter is grown up."},{"Title":"Murder Artist, The","review":"I really enjoyed how this book started. It stands out against other thrillers in that the protagonist undergoes quite a bit of stress as events pertaining to his children's kidnapping unfold. John Case really wallops his character Alex Callahan by throwing the system at him. The police, his wife, and the media are on his tail over the disappearance. For the first half of the book you will be on your seat, captivated by an author tweaking this genre in new directions. But then it starts to fall apart. Alex follows up on leads and the story fades from a dynamite nail biting suspense novel into a run of the mill-seen it all before mystery.Maybe if you haven't read too many thrillers you will enjoy this book all of the way through. But Alex is not really fleshed out as a character. You will not be left with any idea of who he is as a person. At least he does not posses any superhuman attributes and remains an \`everyman,' so you will be able to relate with the character. And because this book is not a character study, it has to rely wholly upon the plot. So that is why it is just such a shame that the novel sheds all of the gripping earlier structure that Case built up and instead becomes a very typical step by step process. Another thing is that Case often writes in a manner that leads the reader to understand what Alex should be doing long before he does. This occurs quite often in the second half of the book and I don't want to give away the plot. You are left screaming at the character to ask this or do that, and he usually does, but not without long deliberation.Lastly, I just want to recommend a couple of authors that you might enjoy much more than this effort by Case. Harlan Coben has written a couple of really good thrillers recently. Try one of his later ones without the character Myron Bolitar, and skip \`Innocent' his most recent book. I guarantee that it will be similar in style to \`Murder Artist', only better. An author I like even more than Coben is Denis Lehane, try \`Mystic River' or any of his series that deals with a private eye duo in Boston."},{"Title":"Murder Artist, The","review":"What do stage magic, the art of Vegas illusion, origami and ghoulish voodoo rituals performed in the swamps of Louisiana have in common? In THE MURDER ARTIST they are all somehow linked to the abduction of Washington TV reporter Alex Callahan's twin six-year-old sons from a gala Renaissance fair in Northern Virginia. Out of these wildly disparate elements, and despite a convoluted plot that in places limps like an arthritic old \`coon hound, Case conjures a (generally) gripping story that will keep you entertained right up to its ingenious (albeit somewhat improbable) ending.Separated from his wife and fighting deadline after deadline at work, Callahan struggles to keep his sons entertained while they are staying with him over their summer vacation. The harried reporter's efforts to bond with his children go horribly awry, however, when the twins - Kevin and Sean - are abducted while on a weekend outing to a medieval festival. Predictably, Alex finds himself to be the police's prime suspect. In fact, Alex is the only suspect. Once his innocence is established, the authorities are back at \\"square one.\\" On the verge of mental and physical collapse, Alex decides to quit his job and devote all of his time, energy and resources to discovering the whereabouts of his sons.Alex's training and background as an investigative reporter stand him in good stead as he begins his search. Turning first to the Internet he discovers a string of cases - one more grisly and horrific than the next - involving abducted twins. As his funds and patience begin to leak away, he becomes convinced that the perpetrator of those earlier crimes, an accomplished stage magician with ties to a voodoo priest and whose previous residence was a psychiatric facility, is also responsible for the disappearance of Kevin and Sean.THE MURDER ARTIST is a big, sprawling thriller replete with atmosphere and local color. The novel is also built upon an intriguing and absolutely diabolical premise. Two problems emerge in the pages of this book, however. First, the plot is overly complex. The author, not to mention the reader, has to work way too hard to make all the necessary connections. And even when those connections have been made, the pieces don't always fit together neatly. Secondly, the character of Alex Callahan is not entirely sympathetic. He comes across as shallow and selfish. Despite the fact that he moves heaven and earth to find his sons, and is thus redeemed somewhat in the eyes of the reader, it is nevertheless still difficult to summon up much genuine concern about Alex's fate.The bottom line here is that THE MURDER ARTIST is an interesting novel with much to recommend it. It is a book that, as far as it goes, will capture your attention and, at times, have you gripping the edge of your seat. Be that as it may, this is not the kind of book you will want to buy in hardcover; read it by all means, but borrow it from your local library ... or wait till it comes out in paperback instead.

His biggest fear is not getting killed, but that his twin six year old sons will not know him as he struggles to see them periodically. That is why Alex enjoys his time with them as they wander a Virginia medieval fair.However, the quality time together ends when he receives the phone call with the voice of a frightened tentative child crying out \\"Daddy.\\" The police investigation goes nowhere so Alex employs his investigative reporter skills in cesspools to make inquiries. He finds a pattern that a voodoo crazed individual dubbed The Piper has been abducting and killing twins for years as part of a quest to fulfill a dark dream. Alex's only hope is to find a voodoo master hidden away in the backwaters of Bayou country. If he locates the master, Alex will pay a price to obtain help; the cost is being buried alive for a night by someone who might prove to be THE MURDER ARTIST or perhaps the twins' killer.This is an exciting thriller that grips readers from the moment Alex receives the devastating phone call. The story line never slows down as a desperate Alex, filled with guilt even before the abduction, is just about over the edge with a frantic need for penitence by saving his children and stopping the monstrous Piper. Fans will be stunned by the level of tension that grows to an unbelievable crescendo in what is going to be recognized as one of the best thrillers of the year.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Murder Artist, The","review":"This one kept me awake on a dark and stormy night, about 10 hours until I finished it. Maybe it's because I was avoiding writing a paper at the time, but there are very few thrillers I find literally unputdownable.I didn't care too much about most of the characters, but the villian was fascinating enough to make up for them all. The voodoo business, the bit by bit uncovering of his past... all creepy as hell. So much so that meeting him in the end was a little anticlimactic, but the book as a whole is still very much worth the read.I would give it 4.5 stars if possible, since it's no great literary masterpiece, but as cheap thrills go it's one of the best I've encountered in a while."},{"Title":"Murder Artist, The","review":"The first-person narrative Case uses speeds the tale along, as we are brought into the mind of a frantic father looking for his kidnapped identical twins. The slim clues that exist have the main character traipsing across America, looking into every kidnapping incident in which identical twins were abducted. Does he find any similarities where previous investigators have failed? If you have to ask you've probably never read a thriller before. A good read, but with an ending that could have been more detailed.This book is similar to 24 by Greg Iles, and other books due to the nature of the theme, so if you've enjoyed other books with parents searching for their seemingly gone-forever children chances are good that you'll enjoy this one as well."},{"Title":"Murder Artist, The","review":"John Case has done a fine job in this latest emotional thriller about a man's relentless pursuit for his abducted children.He'll keep you guessing as the father persues clue after clue taking him from N'Orleans to Vegas to California and points in between. Along the way you'll be educated on things like Voodoo practices and some history about magic and its relation to religion and the supernatural. Small problem with the ending but overall a fine effort.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Murder Artist, The","review":"Workaholic Washington DC based Alex Callahan has been-there, done-that in most of the major trouble spots of the world. Obsessed by the demands of his high-pressure career as an investigative TV journalist, he's relegated his wife Liz and six-year-old twin sons, Sean and Kevin, to a distant second place on his priority scale until Liz decides that she's no longer willing to accept whatever crumbs of time and affection he has to offer. Taking the children with her, she accepts a job at a museum in Portland, Maine, and leaves Alex to discover just how empty and meaningless his life becomes without them. Desperate to make amends, Alex is willing to agree to anything she proposes that might help mend the rift: specifically, a month's trial visit from Sean and Kevin and full-time, single parenthood 24/7. One of the first lessons he has to learn is that you don't break a promise to your kids. When the boys set their hearts on attending a Renaissance Faire being held in nearby Maryland, Alex quickly agrees and then, reluctantly, is forced to stick to his word. Caught up in the spirit of the Faire, he bows to their pleading and lets the boys head for the jousting ring which takes them briefly out of his sight. In that tiny instant...they disappear, and Alex, for the first time, realizes the full weight of what it means to be a parent. Concern turns to fear turns to increasing terror as his frantic personal search becomes a police dragnet which still yields no sign of his boys. Then his cellular rings...a trembling voice from his home phone cries \\"Daddy\\"...and after it's abruptly silenced, the full horror of the situation crashes down on him. Now he and Liz become enmeshed in the media circus he knows so well from the other side of the camera, but, as time goes by with no demand for ransom or other contact, the officials reluctantly back-burner their search and Alex is left to go it alone. Now 24/7 takes on a different meaning for him. Using his job-honed research skills, he starts with a tiny clue left behind in his home for whatever reason by the kidnapper and hits the Internet for answers. A nebulous pattern begins to emerge which necessitates an increasingly far-ranging personal search that takes him from the neon wilderness of Las Vegas to the back country and swamps of Louisiana to the decadence of Northern California. When he finally understands WHY they were taken...HOW to find and rescue his boys becomes his and the reader's imperative. That's the point where this breathtakingly superb thriller quite literally becomes un-put-downable.In his previous novels, John Case has primarily focused his attention on global issues, so this highly-personalized, domestic thriller is a stunning change of pace for him, highlighted and intensified by his use of a first-person narrator. Roughly the first hundred pages of the book explore the mindset of an abductee's parents in some depth and establish Alex as a completely sympathetic and wholly believable protagonist...essential given the trials and terrors that he's subsequently called upon to face and overcome...whom Case then surrounds with a fascinatingly diverse and equally well-realized cast of supporting characters. Fictional Alex uses research as a tool to provide him with the answers he so desperately seeks and dearly wants. John Case's obviously thorough research into the real worlds of Ren Faires, professional magic and voodoo provides his readers with an intensely interesting and beautifully-detailed background for the story he has to tell. This may well be his strongest and best novel to date, and I can't help thinking how well it would translate into a genuine blockbuster of a movie."},{"Title":"Murder Artist, The","review":"The first half was gripping, but then it disintegrated,,,,the voodoo stuff was weird and the idea of this middle-aged sedentary man doing all this incredibly physical action is semi-believeable. Also, did anyone else wonder how the hero, who was described earlier as being financially strapped (on leave, had to get a $5,000 advance on his Visa, owes alimony to his ex) managed to fly all over the country, rent cars right and left, stay at hotels and motels, etc??? Just not plausible. Also, I never try to guess what is coming next (like to just go along for the read) but two of the conjurers tricks were so obvious I spotted them at once: woman sawn in half and Indian rope trick. Not up to his usual standard."},{"Title":"Murder Artist, The","review":"I enjoyed the first half very much, the second half I still enjoyed but not quite as much. It just got more and more unbelievable and ridiculous and the ending was too abrupt.That being said I will still read anything written by John Case because even my least favorite book of his (theirs? I think it's a husband and wife team writing together) is still good."},{"Title":"Murder Artist, The","review":"another great thriller by john case. i have read all of his books and this one ranks #1"},{"Title":"Murder Artist, The","review":"I've read each of John Case's books but this one disappointed me. It had none of the insightful, suspenseful twists that I have enjoyed in his other books. And it had no ending, it simply stopped which was to be expected as it really seemed more of a germ of an idea for a story as opposed to being a good story.I'll read his future books, but I don't recommend this one."},{"Title":"Murder Artist, The","review":"As with this husband and wife team's other novels, notably \\"The Genesis Code\\" and \\"The Eighth Day\\", \\"The Murder Artist\\" blazes out of the reader's starting gate like a racehorse on stimulants. Here, the father of twin six-year-old boys retells the harrowing tale of how a father/sons' day at a Renaissance Fair turns into a frantic marathon rescue mission when the boys are abducted by a man who has a penchant for magic. The first person voice of Alex Callahan tells his story with enough emotional realism to make any parent want to go out and buy toddler leashes for any of their children under the age of 21. I found myself engrossed by the story from early on; the details of the police investigation and Alex's frenzied response typifies Case's unique gift of getting the reader to empathize with another of their very human narrators-- a regular guy who either through greed, cleverness or, in this case, simple happenstance, stumbles onto something so macabre and labyrintine, he must uncover a vertitable Da Vinci Code of oddball trivia lore to regain his sons.In this one, the Cases lead us on a merry chase that explores serial killings, magic acts in Las Vegas and occult voodoo practices in Louisiana fascinating, page-turning segments that moves the main character around many US cities while hynotisizing the reader with a wealth of researched information that adds volumes to the credibility of the plot and keeps the old grey matter folding.My main criticism with this novel and with Case's other novels is that the team doesn't maintain the mental momentum. In \\"Murder Artist\\" in particular, the story works so well on a thinking level that the action of the characters seems a let-down. The final piece to the mental puzzle should click in as the action winds down so the reader gets a double karate kick on both a sensual and cerebral level. As with many novels of this genre, once our narrator discovers the trick to the Chinese conundrum, the brain rush shuts off and the actual denouement -- the rescue, in this instance -- always a step or two behind, flails painfully, almost seeming like a mundane \\"going through the motions\\" and a telling of boring secondary events the reader doesn't even need to read because the thinking aspect of the character has been switched off. The result? A feeling of reader burn-out that after all that research and clever workings, the authors simply do not deserve.Another aspect of the story that I thought needed work was the use of dialogue rather than strict narration to convey key facts on which to build the story's main points of interest. Dan Brown succeeds in giving the reader plenty of obscure facts to string together to form an interesting platform from which to jump into the realm of the imagingation; Case tries hard, but the use of dialogue between characters almost comes off as attempting a nonchalance that comes off as forced.Bottom line: Good page turner that kept my brain busy until the almost unnecessary action kicks in at the very end."},{"Title":"Murder Artist, The","review":"Wow! I ordered this book by mistake when I had intended to buy Johnathan Santloffer's Death Artist. What a serendipidous mistake! Even though I began to read this book grudgingly (having paid for something that I didn't think I'd want), I was very quickly sucked in and couldn't put the book down.Although the mystery is a little simplistic and although the author doesn't really follow through on some of the most intriguing elements of the story (e.g., I would have liked to have seen the voodoo clues found at the crime scene developed into something a bit more sinister and significant), the real strength of this novel is in the heart-wrenching and completely believeable descriptions of the angst and fear that the main character goes through after his children have been kidnapped. If for no other reason than this strength, I would recommend this book to any parent who's a thriller fan.Note -- I have also read one other book by this author: The Syndrome. The Murder Artist is written in an entirely different style such that I would never have guessed that the two books are by the same author. The Murder Artist is written in the first person whereas The Syndrome is written in the more typical third person omniscient. I'm usually not a fan of \\"first person\\" writing, but it really worked in this book and I believe that it helped to convey the strong sense or urgency and bewilderment felt by the main character. Be aware of this if you're looking for a repeat of Mr. Case's earlier novels."},{"Title":"Murder Artist, The","review":"I have to admit it took me a long time to read this novel. Why? Because it starts very slowly. A divorced man takes his twin boys to a fair and they are kidnapped. After a long exhausting search he figures out that they were abducted by a magician, with a history of kidnapping identical twins. The magician will do an impossible trick, like cut a person in half and then put them back together. The secret to his trick is that he really kills one of the twins on stage and uses the other as proof that the person is okay. Of course, he kills the other twin later when the survivor realizes their sibling has actually been murder. Now, this man must find his sons before they suffer the same fate as at least two other sets of twins.I liked the idea of the murdering magician. Let's face it, they have the perfect personality type to become mass murderers or serial killers. They engage in deception and get their kicks pulling one over on their audience. What a rush a magician would get from committing a real murder and getting a way with it.What I didn't like is the long drawn out explanations of the history of magic the main character sits through while he is trying to find his sons. While looking for your kidnapped soon to be murdered kids you would think he would have little patience for these magicians that what to stroke their own ego. Also, four or five pages from the end a new storyline is started and never addressed again and seeing as how there is no mention of this being a series I think there should have been a conclusion to all storylines.I like this author and if he cleans up his stories (ok, the editors should do that for him) he could really have a strong fan base."},{"Title":"Murder Artist, The","review":"Bad plot, highly unbelievable. Wife turns money-grubbing just as dad is getting close to the children. Lots of badly researched magic and voodoo history thrown in as well.This guy is supposed to be a newsman, an investigative reporter, but doesn't utalize the media to his advantage? Bull!The book also never explains who the audience was in the final scene and what happened to the assistant at the top of the rope.I should have stopped reading after he arrived in New Orleans.

Every page was a chore to get through. I picked up this book because I thought Genesis Code was such a fantastic book - while I read this one - I kept thinking - there is no way this is the same writer. So I went on line and did a search - it turns out that JOHN CASE is actually a husband and wife team.If a husband and wife team decides to write a book - admit it - hiding behind this pseudonymn is insulting to readers. I regret the two days I wasted on this piece of trash. I will never again pick up a \\"John Case\\" book!"},{"Title":"Murder Artist, The","review":"At first sight there's nothing much to recommend this thriller- the plot is very basic, no twists or turns and characterisation is uninspired with lots of loose edges at the end. But it's beautifully paced by authors who clearly delight in research. As a result this is a classic old time horror cum detective novel and as one of the best of its kind, it's unputdownable."},{"Title":"Murder Artist, The","review":"The plot is about investigative TV reporter Alex Callahan's identical twin 6-year-old sons who go missing at a Renaissance fair. He soon learns that they have been kidnapped.

His investigation leads him all over the US and he learns that magic and voodoo is involved. The more he learns about the abductor, the scarier it becomes and he knows that he has to find his sons as soon as possible, or they may depart this life in a terrifying way.The novel's pace slows down towards the middle of the story, but picks up towards the end. However, Alex's quest to find his sons is still a captivating read.My only quibble with this book is that some loose ends are left untied at the end, but maybe the author wants the reader to use his/her imagination and figure out how he/she wants it to work out."},{"Title":"Murder Artist, The","review":"This is the first novel I've read by John Case, and it won't be the last. THE MURDER ARTIST is a very well written thriller, and I say that as someone who has read close to a thousand books in the genre.The best part of this book is the beginning. Reporter Alex Callahan's 6 year old twins are kidnapped, and the first hundred pages are a highly realistic depiction of how Callahan and the authorities respond. This section of the book is incredibly suspenseful, on par with the very best the genre has to offer.Unfortunately, after starting with a bang, THE MURDER ARTIST eventually turns into a rather formulaic detective story. Callahan decides to purse the kidnapper on his own, and essentially becomes a de facto private investigator. He then embarks on a cross-country trek, interviewing witnesses and pursuing clues.The suspense level of the book drops considerably at this point. Case is a writer who obviously loves research, and much of the book is filled with a lot of interesting historical trivia, much like the work of Dan Brown. There are many lengthy dialogues about magic, origami, voodoo, and a host of other subjects. I personally found these dialogues quite interesting, but they do slow the pace of the plot somewhat.The storyline is ultimately very interesting, but it does becomes less and less credible as the story progresses. Still, I enjoyed THE MURDER ARTIST, and the book's pace does pick up considerably toward the end. Overall, this is a very well written thriller, definitely one of the better ones I've read this year.Recommended, and I plan on reading more of John Case's work."},{"Title":"Murder Artist, The","review":"This was my first \\"John Case\\" novel. I found the story line and characterizations extremely enjoyable and compelling. However, the resolution was very disappointing in that the actions and events portayed were impossible to visualize, although I had the general idea. It seems to me there was was some problem with the choice of language used to depict what was happening. However, from reading reviews of their other novels, I see they once again employ intriguing premises and fascinating background information to tie everything together. I'm hooked!"},{"Title":"Murder Artist, The","review":"I wish you could give half-stars here--I'd really go four and a a half.I don't usually go for thrillers, but a few years back a friend's mom gave us a casette version of \\"The Genesis Code\\" for a cross-country drive. We got into it so much that we hardly pulled off the road from Florida to Ohio. Since then, I've been a Case addict.The Murder Artist is a fairly big departure for Case, as the first four books were all sort of bio-tech thrillers played out on global stages. All were fascinating reads, more for their just real enough premises than for the actual storytelling. This one deals with a parent searching for his abducted kids. The first person narrative works very well and, in many ways, this is the best-written of Case's novels.As with all of Case's works, the pacing can be deliberate at times, as he takes fascinating detours into subjects as investigative journalism, voodoo and the history of magic. These sidetrips add depth without bogging down the story which has numerous twists and turns and keeps readers guessing most of the way. Unlike Case's two previous books, this one never runs out of steam. Its creepy in the best Case tradition and contains not only a first-rate hero but also an engaging batch of supporting characters.If there's anything to quibble about its the fact that sometimes the characters miss clues that are a bit obvious to the attentive reader and that the resolution comes abruptly and is a little underwhelming.Still, the journey's the thing with Case and this is another dependable page-turner. Highly recommended.NOTE: I actually experienced this via the unabridged cassette version (shame on Brilliance for not offering an unabridged cd). Narrator Dick Hill has voiced several of Case's works. He's outstanding, one of the best fiction voices I've heard and he's in fine form here."},{"Title":"Murder Artist, The","review":"The Murder Artist is an excellent journey of mystery, suspense, and a whole lot of knowledge. The best thing about all John Case novels is RESEARCH! They go out of their way to develop some really intricate, complex plots that really become a learning experience wrapped in a really great story. The last book by the authors, The Eighth Day, just didn't live up to the realism and thought out plots but The Murder Artist definitely makes up for it.The story centers around a journalist whose children have been kidnapped. Rather than waiting around and crying daily on TV like other parents he decides to do something about it. Here the Murder Artist takes off and you'll delve into suck topics as magic, origami, voodoo, carnivals, and the mind of evil. It's all there.Read the Murder Artist and you'll suddenly find yourself not only thrilled and entertained, but you'll learn a LOT of really interesting stuff."},{"Title":"Murder Artist, The","review":"I devoured each and every page of the \\"Murder Artist\\" like a famished survivor stranded on a desolate island. At times, my mind conjured frightening images as the grim events unfolded and put the story's protagonist in dire straits. I could barely contain the visual manifestations that transmogrified from the author's prose especially when I read the novel in a public place or while monitoring my daily study hall. Imagine watching a super charged action packed thriller in a crowded room while the rest of the world watched an episode of \\"Little House on the Prairie\\". At times I was left breathless and ravaged even when I was sitting in a calm quiet location. What a thrill ride! Books of this intensity exercise the brain in the same way that barbells condition the biceps of body builders.The story started simply enough as a divorced father reluctantly took his twin sons to a renaissance festival in Maryland. It didn't take long for the father to get deliriously entangled within the various events of the festival. Hell, he actually managed to have some fun right along with his sons. During the joust, the twins wandered towards a fence in front of the event. Father watched his sons but momentarily detached to watch an action packed joust featuring two competitive knights. Looking back towards his sons, the father realized that his worst nightmare was about to unfold. The boys were gone. The mystery of the abduction was quickly replaced with an unending search for clues pieced together in a heart-pounding format to bring any reader to the verge of a heart-attack. As the hapless father used his career as a reporter to follow every lead no matter how trivial, the story evolved like a Pandora's box frustrating readers with numerous dead-ends and enlightening them with unexpected illuminations. To attain one clue, the desperate Dad even allowed himself to be buried alive in a wooden coffin by a voodoo doctor. Although I read fearfully through the novel (the thought of my sons in a similar predicament was totally disturbing), I was always savoring the amazing plot and pulse-pounding dialog. John Case provided an experience I won't soon forget. If you make it to the climax without passing out, you won't be disappointed.Jay's Grade: ADecember 7, 2004"},{"Title":"Murder Artist, The","review":"One of the joys of reading is picking up on an author at the point where they go from someone you check out occasionally to your \`A' list --- that tattered list that is so old and long that you have it folded over and taped together, that you add to more often than you subtract from. I have the feeling that John Case's latest effort, THE MURDER ARTIST, will put him on a lot of those lists.Alex Callahan, the protagonist of this agonizingly thrilling work, is the type of guy with whom a lot of the male readership will readily identify. He is an investigative television reporter whose marriage is unable to stand the strain on his job. Estranged from his wife, with the chances of a reconciliation being slim to none, Callahan is settling in for an extended period of visitation with his six-year-old twin sons. An idyllic afternoon at a local Renaissance Fair --- even Callahan is beginning to enjoy himself --- is abruptly and irrevocably shattered when the boys disappear.Case's handling of the disappearance and the immediate aftermath is marvelous. Callahan's reaction, not only to the disappearance but also to his initial status as a suspect by local law enforcement, is so true to life that it is at once painful and compelling to read. And when local and federal law enforcement reach a dead end, Callahan begins an investigation of his own. His only clues as to the fate of his sons are found in his home: two rows of dimes, a blood-soaked tee shirt, and a mysterious origami figure. Callahan is not without investigative resources, but ultimately he is on his own, knowing that the odds of finding them grow horribly against him with each passing day. As his search leads him back and forth across the country, Callahan realizes that he is chasing a brilliant, elusive and dangerous phantom --- and that time is running out for him and his sons.Case is quite frankly nothing short of brilliant here. His plotting and pacing, always good in his previous work, is absolutely superb here. He never lets the reader know any more than Callahan does; each page, each paragraph --- heck, at some points each sentence --- is a blind alley. You never know what will or won't happen, or where Callahan's worthy quest will take him. As a result, there are points in THE MURDER ARTIST where literally you'll feel your heart stop. And keep the defibrillator handy: while most matters are resolved, for better or otherwise, one or two plot threads are left hanging that could provide the basis for a sequel, should Case be so inclined.For now, however, THE MURDER ARTIST is more than enough of a cardiovascular workout.

He is endeavoring to creatively entertain his sons in the month of custody he has been given.At the boy's behest, they decide to attend a Renaissance fair in the nearby Maryland countryside. Much to the horror of Callahan, the boys, adorned in medieval squire attire, disappear in the midst of the tumult created by a jousting match. When an intensive scouring of the fairgrounds doesn't lead to the discovery of the boy's whereabouts, a criminal investigation ensues.The story navigates through the media sensationalism created by the kidnapping . The investigation, aided by Callahan himself, who has taken a leave of absence from his job, soon loses steam. What we do learn is that the boys have been lured away by a man dressed as the Pied Piper.In short order, Callahan is pretty much left to pursue the quest for the boys alone. His probe leads him to a plethora of colorful yet implausible characters who provide both assistance and clues.Case, not particularly demonstrating an impressive command of the English language, composes an unbelieveable account of what could potentially be an explosive subject. His narrative however explores the world of magic and voodoo, revealing some of their finer points.

But I couldn't put it down. Just imagine Stephen King combined with John Grisham and you have the sense of what I mean. And I gurantee you that if you read this book, you will never turn your eyes away from your children again."},{"Title":"Murder Artist, The","review":"This is the first novel I've read by John Case, and it won't be the last. THE MURDER ARTIST is a very well written thriller, and I say that as someone who has read close to a thousand books in the genre.The best part of this book is the beginning. Reporter Alex Callahan's 6 year old twins are kidnapped, and the first hundred pages are a highly realistic depiction of how Callahan and the authorities respond. This section of the book is incredibly suspenseful, on par with the very best the genre has to offer.Unfortunately, after starting with a bang, THE MURDER ARTIST eventually turns into a rather formulaic detective story. Callahan decides to purse the kidnapper on his own, and essentially becomes a de facto private investigator. He then embarks on a cross-country trek, interviewing witnesses and pursuing clues.The suspense level of the book drops considerably at this point. Case is a writer who obviously loves research, and much of the book is filled with a lot of interesting historical trivia, much like the work of Dan Brown. There are many lengthy dialogues about magic, origami, voodoo, and a host of other subjects. I personally found these dialogues quite interesting, but they do slow the pace of the plot somewhat.The storyline is ultimately very interesting, but it does becomes less and less credible as the story progresses. Still, I enjoyed THE MURDER ARTIST, and the book's pace does pick up considerably toward the end. Overall, this is a very well written thriller, definitely one of the better ones I've read this year.Recommended, and I plan on reading more of John Case's work."},{"Title":"Murder Artist, The","review":"This books starts out with a rather run-of-the-mill premise - kidnapped boys from a separated couple. Once the story gets past the \\"did the father kidnap his own children\\" cop phase, it picks up steam and I couldn't put it down. I typically do not get excited about first person narratives, but in this case the technique is key in keeping the suspense going. I couldn't put it down."},{"Title":"Murder Artist, The","review":"An actual family happening was the inspiration for this story. Magic is a central theme and voodoo figures into the plot. I've always loved David Copperfield's brand of magic and kept asking \\"How did he make the Statue of Liberty vanish?\\" A person who's a bit more sophisticated than I said \\"It's all illusion.\\" Thank you, Cathy at the Giles County Library, for explaining the obvious and for telling me the proper way to say facade. There is a movie just out, 'The Skeleton Key,' which uses voodoo to make a scary plot.At the Renaissance festival, the twin brothers disappear as if by magic. The cicadas roar, in the summer heat. I heard some here downton just yesterday and saw a dead June bug with the beautiful irredescent green shell. One white shoe is found near the barn where the animals are kept.They'd arrived at 2:18 p.m. (according to the receipt of her Visa charge) and, after dark, a search party convenes to cover the wild, woodsy area with thick vine undergrowth. Exhaustion causes mistakes and the search is called off. The mother is put on 'personal trial' as the investigator pretends not to believe anything she says. She takes the investigation into her own hands and finds her boys.It was a wild and magical trip to trace the clues, but a persistent mother, determined at any cost to find her young, cannot be deterred. She saw sordidness and the low life of clubs and magicians, but the end result was startling and good.This was based on an incident when Mr. Case (duo) attended a real event similar to the one in the novel and their two children went missing for fifteen minutes. All's well that ends well. I plan to read more books by this couple. One young mother (also with two sons) arrived at the doctor's office Thursday all harassed because the older one had wandered off (on registration day) with some of his friends at the Middle School to visit with last year's teachers, and she had several minutes of worry by not knowing where they were. She explained to me that it was a small school, so there was very little danger, and yet she was very distraught by the actions of her older son.John Case is not one person but a husband/wife team who who have now collaborated on five books. She has previously written three novels on her own, and he three non-fiction books. She chose the name of her grandfather, just as the Nashville writer Cathie Pellitier chose K. C. McKinnon, her grandmother's name, for two special books. I loved DANCING AT THE HARVEST MOON.The other John Case novels are THE FIRST HORSEMAN, THE EIGHTH DAY, THE SYNDROME and GHOST DANCE (2005)."},{"Title":"Murder Artist, The","review":"The plot is fully explained elsewhere, so I won't be redundant. The novel starts out well enough, with interesting and humanly frail characters. Partway through, though, the plotline becomes increasingly far-fetched, for instance the location of the bodies of the Gabler twins dessed as Las Vegas showgirls, reachable only by rock-climbing up a vertical cliff in a wilderness area. The author never explains how the villian accomplished this feat. Even the most seasoned climber would quail at the prospect of attemting to haul two bodies up the cliff as it is described. The ending is abrupt and parts of it make little sense. For instance, it's \\"almost eleven\\" at night when the protagonist arrives at the northern California coast. He checks into a motel, goes to a grocery store, drives for at least 10 miles into a different county, turns off toward the ocean. The author then states that it's \\"almost dark now\\". The author should realize that sunset does not occur sometime after 11PM in California. The author did make me laugh out loud once, again near the end of the novel, when he wrote \\"the moon scuds along beneath thick clouds\\". Unless I haven't kept up with the latest in astronomy concerning the orbit of the moon, I believe the author meant \\"thick clouds scud along beneath the moon\\". The abruptness of the ending compared with the rest of the novel makes me wonder if the author was up against a deadline. All in all, though this novel is an entertaining, often truly scary novel, if you are not expecting too much."},{"Title":"Murder Artist, The","review":"John Case's The Murder Artist is a gripping story of a father whose two sons are kidnapped. TV reporter Alex Callahan is separated from his wife and, to spend quality time with his twin sons, he takes them to a Renassisane fairground. While he is mommentarily distracted, his sons disappear. The police are called in and after a search they suspect that Alex has murdered the children himself. Eventually they realize that Alex is not responsible.Alex is heartbroken at the loss of his sons. Long after the police have moved on to other cases, Alex quits his job and sets out on his own to try to find some trace of his sons. He uses the Internet to try to track down other cases of twins who have been kidnapped. Ultimately he finds similarities between the kidnapping of his sons and a couple of other \\"twin\\" kidnappings which the police had dismissed as unrelated.Alex suspects that the kids have been kidnapped for use in some rather gruesome magic performance. Along the way he meets many experts in magic and learns much about the history of magic.This is a very well-written novel with a complex but interesting plot. I highly recommend it.

An excellent mystery!"},{"Title":"Murder Artist, The","review":"I've read all of John Case's books and enjoyed them immensely; this one is no exception. The Murder Artist is well-researched and replete with fascinating information about magic and voodoo, but it's also paced extremely well. Unlike the stop-start narratives of Dan Brown (chase scene, characters stop to talk to someone who knows stuff, then chase resumes) Case blends action and exposition skillfully. He also has a good ear for dialogue and can bring characters and settings to life with just a few well-chosen details.My only complaint -- and it's a minor one -- is that Case's endings tend to be very abrupt. He avoids the awkward tie-up-the-loose-ends closing chapter that most thriller writers feel obligated to include, so some readers will undoubtedly finish the book and say \\"That's IT?\\"Case's characters also do quite a bit of traveling, and there's lots of renting cars and checking into hotels that some readers may find tiresome."},{"Title":"Murder Artist, The","review":"I wish I could think of more to say than \\"this is the best mystery or thriller I have read all year,\\" but the truth is, this story knocked my socks off.

But his almost brilliantly complex plot is his undoing in \\"The Murder Artist.\\"The beginning is electrifying and horrifying: reporter Alex Callahan's 6 year old twins are kidnapped, literally before his eyes.The police strike out and after several weeks, Callahan decides to pursue the kidnapper on his own. Nice move - but it doesn't work.Callahan travels across the nation piecing the story together from a disparate set of clues. If only the plot hadn'st become so complex, it might have worked.But each layer of complexity renders the story less and less believable. The action becomes strained and soon you're just turning the pages without any real involvement. Kind of like sitting through the preliminaries at a tall tales contest.The ending is so strained that there's no sense of drama or relief. You're just glad the story is finished.It's not really a bad book: Case is far too skilled a writer for that. And it's not really boring.

Then he read another one on voodoo. He did some research on kidnapping cases. Then he went to a medieval fair. Then he sat down and regurgitated everything he'd learned into this book. Which is fine if you needed to know a bit about magic, voodoo, kidnapping and medieval fairs and wanted everything in one handy book. If, on the other hand, you're looking for an interesting thriller...well, you're out of luck here.Alex Callahan (the only fully-fleshed character in the book) has his twin boys kidnapped at a lavishly-described medieval fair. After a great deal of time is spent intimately describing the investigation, the authorities give up and Alex strikes out on his own to find the killer. So far, so good. However, from here on Alex spends most of the book sitting down and listening to other characters pontificate on magic, voodoo, the criminal justice system and even the proliferation of certain dog breeds. The plot is simplistic and the reader is usually way ahead of the protagonist when it comes to understanding the obvious clues he stumbles over with ease. By the 3/4 mark you're not only wondering why Alex can't connect the dots, but also why the cops haven't tracked down this serial killer - especially considering that every bit of evidence is hanging out in plain sight!After detailed dissertations on magic, ancient illusions and origami (to say nothing of the completely superfluous voodoo ritual that did nothing to advance the plot) Alex eventually tracks down the kidnapper and tries to get his kids back with a plan that shows all the earmarks of something dreamed up by Wiley Coyote and the Tasmanian Devil. The climax occurs in the last five pages and, despite Alex's triumph, is a complete let-down. The reader walks away disgruntled, thinking 'that's it?'Meanwhile, we're expected to swallow events that are little short of ludicrous. Are we really expected to believe that the dramatic murder of twin showgirls (with one of them literally sawn in half) disn't make the news in Las Vegas, let alone the rest of the country? Are we supposed to buy into the concept that years later Alex is the only person to have made the connection between twin girls and the classic cutting-the-lady-in-half magic trick? Are we expected to believe that the mysterious and secretive voodoo priest won't talk to anyone, but after a quick ritual he welcomes Alex like a long-lost brother and spills the beans? None of this is particularly credible, yet we've figured it all out several pages before Alex puts the pieces together. This is irritating and not something you look for in a thriller.This would be much more tolerable if there were any decent characters in the book. Alex gets a few flashes of development as he finds himself on the other end of the camera for a change, but just about everyone else is either a cardboard cutout or a ludicrous stereotype. Even the killer is portrayed as a generic psycho despite the fact that most of the book involves Aex researching his life story. Did the killer have reasons for what he does and why? We never know - he was just a 'bad seed.'The Murder Artist isn't the worst thriller I've read lately, but it's certainly nothing special. For Case fans or magic afficianados only."},{"Title":"Murder Artist, The","review":"Although a departure from \\"his\\" usual bio-tech thrillers, the Murder Artist is one of Case's very best works.The story of a TV journalist whose young sons are abducted, the story provides genuinely creepy twists and turns. In the vein of many great thrillers, it also takes informative side trips into a variety of subcultures, most notably the history of magic. Beyond this, its the best-written book in the Case canon, with nice use of dialogue and first-person narration. All of which makes for an incredibly satisfying page-turner, even if the conclusion is somewhat abrupt and anticlimactic."},{"Title":"Murder Artist, The","review":"Of the three books, I mentioned that I completed during the last two weeks, my favourite is \\"The Murder Artist\\" by John Case, which in fact is a pen-name for the husband-wife duo of Jim and Carolyn Hougan. The title itself suggests that it is a book that must have something to do with murder. It does, but it has more to do with magic than murder. It's a story about a television journalist, Alex Callahan, separated from his wife because he was neglecting his family life for work, who lost his twin kids, Kevin and Sean, in a Renaissance fair in Maryland. After facing the trauma of losing the kids, while they came to him for their holidays, and having to deal with his not-so-supportive wife, he sets off on the quest to find his kids, alive or dead.With a series of perplexing clues, which lead Alex into the enigmatic and intricate world of \\"voodoo\\", he discovered that the kidnapper of his twins was a magician who had earlier shanghaied three sets of twins, two of which were killed as a part of his magic trick. With the help of the third surviving set, which despite being unwilling to put forth the entire story, he established that the kidnapper wanted to perform an ages-old magic trick called \\"The Rope Trick\\", which would definitely involve in the sacrifice of his kids. Scouring the internet for information on the possible locations of the magician, he finally found where the actual magic trick was going to take place, and heroically rescued his kids.This book has all the usual characteristics that can be expected from a story about crime, murder or fantasy. Just like in any other story of the sorts, the police wasn't too co-operative with Alex, which meant he had to do the chunk of the investigative work, although he did find an accomplice in one of the members of the squad, who you guessed right, was transferred before solving the case. It also has a well built up suspense, which ultimately leads to an anti-climatic save of his kids, which can be seen in so many books of the same feature, because of the seemingly hurried rush with which it all ends.Where the book gains the credibility though is the amazing amount of research the writer duo put into it. It's difficult to explain complex theories sometimes, magic being one of them, but in the book, its description is as crisp and clear as possible; the fact that Jim spent some time at a voodoo facility in Haiti as a reporter earlier in his life must have helped though.All in all it's a decent book, which is worth reading once purely for the inclusion of something different, magic here, into a typical murder story, which if you're like me who craves for new knowledge on basically anything, whether of interest or not, should enjoy. I wonder though, if Alex could have used any other search engine apart from Google. I mean, if I were in his place, I'd have tried everything possible. Yet, he seemed to use only Google, maybe Google showered some $$$ upon the authors."},{"Title":"Murder Artist, The","review":"I just was trying a new author and so once I start a book, I finish it.

One of those rare books that's un-put-downable."},{"Title":"Murder Artist, The","review":"Plot/Storyline: 4 StarsThe storyline was unique with not only two children missing at once, but a set of identical twins. The police are at a loss because if ransom was the motive, why take both children with double the trouble? This would also fit for a pedophile.The father, Alex, refuses to give up and quits his job to chase down leads. His leads take him across the country and back again. What made this journey stand out is how much the reader gets to learn about the different aspects of the case as he finds them. I learned about whippets (a breed of dog), origins of magic, a little voodoo, origami, and much more. These details show what a rich and diverse world we live in.There were some superfluous scenes in this novel that could have been cut out while leaving the story completely intact. For example, there is a portion with a \`voodoo witch doctor' that could have been deleted. While I enjoyed learning much of the voodoo history, the scene I refer to was just unnecessary.I felt the ending was a bit rushed. There were some loose ends, unexplained events that were either coincidence or more crimes by the perpetrator, which were not wrapped up. Also, I would have liked to have seen an epilogue.Character Development: 4 1/2 StarsAlex, the father, was fairly well-developed. The reader did get a sense of him and empathize with him at times. However, I did feel at though we should have been given more background on him to really understand him.The reader also doesn't get a good sense of the mother. She is just some weepy (and later, \`witchy') person in the background.Writing Style: 5 StarsThe writing in this novel was excellent. The syntax was perfect for the flow of the story. The author did a terrific job of describing each location with minimal language, while still painting the picture.The dialogue was rich and very realistic.Editing/Formatting: 4 3/4 StarsThe editing was very good with only a couple of errors. The Kindle formatting was okay. The biggest issue was the odd spacing. There were triple and quadruple line spaces between paragraphs. Once or twice, a sentence broke off onto the next line midway.Rating: PG-15 for Adult Situations, Violence"},{"Title":"Murder Artist, The","review":"This is just a FANTASTIC story. Don't be put off by the fact that it's about kids being kidnapped, there's very little of the hand wringing, search the bushes, wait by the phone stuff. This book is about a father searching for his kidnapped sons. One reviewer described it as convoluted, and I disagree. His journey does take him to many places but when you get it figured out, for me, anyway, it's crystal clear what's been going on all along and it's chilling, yet makes a lot of twisted sense. No stretch for motive here! Outstanding story, very well written, I couldn't read it fast enough, I had to take breaks at the few tiny spots of release of tension just to catch my breath! What a story! What a rich history of magic that's revealed here, and what a twisted 'bad guy.'I highly recommend this book to anyone who enjoys an educated person's thriller.

I also teach in a classical Christian school where we use Saxon Math as well. I find that for most students, if they will take the time to read the lesson well, do all of the problems, and then rework any problems they miss then they will achieve a high degree of mastery of the material at hand.Math 87 will prepare the advanced student for Algebra 1, without having to proceed to Algebra . This will only be true if both student and teacher are diligent in doing all of the problems, checking them immediately, and reworking any missed problems.The greatest advantage of Saxon Math is that each lesson provides practice not only for the new problems but also built-in review for every kind of problem the student has previously encountered.

The book follows a portion of Paul's life found in the book of Acts and keeps the reader interested in what is going on. MacArthur's understanding of New Testament history shows forth in the details in his book and make it very informative even to the most educated Bible student.

In this book JM has done a good job in providing insight into the world of leadership from a biblical view. JM sets the record straight by showing you that true leadership... the king that refuses to bend to a shifting, and fickle world comes from a much deeper source.A whole of lot of people do not like JM, but on this topic he hit the mark. Also some say he turns out so many books a year... and is he so knowledgeable on everything. Well, let me say...this book is worth your time and money to read no matter what your likes or dislikes are about MacArthur. This book will truly guide your step in the business world as well.I suggest that everyone read Spiritual Leadership: Principles of Excellence for Every Believer (Commitment to Spiritual Growth) by J.

While these methods may not be right or wrong, these books fail to take an honest look at leadership from the Bible. We are not take the Bible plus the world's leadership values and reinforce them upon the Church but we are to be biblical and that is it (Titus 2:1).That is why I enjoyed Dr. John MacArthur's THE BOOK ON LEADERSHIP. As a teacher of the Word who loves the Word, Dr. MacArthur faithfully seeks to teach what the Scriptures teach about leadership. His concern is not the latest how-to books or the latest Church Growth gimmicks but his heart is to follow the Bible completely in all areas of church leadership.Each chapter covers a portion of what the Bible teaches about leadership. Whether you are a leader in the church or you have biblical questions about leadership, I urge you to turn to this book. While I didn't agree with MacArthur all the time, he does seek to build a biblical case.The only drawback to this book is that it didn't focus on leaders being people of prayer. I agree with MacArthur 100% that we need strong theology, strong preaching and teaching, and Christ-like leaders but one of the traits of being like Jesus is prayer (Luke 11:1; 18:1). We need men of God who's knees are worn out and their eyes are red from the tears they have wept over the condition of the modern Church. We need preachers who will stand in the pulpit and deliver and word from God that they received while on their face in worship before a holy God. We need men of prayer (1 Timothy 2:1-6, 8)."},{"Title":"The Book on Leadership","review":"First, the outside cover of this book is extremely impressive. It LOOKS like leather.

With its leather-looking cover, rough-cut pages, gold lettering and marbled inside pages, it looks like a wonderful, valuable, antique book. Truth be told, I probably would not have purchased it were it not for that cover. I am not so shallow that I would purchase it based soley on the cover, but a great cover and an author I respect are too much for me to pass up.In this book, MacArthur provides his spin on a topic that is gaining prominence in the church. I suspect the books published on the subject of leadership in the church in the past five years would by far outnumber thoese published in the prior 2000 years of Christianity. Leadership has become a buzz-word, and leadership skills are more highly-valued by many than the ability to write good sermons, to relate to people or to express clear doctrine. For many people today a pastor's role should primarily concern leadership with the preaching of the Word taking on a secondary role. In this context I looked forward to gleaning from the wisdom of John MacArthur.This book is based around the apostle Paul (rather than Nehemiah, who seems to be the subject of many leadership manuals), drawing lessons about leadership through two of the situations he faced: his time in prison and his time pastoring the church at Corinth. I was surprised to find that the leadership principles outlined by the author are not expositorily drawn out of the Scripture, for expository teaching is what we have come to expect from MacArthur. Instead, he uses Paul's life to point to principles of leadership. For example, the sixth principle of leadership is that a leader is optimistic and enthusiastic. MacArthur shows this in Paul's life by referencing Acts 27:25 where the apostle tells the men aboard his doomed ship to \\"take heart ... for I have faith in God that it will be exactly as I have been told.\\" There are twenty six of these principles introduced in similar fashion throughout the text.While the book does a respectable job of introducing principles of leadership, I found its primary value in serving as a commentary on portions of the books of Acts and Corinthians. MacArthur is a skilled expositor and does deep research in the Scriptures. Thus he brings to light many situations and tidbits of information that helped me better understand these passages of the Bible and to understand Paul. Reading the book purely as a commentary will be rewarding in itself, with the principles of leadership serving as icing on the cake.I have to admit I found this book a little disappointing, primarily because it was not entirely expository in nature. The twenty six principles of leadership are sound and will no doubt serve to strengthen many future and current leaders. In the final analysis, though, while they are proven from the life of Paul, they were not drawn explicitly from Scripture. Despite that, a man who exhibited those qualities would no doubt be an godly man and one well-suited and eminently qualfied for leadership in the church. I do recommend this book both as a commentary on parts of the life of Paul and as a guide to important qualities necessary for godly leadership."},{"Title":"The Book on Leadership","review":"This book gives you a history lesson on Paul and how he applied leadership in his life. While I enjoyed learning more about Paul and his leadership style, some parts of the book especially near the end became slow to read as if the author just wanted to complete the book."},{"Title":"The Book on Leadership","review":"MacArthur takes the reader through significant events in the life of Paul, beginning in Acts 27 and continuing into II Corinthians, providing insight into Paul's leadership ability and personal character as it is demonstrated in his dealings with pagan sailors, false teachers, and immature Christians.He also takes a short detour towards the beginning of the book to look into the life of Nehemiah in order to glean some wisdom from Nehemiah's effort to rebuild the wall. The end result is an extremely practical, Biblically saturated guide into true leadership. From the life of Paul and Nehemiah, MacArthur derives 26 characteristics of a true leader. Especially helpful is an appendix on page 209 which provides the list of the 26 characteristics in the order in which they appear in the book.Another very helpful portion of this book is where MacArthur elaborates on the principle that a \\"Leader is disciplined\\" (147). On pages 152 through 157, MacArthur gives eight specific, practical ways in which a person can discipline himself or herself: Get organized; use time wisely; findways to be edified rather than merely entertained; pay attention to small things; accept extra resposibility; once you start something, finish it; keep your commitments and tell yourself no from time to time.Overall, the book is exrememly helpful and practical and will be very encouraging for those who desire to be true leaders. I highly recommend it!"},{"Title":"The Book on Leadership","review":"I decided in the last two weeks of 2010 to overindulge on some leadership books. MacArthur is a noted and respected pastor and leader. His book, The Book on Leadership, is based on observations of the Apostle Paul...primarily from the books of First and Second Corinthians.While MacArthur noted a number of characteristics about the Apostle Paul, his work here was more practical than exegetical. Don't get me wrong...He certainly made good observations of leadership characteristics from the texts; however, since the subject is topical in nature...his dependence on practical leadership wisdom was obvious.MacArthur notes 26 characteristics of a leader. These characteristics are illustrated in the life of the Apostle Paul.My biggest takeaway from this book is simple and profound: \\"Leadership is Stewardship.\\" Every leader derives his authority to lead from somewhere. It is given to Him (in the case of a pastor) by the Lord of the church so that the pastor can serve as the Overseer/Shepherd/ Elder of the church. If you believe Jesus...then you have to believe that God placed the pastor into leadership so that the pastor would manage/steward the responsibility of leadership effectively. (This is no different from any other spiritual gift entrusted to a believer).I found the book to be a good read. It boasted of some good takeaways and points of encouragement, as well as served to be deeply challenging.I would certainly recommend the book to anyone who sought to better understand the calling of leadership and to become more effective stewards of that calling."},{"Title":"The Book on Leadership","review":"John McArthur writes another good book, but this one moved a little slow and seemed to take too many pages to develop.

While learning about how to be a leader I also learned a lot about the Apostle Paul.What was so useful about this book is that it taught that each of us are leaders: husbands, fathers, supervisors, teachers, role models, etc. We all need to develop these characteristics in our life. Someone is always looking up or at us for inspiration. We want people to be strengthened in our presence, bolder in the face of opposition, and refocused on the hope we have.

I read that book when I was back in college, but this book is better. It's definitely more personal - in a way it reads like a memoir.You feel like you are going through all the trials and tribulations with her. There's a lot of exciting stuff here - she battles the MPAA over Boys Don't Cry -- the bond company takes control of Far From Heaven-- she has interactions with big stars like Jude Law and Julia Roberts.I have never been to Sundance, but Vachon's Sundance diary takes you through that festival with her.All this makes for a book that's immensely readable; I couldn't put it down. I really liked the spotlights from other industry figures, agents, studio heads and directors like John Cameron Mitchell (who did my favorite film, HEDWIG AND THE ANGRY INCH!) If you are in the industry, want to learn about the industry or are just plain curious about how movies get made, go out and get this book now!"},{"Title":"A Killer Life: How an Independent Film Producer Survives Deals and Disasters in Hollywood and Beyond","review":"This book is riveting reading for the fan or the filmmaker. Vachon has a talent for balancing intensive amounts of details with storytelling skills. You really will want to know how a distribution is made before the first frame is filmed. Her personality -- tough, passionate, centered -- also makes the book a compelling read. Even when her foes are completes a-hats, Vachon does not descend into bitterness, but rather, makes another compelling lesson."},{"Title":"A Killer Life: How an Independent Film Producer Survives Deals and Disasters in Hollywood and Beyond","review":"...which kind of gets me wondering--why the heck don't *even more* aspiring producers and D-boy and D-girl wannabes get their hands on this amazing compendium of production experiences, take them to heart, and learn themselves a whole lot about the global film game in the process. If you've got the answer to that question, let me know. I'm still scratching my noodle.Okay, so you're going to totally dig this book. Christine Vachon and her Killer Films outfit in N-Y-C, using that well-known convention of theirs--break the bounds of traditional (read: boring) publishing with a rather unconventional approach to bookwriting. Prepare for a wild wooly ride of a read...Christine's deft collaborators (egs. directors, financiers, and studio consigliatores) have chimed in here in various sections, offering up sage advice on the pit- and prat-falls of the indie and studio sides of the filmmaking biz, and what it's generally like working with Christine and her able band of brothers and sisters. That, for this here reviewer, was a right privilege...live recordings of Christine's conversations with her colleagues wouldn't have been richer. And like I tell you in my title...you couldn't pay Vachon enough to give this course. For a couple of Lincolns, this was a gold mine.By the way, I think I've tattooed my entire Netflix wish list with every single Killer title known to Movieland. As luck would have it, ONE HOUR PHOTO was one of the better films of 2002, and little did I know that Christine was even responsible for getting this one made. Small world, baby.It's an unsung job, the producing game can sometimes be, but mark it--without Christine's valuable input at various stages of the process, many of these so-called little pictures mightn't have been made, languishing in that purgatory of \\"development hell\\" (or turnaround) like 98% of the projects out there are in (according to every single statistic known to the filmmaking poobahs). One of the most inspiring statements from the entire book which I triple underlined, dogeared, and highlighted in tri-colour was her frank admission that producers must maintain \\"eternal optimism.\\" They are the ones who are enthusiastic at all times, oftentimes when there's no reason to be, and oftentimes when there's no production necessarily to speak of. The equivalent to selling short on the stock market. If your sources' predictions are bang on, chances are you're going to make a \\"buchta\\" of cash.Such boundless enthusiasm the mark of a truly gifted deal-maker, and in the trenches which is the modern-day studio system (read: the business of making movies), and the relatively recent advent of the \\"mini-majors\\" (or classics divisions of the major Hollywood studios), this brand of relentlessness has become all the more critical. Remove one element from the positivity puzzle, strip away a single grain of that much-needed goodness which is a key ingredient of the all-encompassing feelgood--by definition, a must towards smooth functioning on the film set--and off your high film concept goes into the grey ether.Just for the rekkid, listening to podcasts helps, kids! I'd heard about this title after listening to Claude Brodesser Ackner's THE BUSINESS on NPR (goo-search it). I was so intrigued by Christine's outspokenness, that I simply couldn't curb my enthusiasm to hop on over to my favourite online book purveyor and pick up the nearest copy of her A KILLER LIFE.Where is that extra star when I need it?

Carney-Nunes has written a beautiful book of poems that celebrates motherhood from the African-American woman's perspective. Inspired by the author's very own trials and tribulations as a mother, SONGS OF A SISTERMOM: MOTHERHOOD POEMS is presented in four sections. The first section, Prelude to the Dance, expresses the love that a man and woman experience from courtship to marriage. The beautifully written \\"Eternal Love Song\\" and \\"A Mother's Love Letter\\" are the highlights of the section. Hymns of Preparation, the second section, is an ode to the blessing of being with child. \\"The Child You'll Be\\", a mother speaking lovingly to her unborn child, and \\"Don't Question a Blessing\\", are heartfelt and endearing. Section three, From B Flat to F Sharp, are poems discussing the joys and challenges of raising an African-American child. I was especially touched by \\"Nappy\\" a mother relating to her daughter regarding the pain and beauty of having nappy hair. The poem \\"Leroy's Song\\" is a lyrical plea to mothers to stand by and stand up for their sons. The Ninth Symphony, the fourth and final section, culminates the wisdom of life's lessons. Pieces entitled \\"Asante\\" and \\"Motherhood Movement\\" revealed the hope that all mothers have for their children and the world in which they must raise them in.SONGS OF A SISTERMOM: MOTHERHOOD POEMS is a celebration of motherhood from the perspective of an African-American woman, one that is rarely displayed in prose. The poems were well written and presented; they ranged from joyful to heartbreaking but at all times remained hopeful. Many of the pieces were so lyrically written that I heard them as lullabies being whispered into a child's ear. Charisse A.

It was a happy choice of present from friends of mine who are not historians and just happened to find themselves inspired one day by a streak of beginners' luck. Glossy, superbly presented from front cover to back, lavishly illustrated throughout from original sources, empathetically written - I have read no better book in recent years, and certainly no historical biography quite like it since A J P Taylor laid down his pen. It is a literary treasure second to none.Henrietta Maria (to allude to a curse, reputedly Oriental in provenance) lived in interesting times. She was the daughter of a king (Henri Quatre, the Huguenot who thought Paris was \\"worth a Mass\\", and ended up paying for it with his life at the hands of an assassin); she was the wife of a king (Charles I of England, who utterly lost his chivalric heart to her and his head to Parliamentarians); and she was the mother of kings (Charles II, who reigned for 25 post-Restoration years, and James II, who learned no lessons from his father's decapitation and so lost the monarchy for the House of Stuart).This peerless volume tells how she coped with her tribulations from first to last.Even so, what must be recognised from the start is that it is quite beyond the remit of Dr Marshall's masterpiece to supply facts and figures sufficient to gain the reader a First in seventeenth century Stuart studies - or even an A-Level Pass. But what this book will do, and most effectively at that, is supply a sumptuously panoramic background to more formal studies of the period, and in a manner that renders them all the more readily comprehensible. Because, for Henrietta Maria (daughter, wife, mother of kings, Royalist fund raiser of armies and monies - in addition to being, in her marital role, quite frequently enceinte) all alarums tend to be \\"off-\\", rather than \\"on-stage\\". And it is this unusual state of affairs which, in my estimation, lends the narrative such a refreshingly distinctive quasi-objective quality wherein the main protagonist in the story may well be far removed from the main action in any bodily sense, yet invariably closely caught up in it too, being so keenly affected by it on a more personal, emotional, feminine, and motherly level."},{"Title":"Henrietta Maria: The Intrepid Queen (Great Periods of the British Monarchy)","review":"Enjoyable, though not very in-depth.

The book has a solid introductory section where the authors share with us real tips on techniques, equipment and quality control, all of it deadly practical. Every aspect of charcoal grilling is discussed, from placing the briquettes and seasoning to checking doneness. All the recipes I tested are precise, easy to follow and leave little room for mistakes. Most of all, they produce excellent dishes. Not too many glossy pictures, which is fine with me. This is certainly THE grilling book."},{"Title":"Let the Flames Begin: Tips, Techniques, and Recipes for Real Live Fire Cooking","review":"There are so many great things about this book that I don't know where to start. I love the introductions from both authors. They made me realize that fire (real fire, not the watery stuff that I get from my gas grill) is the way to cook food. My weber now has a permanent place in front of my garage. My gas weber now festers in the back yard underneath it's rain coat.These guys really pulled it off. I probably own almost a dozen cookbooks about BBQ (a very generic term until you talk to someone from Texas, North Carolina or Missouri), but what you get here is a great book about methods using LIVE fire. I especially like the chapters on salads. Everybody can talk about rubs and spices, but it takes someone special to teach you how to grill sweet corn and turn it into a beautiful salad."},{"Title":"Let the Flames Begin: Tips, Techniques, and Recipes for Real Live Fire Cooking","review":"Every cookbook collection needs a good and comprehensive grilling oriented cookbook.

This collaborative project by Chris Schlesinger and John Willoughy is enhanced with color photography by William Meppem and line illustrations by John Burgoyne, as well as a sections on &quot;Summer Splurges&quot; and &quot;Party Planner&quot;.

I am an accomplished cook and a lifelong fire grilling aficionado and THIS, my friends, is the best book on live fire cookery I've found. There is enough information to get someone who's never harnessed the pleasure of cooking with fire to make something absolutely delicious from the get go. For those of us who are familiar with said pleasure, these recipes are outstanding. I couldn't possibly pick my favorite, so I'll just go with the last thing I made: slow grilled mustard-crusted butterflied game hens with smoky, lemony red onions. After the hundreds of chicken dishes I've grilled this one had to be the best. My only deviation was that I brined the hens with garlic, bay and lemon - but that's only personal preference. Brining is the only variation I've found the need to pursue in any of these recipes.This book can take your grilling to the next level if you let it. The information contained within is well organized, memorable, never boring and always helpful. The recipes are unbelievably good. You will learn - and enjoy it."},{"Title":"Mentoring Children and Adolescents: A Guide to the Issues (Contemporary Youth Issues)","review":"Being involved in youth mentoring programs for the past 15 years, I have developed a large, personal library of mentoring resources. This new work may cause me to downsize my library, as it really \\"has it all\\" in a concise, interesting package. In addition to covering the basic framework of mentoring, Buckley and Zimmerman also present a plethora of resources for programs of all sizes and affiliations. I plan to use the book as both an orientation tool for new adult mentors as well as part of a pre-mentoring training for new mentees. It could also serve as a recruitment tool, as the information illuminates the world of mentoring to individuals who, perhaps, know little about the concept. I recommend that if you can only afford one book on the subject of youth mentoring, this would be the one."},{"Title":"Mentoring Children and Adolescents: A Guide to the Issues (Contemporary Youth Issues)","review":"A great resource to be sure, but a little slim I thought on more in-depth aspects of what makes a good mentor.

It surprised me. The essays were often on topics which I thought I had no interest-trout- but Quammen gives the subject an interesting philosphical slant.I read alot of natural history books and these essays were not the usual style of writing that I have come to expect. Quammen incorporates science, history, and philosophy into his writing. I liked some of the essays so much I wished that he had gone into greater detail!

By the end of 'Natural Acts' you'll be happily convinced that this world is as mystical and comical as you thought it was.Some of my favorite topics in the book include (in my own words): The (exaggerated)Size of Anacondas, The Intelligent Crow, Why Are There So Many Damned Beetles?, and that whole 'Why Would Someone Drink Their Own Urine?' thing.'Natural Acts' is a very intelligent and hilarious look at nature.

I could not find any information in the various submarine books that have been written, until I discovered Admiral Davenport's book in my local library. Aside from the book being extremely boring, I found it interesting that the Admiral disliked Clay Blair's description of him in his book 'Silent Victory'. I got the impression that the only reason Davenport wrote his book was to defend himself over Blair's portrayal. What do you expect from a former Journalist? The book for the most part reads like a series of patrol reports, nothing original. The O'Kane or Fluckey books are a much better read. Fortunately, the book is available in most libraries.

So if your child wants to learn how to draw a viking, (s)he will only see one perspective and nothing more. No technique on how to draw the helmet, the garb etc.. Second, the book doesn't follow basic techniques to learn how to draw. In my opinion this book should be for 5 year olds in the house that are tired of coloring books.

The authors used empirical findings from Hewitt Associates' Best Employers studies to support their arguments. The book is basically divided into three main sections; Leadership and Talent, Engagement and Execution and A Framework for Sustainability. The first section dealt mainly with the importance of leadership in an organization, how it is crucial to have a clarity of purpose for their employees and the importance of getting the right talent and making sure the talent stays with the organization. The second section dealt mostly with having the right culture and engaged employees will create great business results. In the last section, the authors provided some trends that they foresee (such as diversity in the workforce, blurring of work and personal life, etc) and some implications for the organization and HR. Basically, they concluded that being a Best Employer is not an easy or an overnight thing. Leaders need to align business strategies with people strategies and also to make sure employees' needs are taken care of. It also takes a lot of commitment from leaders to ensure employees are engaged with the organization.This is an easy to read book as the writing is very conversational. There are some HR jargons but I think the authors did a great job explaining them. The content itself is not earth-shaking because what they talked about is nothing new in this field but it is still nevertheless a useful book to have as they are able to support their arguments with Best Employer Studies' results and finding. In addition, I like the fact that the authors were able to illustrate their points with case studies of the Best Employers in Asia."},{"Title":"The Homo Handbook: Getting in Touch with Your Inner Homo: A Survival Guide for Lesbians and Gay Men (1996 Lambda Literary Award Best Humor Book)","review":"So, you're gay, think you're gay, or one of those &quot;I'm just curious&quot; types?

Using generous amounts of her gay stand-up humor, Carter makes her book entertaining as well as informing, allowing gays to laugh at themselves as well as the narrow-minded bigots who bash them.

She is proudly lesbian, but writes in a manner which is also very gay male relevant, and that's because she did extensive online research in gay men's chatrooms, especially for this publication.You'll find plenty of sound advice - including encouragement to keep a journal of your progression toward self-acceptance and public disclosure as well as getting some real-life honest-to-god romantic action happening in your life.The many Gerard Donelan cartoons are a wonderful added bonus and are the reason I often pick the book up and flick through it.The best book, by far, for a young queer person to own and read would be \\"The Survival Guide\\" by XY Magazine, but for more mature readers \\"The Homo Handbook\\" is likely to be a very positive and useful resource."},{"Title":"The Homo Handbook: Getting in Touch with Your Inner Homo: A Survival Guide for Lesbians and Gay Men (1996 Lambda Literary Award Best Humor Book)","review":"As a gay man living in Canada in 2012, The Homo Handbook: Getting in Touch with Your Inner Homo by Judy Carter from 1996 seems sorely dated. Human rights and social legislation for gays and lesbians have advanced at meteor speed in Canada since 1996, while Americans unbelievably have had to deal with homophobic propositions and referenda at election time. I received The Homo Handbook as a Christmas gift from a colleague at work sixteen years ago. While I flipped through it and enjoyed its plentiful cartoons, I did not read it cover to cover until now.Carter is a lesbian comedian and at times her handbook is a riot to read. Most often the humour comes from playing with gay and lesbian stereotypes. I can laugh at myself even if I am not a flannel-wearing lesbian. Carter writes chapters on coming out to oneself, one's friends, one's parents, at work, and even chapters on how to get laid and how to become a gay activist. If I was at a point in my life where I was closeted and not even out to myself, I might have found this book valuable. However its structure seems far too new-age for my liking. The reader is often instructed to remember events from one's past, to meditate and breathe deeply in order to regress, and to write down spontaneously one's feelings in a coming-out diary. One is instructed to do a lot of note-taking while reading this book. I get the feeling that if one were to engage in every writing exercise during the process of reading this book, it would take a good two weeks--seriously--to accomplish all that Carter wants you to do:\\"Imagine that you're getting married. Go into detail--the outfit, the music, the strippers. Write for five minutes. How does that make you feel? Does it scare you? If so, why?\\"and\\"Make a list in your coming-out journal of what you are letting go of by coming out. Now write down the ways your parents made (make) you 'wrong.'\\"Carter believes in making lemonade out of lemons and finds internal strength even when dealing with homophobia or \\"toxic\\" friends. I didn't find some of her advice on what to do if you come out at work and get fired very helpful:\\"If you are fired for being gay, your coming out can wake up the world if you file a sexual-orientation-discrimination lawsuit.\\"This is fine if you have the time, money and strength to file and go through with legal action. If you're living paycheque-to-paycheque, Carter's remark that if you've lost your job, would you really want to be working for bigots anyway, seems little consolation. I am indeed fortunate to work where I do in a gay-positive place, and in Canada at that, where losing one's job because of one's sexual orientation is not a worry.Perhaps groundbreaking--and relevant--when it was written in 1996, The Homo Handbook is now a nostalgia piece that belongs in the lesbian and gay archives."},{"Title":"Isidore: A Novel About the Comte de Lautreamont","review":"I hunted this book down through what seemed virtually every bookstore in Manhattan until I finally found it used at the Strand. Having read Reed's amazing erotic classic, The Pleasure Chateau, &amp; seeing how much Lautremont had influenced his style in that book, I was certain that a book by Reed dealing directly with Lautremont himself would be something extraordinary. I was extremely disappointed to read this dull, minutely over-analyzed fictionalized *report* on Lautremont's not-all-that-interesting comings &amp; goings, relationship with his father, etc. Perhaps if I hadnt had such high expectations for the book I would have liked it better, but somehow I doubt that, for I wasnt even compelled to finish it. For that reason alone, I give it two stars, figuring it would be unfair under the circumstances to give it any less...and on the chance that Reed, who I still admire greatly for The Pleasure Chateau, might have done *something* of interest, eventually, with this book."},{"Title":"Isidore: A Novel About the Comte de Lautreamont","review":"The implication here is that in this book--told from the point of view of the brilliant Isidore Ducasse, the future writer of Maldoror--Jeremy Reed will show the reader that he is quite up to the task of reproducing the mad, visionary, surreal style of the original. He isn't. What he does deliver is 144 pages of clotted prose seasoned with hints, guesses, a few facts, a few interesting tropes. Skip this book and go directly to the original, or, if you can't read French, purchase the Complete Works in the Lykiyard translation from Exact Change Publishers.

Hiswriting is so compelling, and the voice of Ducasse, alsoknown as le Comte de Lautreamont, so strong, that at timesyou'll find yourself thinking, This is the way it must havehappened."},{"Title":"Isidore: A Novel About the Comte de Lautreamont","review":"this fictitious yet engrossing and beautifully written biography of young isidore ducasse, the comte de lautreamont, author of the bizarre and slightly twisted &quot;maldoror&quot; and surrealist precursor par excellance (perhaps even surpassing rimbaud?), will keep the imaginative reader riveted and glued to it from start to finish. reed has an uncanny ability to 'hit the nail on the head', and we (or at least I) always get the sense that his portrayals of his poetic idols and heroes are not that far off the mark, although there is no way to know this to a certainty. we do know that lautreamont was a withdrawn, odd youth who frightened his classmates, very rarely spoke, and had virtually no companions either at the lycee or in paris, where he was to die at age 24. reed's ducasse is a rebellious, brilliant, and poetic genius with lofty feelings of contempt for humanity and a love for the creative imagination, which allows man to transform the banality and monotony of dull everyday reality into something more beautiful and aesthetic. and all of it comes off smoothly, never becoming pretentious or too fanciful. the only weakness lies in reed's botched attempts to explore 'the duality of identity', and explore lautreamont's supposedly schizophrenic nature. to my mind this assists in perpetuating false myths about the author which cannot be verified in any way whatever. from ducasse's letters to his father, his banker, etc, we see not the dionysian monster maldoror but a young man quite capable of being cool, rational, socially interactive and charming. not one word betrays even a touch of mental disturbance or inadaptability. it occasionally seems like reed is trying to imply that because he used a pseudonym to write maldoror, he was almost certainly a nutjob with two personalities tearing one another part. of course, this is entirely possible, but from the &quot;poesies&quot; and the aforementioned letters, it seems more likely than not that ducasse was provoking the writer by writing two such opposed and outrageously contradictory works, and it is quite an assumption indeed to read a great deal of neurosis or impending insanity into it. but other than that, this book is, as it says on the back cover, &quot;an electric testament to the imagination&quot;, and anyone even mildly interested in surrealist literature should grab it immediately. another victory for reed."},{"Title":"Preparing for Tantra: The Mountain of Blessings (Classics of Middle Asia)","review":"I love this version of Je Tsongkapa's explanation of \\"The Source of All My Good.\\" I find the writing to be very easily readable and not burdensome, which some Tibetan Buddhist commentaries can be.

Instead, I would say this book is really about the character of the soul (this would have been a better title).Here's the quick skinny: 3 Major sections: I - LASTING, II - LEAVING and III - LEFT. 3 prefaces, 25 chapters plus a bonus chapter (The Force of the Face), notes, and bibliography. 202 readable pages -- tricky read at times, but also engrossing. I find these sections cleverly titled as they reveal Hillman's approach to \\"character\\" as a sort of core essence which is basically stripped of its outer shell over time especially during the latter stages of aging. This is an interesting concept which deserves further exploration.Whenever the book is intriguing (as I said, it oscillates) I find the concepts presented fascinating. For example the idea of \\"extending\\" longevity to broaden ones scope of life beyond actual years into an osmosis of a kind of universal vision of all life and all history. This way of thinking borders on an attempt at extending into eternity. It's an engaging exercise! The idea of creating a clear distinction between \\"old\\" and \\"aging\\" is also compelling. Here old is more tied to the ancient definition of \\"days of old\\" which can be viewed as a place which connects us all if we are able to tap into this core. Also compelling is the notion of the process of letting go as we are \\"leaving\\" our youth being a powerful conduit into discovering the character of the soul -- this is good stuff. I was especially struck by Hillman's comments regarding the tendency of the brain to lose the ability to recall from short-term memory while becoming acutely capable of pulling in almost forgotten fragments from long term memory (e.g. \\"the dresses of your girlhood friends of seventy years ago\\"). Could it be that the aging process matures the soul and prepares a person for entry into an eternal existence . . . Where facts and figures don't matter as much as intuition and emotional attachment? I wanted to explore this more, but alas the book departs on to fluff and fuzziness. Sigh!Whenever the book is boring it is exceedingly so. Hillman introduces many very interesting notions, yet often fails to make a hard point and fades away into flowery descriptions of vague concepts with seemingly little purpose other than to dabble into artistic expression. Poetry saturated into prose is not exactly my cup of tea! Don't get me wrong, I love the intellectual tenor of Hillman's style. I just want to get somewhere after 200 plus pages. I find after a myriad of quotes from ancient and past philosophers, ancient text, Jungian theory and existential extrapolations I forget what drove me down the many paths of thought I had and even going backward through the pages I don't see what Hillman really wanted to say. At best, I'm left with a lot of really good ideas, questions, and fodder for something else (not quite sure what).It's best to approach the book as an essay on the character of the soul. This is where its true value lies. The most powerful question raised is . . . what is the essence of that thing that is really you under all the flesh and psyche? Even the bonus chapter (Interlude: The Power of the Face) raises a similar question as Hillman suggests that the aging face reveals more about the core person over time. He didn't exactly say it, but I took from this the idea that the young face cannot adequately reveal a good image of the soul as it is somewhat of a blank canvass. What an intriguing thought! Why not expound on this Mr. Hillman?Still, this is a good read with many redeeming qualities. I wish I could give it 3 stars. This would be a better rating I think. A 4-star rating is not exactly right so I opted for 3. I look forward to reading Hillman's better known book, The Soul's Code at some point."},{"Title":"The Force of Character: And the Lasting Life","review":"I studied the early writings of Mr. Hillman, as a student in Vermont. He was once a real genius, original and gutsy if more incomprehensible. Then, some editor got him to &quot;make sense&quot; And in the Soul's Code, I suppose he did, in a pablum-ish way. But this book? I couldn't make nor head nor tails of its structure or meaning. Where o where did the gods put this man's genius? Or rather, what price was he willing to take to his great writing to render this mess? Well, because he is a great author in the past, i cannot give him one star. But for anyone else, i'd give this none."},{"Title":"The Force of Character: And the Lasting Life","review":"Instead of buying this book all you have to do is read the summary and you'll have the whole idea. He uses about 1000 words for every one that he needs, just to state the obvious, over and over."},{"Title":"The Force of Character: And the Lasting Life","review":"Hillman once again underachieves with this one. He wrote some brilliant stuff in the 1970s -- but I guess that was when he was 30 years younger. His writing has deteriorated over the years, and his creativity seems to have gone limp. You have to wonder why the man -- who is, or was, brilliant -- continues to embarrass himself with the string of bland books he has turned out in recent years. An appearance on Oprah Winfrey helped put his previous book on the bestseller list, although the returns of his book to his publisher were allegedly very high and the &quot;bestseller&quot; status was a fluke created by orders from bookstores (like the one I manage). One of the other reviewers said &quot;ho-hum&quot; or something like that, and once again it is true. Maybe his next book should be channelled messages from Carl Jung or seomthing -- at least that would be more fun to read than this book. And maybe more inspiration, too, for members of my advanced age group."},{"Title":"The Force of Character: And the Lasting Life","review":"Glad I got this book for free. I would have cursed myself for spending money on it. Haven't we heard all this someplace else before? There are far better books on the experience of aging. Not recommended."},{"Title":"The Force of Character: And the Lasting Life","review":"After trying to read it for so long I felt that this was a book I wanted in my library. Not as nice as hard cover but the content in this book is excellent.I have assimulated his philosophy into my own. It makes perfect sense, since I have always asked.. \\"Why would God have so many people suffer with old age?\\" This book talks about us as if \\"we\\" are the purpose of life: to develop, understand and grow a soul. The reflective tendencies of old age help us gain perspective and make us ready to decide what was good and bad...sorta making us a more worthwhile conversationalist for God on the other side. Our body weaknessess help in various ways and he elaborates.Excellent book to give you vision and understanding. I highly reccommend it."},{"Title":"The Force of Character: And the Lasting Life","review":"At last! I don't have to fear old age anymore! Seriously, this book will help anyone come to terms with aging, and help all to understand the beauty, dignity, and honor of the elderly. Hillman's style is invigorating."},{"Title":"The Force of Character: And the Lasting Life","review":"I read the other 23 reviews on this title written at the time I sat down to write this review. I will try to be brief because others have talked about how the book shifts the perspective on aging, and that, I think, is it's real revolutionary nature. It is one thing to say \\"old age is actually pretty good,\\" but it is another thing to actually make it SEEM good, which is what this book does. Most of us approaching old age are rather skeptical that it has qualities better than youth, we are trying to forestall the inevitable. Hillman doesn't come right out and say it, but I think the message is there none the less, \\"why forestall the inevitable, why not embrace it?\\"Hillman gives lots of little examples of what older people do (telling the same old stories, getting muddled, forgetting names and details) and then talks about how these behaviors are part of the development of the soul, about the shift in the brain from personal details, to less personal patterns and meanings; about a stage of development that turns to reflection and repetition as a sort of distillation process. He talks about how we like old objects that have character and the older we get the more we like the unique, the odd, the unusual. There are lots of lovely phrases and turns of phrase as he goes along that really show the poetic heart of the author.He muses about the words age, old, eld, and how culture has shifted it's view on this state of being and how it's vocabulary has shifted (Shakespeare gets a slap on the hands).He makes an interesting distinction between the attitudes of \\"lasting,\\" and \\"leaving,\\" and also paints a picture of the dryness of old age as more akin to fire than dust. I really liked this section of the book, making a nice mythic distinction between the wet, damp, moist world of youth that can \\"bog\\" a person down, and the dry, clear, refinement of old age that allows the person to rise above the cloying confines of the swamp.I think the book requires an affinity for this higher dryer realm of the soul and I suspect readers who are still focused on the mucousy slipperiness of youth will find it almost nonsensical. Some of us have been old for a long time, I think, waiting for our body to catch up to our soul, and waiting for a book like this to make some sense of it for us.I'm not sure I buy the \\"biology reflects psychology\\" argument he makes, essentially saying that our mind/body is one package and events in the body should be interpreted as messages or symbols of what is going on in the mind(I'm paraphrasing badly, I know). The whole \\"our bladders get us up at night to face the dark side,\\" seems a bit of a stretch, but again, it is a poetic view of the world, and one that I have thought about on and off myself for years.This is a book to read and think about and then read again. Those who say you can read the summary on the fly leaf and have the whole message of the book, are, I humbly suggest, turning away too quickly, not really entering into the full realization of the central message -- that we will end up a \\"character\\" when we are old, but what kind of character may depend on our awareness of the process now."},{"Title":"The Force of Character: And the Lasting Life","review":"I read this book with mixed feelings at first. It was hard for me to really stay with it but as I progressed along, I began to get it. Then, there were parts that were like WOW really good and that I could personally identify with. There was a part on pages 122-124 that especially was of interest. He told of a woman in an asylum who said she was not alive and the psychiatrist told her to feel her heart beating and she replied that was not her real heart. This was profound because she made the statement that we can be alive but not living at all. Also it has been a year since I lost my father who I loved dearly but did not treat well the last year of his life and I have been crippled by guilt and remorse. He identified these deep feelings I am having and made me realize that somehow, some way, I must get through this and live.This is not a book for the young but baby boomers like myself who have parents and children and are caught in the middle will appreciate what he has to say."},{"Title":"The Force of Character: And the Lasting Life","review":"\\"Character forces me to encounter each event in my peculiar style. It forces me to differ. I walk through life oddly. No one else walks as I do, and this is my courage, my dignity, my integrity, my morality, my ruin.\\"With these words on page 181, James Hillman distills the gist of this fine book on the development of one's character, as opposed to the notions of personality or even ego. For Hillman, aging is the physical counterpart to the process of forging one's character in the mature years of one's life. He offers up to us a new frame in which to view the winding down process; character becomes the distillation of the various quirks and manifestations of an individual's traversal through this life.In prose that is mostly lyrical, although sometimes vague and abtruse, Hillman's interpretations reveal much about the difficulties and shortcomings of the aging process. The fundamental message seems to be: Old people are a helluva lot more than just packages of irritable protoplasm going decrepit!What James Hillman is primarily suggesting is that the refinement and revealing of character is our core purpose in these later years. Character is the force that shapes our ends, just as the ancient Greeks had it (Heraclitus, Plato, Aristotle). THE FORCE OF CHARACTER is a compelling attempt to return to this traditional notion. For us \\"boomers\\" in this confused era of ours, this book is reminder that our character is our fate.ParataxisThe Cloud ReckonerExtracts: A Field Guide for Iconoclasts"},{"Title":"The Force of Character: And the Lasting Life","review":"This was recommended to me by a friend and it is one of the best books I've read recently. In a time when my 30-something friends are fretting over whether or not to get plastic surgery, it is reassuring to hear from someone who finds great value in the last part of life. A must read for anyone who has an elderly person in their life or who plans to be one someday!"},{"Title":"The Force of Character: And the Lasting Life","review":"Reading Hillman always tickles my brain and this read is no exception. He puts names and values on the possible journey into age, rather than allowing our youth valuing culture to shovel our aging population into obscurity. I find his discussion of character development thought provoking indeed, but truly enjoyed, was amused by, and was mentally stimulated by the way he takes the symptoms of aging and turns them into a soulful function. If you work with aging folks or if you plan to become one yourself, you will get some excellent food for thought from Hillman's brain...as always."},{"Title":"The Force of Character: And the Lasting Life","review":"Wow!!! That about sums it up but I will try to elaborate. This is one of the best books I have read in years. This is a book for some one who has matured a bit. At 51 I thought this book came into my life at almost the perfect time. I would not recommend it for my 30 year old son as I think you have to savor this book after you have savored life a bit. I also think this is more a mans book than a woman's book. My wife didn't like it all; there was no murder nor mystery:>) Hey, if your a guy around 50 or older you just have to give this book a read. I can also imagine that if someone reads this in their 30's or is female,the review may not be on track with the true value of this book to an aged man."},{"Title":"The Force of Character: And the Lasting Life","review":"Hillman, like Karl Jung before him, takes a fearless journey into his own psyche exploring the personal, psychological and social implications of old age and impending death. An important work for people of all ages."},{"Title":"The Force of Character: And the Lasting Life","review":"This is a knock-out book for women, and particularly aging women. It is affirming, challenging and encouraging. Two or three of us are reading it and discussing it together."},{"Title":"The Force of Character: And the Lasting Life","review":"As several of the reveiwers have noted, this book is very pleasant; it doesn't dwell upon death and suffering. That is why I believe that it will mean the most for those who are not really, really old. This book is intended for those of us who are facing old age in the future. It gives alternatives to the stereotypyed images of what we should expect. It gives reasons for what is going on. If these new images are already there in our vision,(thanks to Mr. Hillman) then what we experience &quot;down the line&quot; might be viewed by us later on in a different light. We just might be able to age more gracefully, or perhaps more happily."},{"Title":"The Force of Character: And the Lasting Life","review":"I found the Hillman book to be both provocative and deeply optimistic. Here are ways to view the aging process as something other than a final step toward the grave. Here are wonderful paradigm shifts that nudge the reader to see eternity right here, on this side of the grave. Each chapter shows that all one has to do is open one's eyes to the potential of all the stages of life and keep an eye open to see what each has to offer. This is made most evident in the later and last stages of life. Hillman urges one to see heaven seeping in to life as we age and each chapter gently encouraged to enjoy those gifts now and not set it to something that will materialize only after death. Hillman's style of writing is close tho that of Joseph Campbell in its breath of imagination and arch of line. There are parts that can only be described as poetry in prose. I have recommended this book to many of my friends who are, as I, situated between aging parents and raising children here at home."},{"Title":"The Force of Character: And the Lasting Life","review":"Those who would label this just another book on aging would likely label the Iliad just another book about some guy lost at sea. &quot;The Force Of Character&quot; is the continuation of literary journey that germinated in &quot;We've Had A Hundred Years Of Pyschotherapy and the World's Getting Worse&quot; and continued to ripen in &quot;The Soul's Code.&quot; Hillman in not casual reading, nor is his work inpenetrable. This book waxes nearly poetic at times, something quite unexpected from the bard who oft times mercilessly broadsides our culture's staid notions about salvation through psychoptherapy. While Hillman most always cajoles the soul of the reader to open and partake of his wisdom, this book takes on a quality of reminiscence, of the author and the man - and the character of the man - coming to terms with his own advancing years. Those who seek a book on how to age successfully by accumulation of superficial necessity would do well to read Depak Chopra or another popular icon of spiritual ascent. Hillman will not take us gently into that good night."},{"Title":"The Force of Character: And the Lasting Life","review":"I've enjoyed James Hillman in the past and when I ran across this book in our library I read it. The subject of character is such a - a - uh - hum - hard to say and Hillman does it! I didn't give it 5 stars only because I would get lost sometimes and trusted that he would bring it all together - which he did, mostly.I got alot out of what he said - but not all. He's a philosopher for sure. But there were some real gems... such as his take on grandparents, cosmetic surgery, and of course what character is in a round about way - the essense of us. What we are - what becomes magnified as we age and what we leave behind. I am really glad that I stuck with it - I got alot out of it =&gt;"},{"Title":"The Force of Character: And the Lasting Life","review":"James Hillman writes with consummate skill and keen intellect. His subject is a moving target, not easily focused, but he proceeds undaunted. He has the couarge to look beyond the obvious and go where others fear to go. If he is hard for some to accept the reason may be found on p.136- &quot;To see character we must look for it with an idea of character&quot;. Some may just simply have a paucity of ideas.The marvelous &quot;High School&quot; chapter reminded me of my six years of Jr/Sr high school. Daily I entered the school building through a door over which was etched in stone &quot;Knowledge is Power&quot;. Yes, good advice for young students.

I heard two radio interviews with Hillman within a short time and found his ideas resonated and were presented very accessibly; and my mother in law, who is having a lot of trouble adjusting to many aspects of aging, was visiting. Great, I thought. This is stuff I need to explore.Having read the book, I still find the ideas compelling and important, but my hopes of being able to give it to my mother in law to gently urge her to appreciate where she is were dashed by the self indulgence and turbidity of the writing. I'm glad I read the book, I appreciate the new outlook on aging it's helped me move toward, I'm sure it will figure in many conversations with friends. But I wish it had been written with more grace."},{"Title":"The Force of Character: And the Lasting Life","review":"True to form, James Hillman once again calls for an artful reconceptualization of the mundane in his most recent work targeting the much neglected beauty of the aging process. Hillman elegantly charts this terrain with a trio of concepts rich in simplicity (Lasting, Leaving, and Left) and effectively applies his coat of soul to several hard-to-reach crevices (e.g., irritability as an expression of &quot;raw urge to live&quot;). As with his protigee Thomas Moore, Hillman ultimately champions the imagination as the doorway to self-actualization and spirituality. The result is fresh and inspiring, offering above all a glimpse into the dynamics of an individual hell-bent on seeing the glass as half full."},{"Title":"The Force of Character: And the Lasting Life","review":"In an epoch when appearing younger has become a sort of social hysteria this book of James Hillman sets old age in a completely different perspective, recovering and exalting the ancient sense of completion which many a human culture of the past assigned to the last span of life. Character, which Hillman sees as a distinctive unrepeatable pattern of qualities, distilled by time into a unique imaginal constellation, increases in clarity and definition as age advances. From this original standpoint, aging is like a precious refining process, not like something to be fought as a menace of physical and psychical decline. In other words, Hillman sees old age as the part of life when the unique image we contain passes, thru a final development phase, to a stage of perfect, as it were, artistic manifestation, an epiphany of our innermost truth. We become the beings we were since the start of our lives and we project our self into the souls of other human beings in the form of character. In this way, we succeed in remaining, but first we have tried to last as much as we could according to an instinct of self-preservation deeply etched into our biological roots. However, after trying to extend our life to the extreme something inside ourselves silently leads us to a substantial change of attitude and so we become more inclined to abandon the egotistic grasp over the outside world to make room for a new philosophical acceptance of our external decline and transform our bleeding wounds into new spiritual energies. All kinds of defects, limitations and difficulties typical of old age are reinterpreted by Hillman, against current mainstream opinion, in the light of their meaning as expressions of an archetypal scenario. Behavioural tics like frequent repetitions of personal anecdotes, increasing physical shortcomings like seriously weakened short-term memory and cardiac deficiencies, temperamental fits like easy irritability and even untamed eroticism are all seen as necessities paving a sort of hidden path that has to be thoroughly walked to fulfil a secret purpose of self-authentication. As is typical of Hillman's Psyche-centered Weltanschauung the overall picture which forms into your mind after reading this, as well as many of his previous works, is one of intense aesthetic spell and suggestiveness. But what is precisely suggested and evoked remains in the realm of undisclosed significance and you are like a child who is brought back in front of a timeless threshold without being given any hint to what may be lying beyond. Hillman, in this respect, quite honestly admits to have intentionally avoided to place Death at the core of his discourse, for Death devours everything referred to Her. If we want to get life out of life, Hillman seems to suggest, we should avoid granting Death the centerstage. Yes, this sounds quite comforting and charmingly vitalistic, but can that \\"final touch\\" bringing our character and our image the ultimate seal of a lifelong perfecting process be the only outcome of our existence? And, if we are not totally satisfied with this limited, if \\"artistic\\", outcome doesn't our lingering, unanswered desire to survive Death belong perhaps to the same archetypal scenario the Hillmanian Gods assigned to us, poor mortals, as the very fabric of the life they gave us? And, if so, why did They choose such a destiny for us?"},{"Title":"The Force of Character: And the Lasting Life","review":"I've read much of what Hillman has written and his thinking has influenced my own book, &quot;Gideon McGee's Dream.&quot; In Force of Character he again makes me see life in such broader strokes than that painted by the dominant idea of our Age; that is that we are nothing more than a cosmic coincidence. For those with the courage to take this book to heart, and it does take courage, it can be a transformative experience."},{"Title":"The Force of Character: And the Lasting Life","review":"I thought about aging in a whole other way after reading this book---and as someone in their fifties, the subject has been much on my mind.

Elsewhere, wilderness warrior Perkar joins a quest to speak with a forest god about opening up some more land for cultivation. Unfortunately Perkar has recently had sex with a goddess, never a good thing, and consequently emerges with a fierce determination to kill some other god. Mix that with a good-sized helping of magic swords, swashbuckling action, and ill-fated attempts at romance, and you got a recipe for a book that plods along.I won't say that \\"The Waterborn\\" is formulaic. It's not. In fact it has its share of genuine plot twists, hidden identities, and deftly concealed secrets. It would be more accurate to say that \\"The Waterborn\\" is a checklist novel. Stuff gets thrown in - the sex scenes, the irksome suitor, the mysterious warrior - and one feels it's merely because the author feels a fantasy needs to have all that stuff. I do certainly credit Keyes with respecting the reader's intelligence. \\"The Waterborn\\" unfolds with careful attention to motivation and psychology.Keyes does have a mighty struggle with dialogue, unfortunately. Whenever people talk in this book, it's organized more around getting across the needed information rather than imitating the flow of a real conversation. I should perhaps be lenient. As Ernest Hemingway famously remarked, writing dialogue that really sounds like real people talking is the hardest thing any writer ever has to do, and it surely can't be done without practice. But as for that, I always review books by content, not caring whether it's the author's first effort or not."},{"Title":"The Waterborn (Children of the Changeling Ser., 1)","review":"This is a fantasitic book.

Upon find out that he was an author, I endeavored to see what sort of writing he was capable of. I was then very surprised and pleased by Waterborn.I have read many of the current fantasy novels available today and, to me, they all seem familiar. You have your warriors and wizards and some sort of non-human characters, usually an elf, dwarf, or such. But Mr. Keyes has created something truly different, and quite refreshing. Here we have various cultures of mankind trying to make a life for themselves in a world where the Gods are not only real they live in the same world. He characterization is fantastic, and the intertwining story a page-turner.If you like fantasy novels but are getting tired of the same old story I would strongly suggest Waterborn you won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"The Waterborn (Children of the Changeling Ser., 1)","review":"I was trying to write a five page essay on what my future career would be, but I had just checked out this book. I had gotten the book earlier that day say around 12 and my classes ended at 3 but after that all I did was read this book. I just couldn't stop reading it. The story wasn't the greatest ever, but it was very good and just about every chapter ended with some kind of cliffhanger. I kept telling myself that one more chapter and I would go off to write my paper, but it would end I'd start to leave the room and then'd realize I couldn't start writing untill I found out if the princess was going to jump off the roof plunging to her DOOM! The chapters that didn't end like that always had some new strange development that made you want to find out what would happen next; I can't go write now I don't know what will happen now that Perkar finaly met up with the giant and librarian.

With the exotic but bewitched princess Henzi, the valent hero Perker, his brave yet humble friend Ngangata, the ancient one Brother Horse and the gods such as Harka and the changling make it so you don't know if they will ever meet, survive or just what they will do next.

Did I mention a couple of plot twists that would make the most jaded thriller or mystery reader's eyes light up?At a deeper level, Keyes also addresses issues such as the relationship of man to his gods in a belief system similar to the Greek and Roman pantheon of mortal gods and half-gods with emotions and motivations that are all too human. He also seems openly critical of a priesthood that has misinterpreted its role in society and as a result has misappropriated and abused the power that history accorded it. Religious and racial intolerance also make cameo appearances.But, all the while, Keyes never forgets that he is telling a story - and, it's one you won't be forgetting for a long time to come!Paul Weiss"},{"Title":"The Waterborn (Children of the Changeling Ser., 1)","review":"Keyes is a stunning author, able to create worlds that suck you in and plots that keep you turning the pages as fast as you can. The Waterborn is some of his best work.When writing fantasy, it seems like many authors are prone to falling into the trap of overused settings, trite plot developments and stock characters. Keyes is not one of these authors. The Waterborn is a story that contains both fluidity and depth- there is a continuity and logic to everything that happens, and his characters are unique individuals, all of them capable of great good and great evil, none of them perfect in any regard.The Waterborn is set in a unique world, and each of the richly-developed characters must come to terms with their role in it. Their stories converge in an epic plot that will make you as eager to unravel what's really going on as they are. This is not a book to pass up- it's pure magic."},{"Title":"The Waterborn (Children of the Changeling Ser., 1)","review":"Keyes draws on older legends and invents some of his own in telling the story of a boy's coming-of-age quest.

This was one of the most imaginitive and original fantasy debuts I ever read."},{"Title":"The Waterborn (Children of the Changeling Ser., 1)","review":"This book breeds ancient myths entwined with new ones. The journey of misguided youth turns our hero Perkar into a man with a wealth of experience to confront his enemy, the Changeling. The idea of a river god eating the body of a stream goddess, as the main reason to kill the river god is just wild. The river being absolute power is one of the main themes running through, all around there is a god for every nature aspect around in this world. The background for the gods are nurtured from ancient Indian beliefs. Hezhi, a young heroine, goes through her own journey to discover her true purpose in her life. Two paths that lead to each other and both grow as individuals when they clash together in the end."},{"Title":"The Waterborn (Children of the Changeling Ser., 1)","review":"What makes Keyes original is his use of Native American beliefs and religious examples to develop a scenario different from the typical Good Creater, bad Evil Satan-like entity. Gods and Goddesses, of large and small influence, play a decided role in meddling with humans. A fun, fast read."},{"Title":"The Waterborn (Children of the Changeling Ser., 1)","review":"The problem with most fantasy is that it is written entirely within the world of fantasy literature. It refers only to other books, creating a mirror world in which every image has been seen before, and every character is the reflection of many others. With the Chosen of the Changeling series Greg Keyes has escaped from this trap by infusing his story with anthropology and traditional myth. These books feel original because they return to the tradition of heroic stories told around the hearth that lies behind all fantasy. Keyes' heroes are like the heroes of epic, chosen by the gods to play parts in stories they don't really understand. The setting is magnificent, the writing fine. I enjoyed both of these books and recommend them highly."},{"Title":"The Waterborn (Children of the Changeling Ser., 1)","review":"This was the first Keyes book that I read and I have to say that, after wandering through a wilderness of some of the lousiest sci-fi and fantasy books over the past few years, that this was, oh so, refreshing.I believe that Greg Keyes is probably one of the finer writers out there right now.So, I'm picking up just about every book of his that I can.A great read, well worth the money for a new one off of your favorite book store shelf."},{"Title":"The Franchise","review":"The best, finest football sports book written so far.

Although, this book revolves around the front office and star quarterback of an expansion football team, there really is very little football going on. Instead, we are presented with some of the seedy side of a professional sports team with everything from point shaving to murder. Not an uninteresting read but it does get slow in the middle.

Though Amanda may seem cold and in a sense, uncaring and rebellious toward the first half of the book, I was intrigued by the way Fielding gradually \\"warmed\\" up Amanda's personality by unveiling things from her past that explains where she's coming from and why she is the way she is, to a certain degree. As I got to know more about Amanda and her relationship with her mother, Amanda's behavior becomes more understandable to me and curiosity is aroused as to why certain things happened the way they did and why certain people behaved the way they did. The mother-daughter tangle adds well to the story. The conclusion is satisfying and twists an initially cold character into a warm-blooded human being with a wide array of feelings."},{"Title":"Puppet","review":"Here we go again.

Is it to save mom? No, she needs to escape an angry wife. You see, Amanda thinks nothing of sleeping with the husbands of neighbors or gym pick ups. If they're married, all the better.Be prepared for long passages of internal (poor little me) dialog. Amanda just isn't a character one can like; She runs rough-shod over others--treating them to her temper tantrums, sharp tongue, and paranoic suspicions. The privacy of others is irrelevant when she thinks they know something about her. In fact, it all centers around her. So much so that the \\"plot\\" disappears and one feels like a sudden transportee to a therapist's session.

Amanda debates back and forth whether or not to return to Toronto. It is apparent that she and her mother have had a falling out and that Amanda is in no rush to see her again. As fate would have it, Amanda does return to Toronto to attempt to straighten out this dastardly deed committed by her mother. Amanda tries to figure out why her mother would do such a horrible act. She also spends a great deal of the book trying to just like her mother.

The New York Times book review calls Mandy Puppet \\"beautiful,\\" when there is no evidence to support this subjective statement. Mandy's behavior made her anything but beautiful. A pie in the face for Mandy!This story is set in 2004. Twice-divorced defense attorney Mandy Puppet Travis (another whinebag lawyer like Jess of \\"Tell Me No Secrets\\") has a practice in Florida. Her first husband, Ben, a 1950s wannabe bad boy calls her to defend her mother. Seems Mandy's mother shot a man outside of a hotel and nobody can figure out why. Since the lady isn't talking, Ben figures Mandy can slither back into her life and worm the reasons out of her. Mandy drags her feet at returning to her hometown of Toronto and she certainly wants nothing to do with her mama dearest. Naturally, Mandy and Ben relight one another's fires and admit that when they married, both were too young. Mandy's second marriage to Mr. Travis was the opposite extreme - she married a man much older than she who was genuinely a nice person. She used him and fortunately for him, they parted company.Mandy acted a fool all throughout the book. She had a pathological aversion for nicknames of any kind and the word \\"puppet\\" sent her into orbit. Mandy had no compunction about picking up men and sleeping with them. She just used people and was a tiresome drone. It didn't matter to her if they were married or single. She picked someone up at a gym and later a seatmate on the plane. He went from seatmate to sackmate and Ben actually catches them together. One gets the impression that Mandy the Puppet staged that little scene for Benny-boy's benefit.No, Mandy the Puppet just isn't a character you can like. She puts one in mind of Elvis' 1956 cover of \\"Hound Dog,\\" where he says, \\"they said you was high class, but that was just a lie...\\" so true in Mandy Puppet's case. The supporting cast of characters are dull and tiresome. The \\"mysteries\\" as it turns out is simply a) why Mandy Puppet's mother killed that man; b) the man's identity and c) what connection did a woman with two pre-teen children staying at the hotel have with that man.By the time you get to the end, you just don't care. You kind of wish they'd all just hop off the puppet stage and run behind the curtain. Talk about a Punch & Judy show! A good song to sum up this book is James & Bobby Purify's 1966 hit, \\"I'm Your Puppet.\\" The ending, as duly noted by other reviewers was indeed unsatisfactory and yeah, even \\"creepy,\\" just like Mandy Puppet."},{"Title":"Puppet","review":"Joy Fielding has written many popular books in the past years such as Grand Avenue and Whispers and Lies and I think Lost is sure to be another hit.Puppet opens with us meeting Amanda Travis, a main character you certainly are not going to love.

After much deliberation and some extra heat from past relationships knocking at her door, Amanda decided to take a quick trip home. Ben takes Amanda to see her mother the day after she arrives only to be told that her mom, Gwen does not want any kind of defense. She just wants to plead guilty and take her sentence. Being the attorney that she is, Amanda can't take that as an option so she starts digging around to find out the truth behind the shooting. What Amanda gets is a whole lot more than she bargained for when the truth about her past starts catching up to her and life will never be the same.Puppet was a very quick read with a lot of dialog so be forewarned if you do not like that format in a book.

If you enjoy suspense, you'll love this well-plotted tale of a dysfunctional family full of hidden secrets!"},{"Title":"Puppet","review":"It's surprising how many readers commenting here seem to feel that the main character in a popular novel always must be a real role model or at least someone with minor or understandable flaws. The white-hat syndrome. Why is that? Here, Joy Fielding clearly presents a main character who is not very admirable or very happy, either. The character's fast mind and quick wit keeps us turning pages, but the author does not intend for the reader to look up to or admire the main character, as shown by her bitterness and unhappiness. (Probably she doesn't want her condemned outright, either--just accepted as a character.) It's too bad that so many people gave up on the book just because the main character is who she is. The plot explores how she became the cynical, self-destructive person she is, what experiences made her who she is. The author is not endorsing such behavior, or else the character would not be so dark and brooding. It is kind of silly to judge a novel like a person for its supposed morality or immorality, anyway, but if you are going to do that, the judgment should be based not on what the subject is (a woman whose life ignores traditional morality) but on what attitude the book takes toward that subject. The attitude here is analytical--to show how she became the way she is (and how, in a very cliched happy ending) she eventually gets beyond all of this behavior to a new beginning.Popular fiction can seem to cover such extremes (fantasy, history, horror, romance), but all of that, I guess, is really misleading because underneath whatever genre is being used, the range is really pretty constricting--all readers seem to want is a main character who is supergood, someone to look up to, no matter how unrealistic that may be or how unsuitable it is for the kind of conflict that makes for interesting fiction. Readers should consider widening their expectations from the novels they read. Books can provide a role model to look up to--and sometimes other types of people, too, people who can be better understood as we see their pasts. In the book An Experiment in Criticism, C.S. Lewis talked about people who \\"use\\" literature for \\"egoistic castle-building\\" rather than surrender themselves to the book they are reading open-mindedly. He makes a good point."},{"Title":"Puppet","review":"Although Joy Fielding had written several books, I have only read two titles before this. One was The First Time which I thought was OK. The second book was Whispers and lies which I loved. When I found Puppet at the library, I couldn't wait to read another psychological thriller because of how I felt about Whispers and Lies. Sadly while I enjoyed three-fourths of the book, by the end, I was left feeling rather disappointed.Amanda is a 28 year old lawyer living in Florida. With two failed marriages behind her Danielle now finally enjoys a wonderful career, great home and single lifestyle. But this may not last much longer after she receives a phone call from her ex husband, a practicing attorney from her home town in Toronto, Canada. Now Amanda's carefully ordered world is about to crumble when she learns that her mother, whom she has always had a strained relationship with, has just killed a total stranger in the lobby of a hotel. Initially Amanda tells her ex husband this isn't her problem and refuses to fly to Toronto. But then realizing her mother has no other family, Amanda decides to make the trip if even for only a few days. Once there Amanda must not only deal with her mother's refusal to discuss what happened but her mothers stubborness about pleading guilty without explaining her actions. What ensues for readers after this was a roller coaster of events which kept my eyes pealed to the page. But only up to a certain point.While I raced through the first 200 pages of the book I found there was one real problem I had with the book and that was I didn't find Amanda a totally sympathetic character although she should have been, especially by the end. And the zinger at the end, as I call this revelation proved to be way too creepy for me to really rate this book higher which I originally planned to do. Still when I thought about lowering my rating, I did rate this book higher than I might have because for most of the book I was sitting on the edge of my seat.I look forward to reading more books by Fielding. But I do hope that her next endings might not be as creepy and disappointing as this one was for me. My feelings reminded me of those readers who also felt cheated by the ending in Whispers and Lies although fro me I never saw that ending coming and therefore loved it. This ending I would never have predicted and when I read it, was really disappointed that Fielding would resort to this rather bizarre shocker."},{"Title":"Puppet","review":"This was my first novel by Ms. Fielding.

Since the whole book was written from Amanda's viewpoint, although not in a first person narrative, it would be difficult for other characters to be more than two-dimensional. Amanda is written as a very self-centered person. But, the ending...ugh. One reader called it creepy. I call it downright gross and disgusting.

Since the lady isn't talking, Ben figures Amanda can slither back into her life and worm the reasons out of her. Mandy drags her feet at returning to her hometown of Toronto and she certainly wants nothing to do with her mama dearest. Naturally, Mandy and Ben relight one another's fires and admit that when they married, both were too young. Mandy's second marriage to Mr. Travis was the opposite extreme - she married a man much older than she who was genuinely a nice person. She used him and fortunately for him, they parted company.Mandy acted a fool all throughout the book. She had a pathological aversion for nicknames of any kind and the word \\"puppet\\" sent her into orbit. Mandy had no compunction about picking up men and sleeping with them. She just used people and was a tiresome drone. It didn't matter to her if they were married or single. She picked someone up at a gym and later a seatmate on the plane. He went from seatmate to sackmate and Ben actually catches them together. One gets the impression that Mandy the Puppet staged that little scene for Benny-boy's benefit.No, Mandy the Puppet just isn't a character you can like. She puts one in mind of Elvis' 1956 cover of \\"Hound Dog,\\" where he says, \\"they said you was high class, but that was just a lie...\\" so true in Mandy Puppet's case.

You kind of wish they'd all just hop off the puppet stage and run behind the curtain. Talk about a Punch & Judy show!

I find it very difficult to give up on a book once I start reading/listening to it, but this was a bit of a trial. I didn't like Amanda much, nor did I enjoy the snarly, hectoring tone of the reader on the CD--I kept having to turn her down because of the unpleasant tone all the way through the book. I know the character's tone is the reason for this, but it might have been easier to take with a reader with a lower voice. It put me on edge. Nor did the book make it easy to understand why Ben would ever want to mess with Amanda again. She was not a likeable character in the least, either when she was married to him or when she returns to Canada. She uses pretty much every man she meets, and it's doubtful that the big reunion at the end is going to change that aspect of her character. Too many of the mysteries were just ridiculous: Amanda's half-sister disappears from the face of the Earth, and none of the neighbors ever mentions her to Amanda? Her parents never, ever slip and mention the half-sister's name? Yada-yada-yada. Too many details are slipped in right at the end, so you never have the chance to mull them over to try to figure some of it out yourself. Definitely not a satisfying book."},{"Title":"Puppet","review":"Amanda Travis is another unappealing, unpleasant, unsympathetic character who can join the ranks of Fielding's other unappealing, unpleasant, unsympathetic protagonists.

I've always enjoyed her work. However, this novel was easy to put down and dragged on forever with details of things I could've cared less about. The main character, Amanda, was not likeable at all. In real life, I wouldn't want to be around a woman like her. No morals, values, it's all about her. I agree with the other reviewers. The ending was a shocker, and I was surprised when I couldn't figure it out myself. Only after reading the book did I realize why I couldn't predict the ending. It was way too gross. I'm surprised the author went in this direction. If you want to read one of Joy Fielding's best novels, read GRAND AVENUE. You won't be disappointed with that one. I wouldn't recommend this novel...skip it and read something better."},{"Title":"Puppet","review":"Nothing about this book was appealing to me...not the style of writing, which was fractured at best and tedious at worst, certainly not the characters who got lost in their flaws and the jerky movement of sequences, and the ending was just plain disgusting, not to mention unbelievable. I know you have to suspend your disbelief for much fiction to be enjoyable, but my disbelief just won't stretch that far!"},{"Title":"Puppet","review":"Well it speaks to the storyline and gripping writing style of this novel that has me finished in 8 days. Yes, it was a quick read. The fact that the story had me guessing and flipping pages trying to put the pieces together in this murder mystery, i'm delighted to have had a chance to read this book.I didn't like the main character's whinny, over the top personality. It prevented me from really sympathizing with her much. Sure she had a rough childhood and the truth that rocks not only those in the story, but the readers themselves was a lot for anyone to go through. It still had me telling her to grow up a lot.I have never read any of Joy's books so this was a positive introduction to her books. I look forward to the ones I plan to read in the future.If you're looking for a book to captivate your mind and keep you guessing to the very last pages, then this is the quick mystery for you!I'm rating this as high as possible, 5/5, because the writing was so intriguing and the twists and turns in this book rival those of my favourite books and writing styles. You can't do much better than that."},{"Title":"Puppet","review":"In this novel, Amanda Travis is an emotionally-closed-off woman in her late 20s working as a criminal defense attorney in Florida. When Amanda gets an unexpected, urgent phone call from her ex-husband, she is shocked and dismayed to learn that her estranged mother has shot and killed a man in her hometown of Toronto. Her ex urges her to come home and assist in dealing with her mother, who appears to want to plead guilty and go directly to prison. Amanda wants nothing more than to hide in Florida and pretend she has no past. Her relationship with her mother is rocky, to say the least, and she left her ex under less-than-ideal circumstances too. But Amanda is drawn back to Toronto where she is forced to confront unresolved issues and demons from her past as well as investigate things she never knew about her mother. The necessity of investigating the charges against her mother force Amanda to open up emotionally and reevaluate her own life.Amanda is a complex, less than fully likeable character, but she is not entirely unsympathetic. In some ways, it is refreshing to have a less-than-perfect \\"heroine\\" who doesn't always handle things with perfect aplomb and total control. Putting aside the bizarre factual circumstances driving the plot, the novel is essentially about Amanda confronting her past and the journey to finding out who she really is and how she wants to live her life. It's about choices and mistakes and having the courage to attempt to correct things you regret. It is a relatively quick read, although the plot develops a little more slowly than would be ideal in a mystery/thriller. This is far from Joy Fielding's best offering in this genre but certainly worth reading."},{"Title":"Puppet","review":"This is from a guy. Actually, I liked the book. I listened to it and thoroughly enjoyed it. Yeah, I yelled at her a dozen times that she was being stupid and a teeny-bopper, but I still enjoyed the read/listen. I am a lawyer and the way she reacts as a lawyer is quite realistic, but being a guy I cannot tell you if her swoon over her ex is real or contrived (it feels a bit much to me). I found the gimmick of the ancient business cards a bit -- well -- gimmicky. Still, all in all, enjoy the read read or, better yet, listen to Hick's reading of it."},{"Title":"Puppet","review":"I have now read several of Fielding's novels. Some of her earlier work remains among my favorites, while \\"Whisper and Lies\\" (see my reviews) has one of the best endings of most books I have read. Anyway, \\"Puppet\\" was a hard one to put down, I read it in one sitting. Ms. Fielding always guarantees a page turner, and this one didn't disappoint in that regard. As usual the author also almost always presents us with a great ending as well, this ending was more than interesting to say the least, however, a little peculiar for most tastes, hence the four star rating instead of the five. I still love you Joy! Next up...Heartstopper."},{"Title":"Puppet","review":"Although a good novel, it was not as spell binding as her previous.

Although by reading the back cover excerpt you certainly can get the impression that this is going to be a \\"closed case\\" as the book is all about a lady who shoots a total stranger in the lobby of hotel.

The daughter lawyer who resents her mother for the way she was treated growing up can't help herself and starts digging into the mystery of who was the total stranger that her mother shot in cold blood. Once she starts digging, each layer is revealed and somewhere along the line the ick factor comes in. Some people might not like this book because of the ick factor but since we live in such a crazy world and I have watched all the crime drama shows on TV, I was surprised by the shocking revelations but not disgusted as some of my co-workers were. I think this another great read by one of the masters of suspense."},{"Title":"Puppet","review":"Joy Fielding is one of the authors that I buy a book just by the author name alone. This book was not her best but still wasn't a waste of time. The plot was interesting. The angry daughter comes home because her estranged mother shoots and kills a complete stranger. The plot is interesting but not the sit on the edge of your seat suspense that is the norm in books by Joy Fielding. The ending was definitely a surprise so you can't call the book predictable.

Her latest client is accused of raping his girlfriend, and despite the evidence against him, she is successful and gets him off most of the charges. She always gets what she wants, and has been successful because she's aggressive and is not afraid to step on anyone that gets in her way.Amanda has been married and divorced twice, and ex-husband #1 has been calling her constantly, almost to the point of harassment, asking her to call him back. While she's in the middle of having sex with a stranger she just met, she decides to pick up the phone and find out what is going on. She eventually learns that her mother has killed someone with a gun in the middle of a hotel lobby for no apparent reason. The man her mother murdered is a total stranger, and Amanda cannot for the life of her figure out why her mother would do something like this.As Amanda explores her mother's crime, she begins to unravel secrets of her own life, including the connection the murdered man has to her mother and her family. PUPPET may read like a sensationalistic soap opera, but while some readers may find the events totally unbelievable, one has to agree this made one hell of a story, and I had a hard time putting the book down. Riveting with a lot of action and suspense, PUPPET is yet another book by Joy Fielding that I enjoyed a lot. I have only one negative comment about the book - I did not like the main character very much. I believe the author intentionally wrote the character of Amanda Travis as a very manipulative and self-centered woman, in order to arrive at the end of the book where her life takes a turn for the better, despite everything she's learned about her family history. With that said, PUPPET was definitely one of the better books by Joy Fielding that I've read, and recommend the book with the warning that the main character is highly unlikable."},{"Title":"Puppet","review":"Please note that I would give the narrator of this audio book five stars. I've listened to her before & she never disappoints; excellent & keeps the reader interested with her change in voices for each character, etc.In the first half of the story there are lots of characters, so many in fact that I took notes of who was who so as not to get confused & to find out they had no purpose in the story, I don't even know why they were mentioned so that was a bit frustrating; it could have easily been condensed with the key ten or so characters.The ending was too far fetched for me to grasp and made me uneasy.Like Whispers and Lies, the mother-daughter relationship is strained & touches on Florida for a location; hoping for something a little different in the next Joy Fielding I pick up."},{"Title":"Puppet","review":"I agree, this book dragged on way too long.

She drowns her emotional pain in mindless sex, leaving two ex-husbands when they threatened to get too close. Now a lawyer in southeast Florida, she has organized her life just the way she wants it, not letting anyone get too close. Her calm is suddenly fractured one night when her ex-husband calls her from Toronto to tell her that her mother in jail on a murder charge.Despite the fact that she tells herself she doesn't care, she flies to Toronto where Ben represents her mother Gwen. Ben tells her that Gwen isn't talking, insisting only that she killed an unknown man in a hotel lobby because she felt like it and she is perfectly sane. Gwen's stonewalling is infuriating Amanda who believes there is a reason for what she did; for once in her life she isn't going to run away from adversity but plunge into it and expose the secret her mother is so desperate to hide.Joy Fielding once again delivers an exciting crime thriller that will keep readers' interest from page one as they wonder why the protagonist's mother committed cold blooded murder. It is a question that will haunt the audience as the protagonist seeks to find out her mom's secrets that were responsible for her traumatized childhood. As Amanda gets close to the truth she finally comes to terms with her own feelings and turns more sympathetic in the minds of the audience. PUPPET is a nail biting suspense thriller taking readers to the ultimate level.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Moths of the Limberlost: With water color and photographic illustrations from life","review":"Gene Stratton-Porter, 1863-1924, was a naturalist, photographer, and writer. This book is derived from her &quot;Moths of the Limberlost, with water color and photographic illustrations from life&quot; published in 1912 by Doubleday, Page, and company. This brings me to my one objection to the book. It has no pictures! The original book contains 106 of her photographs including 20 that were hand colored. The pictures include moths, their eggs, caterpillars, cocoons, and pupa cases, along with pictures of their food plants and the environment in which they are found. While photography of her day did not produce nature pictures of the quality we expect today, they are, never-the-less, an integral part of the work. I was very disappointed to find them missing. On a minor note, five verses quoted in the original book are not in this one. Otherwise, the text does appear to be intact except perhaps for a few references to illustrations.Given that finding a copy of the original book for sale is difficult, this reprint is well worth obtaining even without the illustrations. Gene Stratton-Porter was a keen naturalist and an excellent writer. The first chapter is an introduction. The second is an overview of the natural history of moths. It is only slightly technical. She has studied the research issues and questions of the day and comments on them. While she guesses wrong on at least one point: whether male moths find their mates by smell, her opinions are always based on observations and her reasoning clearly stated. In some areas, her observations are at the boundaries of what is known about moths at the time. But even in this technical chapter, she presents material in terms of her experiences, both experiences with with moths and experiences studying the writings of lepidopterists.Each of the remaining thirteen chapters deals with one (or in one case, two) moths. Rather than create a comprehensive book on moths, she has focused on those that have caught her interest. These are moths that she has photographed and, in most cases, raised from egg to caterpillar to pupa and back to adult. Each chapter is not only an essay on a particular moth, is it also a bit of her own autobiography. In them she describes her experiences with moths from her childhood through the years she spent developing the book. These include her great joys in discovering and learning about the moths and her disappointments at loosing moths or at failing to successfully raise them through a life cycle. The book describes her family's participation in her love of moths and describes the friendships she made in the pursuit of these beautiful insects. It is a window into her personality and her passion for nature."},{"Title":"Moths of the Limberlost: With water color and photographic illustrations from life","review":"I love the way this authors writes, but I am told that the original copy has wonderful colored pictures of the moths.This book makes you feel like you are growing up with Gene Stratton Porter and helping her with her nature studies."},{"Title":"Moths of the Limberlost: With water color and photographic illustrations from life","review":"This is a suppliment to my August 25, 1998 review.Two editions that I know lack photos:- 1976 Buccaneer Books, Inc- 2007 BiblioBazaar"},{"Title":"Moths of the Limberlost: With water color and photographic illustrations from life","review":"This book is one of her non fiction writings.

At 112 pages including index and references, this work is not voluminous. It is, though, comprehensive. Rather that strictly review the military battles alone, Stewart takes time to establish the global situation leading to the war. Her analysis of America's shifting views of it's role is superb.Her approach complements the major thread of narrative with a large amount of material encapsulating related subjects. For a work target toward late-middle school or early high school, the book is engaging and engrossing for younger minds and adults.You'll find little known facts such as the Zimmerman telegraph, saboteurs in the U.S., the role of African-Americans, effects on woman's rights alongside of familiar stories of the Lusitania, Alvin York, and Armistice Day. Fundamentally, this is not a book about the glory of military triumph. This is a carefully considered exposition of the times, events and people. And it engages the reader in the anguish of the human cost of this war and its aftermath.Highly recommended as a resource for U.S. history courses in secondary or late primary education. Homeschoolers will also find this a valuable wealth of material. On a personal note, I have enjoyed watching my nine year old son devour this book. He has chosen to re-read it many times for the sheer pleasure of learning. It has also been fun to share my well-educated wife's pleasure in finding many elements that were new to her.One note of caution: this book is a bit hard to find, and the entire series it belongs to (\\"America's Wars\\" from Lucent Books) seems to have fallen out of print. If the companion volumes are as well done, this is a grave loss."},{"Title":"World War I (American War Series)","review":"I read this book to brush up on my WWI history for some research I am doing. I found it just right for my needs. The book is simply and clearly written with sub-subject boxes scattered throughout the book with interesting tidbits of related history. This book is an excellent overview of WWI, especially if the reader wishes to avoid wading through theory and tedious extras found in other historical books. Therefore, it makes for a wonderful light read.The two negative things I would have to say about it is that I found some of the text to be a little opinionated and subjective. I also wished that there had been more scholarly citations to know where particular bits of information came from to aid readers in further research. (The author does provide a \\"Works Cited\\" page.)Overall, I definitely recommend this book, especially to those who just want a light history on WWI."},{"Title":"World War I (American War Series)","review":"I used this book to assist in the teaching of an 8th grade history class.

This is all seen though the eyes of a family in Punjab, which successfully makes the transition from old traditions to modernity, as seen through the thoughtful eyes of the author, who eventually becomes the first Indian Chairman of a renowned British multinational company in India and finally a leading senior manager in India's public sector. The author was also the first Chairman of the famous Indian Institute of Management in Ahmedabad, set up together with the Harvard Business School and financial support from the Ford Foundation. Written with a verve and a keen and observant eye, it is socio-economic history at its very best. A must read for all Punjabis from India and Pakistan and for all general readers interested in the sub-continent plus all scholars of South Asia..It is a shame that this book it is out of print.The publisher should be encouraged to bring it back into print again!"},{"Title":"Punjabi Century 1857-1947","review":"This book is a rare gem, a mix of Russel Bakers 'Growing Up' and Ahmed Ali's 'Twilight in Delhi'. Prakash Tandon, founder of IIM A, was born in 1911. He traces the history of his family from 1847, about the time the rule of the Sikhs (Sikha Shahi)ended, to 1947. Unlike the rest of India (apart from Hyderabad),Punjab was never ruled by the East India company. When the British took over, many welcomed the change and stability. The Khatris amongst the Punjabis were the first to embrace formal British education. By 1911,as Tandon notes, the engineering services in some districts were managed entirely by Indian staff.As a child Mr. Tandon grows up in small towns and villages, moving with his father who works as an engineer managing the canal system. He describes a Baisakhi festival on the banks of a river in one such village in photographic detail. Later, he completes his education in a small town called Gujrat, at the foothills of what today would be Pakistani occupied Kashmir. Vividly described, the way of life of this small town, and the ups and downs of Mr. Tandon's family during those years form the core of this book. Pran Nevile attempts a copy of this with his poorly written 'Lahore' but fails to get that emotional touch.Much of this books success is precisely that- a story of a whole community told through the life of one family with a personal touch. The book ends with the parition and the family's crossing over to India at the wagah border."},{"Title":"Punjabi Century 1857-1947","review":"Mr. Tandon wrote the book that surprisingly no one ever thought of writing. The book is sort of a biography of a family .. in it he has masterfully woven the whole society around it, though the reader never would realize his till you finish the book. He describes the society, the cultre and traditions from the past with great care love and nostalgia. His command of the subject is complete, I didn't find a single thing he wrote that I had known to be otherwise!!!"},{"Title":"Punjabi Century 1857-1947","review":"It is one of the best books I have read. The author takes us on a wonderful trip of the punjabi century. A delight to read. A must-read for all punjabis."},{"Title":"Punjabi Century 1857-1947","review":"I first read this book 2 years ago and keep reading it again. Its a book about the Punjab that the British built (&quot;without any hangovers from the Company&quot;) but it is also a book of Indian life of that period, and its the *best* such narration. India does not have a deep tradition of such narrations put to paper --not such superb stuff anyways. Earlier I'd read two &quot;sequels&quot; to this book about post-1947 India, and while they're very good, this one is really fascinating. Mr. Tandon *writes* !!"},{"Title":"Punjabi Century 1857-1947","review":"It was a class requierement. It was in great condition and I really like the service."},{"Title":"Nightside the Long Sun (Book of the Long Sun)","review":"NIGHTSIDE THE LONG SUN is the first volume of Gene Wolfe's four-volume work The Book of the Long Sun, which is a story of political intrigue, revolution, and Christian allegory set in a starship sent from Earth to colonize a distant planet.Gene Wolfe rose to fame with his magisterial work The Book of the New Sun, which is one of my most cherished books. The Book of the Long Sun takes place, in fact, in the same universe as Wolfe's masterpiece. However, differences abound. The Book of the New Sun is a first-person narrative in which the narrator stands between the reader and a clear view of his world. The Book of the Long Sun, on the other hand, is told in third-person and the setting is richly illustrated by Wolfe's prose. That is not to say that there are no mysteries in the Book of the Long Sun, it is of course a Gene Wolfe novel, but the plot is much more straightforward and clear than in Wolfe's earlier triumph.NIGHTSIDE THE LONG SUN slowly introduces the plot that will later rage through the city of its setting and by the end of the four-volume work utterly change the world in which the characters live. NIGHTSIDE opens with the enlightenment of Patera Silk, an augur (i.e. priest), in Viron, one of the cities within the Whorl, the gigantic starship sent from Urth. The rather pagan inhabitants of the Whorl worship a pantheon of deities based upon the ruler who sent out the starship and his family. Silk's enlightener, however, is an obscure god called the Outsider, because he abides even outside the Whorl, who is quite possibly in fact the Christian God. The Outsider has called upon Silk to save the local church and school, which have been sold for back taxes to a criminal named Blood. Silk, in a bit of bravado, proceeds to break into Blood's mansion in hopes of getting his property back. This attempt at breaking in, along with an exorcism of a bordello, are the sum of NIGHTSIDE THE LONG SUN. It's a slow and simple start, the action of this book takes place over merely two days, but in the following books the pace builds exponentially.The Book of the Long Sun may not be as poetic and full of sophistry as The Book of the New Sun, but it's immensely good reading. Wolfe's use of Christian allegory (much stricter here than in the earlier work), and a plot full of revolution, war, and political mystery is a fine work. After NIGHTSIDE THE LONG SUN, the reader should be voraciously desiring the next book in the series, LAKE OF THE LONG SUN."},{"Title":"Nightside the Long Sun (Book of the Long Sun)","review":"Long Sun may be the most conventional of Wolfe's work, at least on the surface. Perhaps because it's told in third person, unusual for Wolfe, it seems more like other, lesser works of SF, until you really begin to understand what's happening, the astounding complexity of the world Wolfe is showing his reader... and you once again are humbled by the talent of this writer. There are no equals to Wolfe writing today; it saddens me he is not a household name, though given the current state of our culture, I understand why he isn't. You have to pay attention to Wolfe. Don't let the simpicity of his prose fool you - not a word is out of place, Wolfe's control over his story should never be doubted.There's no reason to talk about plot, here. This isn't about plot, though this is one of the more traditional Gene Wolfe works you will find. But the power of Wolfe is not plot. Wolfe is about ideas, about humanity's place in creation, about gods and God, about redemption and determination, about what it is to be human, to want to be human, about failure and dealing with failure, about the loss and rebirth of faith, epiphany, and, finally, understanding of one's place in the universe.Wolfe rewards like few writers. It's hard work to read him; it takes effort, you have to think, to consider, to realize he is apt to reveal important informantion at any time. There isn't anything, not one word, that isn't meant to be there, no compromise in his respect for his reader's intelligence. But in the end, when you finish a major Wolfe work like Long Sun, you'll have a greater appreciation for what it means to be human. And you'll wish you too could find an Oreb, or have been taught by a Matera Marble, or perhaps, could have spoken, just once, to a Patera Silk."},{"Title":"Nightside the Long Sun (Book of the Long Sun)","review":"Wolfe's novels have been said to be poetic, full of prose and the author himself has been said to be the modern day Melville. After reading 264 pages of Nightside of Long Sun, I didn't feel that the words were meticulously chosen or arranged into a flowery literary bouquet. The vocabulary didn't strike me as challenging the intellect nor did it pressure me to reach for the dictionary. Perhaps other reviews and recommendations have simply over exaggerated the writing style of Wolfe or perhaps it's just that I've been around the block a few times in the terms of the written English language in modern sci-fi literature. However, this one point doesn't deduct from the respect I have for the author, the novel or from the situation Silk finds himself in. It seems a blessing to be able to easily relate to the characters and schemes to willingly.With that popular oversight aside, the flow and texture of the plot is unparalleled. The purposeful transgressions of main character Silk have a progressive element. While each hectic situation Silk finds himself in seems to be abrupt and unplanned, the further unfolding of the plot reveals a meticulous attention to the detail of the plot. Even in between chapters the crossover is seamless; paragraphs merge like beads of oil atop a level aquatic surface. What else can be said...it's beautiful. The one-on-one connections of Silk are intrinsically loose, which is acceptable merely because there are three books which follow in the series; the precedence is set, the foundation laid. I can envisage a great unfurling of the bolt of contextual plot which Wolfe has woven.On a personal level, my reading has been cut back over the past few months because of a string of bad books (including Pohl, Busby, Bear, Pellegrino, etc). When I started reading Nightside of the Long Sun, I felt the dedication of the author to truly create a work of literature for the sake of literature itself and for the sake of the genre while being courteous to the reader's attention and persuasive to the reader's intellect. It is obvious that Wolfe is a gifted writer, writes with the reader and genre in mind, works scrupulously through an idea and LOVES his production, unlike much of the other popular novels spun out for word count or profit.I'm chomping at the bit to complete the series but I must maintain an interlude of other science fiction literature (perchance because I won't read anything this imperial) according to my draw-and-read sci-fi habit including fifty-four books. BUT I just can't HELP it that I want to pick up Lake of the Long Sun... so I will, soon."},{"Title":"Nightside the Long Sun (Book of the Long Sun)","review":"I write this review after reading the whole series. Perhaps I would have written a more favorable review if I had written it after just reading this volume. The story here plods along very slowly, and may not appeal to anyone who is not used to Gene Wolfe's complex writing. If you want a really good Wolfe series, pick up his &quot;New Sun&quot; books. This one seems as if it hold a lot of promise, but ultimately disappoints."},{"Title":"Nightside the Long Sun (Book of the Long Sun)","review":"Interesting book that really got me into the entire series, inspired by hearing about it in the Fringe series on TV.
