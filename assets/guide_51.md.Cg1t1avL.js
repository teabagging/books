There are small sections within the text for each drug that present Pharmcokinetics/ADR, Drug interactions, etc, but it can be difficult to go through all the drug info when you're learning about the drug for the first time.

But again this deception is what makes the story - the chase - so gripping.And as usual L'amour with his pechant for describing locales, brings to life the desert and its creatures. The characterizations are pretty memorable too!"},{"Title":"Kid Rodelo (Thorndike Western II)","review":"This western has as its setting Arizona and Sonora, with Yuma prison as its starting point, moving along the Arizona/Mexico border along the Camino de Diablo into the Pinacate Peaks around Tinaja Alta and Tule Tanks, with Papago Wells as a water stop off. The final leg of the journey is south to the Gulf of California, hoping to board a boat in Adair Bay, thence onto freedom over the water.I've read this 1966 western of escape and gold hunting in the Sonoran Desert from Louis L'Amour several times, saving it generally for the hottest days of the year; at present the temperature on the porch is 92 degrees. The mean temperature in this novel can reach 110 degrees higher up, and 150 degrees down on the desert sand floor. Reading it under this type of environment helps to really feel what these people are going through. I always read Heller With A Gun in the winter, same principle.Page 53 of the hardcover gives a good thumbnail of this western novel: \\" ... Four men and a woman (Nora Paxton), ringed with death, a death that might come from the Yaquis Indians in pursuit, but could just as likely come from the desert itself.\\" Three of these four men are escaped convicts out of Yuma Territorial Prison in Arizona Territory: one is a slick, homicidal gunslinger, another a little weasel called Gopher, and finally Badger, while a more sensitive man, still a hardened man of all times and places who is capable of murder.Kid Rodelo has served his time out in Yuma Prison, and is roaming the desert with these three and the girl, all of whom are hunting $50,000 in gold that the gunslinger killed for and stole prior to being locked up in Yuma. On their trail are the very successful Yaquis Indians led by Hat, bounty hunters all, that are sent out from Yuma Prison to bring back those that are foolish enough to escape. For this they receive $50.00 per body; and they always bring them back dead, so as not to have to share water with them on the way back.Several mysteries exist in this western: Who is Kid Rodelo? What did he want? And why is he doing what he is doing? But one thing for certain, only Dan Rodelo who knows this desert can save all these people wandering the desert. But as the Bantam paperback asked years ago, \\"But would he?\\"Semper Fi."},{"Title":"Kid Rodelo (Thorndike Western II)","review":"This book starts off pretty abruptly. It left me hanging until the part where one of the characters described how the main character was involved. There was not as much action in this book as say Kilkenny or The Mountain Valley War both of which you had sense of what the character felt. I have read about thirty louis Lamour and this one was my least favorite. I would recomend this book but with caution, some louis lamour readers may not feel that this book was up to standards of his other books."},{"Title":"Kid Rodelo (Thorndike Western II)","review":"If you are a fan of Louis L'Amour, this is vintage L'Amour at his best: good guy gets into a bad situation, there is a struggle against a protagonist, the hero comes out in the end being underestimated and a heck of a shot, and the hero gets the girl. Along the way, L'Amour's description of the geography, scenery, etc. are second to none: when the main character is dying of thirst out in the hot desert, a part of you feels thirsty, too. While the story lines of most of L'Amour's books can be predicted, they are an enjoyable 1.5 to 2 hour diversion, and he makes you feel as if you are right in the middle of the action."},{"Title":"Kid Rodelo (Thorndike Western II)","review":"Louis L'Amour's Kid Rodelo is one of the most amateurish, poorly written books I've ever read. It fails BIG TIME on every level -- weak plot, no character development, child-like dialogue and - oh, yeah-- it is totally predictable. It's been a long time since I've read a book by Louis L'Amour and the next time I'll be reading a book by him will be when hell freezes over! Please -- do not be swayed by the two reviewers that gave Kid Rodelo a 5-star rating. Do yourself a favor and avoid reading this book at all costs. I'm now going to take my copy and put it in the section of my house where I put books of this poor quality -- i.e., the trash.If you are in the mood for a good old-fashioned western, I'd recommend that you try Appaloosa and Gunman's Rhapsody by Robert B.

Now it was too late, and with no one to turn to, she faced a harsh and desperate future.Until Michael Sinclair offered sanctuary, and a solution. As Dan's best friend, he told himself that helping Brittany was temporary. Just until she was on her feet again.But neither of them had expected their arrangement to awaken such passion. Nor could they have anticipated the twist of fate that would put it all to the ultimate test.And my review:I absolutely LOVE marriage of convenience stories. As a result, I've read tons of them, and some are good, and some stink. This one was very well done. I liked how the Brittany was a strong woman, instead of the weak, clinging females you often find in romance. I also liked how the author had their love slowly grow, and that they didn't immediately hop into bed together just because they were married.Though I could see the plot twist at the end coming from a mile away, it didn't detract from my enjoyment of the story. The only complaint I had about this book was that it was too short. I would have enjoyed for it to be about a third longer. Not that the story felt at all rushed, but I would have wanted some more time with the characters because I loved them all so much.However, that being said, this was still very good, and I recommend this book."},{"Title":"Vow","review":"Brittany was devestated when she found out that Dan Remington was killed in a plane crash over the South American jungle. Not only did she lose the man that she was desperately in love with, she was also left with a constant reminder of that loss...his baby. When her parents turned her away after her passionate denial about giving away her baby, she had no one left to turn to. Except Michael Sinclair, Dan's best friend. Not wanting to be a burden, Brittany strikes out on her own.Michael had the perfect solution to Brittany's problem. She could marry him, therefore taking care of the baby. He felt it was the least he could do for his best friend's memory. What he didn't expect was the feelings that Brittany envoked in him, nor the feeling he felt toward the baby when she arrived. It all erupts when Dan returns from the dead and makes Brittany and Michael take a long and hard look at their marriage of 'convience'.Although this book started out promising, I was soon skimming it. Brittany seemed like a naive twit to me who had no idea what love was. I could understand her wanting security for her baby, but when she said that what she felt for Dan was a girl's love and what she felt for Michael was a woman's love, I was floored. It was less than two years and I didn't see anything different in her character to signify that she changed at all. Michael on the otherhand didn't admit his feelings to himself until nearly the end of the book. He had been in love with his best friend's girlfriend from the beginning. I would like to know how that was possible, as it was clearly explained in the beginning of the book that Brittany only met him once or twice. The reason I had to give it three stars was because after reading her other books, I just didn't feel that it had the depth of the others.If it's your first time trying a Schulze book, I would recommend Loving Jessie or The Substitute Wife."},{"Title":"Vow","review":"This was a nice book to read.

To achieve this without giving it a thought is called \`absence of realization'; and to achieve the latter without giving that a thought either is called \`freedom from absence of realization'.40.Q: What is meant by \`a mind delivered'?A: Having a mind free from the concepts of delivered and undelivered is called \`real deliverance'. This is what the Diamond Sutra means by the words: \`Even the Dharma must be cast aside, how much more so the not-Dharma!'

Spindel's book examines the unique nexus of the history of Native peoples, football, the Big Ten, land grant universities, anthropology, wild west shows and photography, among others. In a careful and quiet way, she weaves these areas together to explore why these &quot;mascots&quot; are so demeaning to us all."},{"Title":"Dancing at Halftime: Sports and the Controversy over American Indian Mascots","review":"During my high school unit on Native American history and culture last fall, I used the Illiniwek issue to show my students the subtleties of racism.

We also refuse to acknowledge the issues present day Native Americans face because then we would have to face up to the crimes of our founders.

As a result, it seemed ominously fitting that this legendary Cash LP was made in the turbulent year of 1968, in a maximum security prison no less, only to become one of the years best selling albums. If any year could be perfectly represented by one piece of recorded music, it was 1968's JOHNNY CASH AT FOLSOM PRISON. The author explains exactly how Cash (who was denied the chance to record a live prison LP years earlier) and Columbia Records went about planning this album, how it was recorded by producer Bob Johnson, how it was carefully edited & released, and what the publics reaction was. Yet, page after page, Streissguth, brings the little known story of the recording and the history of the event together like a beautifully made documentary. Most of all this book strengthens the powerful message and experience of AT FOLSOM PRISON and gives the recording a new found dimension that enables it to still be considered one of greatest \\"live\\" album events in popular music history. RECOMMENDED!"},{"Title":"Johnny Cash At Folsom Prison: The Making Of A Masterpiece","review":"This short book, probably less than 100 pages if you take out pictures and account for unused page space, is the recounting of Johnny Cash's 1968 recording of \\"Johnny Cash At Folsom Prison,\\" the album that catapulted Cash into superstardom and highlighted for a generation the misery of prisoners life behind bars. Streissguth does an excellent job of telling about the concert and giving the back-story behinds the original idea, as well as why it ended up as an iconic album.One would do well to learn about this instant in the long career of Cash and how it changed him and America. I highly recommend this book for a quick afternoon read."},{"Title":"Johnny Cash At Folsom Prison: The Making Of A Masterpiece","review":"In 1969 Cash performed at Folsom Prison in California and produced a title album Johnny Cash at Folsom Prison which as to make him a superstar in the country world. Michael Streissguth's Johnny Cash At Folsom Prison: The Making Of A Masterpiece is no ordinary biography of Cash, which has been done before: it's a survey of that performance, what led to it, and what came out of it, richly enhanced by the author's access to Folsom Prison and Columbia Record archives and illustrated with over 100 rare photos. A 'must' for Cash fans."},{"Title":"Johnny Cash At Folsom Prison: The Making Of A Masterpiece","review":"I'm disappointed more often than not at the rock bios that flood the market when a performer dies. Not only are they inaccurate and full of rumor, but they often spend too much time dwelling on mundane childhood details (\\"...then, at age 6, he moved to grandma's house...\\").This book rises to the occasion and gives us an in-depth look at the events leading up to and including the day that Johnny Cash took his band of musicians (including Carl Perkins and the Statler Brothers) to Folsom Prison for a morning concert to be recorded for an LP. The author successfully traces the seeds of Cash's care for the prisoners, not sidestepping the obvious marketing advantages to his outlaw status.At Folsom Prison is extremely well-researched and Streissguth obviously has a background in country music. For casual fans of the music of the 60's this is a great primer, but for those of us who've listened to the album again and again this is the definitive companion to the recordings. [Note: If there's anything disappointing about the book it's that there isn't more of it. Since it's heavy with admittedly amazing photographs from that day it's pretty short. You'll read it in one sitting.]"},{"Title":"Johnny Cash At Folsom Prison: The Making Of A Masterpiece","review":"When I saw this book on the shelves, I grabbed it. As the title states, Johnny Cash at Folsom prison is a masterpiece. Unfortunately, this book is anything but. The story, which really requires no elaboration, is marred by writing which is so excruciatingly bad in places that I found myself wincing. Instead of being able to focus on the story, I was irritated by a neverending series of atrocious similes and metaphors. Open the book at random, and they jump out like fleas. Page 25: \\"Cash glided through the grim lyric [of Folsom Prison Blues] like a harrow through soft, pebbly earth.\\" Next page: \\"[Cash's 1950's recordings] strutted rock and roll style and ached like cracked dry skin, far scalier than the Nashville Sound that was melting over country music...\\" This is unfortunate because the book is, or appears to be, well-researched.

Many, many great pictures that you probably won't find anywhere else!!"},{"Title":"Johnny Cash At Folsom Prison: The Making Of A Masterpiece","review":"For Johnny Cash fans, this book tells the back-story for the making of his Folsom Prison album in 1968, complete with a large selection of photos taken during rehearsals and performance. Cash, Carl Perkins, and the Statler Brothers made up the entire program that day (there were two performances), along with June Carter. An unusual recording for any time in the history of music, \\"Folsom Prison\\" came about almost entirely through the persistent efforts of Cash and his producer Bob Johnston, who fought Columbia Records every step of the way to make the project happen.Author Streissguth's book is written in Rolling Stone style prose, with enthusiasm for the music and the performer and a degree of high drama. His argument is that the album not only helped Cash back onto the charts, after a long fallow period, but made of him a legend. The year being 1968 and the spirit of the times revolutionary, his drawing attention to the men in American prisons converged with the growth of social protest against any form of oppression and the recurrent American fascination with the outlaw.Altogether, the book is long on personality and short on the music itself. We learn the history of Cash's \\"Folsom Prison Blues,\\" largely stolen from another songwriter, and \\"Greystone Chapel,\\" written by a current Folsom inmate, and we are told of how the characteristic style of his back-up musicians evolved in the early years. But beyond this there is little exploration of the songs that make up the album and how they were performed, and very little is disclosed about the creative decisions that went into post-production, though it is revealed that the audience response to \\"I shot a man in Reno\\" was added after the fact. A fine companion piece for the film \\"Walk the Line,\\" the book is definitely for fans, a time capsule for a moment of music history in the late 1960s."},{"Title":"Johnny Cash At Folsom Prison: The Making Of A Masterpiece","review":"\\"Folsom Prison Blues\\" is arguably the greatest live album ever made and this book does an excellent job of showing haw this album came about and why it was so important in the the career of Johnny Cash and Country Music.Nobody had any idea at the time how important this concert and its recording would be when it was conceived ,performed and recorded.Particularly those in the establishment,who had no idea at the time,what lay in store for Cash.In fact,most felt that his future was dim at best.Even Johnny himself,couldn't have had any idea of the future career that was in store for him.He persevered in doing this concert for no other reason than a personal desire to do something for his fellow travellers on this hard road of life.Yes, it was the fans,prisoners and the ordinary people who faced and lived through the trials of life that Cash wrote and sang about ;that saw the greatness and sinceriety that came through Cash's music,and it was they that made him the legend that he came to be and deserved.Through his long and often troubled life;Cash always managed to rise to the occassion and give us his music that was so poignent.He had that great gift of being able to see and feel parts of life,that we all know about,but feel there is little one can do about it.What Cash did so well was to show us that there was always hope. On page 160 we see a picture of Johnny watching June hug Glen Sherley when he arrived in Nashville after being released from prison.You will look for a long time before you will ever see the happiness that Johnny showed for this man who had finally found a good turn in his life.We ware all better for having had Johnny Cash to have seen and bring his music to us and it is likely that we would all have been poorer for it ;if Cash had never done that concert on January 13,1968 in Folsum Prison.Thanks to Michael Streissguth for telling us how it all came about.\\"Till things are brighter,I'm the Man in Black.\\""},{"Title":"Johnny Cash At Folsom Prison: The Making Of A Masterpiece","review":"Hello.......I'm Johnny Cash...the famous words that opened his acts on almost all of his shows. The making of Johnny Cash at Folsom prison is really great reading, I would really recommend this book to everybody, even if you are not a Cash fan"},{"Title":"Johnny Cash At Folsom Prison: The Making Of A Masterpiece","review":"Johnny Cash: at Folsom Prison the Making of a MasterpieceBY: Michael StressguthOn January 13, 1968, Johnny R. Cash stepped on stage at Folsom Prison, California to do a concert that was going to be recorded by Columbia Records. The album Johnny Cash: At Folsom Prison not only became one of the best selling live albums ever, it would launch Cash into superstardom for life. The concert was great because it was meant just for prisoners and Cash sang songs that cheered the prisoners up and he had songs the prisoners could relate to like \\"Folsom Prison Blues\\", \\"Busted\\", \\"I Still Miss Someone\\", \\"25 Minutes to go\\", and \\"Cocaine Blues\\". Before Johnny Cash, no one ever did a performance at a maximum security prison.Cash's struggle that led him to do this concert was a difficult struggle. Johnny Cash was a serious Drug addict who had to quit in order to continue his dream and get the woman he loved (June Carter). It reminds me of the struggle that Ms. Dubose faced in To Kill A Mockingbird. Ms Dubose was a former Morphine addict who also, struggled quitting and coming back off quitting. I liked this book because not only am I huge Johnny Cash fan, but it was just a good read. I didn't like the book because it took to long to get to Johnny Cash's performance. If you wanted to read the book just for Cash, You really don't care about Bob Dylan and other people (unless you are interested in it). But, Overall it was a good book."},{"Title":"Manual of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, 1e","review":"This book is useful in several ways. As a student rotating in PM&R; it is unlikely that you will spend >$100 for a text. Also it is impossible to really read a significant amount of the larger texts out there in the course of a 4 week rotation. the review book allows students to focus their reading and hit the main points. Reading here will allow for greater learning on the unit.The other great use for this text is for board review. The outline style allows for reference while preparing for boards. This text is clearly not intended to become a prumary source for residents, but is extremely useful as a starting point early in residency or as a tool for board review.The layout is simple. The selection of topics for chapters makes it easy to read a chapter or two before starting a rotation or for reading before and after braddom or delisa chapter study.One shortcoming is the lack of EMG and interventional maneuvers covered by this text.

If this handsome face is \\"Robert,\\" he is mentioned here and there and contributes a few lines of intelligent conversation as the twosome travels around Europe. Perhaps his virtue was to silently agree that two souls can befriend and love uncompromised by the flesh.This 30-year diary occupies only about 300 pages, with entries (of substantial length) selected by German publisher and editor Kurt Wolff. Meetings with Andre Gide (1869-1951) figure prominently. Julian passed WWII in the United States and made broadcasts to the French people. After his return to Paris, he had an ever increasing aversion to life that stops short in earthly happiness rather than striving for salvation. The Cold War of the Fifties, the nuclear threat, deepened his concerns. Even so, he applied himself to writing serious novels, his vocation.All the above, though, is overwhelmed by his obsession with The Gospels and his determination to achieve perfect love between him and God, to surpass his concern that each death reinforces the question, What's the use? Entry after entry in the diary re-expresses his personal religious struggles and his erudition in religious texts. You may tire as he rolls stone after stone to block the entrance to his tomb.Green's complete diary spans 70 years, making it the longest in the world. I've had enough. But I do intend to read one of his novels, The Dark Journey (1929)."},{"Title":"I'll Be Seeing You","review":"This is the first book of Margaret Mayhew's that I have read. What a great book!

I loved it and will read more of her books. I can't wait to read another one."},{"Title":"I'll Be Seeing You","review":"Most history fanatics hold specific eras close to their hearts and I am no exception. WWII is one of the periods I can't get enough of. The title reference to Frank Sinatra didn't hurt either. That being the case, I anticipated liking this book a lot more than I did. Perhaps I expected too much going into it but I found Mayhew's work mediocre at best.Juliet, a divorcee with a grown daughter of her own, is rattled by her mother's deathbed admission. Angry and confused she struggles to accept the truth of her paternity and understand the circumstance of her existence. Eventually, curiosity proves too much. Left with only a sketchbook, an unmarked photograph and fragmented memories of her mother's war experiences, Juliet sets out to discover what she can about the man who stole her mother's heart.As the granddaughter of an American solider and an English woman, I feel like a hypocrite for saying I found this story overly romantic and unrealistic. Daisy's story was fine though there wasn't a lot of information regarding her position with WAAF and I never felt the intensity I know exists when your significant other is on the front lines. Howard's story was flat out laughable. The entirety of his twenty plus missions are wrapped into a mere thirty pages, the bulk of which focus on his concealed tenure in a French barn. Boring doesn't do it justice.Juliet's story had a lot of potential. American soldiers fathered more than 37,000 children while overseas, many of whom were never acknowledged. Several organizations exist to aid these individuals but the vast majority have little luck locating their fathers. American privacy laws are difficult to work around but time is biggest obstacle. I think this is why I found Juliet's story so difficult to swallow. She experiences a few hiccups but she completes the puzzle in a matter of months. Mayhew wrapped everything up in a pretty little package that is too improbable to be realistic.I'll Be Seeing you is a sugary novel with little to no action sequences and limited historic detail. Sadly, not my kind of book.

Block, M.D. with Carolyn Bryant BlockAtria Books, 2007 Pages: 221 ISBN-13: 978-1-58270-126-4Reviewed By Christine L. Allison, O.D., F.A.A.O., F.C.O.V.D.Illinois College of Optometry3241 S. Michigan Ave Chicago, IL 60616Come to Your Senses, Demystifying the Mind-Body Connection, 2nd edition by Block is a revised edition of the first publication from 2006. This edition contains a new chapter, which describes ways to implement a 10 day plan to improve the reader's life. In the Preface, the author explains that the book can be read in two ways, either straight through to the last chapter, where they can then implement the recommendations from the book, or by jumping immediately to the last chapter and filling out the life requirements in that chapter as the rest of the book is being read. The approach the reader is to take depends on how quickly they wish to implement the system in their own life. As a reader whose sole purpose was to review this book, I chose to read the book in chapter order to give you a feel for what it is about, but I did not actively participate in any of the exercises that the book recommends, thus I did not use the final chapter in the way that the authors intended.The basic premise is that we all have an Identity System which is composed of self-centered thoughts. The author states that, \\" The human Identity System evolved in order to confirm and deepen the separateness of family, clan, religion, culture, race, nation, and species-i.e., to help us create our individual identity.\\" Thus it was developed to be a useful tool to help human self-interest. The authors feel that the problem arises when the Identity System becomes dominant. When the Identity System becomes overactive, it is postulated to create fear and restrict awareness. It can be disruptive to the \\"harmony and balance of the mind-body connection\\". The Identity System produces requirements or specific thoughts that reinforce your damaged self and can cause tension, fear, and physical stress.In order to shift your awareness from these overactive negative thoughts that your Identity System promotes, the authors recommend a \\"bridging\\" practice. Bridging is just your mind's natural way of expanding consciousness, and is a function to use to get past your worries and stresses. The Identity System has two assistants, the depressor and the fixer. The depressor makes you feel you are not good enough, and the fixer makes you consistently try harder. Both of these assistants fuel the damaged self and cause an imbalance.Throughout the book, the authors promote using bridging exercises consistently throughout the day to rid the self from the Identity System's control. They give many examples of scenarios in which bridging could be used to help with anxiety and stress. They promote labeling your thoughts to enhance the bridging activities and require a lot of mind-body mapping. The authors suggest putting ideas and feelings on to paper in the form of closed circle types of maps. Some of the suggested maps for the reader to design are the mind-body problem map, the \\"Who I Am\\" map, the \\"How I Got to Be the Way I am\\" map, and the \\"My Relationship Requirements for Others\\" map. Each of these maps give the reader a way to find their natural self without being overtaken by their Identity System.While I did not participate in the exercises in this book, they may be useful for someone who is struggling with anxiety and extreme stress in their day to day lives. This may be appropriate for us to recommend for certain patients that are dealing with these types of issues. On the whole, though, this is not a book that I would recommend to be on every optometrist's shelf. There is a lot of terminology in this book that I feel would be a bit overwhelming for some readers, but the plans to follow in the final chapter are simple and easy to follow. It is a way for the reader to explore their own nature and heal their mind-body connection; however there are many other methods that may cause this to happen as well.Optometry & Vision Development Editor's Note:This book review is re-printed here with the permission of the editor of Optometry & Vision Development, the official journal of the College of Optometrists in Vision Development.

But a lot do. Most readers know this tragic personnage who allied himself with the devil and finally paid the price for his betrayal of God from a famous play written by J.W. Goethe. It was him who wrote the most famous version of Faust's history. (If you want to know more about Goethe's work, please visit my reviewer page.) But he wasn't the only dramatist who considered this lost magician worth a tragedy. Exactly 2 centuries and 1 year before Goethe published his work, a play by the Englishman Christopher Marlowe saw the light of the world.Marlowe and Goethe are different personalities living in completely different times so that it's no wonder their plays vary in character. Goethe lived in prosperity and had all his life to think about subjects like human nature, social relationships, history and its influence on the present, love, religion and much more. He was a philosoph, and that's the reason why Goethe's &quot;Faust&quot; is sometimes difficult to understand because you have to dive under the surface of things to understand their true nature. Marlowe's work is different: This man was certainly very intelligent and knew a lot about the forces that moved the world, but, unlike Goethe, he didn't have a lifetime to think about one single play. You can imagine that Marlowe's &quot;Faust&quot; became more shallow, but still not shallow enough to be ignored by this imaginary institution we call World Literature. As a compensation, Marlowe's work contains more life and action in it, something I can't say about Goethe's. Both men were geniuses. In this review, I'd like to pay my tribute to the Englishman.As stated above, the play tells the story of a medieval scientist who allies himself with the devil. The latter promises to serve the first in this world, whereas Faust must do the same in hell. The poor doctor doubts his choices because it's his soul being sold, still he follows the devil and has the time of his life. I beg your pardon, for I feel the need to return to Goethe to show you another important difference between both versions: Whereas Marlowe's Faust wants the devil to provide him with fun and all richness of the world (materialism), Goethe's alter ego feels the importance to be educated by the devil to get a complete picture of the world. At the end, Marlowe's Faust realizes that all experiences weren't worth his soul. He begs God to save him, but it is no longer possible. The devil tears his body apart and takes his soul with him to infinite sufferings.The effect this play had on me was tremedous. Fascinated, I watched Faust's development. I particularly liked the 5th act where he realizes that all is finally lost. You can really feel his pain in those scenes; the effect is unbelievable.So, if you want to be touched by human tragedy, I really advise you to read this book. It's done very quickly, so you needn't worry about the time it takes. If you want to make a step further and find additional material on Faust, read Goethe's &quot;Faust 1&quot; as well as Thomas Mann's &quot;Doctor Faustus&quot;. It's a marvelous novel and the most modern narration based on the medieval German scientist named Johann(es) Faust(us)."},{"Title":"The Tragedy of Doctor Faustus [Mass Market Paperback] by Marlowe, Christopher","review":"In the Faust legend, a man by the name of Faust or Faustus sells his soul to the devil for twenty-four years of worldly power. This legend has been told many times over by such writers as Goethe and Mann, but no doubt the most famous retelling, and probably the best, is the play, Doctor Faustus by Christopher Marlowe.The most prominent influence on Marlowe's version of the Faust legend was the social upheaval during the time period in which it was written. Doctor Faustus was probably first performed in 1594, a time of tremendous change in Europe. The Medieval times were over and the Renaissance was beginning, however, influences of both times can be found in the play. Doctor Faustus is a transitional play where beliefs from both time periods intermingle, sometimes with disastrous results.Doctor Faustus, himself, is a man torn between two traditions. He is a man with medieval beliefs, but renaissance aspirations. When he first attempts to conjure Mephistopheles, Faustus believe that Mephistopheles was forced to come by his (Faustus's) words. In response, Mephistopheles says, &quot;for when we hear one rack the name of God, abjure the Scriptures and his savior Christ, we fly in hope to get his glorious soul.&quot; Mephistopheles has, of course, come of his own accord, because he feels that there is a soul to be had. He states this blatantly, yet Faustus is clouded by his old beliefs and also by his desires.From a medieval point of view, Doctor Faustus can be looked upon as a morality play; a play about one man who aspires beyond his God-given place in the world. On the other hand, from a renaissance perspective, this play is a tragedy. The Renaissance was a time of individuality unlike the Middle Ages where a man was trapped in whatever social class into which he was born. Faustus is &quot;an essentially good man&quot; by Renaissance ideals who believes he has reached the end of human knowledge and is thus justified is using the black arts to further his knowledge. As in most classical tragedies, his downfall is complete and is due to his pride.After Faustus makes his deal with Lucifer, the question must be asked: Is there any way back for him? Faustus believes he is damned at the moment that he signs his name in blood, although he has many chances to repent during the course of the play. The first chance comes after his first conjuring. He says, &quot;O something soundeth in mine ear, 'Abjure this magic, turn to God.' Aye, and Faustus will turn to God again. To God? He loves thee not.&quot; Something is pleading for Faustus to repent, but Faustus remains firm in believing God has already condemned him. Each time the Good Angel appears is yet another chance for Faustus to repent, but the Evil Angel continues to threaten him if he even thinks about repenting. If it were not possible for Faustus to save his soul, then the Evil Angel and his demons would have simply left Faustus alone to cry out in anguish to God.The final indicator that Faustus could have been saved at any point over his twenty-four year bargain is given by Mephistopheles, himself, as Faustus's fate is sealed beyond irrevocability.Christopher Marlowe's brilliant retelling of the Faust legend springs not only from his own creativity, but from the times in which he lived. Marlowe's life and times allowed him to create the greatest retelling of one of Western cultures more timeless stories. When put to words, the legend seems so simple, yet its possibilities and implications, as Marlowe proves, can be nothing less than monumental."},{"Title":"The Tragedy of Doctor Faustus [Mass Market Paperback] by Marlowe, Christopher","review":"I do not feel Marlowe's &quot;Faustus&quot; is quite as good as his &quot;Massacre at Paris&quot; or &quot;Edward II,&quot; but I still consider it an outstanding play. &quot;Faustus&quot; is very true to life in that many people can not stay behind the 'this far and no further point.' The opening is quite chilling as Faustus decides that the legitimate knowledge of this world is not good enough and he immediately decides to cross into forbidden territory even at the expense of his soul. To this day, I never have forgotten the chills I felt in 2.1 when Faustus signs the unholy contract. It is interesting that even after Faustus signs the contract, that he is presented with several oppurtunities to escape his fate: &quot;Faustus, repent; yet God will pity thee&quot; (2.2.12). But he can not give up the fruits of the contract. (His powers, having Mephostophilis at his command, etc.) After the chilling tension of the first 2 acts, Marlowe releases the tension for the next two acts by having Faustus perform several practical jokes (of an evil nature to be sure), but nevertheless it offers a release of tension while at the same time we can see how malignant Faustus has become. I once read that many people feel the 3rd and 4th act are way too silly and that they drag the play down. But I don't think this is the case at all. I can not help but think Marlowe was trying to point out that in all honesty, there was a worthless aspect of the fruits Faustus sold his soul for. Furthermore, Acts 3 and 4 help us to see the mentally disturbed side of Christopher Marlowe himself. In 5.1, Faustus has 1 final chance to avoid his fate, but he resolves himself to damnation after enjoying Helen of Troy. If I were a betting man I would be willing to wage that Marlowe is pointing out that sex is an ultimate driving force. To this day, I have never been able to forget the final soliloquy of despair in 5.2 followed by the demons carrying Faustus off to hell. Marlowe himself dedicated much of his life to blasphemy, and I can not help but feel he was coming to terms with the church and starting to realize he better cut it out or else. Not only is this an excellent play, but it also helps us to take a look at Marlowe himself."},{"Title":"The Tragedy of Doctor Faustus [Mass Market Paperback] by Marlowe, Christopher","review":"Christopher Marlowe is awsone. What other Renaissance writer was a freakin' spy? I mean, I like Shakespeare's plays and all, but as a person he's boring unless he's being played by Joseph Fiennes. I often pit two historical figures against one another in my mind, and I wonder what would happen if these two fought. If Shakespeare and Marlowe fought, Marlowe would bust out his super secret digital watch-that's secretly a laser-and he'd slice Shakespeare in half. Maybe \`Speare would have a deadly quill like the Joker had in Batman, but a deadly quill versus a laser? I think we know who would win. I know the digital watch/laser is a bit silly because they didn't have digital watches back then, but at the very least he'd have an hourglass with a secret laser.Reading Dr. Faustus I realize what a shame it is Marlowe died so early. Marlowe's ability to combine drama and comedy was light years ahead of Shakespeare's. It wasn't until the second half of Shakespeare's career that he started writing dark comedies, but Marlowe was interjecting his humor with a dark twist right away with plays like Dr. Faustus and The Jew of Malta. If Marlowe hadn't dies so early (in a fight over who was going to pay the bill no less-freakin' cool!) then maybe there would have been two playwriting giants in London competing against one another. Just imagine the masterpieces that would have ensued. I bet they would have made King Lear look like A Comedy of Errors.This is the second time I've read Dr. Faustus, and I had forgotten how anti-Catholic it is. The story takes place mostly in Wittenberg, Germany where Martin Luther wrote his famous 95 theses. The location already sets up the tenuous relationship between Protestants and Catholics. This relationship, obviously biased against Catholics, is further represented in the good angel and bad angel that appear to Dr. Faustus several times. The good angel repeats over and over to Dr. Faustus that he can repent at any time and come back into good graces, while the bad angel keeps on telling him it's too late. The obvious analogy is that the good angel represents the Protestant idea of justification by faith. Not surprisingly, one of the groups of people who Marlowe is rumored to have spied on were Catholics intent on overthrowing what they saw as England's Protestant government. Furthermore, the first thing Dr. Faustus does when he makes his famous bargain is to play a practical joke on the Pope.Please, if you're Catholic don't let this turn you away from reading this beautifully written play. At times the mixture of slapstick comedy and high brow allusions are a bit uneven, but that was the nature of the beast back then. Marlowe had to play to the peasants as well as royalty.The trick Marlowe plays on the audience is even greater than the trick played on Faustus. Marlowe actually gets us to care about Faustus by the end of the play. This is either a trick to show us how close every one of us is to making a Faustian bargain, or it's a trick to show us how unfair these religious traditions were. After all, what did Faustus do that was so wrong? He goes into the deal with plans for making himself a despot, and ends up using all of his power to fetch grapes for debutants and summon Helen of Troy so that others may see her beauty. (Dr. Faustus has \\"phenominal cosmic power,\\" and all he can manage is playing a few practical jokes and impressing people with out of season fruits.) He's never punished for his bad acts, but rather because of who he pledged his allegiance to. Over the course of twenty-four years Faustus has actually become a somewhat better person if only because he recognizes his sins. His greatest crimes are nothing more than playing practical jokes on peasants. He's not perfect, but he's also not deserving of eternal damnation.I see Dr. Faustus as a critique of religion. Others may find that it only reinforces their beliefs, and that's what makes the text so good. The Faustian bargain finds its way into literature time and again, but it means something different to each author; likewise, Dr. Faustus means something different to each reader."},{"Title":"The Tragedy of Doctor Faustus [Mass Market Paperback] by Marlowe, Christopher","review":"\\"Dr. Faustus,\\" the play by 16th century writer Christopher Marlowe, has been published as part of the Dover Thrift Edition series. The brief introduction to this version notes that the play was first published in 1604, and also discusses its relationship to a German text from 1587 known as the \\"Faustbuch.\\" In his play Marlowe tells the story of the title character, a scholar who is \\"swollen with cunning.\\" Faust dabbles in the dark arts of \\"magicians / And necromantic books,\\" and literally makes a deal with the devil. These actions drive the tragedy forward.This play is a curious mixture of Christian theology, tragedy, slapstick comedy, and colorful pageantry. It moves along fast, and contains some really beautiful and stately language.\\"Dr. Faustus\\" is ultimately a cautionary tale about human pride and ambition. I must admit that in the end I find it less satisfying than some of the other great tragedies of the Elizabethan era, perhaps because this play relies less on universal human issues than on a culturally-bound theological contrivance. Still, it's a noteworthy play that, I believe, still holds relevance for contemporary audiences. ..."},{"Title":"The Tragedy of Doctor Faustus [Mass Market Paperback] by Marlowe, Christopher","review":"At age 29 Christopher Marlowe was apparently stabbed and killed in an argument over a tavern bill. In his short life he left a remarkable legacy of four great plays and exerted considerable influence on another young playwright, William Shakespeare. The Tragicall History of Dr. Faustus, or simply Dr. Faustus, is the story of a brilliant scholar whose thirst for knowledge and power leads him to trade his soul to Lucifer.As we first encounter Faustus, he is systematically dismissing further study of Aristotlean logic, Galen's teachings on medicine, Justinian's works on law, and the study of divinity; Faustus is already the acknowledged master of these subjects. Only the study of necromancy can offer him greater profit, delight, and power. Faustus through incantations summons Mephistophilis, servant of Lucifer, to negotiate a trade for his soul. Mephistophilis urges Faustus to reconsider, but Faustus is adamant: \\"Had I had as many souls as there be stars, I'd give them all for Mephistophilis.\\" Faustus recklessly forges his agreement with Lucifer, his body and soul to be forfeit after 24 years of service from Mephistophilis.Again and again Faustus calls upon Mephistophilis for delights and power and hidden knowledge. Mephistophilis obliges, and Faustus increasingly distances himself from God. Occasionally Faustus has misgivings and considers repentance, but fails to act, due partly to persuasion and threats from Mephistophilis - if thou repents, devils shall tear thee in pieces.The intensity builds as Faustus repeatedly rejects God's offer of mercy and forgiveness, and we are never quite certain whether he will repent or not. Marlowe occasionally lowers the growing intensity by interspersing brief episodes of humor with tragedy, a convention quite familiar to Elizabethan audiences. I leave the ending as a surprise.Christopher Marlowe's other works include his two part drama Tamburlane the Great, The Troublesome Reign and Lamentable Death of Edward II, King of England, and The Famous Tragedy of the Rich Jew of Malta.I recently read Doctor Faustus, edited by Michael Keefer and published by Broadview Press (ISBN 0-921149-59-X). The detailed introduction, comparisons between the 1604 and 1616 versions, and source material make it a good choice for English literature majors.The Dover edition is another good choice as it is quite inexpensive, but it offers only sparse footnotes."},{"Title":"The Tragedy of Doctor Faustus [Mass Market Paperback] by Marlowe, Christopher","review":"I once read that &quot;Dr Faustus&quot; by Christopher Marlowe was a prime example of pre-Gothic horror, and I can put my name to that. The play has aspects of suspense, morality and tragedy, all couched in wondrous language. In its bare tragic tone, I think this story is the best one ever retelling the life of Faust. The &quot;hero's&quot; final mad soliloquy before being taken by the fiends is certainly among the strongest poetry I've read. I enjoyed it immensely, since it shook me to the depths of my soul. There is plenty of broad humour in the middle which kind of breaks the plot, but without it the tension might have been unbearable. If I could only write like this!"},{"Title":"The Tragedy of Doctor Faustus [Mass Market Paperback] by Marlowe, Christopher","review":"I, like many English majors, was assigned this play for my English Lit I class thinking it would be more of an exercise than anything else. I was pleasantly taken off guard. I was surprised about how well I could relate to or at least empathize with the character of Faustus, in a play written hundreds of years ago.Marlowe has a great sense of style in his writing which was ahead of his time, rivialing Shakespeare historically though slightly predating him. He shows a great sense conflict and tension throughout the plot and characters who are very much architypical of the human condition; the quest for forbidden fruit, dealing with own's own need to conquer, lust for greed, exhibiting vanity (the other of the seven deadly sins make appearances) and so on. There is a religious undertone to the play which is easy enough to follow without having much knowledge of Christianity, this play is easy to enjoy without considering much of the religious dogma which was inserted as a guide for the audience of the time.Perhaps what is most interesting about the play is Marlowe's use of black humor as the reader will find that there is much comic relief spread throughout the play (mostly through other characters mocking Faustus in ways unbeknowst to him, and you yourself may be laughing alongside of them.) Marlowe's style could arguably be seen as a significant influence on Monty Python and other British comedies going back as far as Shakespeare. The play is very much in the vein of what we might consider modern day 'British humor'; dark, often bleak, obsurd, hysterical.Dr. Faustus doesn't take long to read, is highly entertaining, and you may even get something extra from it by examing your own moral tendencies. Without a doubt the best piece of literature I've read last semester."},{"Title":"The Tragedy of Doctor Faustus [Mass Market Paperback] by Marlowe, Christopher","review":"If you saw \\"Shakespeare In Love,\\" you know this was the play of Marlowe's that was getting so much attention. (For that matter, I found this play better than \\"Romeo and Juliet,\\" even though \\"Romeo and Juliet\\" was to become the big play at the climactic moment.) Moving on, we meet Dr. Faustus, and he decides that the legitimate knowledge of this world is not good enough. So, he decides to cross the line of 'this far and no further' by making an unholy deal. It is interesting that even Mephistophilis (the unholy agent of the devil) is drawn as a figure of sorrow and even tries to warn Faustus about what he is getting himself into. But Faustus is unreceptive to the truth and ignores Mephistophilis's warning. In a scene of shocking horror, Faustus even mocks Mephistophilis for trying to warn him of the dangers involved: \\"Learn thou of Faustus manly fortitude\\" (1.3.85). Faustus makes an unholy pact and sells his soul for books that will offer knowledge beyond the point of 'this far and no further,' as well as significant magical powers. It is interesting that even after Faustus makes the pact, he is presented with several opportunities to escape his fate. But he can not give up the fruits of the pact. (His powers, having Mephistophilis at his command, etc.) Later, we see meet the 7 deadly sins. And Faustus's delight at them shows us his degeneration. In the 3rd and 4th acts, Faustus seems to let go of his quest for knowledge (for the most part) and indulges in practical jokes of an evil nature. There are some who feel that the 3rd and 4th acts are way too silly and that they drag the play down. But, I don't think this is the case at all. I can not help but think that Marlowe was emphasizing how worthless the fruits of the pact really were. (Nothing we could ask the devil for could equal the soul which Christ gave us.) Furthermore, in my opinion, we shouldn't be so surprised at Faustus's degeneration. He has made a pact with evil, and evil is basically degeneration through the service of one's self, depite how amoral and sick that service may be. It is our good side that encourages us to better ourselves, hopefully at least in part for the sake of others. The 5th act begins, and Faustus has one final chance to avoid his fate, but he resigns himself to damnation if he can 'enjoy' Helen of Troy. If I were a betting man, I would bet that Marlowe is emphasizing that sex often overrides our rational thoughts. (How many romance plays seem to defy reason?) The final scene where Faustus realizes that it is too late and hell awaits, is a scene of pure terror almost unparalled in literature. He moves from requests that can not be granted to the most imaginative escapes. The play ends with an appropriate warning to stay behind the line of 'this far and no further.'"},{"Title":"The Tragedy of Doctor Faustus [Mass Market Paperback] by Marlowe, Christopher","review":"This is a more than adequate text for exploring Marlowe's Text A, with the Text B portions in the back and a fairly thorough introduction."},{"Title":"The Tragedy of Doctor Faustus [Mass Market Paperback] by Marlowe, Christopher","review":"The story of the infamous Dr. Faustus shows depth on many levels.

Prodded and guided by Mephostiphiles, servant to Lucifer, Faustus explores aspects of nature and society that the common man only dreams about.

I would recommend it to all."},{"Title":"The Tragedy of Doctor Faustus [Mass Market Paperback] by Marlowe, Christopher","review":"Plot:Doctor Faustus tells the story of a medieval scientist who in search for power and riches relinquishes science for necromancy and thus allies himself with Lucifer. Lucifer promises that his sergeant Mephistophilis will serve the Faustus in this world for twenty four years in exchange for the latter's body and soul. Faust spends his time asking the devil to provide him with materialistic riches and pleasures. At the end, He realizes that all experiences weren't worth his soul. He begs for salvation, but it is no longer possible as he has signed a blood contract with the devil and God must be just.Three topics are worth considering while reading this play:Motivation for Faustus's character: Most people have wanted something so badly that, in moments of desperation, they imagined they would do anything to have it. Most learn to balance their desires with reality while a few people act on those desperate imaginings. Doctor Faustus decides to sell his soul to the devil in exchange for twenty-four years of absolute power.Damnation of Faustus's character: The problem with Marlowe's play is that his characters are static. The frivolous ways Faustus uses his powers supports this position, suggesting that he learns or changes little as the narrative action progresses. The only change in the whole play is at the end when Faustus asks God for salvation after he realizes the error of his ways. Therefore, I believe that damnation happens from the first realization that he wants to switch from science to necromancy and all through to the end of the play.Where is the Middle: It is hard to define a climax or middle for this play! If there is a climax then it is at the opening scene or the final one! It is an issue worth further analysis.Other characters:Lucifer is a passive character and is only seen as accepting Faustus's offer. He tried to stick to his end of the deal and expects the same out of the doctor. He is in no way seen as being an evil character.Mephistophilis is seen as an obedient and reflective character, always trying to serve and advise the doctor and necessary. One of his most interesting moments is when he says that Hell is not a place but a state of being.God is in conflict with his divine nature as he is forgiving and just. While Faustus asks for forgiveness at the end Lucifer asks for justice and that God holds Faustus to his end of the deal."},{"Title":"The Tragedy of Doctor Faustus [Mass Market Paperback] by Marlowe, Christopher","review":"This book appeals to me greatly , not only it has left me with many questions to think about ..it has certainly thought me more about the writings of a moralilty play.It has been a book worthwhile reading and a great literature text as well.i will definitely recommend it to all and i can bet with u that once u start ,u can never put it down!"},{"Title":"The Tragedy of Doctor Faustus [Mass Market Paperback] by Marlowe, Christopher","review":"The book quality is very good, but the delivery process is kinda slow.

Whereas the majority of readers are interested in the play for its basic themes of religion and the juxtaposing of the Medieval/Renaissance worlds, or for its value for the theatre, mine was specifically for *why* Faustus sold his soul to Mephostophilis, and what great feats of necromancy were performed.Why was I interested in that? Certainly not because I have aspirations of being a Necromancer. That would be ridiculous. My interest was for research for a book that I'm working on, where a group of people engage in acts of magic that would be classified as necromantic.So I was initially disappointed when I discovered that there was no necromancy here - nay, there is \\"nigromancy\\", which strictly defined means \\"black magic\\". That black magic is, of course, the summoning of Mephostophilis.As I read further, however, I found that it contained exactly what I was looking for, and that the characters in the book I'm working on were surprisingly Faustian. The parallels were quite encouraging, and I took more from the work than I originally thought I would.

To continue musical metaphors he didn't invent but merely sampled the Faustus tale and in so doing gave it his own unique spin.Though the version we have was not recorded until about a decade after Marlowe's death (and therefore shows signs of later adulterations by other writers) you can still observe the genuis of Marlowe at work. By likening his character to the Greek methological story of Dedalus, Marlowe imparts that sense of doom so connected with the potential arrogance of human ambition. As a reminder, Dedalus was affixed wings with wax by his father Icarus only to lose them and fall when Dedalus flew too high and had them melted by the light of the sun.Similarly Faustus is -- in almost Christmas Carol type fashion -- visited by the personified seven deadly sins and Lucifer himself...itself then a unique device uniquely and effectively executed.Throughout Marlowe makes us witness to Faustus' growing sense of doom at the irrevocability of his contract with Lucifer.Sadly, to the modern reader much of the horror of his Faustian bargain is lost to us. For the most part, we moderns don't have the immediate fear of Lucifer that our forebears had. For us today, evil does not lurk in the shadows but is rather all too much before us as we proceed through our days and take note of current events.Still the same the play was a landmark piece and an inspiration to Shakespeare who had before him an example of the genuis he had to compete with and the standard he had to maintain."},{"Title":"The Tragedy of Doctor Faustus [Mass Market Paperback] by Marlowe, Christopher","review":"Tells the tale of the unfortunate Doctor John Faustus - who in return for 24 years of fame and fortune sells his soul to Lucifer.

There are so many great lines in this play! The greatness of Marlowe was recognised in his own time (a gentle modern reminder of this came in the film 'Shakespeare in Love', when almost every actor auditioning chose a bit from Marlowe, and all of those defaulted to this play).It is somewhat ironic that if Shakespeare and Marlowe were writing today, they should most like be charged with plagiarism and copyright infringement; 'The Tragedy of Doctor Faustus' is likewise not an entirely original construct of Marlowe's, but rather derives from an anonymously penned German poem translated into English shortly before Marlowe recast it for his play. The German poet Goethe was influenced by the same anonymous source, and perhaps knew of Marlowe's play during his writing.Dr. Faustus may have been based on a brilliant professor in Germany a generation or two prior to Marlowe. In any event, the idea of the seduction of the power of knowledge was (and continues to be) inspiring. The idea of selling one's soul to get the object of one's desire is also not a unique concept. Knowledge in the ancient world often always involved the spiritual realm, which had both its light and dark sides (one has but to think of the Star Wars saga to see how such concepts remain firmly rooted in our own time). Faustus becomes a conjurer, and strikes a deal with Lucifer to maintain power and knowledge in return for his soul after 24 years.Despite the temptations to repent, Faustus in Marlowe's text never manages to break free of the temptations. 'My heart's so hardened I cannot repent. / Scare can I name salvation, faith, or heaven, / But fearful echoes thunder in mine ears: / \\"Faustus, thou art damned.\\" ' Even recognising this, in the span of this one monologue, Faustus talks himself out of despair with the temptations of knowledge and secret power. Unfortunately for Faustus, he spends so much of his time and power doing ultimately useless tricks that he ends up in a worthless position despite his deal, and pays the ultimate price for his deal with the devil.This edition contains a very interesting essay, including a biographical sketch of Marlowe (who died at the very young age of 29, having already become a leading light in Elizabethan drama), and a survey of his plays and playwriting techniques, influences, and subsequent influence on others. One story bears repeating, dealing with the performance history of the play: 'A legend developed that during a performance in Exeter, in one scene in which Faustus called up devils, the actors counted one more devil than the scene called for and realised that Satan himself was in the their midst. In terror, they stopped the play; the audience bolted from the playing place; and the actors quitted the town the next morning.' Such was the power of Marlowe's rendering, that his language was thought to have magical conjuring power.This edition is a good one, put together by Louis B. Wright and Virginia A. LaMar, with generous notes and modernised spellings for ease of reading. The play of Dr. Faustus by Marlowe had two editions printed from early days, one dated 1604 and an expanded one from 1616. This one is rather good keeping the conflict between the two to a minimum for ease of reading - this not for those looking for a point-by-point comparison or analysis of the two.The Folger Library editions are designed with students in mind, and as such, this book is a very accessible introduction to this very important play."},{"Title":"The Tragedy of Doctor Faustus [Mass Market Paperback] by Marlowe, Christopher","review":"I've been studying this play for English, that's why I read it.

Admittedly, when reading the play, some of the comic scenes come across as rather annoying - they really need to be seen on a stage - but it doesn't harm the book to any great degree. I would have appreciated less comedy, but I still recommend this play."},{"Title":"The Tragedy of Doctor Faustus [Mass Market Paperback] by Marlowe, Christopher","review":"Well i just started reading the &quot;damn&quot; book and I can understand why some people would not like it. I belive Mr.Mrlowe crosses lots of bridges in where words and actions overcomes one's mind, trying to forget that you are reading the name lucifer repeatedly. It is important to remember that is just a book, a well written one by the way. I am fascinated by the way he prepares you for whats coming, the small battle with the good and bad Angels its the begining of an ambitious and evil portrayal. I think that the main character is evil but somehow heroic, by the way he wants the power to defeat his foes nad defend his friends, but that is just a point of view. I am sure i will keep enjoing it untill the end, where i will come back with more and final thoughts.Joshua P."},{"Title":"The Tragedy of Doctor Faustus [Mass Market Paperback] by Marlowe, Christopher","review":"This book is NOT a rendition of Goethe's Faust, as one reviewer mentioned. Marlowe wrote the original version (Doctor Faustus), and Goethe rewrote it with his own ideas of forgiveness in Faust. Both versions should be read, as they are often quite different in plot and, espeically, conclusion. Almost competely different stories, both are worth reading for their theological and spiritual value. Doctor Faustus is a quick and easy read, but filled with great stuff! A must read for anyone who appreciates classical literature."},{"Title":"The Tragedy of Doctor Faustus [Mass Market Paperback] by Marlowe, Christopher","review":"The story of Dr. Faustus is that of a supremely educated man seeking still more knowledge. The only way he sees to get what he desires is to make a deal with the devil. He signs his soul away for 24 years of service of one of Lucifer's servants, Mephistopholes. He thinks of repenting and there are friends and angels who try to persuade him, but he continues on his course for the full 24 years.This is a well written play and it is a bit creepy to put yourself in the position of Faustus and imagine selling your soul to the devil. My dissatisfaction comes from what I see as a weak motivation from Faustus and a thinness at the plotpoint of Faustus wrestling with what he's done. There wasn't as much of an internal struggle shown as I expected. For a play that has held up for 400 years I was expecting a little more depth."},{"Title":"The Tragedy of Doctor Faustus [Mass Market Paperback] by Marlowe, Christopher","review":"'Was this the face that launched a thousand ships...' There are so many great lines in this play! The greatness of Marlowe was recognised in his own time (a gentle modern reminder of this came in the film 'Shakespeare in Love', when almost every actor auditioning chose a bit from Marlowe, and all of those defaulted to this play).It is somewhat ironic that if Shakespeare and Marlowe were writing today, they should most like be charged with plagiarism and copyright infringement; 'The Tragedy of Doctor Faustus' is likewise not an entirely original construct of Marlowe's, but rather derives from an anonymously penned German poem translated into English shortly before Marlowe recast it for his play. The German poet Goethe was influenced by the same anonymous source, and perhaps knew of Marlowe's play during his writing.Dr. Faustus may have been based on a brilliant professor in Germany a generation or two prior to Marlowe. In any event, the idea of the seduction of the power of knowledge was (and continues to be) inspiring. The idea of selling one's soul to get the object of one's desire is also not a unique concept. Knowledge in the ancient world often always involved the spiritual realm, which had both its light and dark sides (one has but to think of the Star Wars saga to see how such concepts remain firmly rooted in our own time). Faustus becomes a conjurer, and strikes a deal with Lucifer to maintain power and knowledge in return for his soul after 24 years.Despite the temptations to repent, Faustus in Marlowe's text never manages to break free of the temptations. 'My heart's so hardened I cannot repent. / Scare can I name salvation, faith, or heaven, / But fearful echoes thunder in mine ears: / \\"Faustus, thou art damned.\\" ' Even recognising this, in the span of this one monologue, Faustus talks himself out of despair with the temptations of knowledge and secret power. Unfortunately for Faustus, he spends so much of his time and power doing ultimately useless tricks that he ends up in a worthless position despite his deal, and pays the ultimate price for his deal with the devil.Marlowe had great appeal to the play-going audience of his day, and his words were considered very powerful art, indeed. One story bears repeating, dealing with the performance history of the play: 'A legend developed that during a performance in Exeter, in one scene in which Faustus called up devils, the actors counted one more devil than the scene called for and realised that Satan himself was in the their midst. In terror, they stopped the play; the audience bolted from the playing place; and the actors quitted the town the next morning.' Such was the power of Marlowe's rendering, that his language was thought to have magical conjuring power.This edition is designed both for students as well as for those who might want to do the play in performance for classes. The spelling is modernised and edited for ease of reading. There are generous notes for the changes in the text versions (there was a publication of this text in 1604 and again in 1616 with changes and revisions). This text also includes many stage-direction and theatrical notes to give a good sense of how the play is performed. It includes many photographs of productions along the way. In addition to all of these features, editor Sylvan Barnet provides an introduction to the play which includes biographical details about Marlowe as well as more details about the background of the play.Don't let the devil fool you - this is a good text."},{"Title":"The Tragedy of Doctor Faustus [Mass Market Paperback] by Marlowe, Christopher","review":"I had not been introduced to Marlowe's work (or, indeed, heard of the legendary playwright at all) until after taking the mammoth decision to start an Open University module. This was a Level 1 module for 60 credits; AA100 \`The Arts Past and Present'. During the second week, we had the task of reading the play from this suggested A-Text version, alongside an audio track provided by the university. Having not studied for the past 4-5 years, I found the play initially hard to go by. But, of course, this is expected for a higher education student who has been away from academia for quite some time. My fellow students and I found this text to be a surprising read, and, reading from the perspective of an observer of the production, rather than the reader of a novel (or stage-play) helped to put the play into context.Having not studied much Shakespearean literature, I found \`Doctor Faustus' the perfect play to be introduced into the discipline of Renaissance English Literature, with its vastly complex and visionary characterisation. The character of Faustus, for me, is a living representation of the dangers pertaining to seeking knowledge beyond one's physical (and spiritual) capabilities. The Christian message is embedded throughout the play, as was suitably the norm during Marlowe's lifetime, of repentance, forgiveness and God's ultimate will.The Pearson Longman edition is especially useful for the Open University student, as this is indeed the first set book for the aforementioned module for the humanities. It provides extensive details on the text and footnotes detailing the many idioms and contemporary translations of early-modern English. There are also many more sections on the life of Christopher Marlowe and his contemporaries, as well as notes on the period and life for the common Englishman during the Renaissance. There are some shocking revelations about his life and, ultimately, his death.I am so glad that the Open University introduced me to this wonderful stage-play and its amazingly complex themes, but, most importantly, its writer. Now I am continuing on with Level 2 studies and have come across the likes of Charles Dickens et al, but Doctor Faustus will forever hold a special place in my literary heart. Additionally, not to miss is the film translation made famous by Elizabeth Taylor, the \`Stage on Screen' DVD of the play recorded at London's Greenwich Theatre, and the upcoming Opus Arte production starring Arthur Darvill (Rory Williams from the BBC's \`Doctor Who' television series)."},{"Title":"The Tragedy of Doctor Faustus [Mass Market Paperback] by Marlowe, Christopher","review":"Both his influence and his biography far eclipse his actual writing. Notable, but for me he will always be Shakespeare Lite."},{"Title":"The Tragedy of Doctor Faustus [Mass Market Paperback] by Marlowe, Christopher","review":"I've been assigned this play twice in my college career and enjoyed reading and analyzing it both times. It is both intelligent and clever, well-constructed with a slightly devious wit. However, I think it's one of those stories that is more fun to think about than to read as a play or see performed. The characters feel as though they have been constructed for Marlowe to make his argument. They are not the kind of characters you like or sympathize with. And because the ending is a foregone conclusion there's no real tension in that regard. The characters don't display a tremendous amount of emotional depth so you feel nothing for them. Instead, the play invites debate and scrutiny. It is a play of exposition, monologuing, and philosophical and theological debates. If you read for the plot, I think you'll be disappointed.I think Faustus is incredibly interesting to consider as a modern reader. In a modern story, he might be the hero. A man from a humble background with \\"parents base of stock\\" he rose to prominence as a doctor through his natural intelligence and diligent study. His great sins are his ambitions and unwillingness to accept the limitations of man, especially given that he has achieved so much in his life. He questions his mortal existence and the inevitability of his sinning and death. Yet ultimately, he proves to be all too mortal. He is limited by his fixation on physical, earthly, mortal concerns. He is limited by the bounds (countries and borders) of the earth. His imagination cannot stretch beyond human thought. He is still subject to lust and the weakness of human flesh. And because Marlowe is trying to make a point, sometimes he can be incredibly stubborn and blindingly stupid.But it deserves its position as a classic and its brilliant for provoking discussion. Well worth a read, especially if you then go about dissecting it."},{"Title":"The Tragedy of Doctor Faustus [Mass Market Paperback] by Marlowe, Christopher","review":"This very comprehensive text and supporting notes are providing me with a great support, for an upcoming reading of this play, which I will be directing.

The tale deals with a professor who offers his soul to Lucifer in exchange for fame, wealth, and knowledge. He enjoys the benefits of making the deal, but all the while wonders whether his soul can be saved. Some try to convince him that it can be saved, but he fails to act, and in the end, his soul is taken by Lucifer. Marlowe's take on this story is a very good one, but one that has underwent some obvious editing. So get it, but be forewarned that somethings may be hard to get through at spots."},{"Title":"The Tragedy of Doctor Faustus [Mass Market Paperback] by Marlowe, Christopher","review":"A good short play by Marlowe that covers the whole life of Faustus from his signing the damned pact to his death by dismembering in the hands of all kinds of demons. Faustus does not appear as a real scientist or doctor of anything looking for knowledge. He starts with such a condition which is bluntly rejected and then he accepts the terms of the contract and he is going to use his power only to pester the Pope, to make fun of the Emperor, though not too much, and to get the Mickey out of all sorts of simple people? He is a clown and it is not his pleading at the end for some kind of salvation or waver that is going to change anything. He is a fool and appears as such from beginning to end. Yet the play is not some kind of religious warning. It is nothing but an anti-Popish farce. The metaphysical and ethical dimensions are absolutely erased. That's amazing because Marlowe's time was favorable to such metaphysical and abstractly religious gibberish and Marlowe resisted it. So that Faustus has no cathartic value for us since he is a clown and we hardly can project ourselves into that fool. Even the episode with Helen of Troy is minimized into some kind of a clich&eacute; crossing the stage.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, University Paris 8 Saint Denis, University Paris 12 Cr&eacute;teil, CEGID"},{"Title":"The Tragedy of Doctor Faustus [Mass Market Paperback] by Marlowe, Christopher","review":"This was my first brush with Marlowe's work, and I like his style. Marlowe's incarnation of this tale is done quite well. Dr. Faustus is a well off man who makes a deal with the devil so that he may transcend his mortal powers. All the while, he is visited by an angel of God who importunes for him to expiate his sins and seek salvation above. He is told by the angel of the Devil, however, that all is already lost. Mixed in is a bit of humor from some comedic scenes in the Vatican, followed by damnation.The story is so simple, and yet so complex. The complexity comes in when we attempt to figure out the whys of what happens. Was Faustus damned from the start, and he knew it? Why did Faustus flout the warnings of Mephistophilis himself--the devil's agent--as to how awful hell is? Was Faustus still able to achieve salvation before he was taken below? That is all for more learned men than I to discern.As part of my Five Book Challenge on [...], I am trying out authors I have not yet read, and this is one. Marlowe's other works ought to be of interest to me as well, I would imagine. I now am quite curious to read Goethe's version of Faustus after having read this to see the similarities and differences.Happy reading!Matt Finizio[...]Box off.

This extensive biography profiles the woman who makes her way from a farm in central Massachusetts to Oberlin College (the only institution admitting women and blacks at the time), and then on to the lecture circuit and the issues of anti-slavery and suffrage. A fiercely-independent woman who vows never to marry, she fends off and is simultaneously intrigued by romantic advances made to her by Henry Blackwell, the Ralph Kramden of his day. They marry in 1855. Lucy continues her speaking tours, eventually takes care of daughter Alice, publishes the Women's Journal, and finances all of Henry's ill-fated get-rich-quick schemes. Intertwined with the details of her personal life are her relationships with the key people in both movements (Anthony, Stanton, Frederick Douglass, William Lloyd Garrison) and the splits with leaders of both. Thanks to many pieces of archived correspondence, we can know the reasons for the rift among suffrage leaders, the division into separate organizations, and their reunion many years later. A fascinating must-read for feminists of all dimensions."},{"Title":"Sleeping Beastly: And Other tales from Maynard Moose","review":"Sleeping Beastly is my favorite Maynard story but whole CD is wonderful.

The 15 short stories in this collection, titled The Golden Spurs, were selected from the years 1953 to 1988. Like many readers, I am not especially familiar with this genre, but I do occasionally read westerns. The subtitle, The Best of Western Short Fiction, is a fair assessment. These are good stories.The titles include Gun Job (Thomas Thompson), Bad Company (S. Omar Barker), Lost Sister (Dorothy M. Johnson), Thief in Camp (Bill Gulick), Isley's Stranger (Will Henry), Comanche Woman (Fred Grove), A Season for Heroes (Carla Kelly), Jason Glendauer's Watch (James Bellah), One Man's Code (Wayne Barton), Horseman (Oakley Hall), The Ten Sleep Mail (William F. Bragg, Jr.), Sale of One Small Ranch (Paul St. Pierre), The Way It Was Told to Me (Bill Brett), The Bandit (Loren D. Estleman), and Yellow Bird: An Imaginary Autobiography (Robert J. Conley).Gun Job, the story of a town sheriff drawn back from retirement, and One Man's Code, the tale of a man's resolve not to take sides in a dispute between others, address a common theme that resonates even today.Lost Sister and Comanche Woman examine the poignant stories of women taken captive as children, now married to warriors and faced with returning to a nearly forgotten, civilized society.Bad Company and Thief in Camp, both stories from the perspective of boys becoming young men, explore the tradition of honor in the west.Isley's Stranger has supernatural overtones and is in a class by itself. Yellow Bird is the disturbing, perhaps not so imaginary, account of the Cherokee tribe. The Ten Sleep Mail was among my favorites; a wolf plays an unexpected role in the survival of a mail carrier stranded by an early winter blizzard.A Season for Heroes is a low key, highly effective story of a hero, one Ezra Freeman, a black sergeant in the US Calvary at Ft. Bowie, Arizona Territory.Horseman, The Way It Was Told to Me, and Jason Glendauer's Watch are stories that reach out beyond the traditional boundaries of western genre, and in the process perhaps redefine the western itself. These were not my favorites; I may be too much of a traditionalist.I had read only two stories previously: The Bandit by Loren Estleman and Sale of a Small Ranch by Paul St. Pierre. Both are quite fascinating and warrant multiple readings. I first encountered Sale of a Small Ranch in a remarkable collection of St. Pierre's short stories titled Smith and Other Events (1984)."},{"Title":"Feast of Fools","review":"Harvey Cox (born 1929) is an ordained American Baptist minister who also taught theology at Harvard Divinity School. He has also written books such asThe secular City,On not leaving it to the snake,Seduction of the Spirit: The Use and Misuse of People's Religion,Turning East, etc.He wrote in the Preface to this 1969 book, \\"I wrote 'The Feast of Fools' not to solve a scholarly problem... I wrote it because I think what it says is true and is needed. In part, this book grows out of thinking I have had to do in response to the criticisms that were made of The Secular City. Some people rightly saw that book as far too one-sided in its eager activism, its zealous concern for social change, its hyperthyroid extraversion... In this book I turn somewhat to the other side... I touch here on a different range of issues, including meditation, mysticism, prayer, and ritual. I strongly emphasize the noninstrumental significance of celebration and liturgy.\\"He suggests that \\"Our loss of the capacity for festivity and fantasy has profound religious significance... This may account in part for the malaise and tedium of our time. Celebration requires a set of common memories and collective hopes.\\" (Pg. 15) Later, he adds that \\"Like fantasy, religion enables man to transcend the empirical world and to appreciate the sublimity and mystery of existence.\\" (Pg. 80)He observes that Christianity has a \\"fertile 'mix' of time dimensions,\\" but admits that it does not. \\"The reason is that in Christianity itself today the mix is badly distorted, with a bias not toward the present or the future but toward the past.\\" (Pg. 50) He asserts that the church cannot be the metainstitution the world needs to open us to fantasy, or enlarge our petty dimensions of reality because they \\"have departed so markedly from their vocation... that only a residue of that historic calling remains.\\" (Pg. 115-116) He suggests, however, that \\"celebration should open man... to the larger cosmos of which he is a part and the history he is involved in making.\\"Those who enjoy Cox's earlier theological reflections will also appreciate this book."},{"Title":"Feast of Fools","review":"&quot;The Feast of Fools&quot; has been selected for listing in &quot;Religion and Psychoactive Sacraments: An Entheogen Chrestomathy.&quot;"},{"Title":"Pump House Gang","review":"Tom Wolfe is brilliant in capturing a generation's feel.

This plays out in some interesting ways--most notably Wolfe watches Natalie Wood pursue status in a more traditional way by acquiring knowledge of art and even some Old Masters, while others play their own status game around photographing celebrities, in this case Wood herself. Essays on Hugh Hefner, California surf culture, and London mods are also worthwhile, as is a comic piece on Wolfe's misadventures with an &quot;automated hotel&quot;. Wolfe does bog down at times, however, in the minute stylistic details of the groups he covers; if you are not that interested in style in and of itself, your eyes may glaze over those passages. Still, this is a good read for anyone interested in subcultures (especially of the 1960s) and status-seeking."},{"Title":"Pump House Gang","review":"Noted author Wolfe wrote this series of short stories in the mid 60s which describe a changing America, leaving the European framework of class structure and elegance for something different.

And this is some of the problems with the book. You may like some stories but they are so diverse, you may loathe others.

His account of the La Jollans visiting the Watts Riots was right on. I visited the riot zone myself, and enjoyed the same experiences as Shine, Nelander, and Sterncorb.Wolfe came as close as any &quot;outsider&quot; has been able to do, in analyzing the La Jolla nut house, the institution where the walls fell down, and none of the inmates left."},{"Title":"The Best of Davie Napier: Come Sweet Death, Time of Burning, Word of God, Word of Earth","review":"Dr. Napier was my primary Old Testament professor and mentor at Yale Divinity School.

The subject content is short and concise with excellent focus on key terms and their definitions, as well as subject matter experts and their contributions to sociology.It was well worth what I paid and met my expectations."},{"Title":"CLEP Introductory Sociology w/CD (REA) - The Best Test Prep for the CLEP Exam (Test Preps)","review":"The book was good in terms of what it includes. But it leaves out some areas that are on the CLEP test, like demography and urban ecology. The practice tests are very helpful but there is lots of stuff in the practice tests that wasn't covered in the book. I supplemented the book with Wikipedia."},{"Title":"CLEP Introductory Sociology w/CD (REA) - The Best Test Prep for the CLEP Exam (Test Preps)","review":"I just took the CLEP Intro. to Sociology and passed with a 70 out of 80 on the test. I got this book a week ago and studied it thoroughly (outlines, read it three times, etc), and I also got the practice test from the CLEP site this morning to look over. This book itself covered only about 40-50% of what was on the test.My suggestion to pass the test is to study this book completely - including the answers for the practice tests (since a lot of the information is covered there and nowhere else in the book) - and then google every topic on the practice test from the CLEP site and you should be fine."},{"Title":"CLEP Introductory Sociology w/CD (REA) - The Best Test Prep for the CLEP Exam (Test Preps)","review":"I used this book alone to study for the CLEP and passed with a 66.

This was only worthwhile because I was taking so many tests. It only contains a sample test for each CLEP - and there are no detailed answers. I will say I think it was helpful but I also do not believe it made a real difference in terms of pass / fail on the tests.For the first three listed, it was enough to read the books a couple of times and then take the tests. Some of the material wasn't on the CLEP and there was material on the CLEP that was not in the book. That is to be expected given the broad topics covered. There is enough material in each of these three books to pass the CLEP they cover. I crammed a full semester of these classes into two weeks of study.**NOTE** The sample tests are an important part of the learning process. There is information in the tests and detailed answers that is not covered elsewhere in the text. Do not underestimate the need to review the sample tests. They also give you good practice on timing. I considered this important for the Math and Literature tests. I was worried about spending too much time on each question for these last two. This is why I was disappointed with the lack of computer based testing with the Literature book.The other two CLEP books require specific reviews.College Mathematics: This was the toughest of the five for me personally. I do not feel the book covered the material in enough depth to prepare you for the test. It assumed you knew an awful lot that I did not know. There are drill questions at the end of each section. It would have been more helpful if they included detailed answers. There were a couple that I never did figure out. I do not consider myself math challenged but I also admit that I am not a math major. I spent a lot of time on-line utilizing other resources. My thanks to:[...][...][...]Analyzing and Interpreting Literature: I'm not sure this book really added value for me. The tests were helpful in getting me familiar with the format of the test (the printed version was all I had to work with - see above). However, there isn't much within the text that actually helped me prepare. In all fairness, I am an avid reader (not poetry!!) and could have simply taken this test at any time. If you are not much of a reader this book might be a good guide on what to read. It does not contain a list of what to read but if you read the material it uses as examples, it may help.

I only got to read about two chapters of the other book but I read this book's review twice, took all three exams and even redid one of the exams later for practice. It all paid off when I got a score of 73 (80 is the top score). :) This book really helped me!****Tip***** go through all of the explanations to answers, not only the ones you have wrong, and take notes from the information you have there.

The review section has the most filler I've ever seen in what is supposed to be a condensed presentation of a subject. I don't think the authors could fit any more prepositional phrases or parenthetical explanations in there. It was an absolutely brutal read, in that it was slow and dry. I had to re-read many of the 7-line sentences (yes, seven lines, one sentence) to figure out what the point was. Usually I read very quickly so this was irritating for me.The Part Where I LOVE IT...The tests are the best part of the book. The information is relevant and clearly presented. Why couldn't the whole book be like this?As usual, I also supplemented with Instantcert.com flashcards. If you use instantcert, there is no need to read the text of this book because it is exactly the same information. The instantcert flashcards are a lot more enjoyable to use.Overall, the book (because of the tests) was definitely worth purchasing and using in prep for the CLEP exam.

I spend roughly six hours reading through the texts in the first day. I don't simply read the text, I clarify them into my mind. One of the reason why it took me six hours is because I take many notes. I have about six pages of notes (back and front) by the end of the first day.Then the second day I did two of the practice exams and read over EVERY answer explanations. I have to say that the practice exams are extremely helpful in preparation for the real test. I write down important notes and they take up nearly six pages (back and front again). I spent about ten hours on the second day, this includes the one and a half hour going over Day 1's notes.Then the third day I woke up early at 5AM to take the third practice exam and going over the answers. Notes for Day 3 is around 3 pages. After that, I read over my notes from Day 1 to Day 3. I spent about four hours for the whole thing.I went to take the test and scored a 71 out of 80 (I was panic and thought I couldn't make it). I finished the exam about 30 minutes early but I spent the left-over time going over my answers. Anyway, I still leave about 10 minutes before it actually ends.

If you understand why an answer is right (by reading the explanations in the back of the book) you'll pass. It really helps to know all of the terminology because most of the questions are based on the assumption you have the terminology down. I made flash cards that really helped.The CLEP Official Study Guide is a great way to test your knowledge as well.

I would pay a lot of attention to functionalism and conflict perspectives, and know all the sociologists and the theories in this book. I also took the peterson practice tests, and scored in the 50's. The most valuable part of this book are the three practice tests, and the detailed explanations (make sure you understand how the sociologists think).

Because of this I was anxious, nervous and skeptical that I would even pass. I would suggest purchasing a sociology textbook to get further explanations that this book didn't provide. Some of the questions on the test asked about specific situations and details that a texbook would have.

I have just finished reading it here in Washington DC, but I felt throughout that I was right there with the women called The Trident Three as they did their disarmament work on board that NATO facility in Loch Goil, Scotland.Mayer seems not only to be a great lawyer who is prepared to battle for all humanity - he can write extremely well also. His style skips right along as he explains what the women did, how he got involved as their Scottish Advocate and what the international law has to say about this constant danger to humanity from nuclear weapons. Mayer is right - this is an adventure story and one which once picked up, is real hard to put down.M. J. BrewerHistory ProfessorVirginia"},{"Title":"Nuclear Peace: The Story of the Trident Three","review":"What an adventure! All the more inspiring for being true. John Mayer has captured a too rare event with a keen eye for drama, history, and human survival. Three courageous women from a world-wide community of Ploughshares activists boarded a highly secret vessel in Loch Goil in northwest Scotland to disarm it, thereby disarming the British Trident nuclear submarines the vessel serviced. How the women planned and carried out this amazing feat and then were acquitted of any crime is a story not to be missed by any peace-loving person or any adventure lover. There's a good deal of suspense as well as humor and lots of human joy in this story. It's a great read with profound hopefulness for the human soul."},{"Title":"The Norman Pretender","review":"The exciting tale of the Norman Conquest of 1066 is once more brought back to life. This book begins where &quot;Gildenford&quot; by Valerie Anand, an incredible author, left off. It is just as engrossing as her first novel in this trilogy.The story begins with Harold's eventual rise to fame, glory, and finally, later on, tragedy. Ringed with a traitor and a brother for friends, who needs enemies, right? Well, Brand Woodcutter, from the first novel ends up being one of Harold's staunchest friends, while his brother Tostig becomes the greatest betrayer of all. Then, we have Duke William of Normandy, who has his sights on the crown of England at any and all costs.From history, we know that William succeeds, but the circumstances and events that lead up to it were incredible to believe, but true nonetheless. This is an extraordinary adventure into what life must have been like for these amazing figures from the past that still haunt the present day. If you enjoy this historical period you won't want to miss reading the first of the trilogy, &quot;Gildenford&quot; followed by this book &quot;The Norman Pretender,&quot; and ending with &quot;The Disputed Crown.&quot; Sadly, yes, they are all out-of-print, but very well worth finding!"},{"Title":"The Norman Pretender","review":"BUY THIS BOOK! Anand weave a remarkable story and tells the tale of the search for an heir upon the death of Edward the Confessor. Harold, Earl of Wessex and brother to the Queen, or William, Duke of Normandy and originally named heir... who should be the rightful king of England when Edward dies? Well, just to keep it intersting there is the long lost cousin, the bi-polar younger brother of Harold (Tostig), and the Viking leader Harold Hardrada to contend with also. In a story almost too good to be true, it is remarkable to realize that it is true...or at least based on historical fact. As for Anand's ability to stick to history - well, it's commendable. Certainly, there are characters who have no known historical basis, but they are created to be as realistic as possible and only help to make the story flow. Brand Woodcutter is back from the extraordinary first book (Gildenford) along with several other memorable personas. I was lucky enough to get this book before the few remaining used book dealers realized the treasure they held - and jacked up the price unreasonably. However, if you can find a dealer who appreciates this book for the story it tells and is willing to part with their copy - BUY IT. Personally, I will not part with mine - I know I'll enjoy it again in years to come. Any publishers reading this - you are OUT OF YOUR MINDS if you don't bring this book out in print again."},{"Title":"The Norman Pretender","review":"Though the title refers to William of Normandy, this book revolves around Harold of England.

This is an easy-to-read, in-depth book that anyone would enjoy."},{"Title":"The Norman Pretender","review":"The follow-up to Anand's \\"Gildenford\\" is a stunning success. This story follows more closely the life of Harold II, leading up to the Norman Conquest of 1066. All of the original characters are back: Brand, Edith Swanneck, William, etc. This is a great buy."},{"Title":"The Norman Pretender","review":"The Norman Pretender takes up the story whereGildenfordleft off, as the powerful Godwinson family returns to England after King Edward forgives them for their role in the massacre of his brother Alfred and 600 of his Norman followers. The old Earl dies and his oldest son Harold becomes The Earl of Wessex and the story then details Harold's life as he battles the Welsh and his bitter enemy Gruffydd ap Llywelyn, while also struggling with his jealous brother Tostig. We also see the return of the fictional character of Brand the Woodcutter (who has been living in Duke William's court), along with Wulfhild, the daughter he didn't know existed, as he returns to England and Harold gives them the lands surrounding Fallowdene.For those familiar with the period and its history you know what happensnext, but for the sake of those that don't I won't detail too much further, just suffice it to say that Anand weaves a fine tale of Harold Godwinson and the events leading him to make an oath of fealty that he cannot keep, the final treachery of his brother Tostig that exhausts Harold and his army, finally culminating in that fateful October day in 1066 and the Battle at Hastings.While this book is not quite as good as Helen Hollick'sHarold the King(a must read!), I had a very hard time putting this down and I am very much looking forward to reading the last in the trilogy,The Disputed Crown.

This book is full of misguided information about herbs, candles, crystals, and so much more that you will be utterly confused if you ever pick up another book on Wicca. This title is even fictional. There is no such thing, to my knowledge, that is called 'the Wiccanning' and it is certainly not a commonly used term in the pagan community. Honestly, I just can't even explain how many errors there really are on every single page.It's so infuriating for someone who's been practicing for a quite a while.

Hell, even Silver Ravenwolf is a better starter than this hogwash."},{"Title":"The Wiccaning: A Step-By-Step Guide to Becoming a Modern Witch","review":"Okay i just read this whole book in one sitting. I found the author to be mostly Christian-Wiccan themed. This book was not a favorite of mine because i don't associate angles and characters from the bible in my craft. I know each wiccan practices differently but i feel that if Christianity and Wicca are combined there needs to be some indicator in the title, and not a purely (wiccan) appearance. I only gave this three stars because i disliked most of her beliefs but i did find there is usable information to learn form this book to an extent. Not for beginners.And i don't understand why she would bother with putting the exorcism part her \\"Becoming a Witch\\" book. If there is a need for an exorcism i feel that needs to be left up to experienced Priests or Priestess, and not for Newbies!"},{"Title":"The Wiccaning: A Step-By-Step Guide to Becoming a Modern Witch","review":"The book is actually informative and helpful, parts of it I find to be slightly questionable, confusing, and difficult to understand.First off she says that one qualification to being a wicca is you have to believe in the god and goddess and that they are equal in power. Although in other books and sites I have visited it says you can either believe in just the goddess or god, or even any god or goddess of your choice. She also wants you to be whole and perfect, no one is perfect in my opinion until death.She also seems to believe that there are only four types of teachings for witches to study I wonder if this means that other types do not exist. She also goes into there being three of witches. From what I have read either you are a witch or you aren't so you can't be gray and go white.Her origin of the god and goddess are also different from what I have read, but then again the book of Genesis as two different creation stories so why not. She goes into the special books one Grimoire which as designs on the cover and the Book of Shadow that doesn't have any design what so ever. She tells the reader not to let anyone see it, I can see to some degree why but it would also be an interesting tool to be used in teachings and learning something new. She also wants you to write a spell or poem on the front and back when you finish that will scare anyone off to keep away prying eyes. In my opinion this is not a smart move because if some where to find it then that would only serve to push the stereotypes of witches along. She also mentions that all magick as rhythm so I guess she thinks that spells without rhythm aren't magick.She also goes into seven laws of Magick, the Wiccan Rede, and the One Truism (complete worship of god and goddess), and purity of heart makes up the entire Wiccan Religion. Her views on casting love spells are rather strange since she tell you not to cast it on a married man but you can cast it on someone dating someone else. Then she states the spell can not hurt anyone; in my opinion if you cast a spell that ends up breaking up a couple then someone is going to get hurt.Sister Moon goes into their being ten basic rules that must be abided by at all times. The tools of the trade for her are a little different where the candles are concerned. The rest of the tools she recommends are the same as most other books and sites. She gives a very nice table on different ways to call the towers. Her way of Calling the Towers are different then most other books. She states you have to wear a certain article of clothing for sabbaths.Her corrosponding tables are well done. She talks more about Lunar Cycles and magick. While she talks about Drawing Down the Moon she does not go into how it should be done. She then goes into what factors are needed to cast the spells: colors, days, houses, signs, moon, planet, etc. How to find out things dealing with astrology she doesn't go into enough to understand how to do it. She gives brief definitions on oils, tinctures, mixtures, inks, ointments, and powders, her brief listing of rules of thumbs for magick is brief and easy to understand and read. She discusses the chakaras briefly but doesn't go into how to open them. She also goes into the Qabala which is an oracle and a way to receive enlightenment, which is based off of the Jewish Torah. She also discusses briefly the aurora and astral projection.She goes into the several different types of Divining some of them are more in depth then others. She also goes briefly into the High Sabbats and Esabats and gives ideas for how to celebrate them. Another thing she goes into is how to celebrate the different Full Moons of the month. She talks briefly about Angels and other spirits including Demons, which for most witches do not exist. She tells you how to do a Clearing which is an exorcism for a house and how to do an exorcism on a person. I would not recommend doing either by yourself since you have no idea how powerful the Demon or spirit is, if you follow a Judo-CHristian-Wiccan path, and if he will enter you or someone else after he or she has left the body or house. I would also not recommend doing this because from what I have heard it is a very draining experience.She discusses the Ceremonial Rites. She also goes into the Coven and how to form one; something which should not be gone into for a beginner. She talks about binding \\"Turned She talks about the Rite of Power, and the Rite of Crowning.Basically if you aren't into Christian Witchcraft I would not recommend looking at this book save for the tables. Because even though some of the stuff is not interesting and rather contracdictory; it is better for Christian Witches because of the stuff she goes into and deals with using for spells and magick including a Bible.[...]"},{"Title":"The Wiccaning: A Step-By-Step Guide to Becoming a Modern Witch","review":"Go spend your money on Scott Cunningham or Starhawk. Yes, the correspondence tables in the book are lovely, but that information can be found elsewhere in other books and all over the Internet. The correspondence tables were pretty much the only redeeming factors of the book (well, the poetry opening each chapter was lovely, but it was written by someone else).But there were a few disturbing things about this book. First, the author made no mention whatsoever about potential magickal repercussions, and she glossed over magickal ethics in all of three paragraphs.Second, she combines novice information with advanced information and makes little to no distinction between the two. Maybe it's just me, but giving step-by-step instructions on exorcism and seances in a book for newbies just doesn't seem real smart to me. Glad I'm not going to have to bail the newbies out when things start hitting the proverbial fan.And third, the book smacks of &quot;Christian Witch.&quot; Sister Moon must be a big Silver RavenWolf fan -- she mentions angels on practically every page. And not to mention heaven, hell, demons that possess people, and invoking the Triple God as the Father, Son and Holy Spirit. If you like Christianity so much, go back to church.Your money would be better spent elsewhere."},{"Title":"The Wiccaning: A Step-By-Step Guide to Becoming a Modern Witch","review":"According to the description the book is about the Wiccaning ritual of how to become a Witch. A wiccaning is NOT the ritual of becoming Witch. Those with Christian friends/family can relate. The Wiccaning is a Witch's &quot;baptism&quot; ritual. Being baptised doesn't mean that child will follow their Christian upbringing any more so than a baby who's had a Wiccaning will be Pagan. The title and description are very misleading."},{"Title":"The Wiccaning: A Step-By-Step Guide to Becoming a Modern Witch","review":"Altar Tools, Circle Casting, Ritual Basics, Beginning Craft Ethics, Herbal and Color Magick, Moon Phases, and other subjects are varying aspects of the Craft'. If one were to feel the need for a brief summary of these various aspects, The Wiccaning would be a decent place to start. However as with any book Enot all of its contents should be considered for use Emost especially by the beginner.Defining Wicca as the proper name for the religion of WitchcraftE(Moon E4) is the beginning of what some might consider to be a series of scholastic and historical misrepresentations. In the first chapter, Witchcraft is often inappropriately used as a name of a religion, instead of a way of life. This is followed by a brief (albeit inaccurate) historical depiction in which the author places Wiccans as individuals who interacted with Ancient Greece and Rome, serving as respected advisors/wise women, and sometimes as individuals who gave 'warnings' Eearning fear from the Greeks and Romans by the issue of the 'evil eye'. While certainly remnants of the Neolithic Mother Goddess Cult had already passed through the area, and Witches and Seers and individuals considered to be knowledgeable of the needs of the gods were present EWicca, as a binding religion, did not begin to exist until at the earliest Ethe late eighteen hundreds/early nineteen hundreds. Even then, the name was not publicly known until the 1950's.Whereas precepts are concerned, the author does outline some of many qualities that readers may/may not deem necessary to pursue the study of the craft, or of an earth based religion Emany of which I agree with. However, the presentation of certain topics appeared rushed, with more in the way of diagrams than explanations. Other topics, such as the Kabbalah, and Tarot, were related to one another in a manner which required more explanation than what was given. The Kabbalah and Tarot are not subjects I, as a reader, feel are necessary for beginners to immediately become acquainted with. In fact, associating these things with topics considered common for beginners to read could lead to mass confusion, and misinterpretation.The brief summaries of the subjects offered within the book lead to a less than organized explanation/overview of 'The Wiccaning'. This coven-based explanation is then followed by spells which seem geared less towards attunement and more towards what the author herself is familiar with. While an overview is certainly present, information is presented from a hereditary, coven based perspective. Little in the way of steps is offered, apart from familiarizing oneself with tenants, and bare bone basics Eand seems less than appropriate for a solitary practitioner of any craft, or earth-based religion. This book is less a step-by-step guide, and more a diagram of the author's beliefs, and should be perused only after reading other books Ewhen the reader is capable of taking from the book what they feel will work, and moving on from there.(This review was previously written in May, for my Pagan-based Website. I thought I would share my thoughts here.)"},{"Title":"The Wiccaning: A Step-By-Step Guide to Becoming a Modern Witch","review":"I must say this is a good reference book. It has many uses in it, how ever this person Sister Moon Knows nothing about the Beliefs of Wicca. She states Wiccan's believe in a Satan, a Haven and Hell. This is ridiculous! No true Wiccan believe this. Her story of the origin of the goddess and god is almost the same as the Christian belief of its origin of there God in the bible. I suggest people who get this book to over see what she try's to teach you about her beliefs and own views of Wicca. There are better books that teach the true history like Scott Cunningham or Silver Raven Wolf. Take the good and useful from this book! Don't believe everything you read! Do lots of research.

She gleams over the inquisition, the burning times and the modern reconstruction of Wicca. This book has the distinct feel like the Author has made up what she believes and thrown into a book, without any research. This is clearly her opinion and what she practises and I can only hope that anyone reading this will use their brain and read other material and make an intelligent decision. Below are some examples from the book of the information that is incredibly questionable. There is at least one piece of dodgy information on every page.Page 5 \\"The ancient Greeks and Romans believed that the Wiccans were capable of many different things\\" Find me a history book that says anything about Wiccans, Wicca and Wiccan are modern terms and using the words interchangeably for historical reference is poor writing.Page 5 & 6 \\"The thing most dreaded among the Greeks and Romans during this period was the threat of the evil eye. They accused only the Wiccans of having this power. The evil eye is an intense look or state. It is meant for on e purpose; a warning. The warning is forbearance to refrain from action. Yes the evil eye still exists! The Author then goes on for another page about the subject.Page 8 \\"The Black Witch Black Witches are not associated with either Gray or White Witches, or even the Wiccan religion. This is usually due to their affiliation with Satan or other dark forces.\\"Page 12 \\"The Book of Shadows must have solid black covers and unlined white paper\\" Really! Well I know a few Witches and Covens who would have something to say about that.Page 14 \\"As long as the person is not married, the field is open for magick\\" I can not personally believe that this was allowed to be in print, there are a lot of people who are not married and have children and very happy lives. Relationships are sacred things and by saying something as blatant as that in a book like this is a disgrace.Page 111 \\"4th Chakra - Pink\\" Most Eastern philosophy states that the chakra is green, pink is the secondary.Page 173 \\"How does one become an Angel? And if out soul reincarnated, then how do you explain Angels? I believe every soul has a destination. It can rest and learn in either Heaven or hell, or even become a ghost on an earthly plane, but all souls have a destination. I believe some souls are older than others. The older, the wiser and the more pure of heart the soul is, the more likely the candidate is to become an Angel.\\" Rest in hell, ok then, Souls becoming Angels? There are a lot of theories about Angels and their origins, I think her explanation is was to simplistic.Page 173 \\"not all Witches believe there is a heaven or hell. I believe in both and that there is a ruler in hell, known as Satan. The Dark Forces are mere followers of evil\\" And that quote takes the cake.To sum it all up, this book is childish, uneducated, shallow, simple, un-researched and a waste of money.

Unfortunately, the book is cleverly disguised as a useful guide, with lists of tools and oils, and seasonal rituals. A novice to the subject would be easily fooled by the look of the book, and may not realize that much of the information is completely inaccurate - and often ridiculous. For example, the author suggests that the ritual for becoming a witch is called a &quot;Wiccaning&quot;. However, this term has been used in modern Wicca to refer to a type of baptism for the child of Wiccan parents, not to any kind of initiation. There are several similar incidences where the author misuses terminology or simply makes things up. I've been practicing Wicca for 13 years and have never even heard of some of the things this author has made up and presented as if it were &quot;ancient knowledge&quot; or even common Wiccan practice. At one point, the author suggests that the coven should, in essence, hex any witch who turns to black magick. The ritual for doing so is called &quot;The Darkening&quot;(another made-up term not commonly used in modern Wicca)and is one of the most negative things I have seen in print. It is, itself, the practice of black magick, and involves stabbing a voodoo doll with pins and sealing it in a coffin after stabbing it's chakra points! Yet the author presents it as if it is a neccesary practice for the &quot;white&quot; witch to strip the black witch of their power. And not their power to do evil - their power to do good! She suggests that the person who turns to dark magick cannot turn back to good(so much for free will!)and must be magickaly banned from returning to white magick. There is no logic or ethics involved here. And any true Wiccan knows that you cannot strip the power of magick from anyone - it is neutral and inherent in all beings and cannot be taken away. I would never recommend this book and the store where I work returned it to the distributors so that anyone interested in learning about Wicca would not end up with such misinformation.

It is not even 'escape literature.'&quot; This should be noted before deciding to read this book.

Simms is not coasting on his reputation. He prepares for each week's broadcast with the same seriousness of purpose with which he formerly prepared to quarterback the Giants. Simms has always dedicated himself to self-improvement--even improving his throwing mechanics during his second decade as an NFL quarterback. His journalism reflects his professionalism; Simms respects his audience. For example: \\"I try to stay away from buzz terms such as 'Two Deep' or 'Eight in the Box.' Instead, I'll talk about the defense 'crowding the line of scrimmage.'\\" (p. 125).\\"Sunday Morning Quarterback\\" dispels countless false \\"truisms\\" that less analytical/knowledgeable NFL broadcasters spew because they are too lazy to dig deeper.Simms vividly describes the challenges NFL quarterbacks face that average fans (like me) don't appreciate. Simms argues persuasively that, even today, many NFL teams fail to adequately coach and drill quarterbacks in their throwing motion. He explains that it's easy for fans and journalists to second-guess plays that don't work out well, such as a reverse that gets stopped in the backfield or a draw play in an \\"obvious\\" passing situation. But, he argues, the very \\"obviousness\\" of a call makes it less desirable. Also, even when a particular play \\"fails,\\" it can achieve the objective of confusing defenses and preventing them from \\"reading\\" plays too quickly (and, thus, attacking immediately). Planting seeds of doubt may slow down a defense's reaction by a second, which can be the difference between an interception and a long pass completion on the next play.Simms argues that the prominence of highlight films has made fans less patient (\\"Why can't we do that?\\"). Highlight reels, he points out, leave out all the busted plays and short gains. Also, every \\"highlight\\" is a \\"lowlight\\" for another team.He notes that quarterbacks who scramble reduce their ability to notice open receivers and reduce the portion of the field to which they can throw. He neglects to follow up by pointing out that smart defenses will react to a scrambling quarterback by compressing their defense toward the side of the field the quarterback is scrambling to (esp. the sideline toward which the quarterback is running). But he makes plenty of great points that will get fans thinking. He does, for example, add that a scrambling quarterback should keep his head looking downfield and shoulders parallel with the line of scrimmage as he runs towards the sideline. He says Manning and Brady have been trained to do this and complete more passes because they look downfield while scrambling.One place I vehemently disagree with Simms is his belief that \\"good size, a good throwing arm, and the ability to move reasonably well [plus] common intelligence\\" are more important in NFL quarterback prospects than \\"how they handle pressure and other mental aspects\\" which he terms \\"intangibles\\" (pp. 75-76). On p. 180 of my book, \\"Management Secrets of the New England Patriots,\\" I cite former NFL quarterbacks Joe Theismann and Jim Harbaugh who say that toughness is a quarterback's most important attribute. At Michigan, Tom Brady was small, weak-armed, and slow. The Patriots drafted him for his toughness, competitiveness, intelligence, and calmness under pressure. None of these were \\"intangible.\\" You can't measure them statistically at the scouting combine, but you can measure them by studying game film, talking with teammates, etc. The Patriots saw those \\"intangibles.\\" Brady has added twenty pounds to his frame, strengthened his arm, and remains slower than many nose tackles. \\"Intangibles\\" cannot be taught because character is far harder to change than muscle mass. I'm not sure Simms even believes his own words because he later contradicts himself: \\"Your philosophical beliefs determine whether you win or lose. ...[W]hat you believe in--great physical conditioning, toughness, practicing under pressure--forms the core\\" (p. 149). And his entire Chapter 7 describes the many mental challenges of playing quarterback!Some might criticize Simms for his apparent jealousy that Joe Montana had the good fortune of being drafted by Walsh's Niners, but I admire and appreciate his candor. I wish we could re-run history and see what Simms would have done in Montana's place. Simms' story of Walsh telling Simms, during pre-draft scouting, to throw slower does suggest that Walsh's system would have enabled Simms to post even bigger numbers."},{"Title":"Sunday Morning Quarterback: Going Deep on the Strategies, Myths, and Mayhem of Football","review":"an insightful and quick read. the stuff about parcells is especially good. great for any NFL fan."},{"Title":"Sunday Morning Quarterback: Going Deep on the Strategies, Myths, and Mayhem of Football","review":"If your a Phil Simms or NY Giants fan, this is a must book to have.

In an age when adults are turning to conventional piety in greater numbers, it seems, Booth's book is a practical guide for developing authentic adult spirituality rooted in wisdom when the \\"God Box\\" offered in contemporary forms of True Believerism loses its allure.I consider works like Booth's (and many others) to be a kind of \\"warning label\\" on the real dangers of devotion associated with the resurgent fundamentalism and parochialism found today in most religious institutions and spiritual movements. Booth's work meets a growing need for spiritual recovery among adults who become disillusioned with the polarization, polemics and proselytism too often associated with naive forms of religious enthusiasm, however orthodox and \\"grown-up\\" in nature.Chapter by chapter, Booth leads the reader in recovery from the \\"numbing effects of... religiosity\\" (page 11), to the \\"reclaiming of spiritual power lost to dysfunctional or outmoded religious messages.\\" (page 13).Thanks to Leo Booth for encouraging us all to \\"experience 'The Way' demonstrated not just by Jesus, but by so many great spiritual leaders and teachers in all cultures and walks of life. Writing a new story for ourselves helps us discover the sacred in the secular that reveals God at work in so many diverse places- not only in the traditional religious scriptures, but in the words of ordinary people who challenge us to connect with our world.\\" (page 183)"},{"Title":"The God Game: It's Your Move: Healing the Wounds of Religious Addiction & Religious Abuse","review":"I have claimed to be an agnostic for years with a strict penticostal background and according to my therapist a grudge with Jesus.

Here is a quote which I hope illuminates the author's sensitivity towards your desire come away from reading this with a sense of it's friendliness: \\"Physics is not difficult; it's just weird. Physics, contrary to the opinion of many journalists and parents of scientists, is not particularly hard to explain or to learn. To learn how to use relativity, you do not have to be Einstein; nor do you have to be Heisenberg to do Quantum Mechanics. Physics is weird because your intuition is false. To understand what an electron's world is like, you've got to be an electron, or jolly nearly.\\" Here are a few more points Icke makes before setting out on this wonderful journey of discovery: \\"Physics is powerful.\\", \\"Physics is beautiful.\\", \\"Physics is simplification, and so is explanation... This is the real stuff, even though there is a two-semester lecture series of heavy technical material behind every chapter. In fact, it is my intention that you could read this book right alongside a textbook on gauge theory.\\" I believe that, before you've finished this book, you will have happily come to the conclusion that this author has delivered a well-prepared & friendly presentation of his points in the above thesis.INTRODUCTION1. A MATTER OF FORCE (The speed of light, Relativity and fields, vector, scalar & tensor fields, Feynman diagrams, Fermions & Bosons)2. STALKING THE WILD RAINBOW3. LIGHT (Waves of light, Huygen's principle, Interference, Standing waves, Photons, The equation of motion, momentum - kinetic & potential energies and their conservation, and finally \`action'.)4. MAYBE I'M HEISENBERG (De Broglie length, Planck's constant, amplitudes, waves and Uncertainty relations, complementary, conjugate variables/operators, Quanta, dispersion and probability.)5. CATCH A FALLING QUANTUM (Indeterminacy, linear superposition, interference terms, and \\"Where does the electron go?\\")6. QUANTUM BEANBAGS (One of my favorite chapters. The first part, 6.1 \\"A muddy wheel\\", gives a clever analogy which helps you comprehend the concepts of complex numbers & probability amplitudes. The next section, 6.2 \\"The importance of having phase\\" looks just like Feynman's \\"QED - the Strange Theory of Light and Matter\\" with the same types of illustrations. The very next section is titled \\"Feynman Paths\\" and brilliantly elucidates 'Action' and \`field density'; the last section, 6.4 \\"Superposition and quantum sorcery\\", brings to light principles of second quantization, state vectors, eigenstates & eigenvalues. The chapter finishes with a nice metaphor for Rotation and hints of Dirac's \`ket' & \`bra' notation.)7. SYMMETRIES (quantum numbers, Rydberg equation, Groups and rotations, rotation & translation groups, Invariance and angular momentum, Noether's theorem, angular momentum and uncertainty, and three dimensional rotations.)8. QUANTUM RELATIVITY: NOTHING IS RELATIVE (Rotations in space, \\"The light cone -our compass in space-time\\", time dilation, the Lorentz transformation, Antimatter, pair creation & annihilation, \\"The dizzy world of spin\\", precession, \\"Spin and relativity\\", \\"The quantum of spin\\", Polarization, vector & tensor particles, vector bosons, handedness and helicity.)9. LIFE, THE UNIVERSE AND EVERYTHING (the \\"Anatomy of an atom\\", \\"Atomic symmetry\\", \\"Quantization produces chemistry\\" - the periodic table, \\"The molecules of life\\", and \\"Quantization and genetic coding\\".)10. THE PHYSICS OF A TABLECLOTH (\\"Gauge twists and velpons\\", the electromagnetic field - QED, phase, isospin, Yang-Mills fields, and gravity.)11. COLOUR ME RED, GREEN AND BLUE (the colour field, Mesons & baryons, and pions.)12. SMASHING SYMMETRY (sections on Weak decay, Velpons, symmetry breaking, the electroweak force, and \`Charm'.)13. HOW MUCH IS INFINITY MINUS INFINITY? (Renormalization, \`dressed' vs. \`naked electrons'; vacuum & charge polarization; the \`Global behavior of electromagnetism', Coulomb's law, the magnetic moment, and the weak & colour forces.)14. EXCELSIOR! The ascent to infinity (Contains sections on Grand Unification -with a nice a bit on the \`fine structure constant'; Supersymmetry, The Planck scale, and ending on Superstrings with Kaluza-Klein Theories.)\\"A MODEST READING PROPOSAL\\" (The last chapter. This is a golden opportunity to take up the author's challenge for \\"do it yourself\\" verification and to expand your knowledge by reading & learning.)REFERENCESGLOSSARY (This is one of the features of the book which makes it particularly sweet! It's not just any glossary, it has a couple of pages introducing the concept of what it means to define words in physics -e.g. what's the difference between a mathematical and an everyday linguistic definition? The words in the main body of the book appear in a conspicuous font signaling you that they can be found in the glossary. The page numbers for the words that are defined in the glossary are cross-referenced to the sections of the main text where you can locate the context that they are used in.)INDEX (exceptionally complete!)Of interest to this reviewer are the copious illustrated diagrams that helped me to get a picture in my mind of the subject at hand. I am grateful to the author for leading me along a pedagogically sane path towards a deep understanding of the material.This book is the kind of book that, if I were to have achieved a lifelong goal, I would die happy knowing that I'd written it! Nonetheless I am extremely pleased to have merely read it!I sincerely hope that you get your hands on this book and wrap your mind around its concepts for your enlightenment.IndiAndy - Exploring opportunities for intellectual adventure !"},{"Title":"The Force of Symmetry","review":"As I write these words, I stop frequently to consider how they might best be arranged, an activity no different in principle from picking my way along a trail when hiking over tricky terrain. For human beings, walking and language production (at least spoken language) are natural, their potential part of our DNA, their actualization emblematic of a basic level of developmental health and social well being. Mathematics too has been called a language, and indeed certain features of this language (e.g. the ability of neonates to recognize small numbers of things) are innate. But none of us go on in the normal course of development to become fluent in mathematics without a great deal of difficult, sustained effort.It has become axiomatic among people who write popular books on scientific subjects to suppose that physics cannot really be presented without mathematics. And if that axiom is true for classical physics, it is even more true for modern physics, the surreal world of quantum interference, antimatter, black holes and M theory.But now along comes Dutch physicist Vincent Icke, and in his book THE FORCE OF SYMMETRY he has, one might say, renormalized popular accounts of modern physics. He has been able to state the concepts of modern physics in a way which is lucid, coherent and, in all but the very simplest instances, nonmathematical. The novice physicist will not have to unlearn any of the concepts he acquires in Ickes' book after he goes on to master the mathematical intricacies of quantum field theory. The advanced student can use Ickes' text to obtain a detailed topography of the field.There is much to delight in this charming book. The five years I spent studying theoretical physics was a time of painful head banging on questions like, \\"How do you know this?\\" Few writers have the grace of Feynman, the ability to say about some arcane point, this is as much we know about it, no deeper than this. Icke, like Feynman, is very careful to signpost his epistemological wanderings. He lets the reader know when it is analogy, intuition, logic, experiment, convention, or metaphysics which is progenitor of some bit of physics knowledge.Because of his careful attention to the grounding of his discourse, Icke does not fall into the deep pit which is, alas, standard in most popular science writing. You know what I mean. There you are, happy reader, blithely meandering along in someone's account of protein synthesis, the inflationary period, mathematical intractability... the subject doesn't matter. You are reading along, and you are beginning to feel the first faint blush of hope. Maybe you will understand it this time! And then you turn the page. And then the trail disappears. No matter how many times you go back and forth over the ground, there is now a chasm in your understanding as big as the Central Rift Valley. I first had this experience years ago reading Bertrand Russell's account of special relativity. All was well, and suddenly, darkness descended. I took the book to a friend who is a physicist at Lawrence Livermore, and asked, \\"Why can't I understand this?\\" He took a look, \\"You don't understand it because he has left out the following (very long list of) points.\\" Thus I learned that it is OK to be simple minded in the world of science. Almost a gift, really.Of particular note because of their exceptional clarity are the sections on: quantum interference, superposition, angular momentum, antimatter, gauge theory, isospin, Yang-Mills fields, the color field, symmetry and symmetry breaking. First published in 1995, the book has too little to say on string theory, but prophesied that supersymmetrical theories will lead the way in mapping what was then the frontier. Please Mr. Icke, update your book!Physics, as Feynman said, keeps the simple stuff. The rest goes to chemistry, biology and engineering. Probably the line that most readers of Icke's book are sure to remember is this one: \\"Physics is not difficult; it's just weird.\\" A funny little assertion, yet one that points in the direction of the kind of knowledge that physics is. The physics of the twentieth and early twenty-first centuries has introduced us to a universe too strange (in the lexical sense) to even be imagined. Physics, in its many acts of discovery, has taken us further outside of ourselves than any other human study. The exploration of physics, by lay persons and physicists alike, is a thrilling adventure. It is science become natural philosophy, once again. Better than any other book of its kind, I found Vincent Icke's book to motivate this exploration. The last words are his: \\"in the book of physics, there never is a final sentence.\\""},{"Title":"The Force of Symmetry","review":"First, I feel I must refer back to F.A. Muller's review (also on this page, titled &quot;Erros Abound&quot;).Vincent Icke, the writer of &quot;the force of Symmetry&quot;, *did* actually study theoretical physics (on the same university that Mr. Muller now resides) so I'm a little surprised to find that he &quot;shouldn't really understand fundamental physics&quot;.Actually, Mr. Icke studied under Tini Veltman, who won the Nobel Prize for Physics recently (together with Gerard 't Hooft) and is now professor of astrophysics (Leiden university) and cosmology (Amsterdam university).I think &quot;the Force of Symmetry&quot; is an excellent primer on the subject of quantum behavior, relativity and symmetry. Besides (in my humble opinion) understanding, it's written with dry humour and love for the subject, and that's highly catching.It urged me to want to know more on the subject(s), which is exactly what I'm going to do. So beware - it might catch on you too ;-)"},{"Title":"The Force of Symmetry","review":"This book deserves a much wider readership. I think a layperson can not only grok most of the modern physics content in Icke but also see the motivation for why modern physics is formulated the way it is.

Layout could be improved however, having something like a rules/character creation/background arrangment with each in a seperate section would be better I think. As for content, if they could have written a new discipline to demonstrate step by step how the process goes, it would be better. Plus some more info on day to day(or night to night) lives of the thin blooded vamps and their dhampir children, sort of a &quot;Thin-Blooded survival guide&quot; like Mage: The Asscensions &quot;Orphans Survival Guide&quot; but the book is still a great resource and details pivotal WOD events. Salubri are no longer the rarest of the clans... you'll have to read it to find out why."},{"Title":"Time of Thin Blood (Vampire: The Masquerade)","review":"This isn't the book for the gamers who want a supplement to contain more bitchin' powers and the (apparent) answers to some of the great mysteries of the game setting.Instead, this is jumping in at the deep end of the desperation, confusion and madness of the end of the world, as the vampires see it. Fourteen and fifteen generations later, the power of Caine's curse is wearing off, and vampires are being created who are more human and less vampire than those who have come before them. They aren't masters of the night, they aren't capable of living as humans. They're pathetic creatures living in fear and ignorance, not even knowing that there's an entire World of Darkness ready to do them in for reasons they won't live long enough to learn.Instead of the high Gothic opera of most &quot;Vampire: The Masquerade&quot; games, &quot;Time of the Thin Blood&quot; is a squalid, brutish and brutal game supplement that stinks of fear sweat and, along the way, gives reasons for the rest of the vampires to be sweating blood along with the thin-blooded.And, of course, there are some bitchin' new powers: The thin-blooded can't do much of what more potent vampires can do, but they can do some things that none of their elders (and betters) can do, including make babies. The rules for these half-human/half-vampire dhampires are also given. Would a player want to play one? Not most players in most games. But &quot;Time of the Thin Blood&quot; works best on its own (with the core rulebook, of course) or for the rare player who doesn't want to be a Lestat-like master of the night.And there's also some answers to the big questions, or at least an apparent answer that poses some bigger questions. The game master-only section at the back tells a brief tale: Something very old and very nasty wakes up in India, the supernatural world rises against it, and the world of VtM changes, getting more desperate and somewhat less populated ...This is the stuff of nightmares and urban legends. Good stuff. Pick it up."},{"Title":"Time of Thin Blood (Vampire: The Masquerade)","review":"Ok, I love the beginning and for those who've read the &quot;ghoul book&quot; you'll recall the fine Malkavian doctor and his ghoul assistant as they now share their research into the &quot;thin blooded&quot; vampires and these strange new creatures some of them can parent. I also loved the insights from the thin-blooded themselves. However, I still had some questions such as when these 15th generation vampires first appeared and any connections to other ancients arising. Also I felt that the &quot;story-like&quot; sections were merely repeated in later sections and that the insights on character creation is not as strong as in other books. Also why would 13th or 14th gen kindred even be trying to make others? And why are 15th gen so interested in sex when supposedly other gens aren't? How much of this is propaganda? I know, I'm a stroyteller, I can make this stuff up, but I had hoped for better guidelines."},{"Title":"Time of Thin Blood (Vampire: The Masquerade)","review":"In theory, this book is a powerful tool for any Storyteller with a mature troope. The thin-blooded are a force to be reckoned with; their power is small but they numbers are unimaginable. Are these the Final Nights? The Book of Nod would seem to suggest so (according to this book), but what of it? There are Cainites so weak that the Sun no longer burns their flesh, vampires so far removed that they can bear breathing children.In this book are excellent rules for designing a discipline (or powers within a discipline), a subject rarely touched before. I have odd feelings about the subject of Dhampirs, the children of the thin-blooded, but this book portrays them marvelously. So much thought is put into these systems that I can hardly restrain my chronicles from overusing thin-blooded plots.Why just four stars then? That draws upon the overall readability. The grammar style of the authors is different from that of most other White Wolf publications. It's choppier and harder to read. Entire pages are written like notebooks, cutting up their readability factor. And the notes are, in some ways, no less than cheasy. The authors have reached out on a limb, which subsequently broke.Still, don't be discouraged. The thin-blooded are a wonderful plot point and excellent chronicle focus. They have fatal flaws counterbalanced by powerful assets that strike fear into the hearts of Elders. The Final Nights are here, embrace them."},{"Title":"Time of Thin Blood (Vampire: The Masquerade)","review":"I really liked the idea of &quot;thin blooded&quot; vampires, for two reasons. One, they are weaker (but they can shine) than everyone else. This is good for me from a StoryTellers point of view. One thing I can't stand is power-gamers. Since the Thin-blooded can make thier own disiplines, this gives me (the story teller) a measure of control, but can make them good characters. Second with Thin-blooded ones, they ARE weaker, so that makes them a challenge to play, and I love a challenge.Also this supplement was necesary. With some players being 13th Generation Vampire make their own childer, and this goes into detail on the information of 14th and 15th Gen Vampires.Finally Dhampirs... If I understand how Dhampirs work, they are essentally masterless ghouls, right?

I found this book very enjoyable."},{"Title":"Adrenaline and Stress: The Exciting New Breakthrough That Helps You Overcome Stress Damage","review":"When I began experiencing bizarre physical symptoms several years ago, I began getting very frightened. Cancer? MS? Lupus? Brain tumor?Test after medical test showed me to be quite healthy, with no discernable problems. When doctors suggested \\"stress,\\" I dismissed it as a junk diagnosis, thinking \\"why don't you just say you don't know instead of blaming stress for everything.\\" Turns out, though, that they were right.Stress is much, much worse for us than previously imagined. It does not just affect us primarily mentally or with the occassional headache or indigestion...it can profoundly alter our body to the point of near disability. I know -- because it has happened to me.This book came as a godsend in helping me understand what was happening to my body, and why. It was the book that opened my eyes to the connection between stress and the adrenal glands, and the profound affect that prolonged exposure to stress can have on our hormonal system. Many physicians poo-poo the idea that the adrenals can eventually become exhausted because they reason that adrenaline goes up (not down) when the body is under stress. Hart shows that while such reasoning is correct, it is only half correct. Eventually, the body can no longer sustain the continual demand for over-production of adrenaline and the body will crash. When that happens, the physical results are profoundly severe.Although Hart spends less time in the book dealing with the most serious stage of stress exhaustion - adrenal depletion - he was the first author that alerted me to this very real condition, and hence helped me on my journey to finding out what was wrong and how to get much-needed help for recovery from a debilitating condition.Most have been conditioned to believe that stress will only manifest itself as eventual coronary problems. While this is true for some people - the heart attack out of the blue - there are a host of other physical symptoms that while perhaps not life-threatening, can render a person's quality of life completely destroyed. There is a significant body of evidence, for example, to show that chronic fatigue syndrome and fibromyalgia are simply the body's response to prolonged, chronic, unresolved stress.I believe that anyone who deals with stress - from mild to severe - will benefit from this book. Knowing the dangers and warning signals of too much stress are vitally important in today's ultra-demanding pace of life.My only critique is that I wished he would have discussed the concept of adrenal fatigue or adrenal exhaustion in more detail. However, that topic is adequately addressed in other books - particularly \\"Chronic Fatigue Unmasked\\" by Gerald Poesnecker."},{"Title":"Adrenaline and Stress: The Exciting New Breakthrough That Helps You Overcome Stress Damage","review":"Well informed, somewhat technical read.

This book is a must read for all physicians, counselors, pastors, and other members of the helping professions who work with individuals who are in crisis. If you are an individual who lives life on the edge, always running in high gear, Stress and Adrenaline will teach you invaluable tools to help you learn to relax and live longer."},{"Title":"Adrenaline and Stress: The Exciting New Breakthrough That Helps You Overcome Stress Damage","review":"I received my first copy of this book several years ago while I was enduring tons of stress. Not only did this book help me to identify with the adrenaline/stress issues, but it pointed to a way out. Yes, I found it helpful that every bit of helpful advice does not have to come in a bottle of pills; though I am not knocking medications for needed issues. Stress is something that we can choose to perceive as impending doom, or a little skip in the road. Archibald Hart does a very nice job showing how some Biblically related principles can help one to overcome stress. We were not wired for all of this anhedonia in the first place.I would hesitate to have a few of my \\"Type H\\" friends read this book at certain times. Hostile or hyper people are sometimes hoping to keep their adrenaline pumped for reasons of performance, and they are many times not worried about future problems that may result from this. They sure would be the fist to benefit from this, and I hope many will take the subtle information to heart. It is worth the timeless details of sorting thru, as one can still see that adrenaline is killing us in many ways. It does have many functions, but not at the levels and seemingly addicted ways of being maintained.Adrenaline junkies may actually find this book interesting. It won't keep you from loving your sport or adventure, but perhaps managing a few issues that friends or family have been hesitating to tell you!!Yes, this is a Christian directed book, but it does not have to serve believers only. I would see very little that would upset a totally secular audience, and actually have been a little less interested in a few of Archibald's meditation ideas. Those do not appeal to me quite as much, as it really seems more important to get to the root of the problem. The Stressor does not always have to be avoided or thrown out, rather looked upon with a healthy perspective.Yeah, now that is getting to the root of the issue."},{"Title":"Adrenaline and Stress: The Exciting New Breakthrough That Helps You Overcome Stress Damage","review":"i heard about the book while listening to Dr Hart and his daughter teach at an AACC Conference. i am engaged in an occupation which involves high levels of daily stress and did survive a heart attack so the prospect of reading an informative book of this nature peaked my interest. i must report it was a profound book of: needed information, challenging-supported truth, tender understanding, immediate and long term solutions and finally an \\"it is up to you\\" finish.

As someone who thrives on projects and challenges and finds relaxing a royal waste of my time here on earth, this was a wakeup call. As a Christian, I particularly enjoyed this book, but people from any faith will benefit from this book, as it is soundly scientific.

So many people just go for a name even when they are unsure of the accurate meaning because they like the sound, or choose a name that is the flavor of the season in their home countries, or resort to very standard names. Searching on the internet for a baby name is risky because a lot of websites contain incorrect or incomplete meanings for Muslim names. There are a few other Muslim baby name books besides this one, but The Complete Book of Muslim and Parsi names is the most extensive and the meanings given are 100% accurate. Muslim names generally come from Arabic, Persian, and Turkish and this book contains a vast selection of names from all three languages (though far less Turkish) including language of origin, meaning, and relevent famous historical figure with the name. If you own this book you are guaranteed that you can select a name and know the sound meaning. The book uses a simple transliteration system to ensure correct pronunciation from Farsi and Arabic. Unfortunately, neither Arabic nor Nastaliq scripts are used as a supplement, but if you understand the book's transliteration system you can easily figure out the spelling in Arabic/Farsi. Another minor problem with the book is that the \\"ta marboota\\" in Arabic feminine names is sometimes written as T and sometimes as H. In Arabic it is silent, but Urdu speakers pronounce the T (like saying Amanah in Arabic as Amanat in Urdu). If the authors revise this book they should choose one system to follow and not jump back and forth between H and T. Technically you could pronounce it either way depending on whether you want to use Arabic or Urdu pronunciation for your baby's name, so it is not that big of a deal. Perhaps the authors could just add that information into the introduction, for that is the book's only flaw. Anyway, it is a GREAT book. It also contains names from Zoroastrian mythology, but if Muslims are concerned about that, it is easy to tell which names those are so there is no chance of choosing a Parsi mythological name for your baby. If you are an Arabic, Farsi, or Urdu language student, this book is great for you just from a linguistic stand point. It is just an all around useful and enriching book for your shelf."},{"Title":"The Complete Book of Muslim and Parsi Names","review":"This book is great with meaning and sheer volume of names. However if youre a parent looking for a name for your child there is one major draw back - IT IS NOT DIVIDED INTO MALE AND FEMALE NAMES!

The authors do not even comment in the introduction about the reasons they've excluded this major aspect of the naming.I was excited to receive this book then disappointed when I got it - I now have to wade through the huge book from A-Z making guesses as to which names are masculine and which are feminine.

Muhammad is the most common Muslim name. Prophet Muhammad is supposed to have said &quot;Whoever is named after me with the hope of being blessed, he will be blessed and will be in peace till the Day of Qayamat&quot;. Then other names like Abdu'llah (the servant of Allah), Adhu'r Rahman (servant of the merciful one) are explained.

An interested and speciality of this book is that the Actual Meaning, the Construed Meaning and those connected to History or Mythology are indicated. This makes the book different from others. The book ends with Bibliography.Male and Female names are neither indicated nor separated, causing little inconvenience to the readers.

In addition to drawing together their ground-breaking empirical work, the authors use these results to describe a theory of language learning that emphasizes the role of multiple cues and forces in development. They show how infants shift their reliance on different aspects of linguistic input, moving from a bias to attend to prosodic information to a reliance on semantic information, and finally to a reliance on the syntax itself.&quot;"},{"Title":"The Origins of Grammar: Evidence from Early Language Comprehension (Language, Speech, and Communication)","review":"This book is a wonderful addition to anyone's linguistic library.

Try reading three pages of this pompous windbag's book!"},{"Title":"Contract as Promise","review":"In this excellent treatise, Harvard Law professor Charles Fried argues that the law of contract is founded on a few simple moral principles governing the practice of promise-making and promise-keeping. Dealing by turns with the formation of contracts, the importance of \\"consideration,\\" the appropriateness of damages in case of breach, the problems of e.g. duress and unconscionability (and the special difficulties they pose for his account), and a variety of other topics that will be familiar to legal scholars and law students alike, Fried briefly, economically, and effectively rationalizes contract law on this unabashedly moral foundation.In this he is going against the tide and harking back to the \\"classical\\" understanding of contract law. But he is not uncritical of that tradition and is quite willing to lambaste it when necessary -- as with, for example, the traditional unwillingness to award damages for certain cases of fraud on the misguided argument that no contract had actually been formed in such cases. (On this point he holds -- in my view quite rightly -- that traditional thinkers were \\"supremely guilty\\" of a tremendous nonsequitur.)On the contrary, he is keenly aware both that contract law is a bulwark of liberty in allowing us to order our own affairs, _and_ that contractual obligations are not the only obligations there are -- indeed that contractual obligation itself cannot get off the ground unless we have a prior, unchosen moral obligation to abide by our promises. In this respect he is a breath of fresh air compared with certain pseudo-libertarian writers and pop-culture icons who reduce all moral obligations to those voluntarily assumed by contract (and I am thinking here specifically of Ayn Rand, among others). Fried is both a true philosopher and a genuine liberal in the classical sense of the term.I concur with the other reviewer's recommendation of this eminently readable little book to One-Ls. Fried is in general very powerful on the importance of philosophy to law, and here he is at his strongest in arguing for the importance of moral philosophy to contract law.I also recommend it to the libertarian and classical-liberal readership as a fine example of real philosophy of law."},{"Title":"Contract as Promise","review":"Professor Fried (former U.S. Solicitor General) is quite possibly the most erudite professor at Harvard Law School. His precision and exacting analysis shine through in his treatment of what some see as a dying academic field, the Law of Contracts. His perspective on the classic cases and extensive treatment of the major doctrinal elements of the subject is absolutely refreshing. Particularly, because his core premise is so intuitive--that it is morally wrong to break one's word and worse yet, to lie, therefore private contracts derive their legal force from essentially, what our parents taught us as children. If you are looking for a break from the typical law school fare or are just curious about what a different perspective looks like, you cannot go wrong with Professor Fried.Also recommended for Law Students: Mary Ann Glendon - Rights Talk"},{"Title":"A Ship's Tale","review":"The old square-rigger Bonnie Clyde, a derelict ship, was slated to be scrapped. Or so the British Admiralty thought. How she ended up in a gale with an unlikely crew is the focus of N. Jay Young's delightful novel, A Ship's Tale. The reader is treated to the antics of a group of men brought together in 1946 by their love of the sea and the desire to preserve a piece of their country's maritime heritage. And so, the salvage work begins in earnest, and in secret, to spirit Bonnie Clyde to Scotland from her present home on the Thames.When Flynn, a former Royal Navy Officer, comes upon the ship and throws in his lot with Bowman, Harris, Edward and Boris, little does he realize that the next few weeks will be a: challenge to all and will permanently alter their lives. Yet, in spite of such obstacles as government officials, Flynn's regular job, and the persistent shortages in England after the war, they manage to hatch a very clever scheme. Each participant in this \\"piracy\\" has specific jobs that usually require intrigue and more than a little bending of the law. Little by little, though, they come together to form a cohesive crew.And what a crew it is. Besides the old seafarers, there are 20 untested crewmen, an unlikely stowaway and a very surprising cook. How they join talents to make the plan work is the treat. We find ourselves willing accomplices in their ruses, admiring their cleverness and cheering them along.Seamen are like a fraternity and a number of them-including a U.S. Navy submarine become co-conspirators who use their boats to help the ship evade detection and surrender once spotter planes, MTB's (motor torpedo boats) and the Coast Patrol get into the act. A reporter, sympathetic to the mission of Bonnie Clyde and aware of a rollicking good story when he sees one, manages to get the British public on the side of the crew as well. That certainly gives the Admiralty something to think about.Friends on land, with the help of ham radio operators, are able to keep the crew abreast of what's being published in the papers and how far the investigation by Scotland Yard has proceeded.The first half of A Ship's Tale pulls the reader into the plotting by the crew, not only revealing what's being done to prepare the square-rigger for her rescue from the scrap heap, but also giving us very defined characters. Young weaves together the various subplots very deftly, so that, even though you want to know what ultimately happens to the ship, you can savor the time the author takes in setting the scene and building the background. You don't want to rush through this part; there are revelations and laughs when you least expect them.The rest of the book, of course, covers the journey to Dumbarton, Scotland. At this point, you've gotten to know the characters really well, and Young puts the 'reader right next to then}' wherever the action on the ship takes place. This is good, clear writing that lets even the landlubber understand what's going on. Young also does a neat job wrapping up the crew's individual stories. All of which makes A Ship's Tale a satisfying, highly enjoyable read. --Liz Shaw"},{"Title":"A Ship's Tale","review":"This review was written by a friend who has read the book. Based on her review, I will definitely have to check it out myself!From Mrs. Leslie Finertie, OrindaWell written and easy to read, A Ship's Tale has it all: Bungling bureaucrats, a sweet romance, the draw of the sea, and salty characters from around the UK and their interactions with each other found me laughing out loud.Set in England, the reader catches a glimpse of pub life from the back room and the resilience of the British people who turn bomb craters into duck ponds or drag their foot to stop their brakeless car.The first half of the book finds the characters we learn to love preparing the Bonnie Clyde, a square-rigger soon to be scuttled, for escape and a final voyage unknown to the powers that be.In the second half, the Admiralty, and Scotland Yard, tries to apprehend the Bonnie Clyde and its crew. Storms, clever diversions, and public opinion give our heroes a chance to outwit the entire British Admiralty, astonish its government, and made modern technology nearly obsolete in this effort. The ending was a complete surprise which brought tears through the cheering.Anyone who enjoys the twists and turns of a good adventure story, cheers for the underdog, or routinely gets lost in a book full of loveable characters, will find much to enjoy in A Ship's Tale."},{"Title":"A Ship's Tale","review":"This is a story about preservation.

I realize that the writers assume the reader already possesses a clear understanding of Flash and will proceed from there. However that is not the problem, but is rather that in may examples the writers are far from clear on where they are going. And there are many errors.

These topics go pretty deep. But that's where the fun is."},{"Title":"Flash 5 Advanced for Windows and Macintosh Visual QuickPro Guide (With CD-ROM)","review":"I am not a large fan of the Quick Start guides and have been reluctant to try the Quick Pro series. But on a friends recommendation I picked it up. Boy was i surpised. This book is well written, and &quot;not&quot; a beginners book. Too many books promoted as intermediate are more beginner than intermediate but this one is quite helpful.The writing is concise and easy to understand and follow. I picked up more than enough tips in this book to justify the cost"},{"Title":"Flash 5 Advanced for Windows and Macintosh Visual QuickPro Guide (With CD-ROM)","review":"This book is simply a wonderful inpiration not just because it provides a wealth of information without drawn out-dumbed down diatribe, but because it also literally inspires designers to immediately get to work with the new concepts presented throughout the material.This book is not for the lighthearted flash beginner who needs their hands held through each step. It provides clear and quick instructions for working web developers that have actual projects to do and deadlines to work with. Keep in mind, the cover says, &quot;Flash 5 ADVANCED.&quot; This means that the book is for those who know how to use flash but want to tweak their web site's visual attraction and begin thinking about creating an enviornment for dynamic content and easy data manipulation and maintenance.Nevertheless, this book is not a comprehensive reference for flash 5 programmers. It is merely a tool to get your site looking and behaving more professionally off the bat...and is more of a catalyst to your professional advancement with flash 5 rather than a complete foundation from which your skill stands. It opens the doors of possibility...but once you get to the other side, it's all up to you!Buy this book. If you flash, you should own it. I also suggest the &quot;friends of ed&quot; series...ie: &quot;Foundation Actionscript&quot; &amp; &quot;Flash 5 Studio.&quot; The new Flash 5 Bible just came out too...although I haven't read it yet, I will buy it because the bible books are usually brilliant reference tools. Speaking of which, if you don't know javascript, you need to, so but the Javascript Bible while you're at it. If you are serious about being a flash programmer for a living...these books are all invaluable and truly rewarding investments into your future."},{"Title":"Flash 5 Advanced for Windows and Macintosh Visual QuickPro Guide (With CD-ROM)","review":"I bought this book a number of years ago, when I was struggling with creating effective animations, and Actionscript really intimidated me. Right now I'm enjoying a productive career doing professional Flash work, and I wouldn't be as proficient at Flash if it weren't for this book.I'm the kind of person who likes to develop my own skills and techniques instead of 'formulaically' imposing someone else's techniques into my work. This book is perfect! It doesn't waste any time on 'How to draw a circle!', and gets straight to teaching the critical foundation skills of making good Flash. Don't worry though, it isn't one of those 'Bibles', but at the same time it isn't about creating one big project through the course of the book.In my opinion, this book is the perfect balance between reference and teaching. It gives you the solid skills and techniques on how to lay down advanced flash, which fully eliminates the mystery of things, so you can then expand on these techniques with your own innovation.What's best, I keep coming back to -this- one book, even in these days of Studio MX 2004 Pro, for an effective reference manual. At the time of writing this review, I'm working on an interactive skeletal system for my animations, and paged to the section on angles and math to help me create proper rotating limbs.I recommend this book to anyone who wants to become a Flash master!"},{"Title":"Improving Your Study Skills: Study Smart, Study Less.

This might be good for a high schooler."},{"Title":"Catch Phrases, Cliches and Idioms: A Dictionary of Familiar Expressions","review":"My Mom wrote this book \\"back in the day\\". She's passed on now, but while she was alive she worked 20+ years as an advertising executive for a major ad agency in Chicago (Remember the Alberto VO5 commercials with Rula Lenska? She wrote all those).I followed a different career path, albeit one that has allowed me to write the occasional journal article, but I'm not a creative writer. That being said, my impression of this book is that it's great for coming up with a catchy phrase that you almost--but can't quite--remember. Something that's \\"on the tip of your tongue\\", so to speak ;) (and yes, that would be in the book!)I remember when Mom wrote this she said it would be good for advertising students, writers, English and literature students, and the like. I agree. And while she worked on this book specifically for several years, in reality she compiled all of these in her mind over a lifetime spent working in the ad business, radio and TV; from the 40's to the 90's, and from Minneapolis to Michigan Avenue. The fruits or her labors would be a worthwhile and useful addition to any writer's reference bookshelf."},{"Title":"The Shifting Heart","review":"The Shifting Heart is an erotic tale of two women, Megan and Ivy, and the otherworldly men with whom they fall in love. The story takes place in what I took to be roughly the Victorian era. The two women are constrained by their families and the roles forced on them by their society, and heartbreak is inevitable. Along the way there is tragedy, betrayal, and a great deal of sex!While the story was poignant and haunting in many places, I was distracted often by editing errors. Overly convoluted grammar, wrong-homonym use, and the like were par for the course. It took me out of the story somewhat.I also thought that the last death in the story--though I won't say who died--was maybe one death too many. It didn't seem to further the plot in the way that the other deaths did. It only seemed to add an extra cloud of gloom to an already dark story."},{"Title":"Embattled Island: Palau's Struggle for Independence","review":"Leibowitz's work is unique among the recent works done on Palau in that he is not as condemning of the United States as his predecessors (Sue Roff, Ched Myers, Robert Aldirge, Roger Clark, John Hinck). In fact, he is critical of the &quot;advocates&quot; from the &quot;left&quot; and points out that Roff's work &quot;. . . is [a] very selective, one-sided telling of the tale, omitting, for example, any mention of Salii's death . . .&quot; Leibowitz's work is indeed valuable as it presents a different angle and does include some aspects of the &quot;tale&quot; which shed more light on the happenings of the 80's. Moreover, it is at least a bit more expansive in the sense that, unlike his literary predecessors, his work begins with Palau's earlier history and ends with the independence celebration. Of course, he has the advantage of time since independence celebration was held after Roff, Aldridge, Myers and others had published their works. But what of the United States role? For Leibowitz, the United States did fail in several ways including its delay of self-determination. However, the United States is not solely responsible for the troubles, he asserts, since the Palauans were in on the act as well. Palauans, Leibowitz argues contrarily to Aldridge and Myers &quot;society of people&quot; thesis, were competitive and self-confident people. They have a history of internal competition which explains much of the pro-Compact and pro-Constitution stances which the divergent camps took. Instead of a &quot;society of people&quot; theirs is more like a &quot;society of competitors.&quot; Moreover, Leibowitz argues that the pro-Constitution group were not as potent in their opposition if it were not for the liberal press and the legal aid provided by outside groups such as Greenpeace. In other words, the water could have been calmer in the Palau if outside meddling by interest groups was limited. The anti-Compact Palauans, therefore, were merely pawns controlled for the most part by the motives of outside gr! oups from the left. As for American neglect, it is regretful, Leibowitz concedes, but the United States was not necessarily deliberate in its neglect since it &quot;hated its own imperial role and seemed to take out its anger by providing stingy budgets for the islands.&quot; Leibowitz makes his case although he too is guilty of the same charge he makes, specifically that of the other writers' omission of other aspects of the &quot;tale.&quot; For instance, he fails to explain his views on some specifics such as the shots fired at the home of a staunch anti-Compact legislator (Sen. Olikong) as well as the overprinted ballots. These are just a few and Leibowitz's work is hence sketchy at times, not to mention its unclear or unspecified documentation. His halfhearted defense and sometimes evident admiration for Salii might be explained by the fact that he was the president's attorney at a critical point in the &quot;tale&quot; and when he accounts for some of his tasks under Salii, he seems to be taking on the role of a lobbyist more so than an attorney. Furthermore, and ironically for a lawyer, he seems to disregard or at least treat lightly the leftist legal argument that the Compact was indeed undermining the struggle for self-determination which in turn violates U.S. responsibilities provided in the Trusteeship Agreement. Other omissions can be noted but engaging each would be too tedious and perhaps might be overstepping the constraints of a short review."},{"Title":"The Frogs and Their Monster","review":"This book is an absolute delight.

Fleeing a depressing place in which she had recently been imprisoned, she goes on the run to find the one man she feels can help her. She needs to find the Prince of Venya in the hopes he can help her escape the wrath of her uncle. The man she finds is nothing like the stories and legends claim, but someone infinitely more intriguing.Florian barely held on to his life a fateful day many years ago, when the wretched King Richard killed his parents and took over the lands of Venya. As a result, he made a vow that no matter what the risk, he would one day rid his lands of Richard, and assume his rightful place as ruler. He has no time for a misguided young woman whom he feels is slightly mad... or does he?When Florian realizes Rose may be his greatest hope in ending the long years of war, he determines to make her his by fair means or foul, and sets his course. Little did either of them realize that they'd find their greatest strengths in each other... and a love that is the stuff legends are made of.This was a wonderful story! Ms. Minogue weaves a passionate tale, full of suspense, romance, mystery, and a healthy dose of the paranormal. Readers will venture in to the swashbuckling world of pirates, where no one is quite what they seem, and magic is the name of the game. The plot is swift moving and well developed, luring one in on the first page and holding tight until the final scenes unfold, surprising in their outcome.Rose is a brave woman, who puts all else before herself, never minding the risk to her own life. She is deeply passionate, highly intelligent, very caring, and in love with a legend. Florian has one mission in life and always has - to restore his people to their rightful land and to take his place as ruler of the magical land. He is strong willed, also very passionate, and finds himself taken with the young beauty who seeks his aid. When these two come together, their love is all consuming but not without its ups and downs.Magic, as mentioned before, is a primary player woven into the story. The \`filidhi', who fled Venya, are a people of great wisdom and none too lacking in magical abilities. Their skills come into play many times throughout the story, adding a mystical bend to the tale. Florian himself has some pretty impressive abilities, though one is kept in the dark as to what they are through much of the story, with the secret only being revealed when most necessary to the storyline. Also there are other fantastical beings in the story, like the Ilindrian race of people who have some unique traits of their own, and the sea-going merrow, who appear to be much like what is more commonly known as a mermaid. These beings add interesting facets to the story, making it the impressive fantasy it is.All of the secondary characters are rendered beautifully, with unique personalities. This reviewer was intrigued by many of them. There was the young brave Beylik, a former slave, Florian's surgeon, Sigurd who is not what he seems, the young Ilindrian shipmate Ashkii, King Cristobal of Sorlain, the filidhi Mage apprentice Caelan and the hated King Richard. Everyone adds depth and dimension to the story, making for a more than satisfying read.This was a fascinating story that this reviewer thoroughly enjoyed and would recommend highly. Also, she has a sneaking suspicion that there may be sequels yet to come, having found some characters just longing for their own stories to be told.Kelley A. Hartsell, December 2004.

I had the pleasure of meeting Ms. Minogue at a book signing event recently and I must say she is one of the nicest and most pleasant authors I've ever met. I purchased a few of her books and I am thoroughly impressed. I have never read any books in this genre before, but her writing style kept me glued to the pages. Whether you're into these types of novels or not, you should give them a try."},{"Title":"The Prince (Berkley Sensation)","review":"What a truly entertaining novel. The characters come alive, the setting incredibly real. I loved the blossoming love story, as well as the writer's extreme attention to detail. Ms. Minogue is a born story teller.

Richard has the ruling monarch and his wife killed, but Sir Ewan and a few other leaders manage to rescue seven year old Prince Florien.Eighteen years later, Princess Rose of Valinor escapes from her Uncle Richard. She seeks Florien as the only person who might keep her safe since she believes he would never sell her to his enemy her uncle. Rose meets Florien who rejects her contention that she is his enemy's niece, but takes her on his ship, the Quest.Rose convinces Florien that she is who she claims to be because of her knowledge of the atrocities perpetrated on his people. He still reels from the crushing of his Fheara tribesmen by Richard while the Filidh mages have made their home on another island and want to forget their heritage. Rose tells him that the Fheara feel abandoned by him and the mages. Florien wonders if Rose is part of the prophecy to regain Venya; by marrying her can he regain what he lost as his people will no longer fight for him, but would rally around his courageous Rose who he loves.This romantic fantasy contains magical elements that seem genuine and add depth especially an exciting Game of Kings contest that will remind fans of the wizards' fight in Disney's The Sword and the Stone. Fans will appreciate the strong female character, but also find fault with the obstinate Florien always insisting on going it alone. Well written so that the audiences of both genres will treasure, but the anticipated confrontation with the villain and the retaking back the Prince's lost land never happens.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"The Prince (Berkley Sensation)","review":"I wish this author had more books I could read!I really loved this book. The relationship between Rose and Florian wasn't overly sexed up, it was well paced and the story that went along with them was interesting and held my interest beyond their romance. If you like romance without the cheese, this one's for you."},{"Title":"The Prince (Berkley Sensation)","review":"Spoilers Exponentially:I was shocked by how much I enjoyed this book! I found a copy in some musk-infused book shop, and it has been living at the very bottom of my bookshelf ever since. About a week ago I plucked up The Prince with decidedly ambivalent intentions, and five or so hours later...I read the last sentence with one big smile on my face. Elizabeth (i.e. the not-Kylie) Minogue must be a romantic at heart because the love story in this book really sparkles (I mean that in the nicest possible way).Rose of Valinor may not have the brawn, but she practically effervesces intelligence and political savvy. On the run from a maniacal uncle (King Richard of Valinor) she maneuvers herself into the company of the legendary Prince of Venya, who at first acquaintance seems to be more lecher than savior. Prince Florian (who had to grow up with the name Florian, poor boy!) is a slutty pirate on the on the lamb from just about everyone. At first Rose is aghast at his presumably selfish behavior, but since she has nobody else to turn to, she hitches a ride on Florian's ship. But as her plans for a graceful escape allude her, Rose finds herself both confounded and pulled in by Florian's quiet suffering. It turns out that Florian the cad and the criminal is utterly devoted to his people (who were ousted from their homeland by none other than King Richard), and all of the riches he and his men pillage go to supporting the Venyan colony (which has no natural resources of its own). And ever since Florian received a prophecy suggesting that his death would bring about the return of the Venyans to their homeland he has accepted destiny as martyr for his people.Hijinks ensue. A few mages and mermaids are thrown in. The relationship between the two lead develops organically. And the writing is just superb. What fun!"},{"Title":"Manifold: Time","review":"If you want an entertaining look at parallel universes and the end of time, then take a pass on this book and pick up almost anything by Michio Kaku. Stephan Baxter's \\"Manifold: Time\\" is one of the most boring, academic, migraine-inducing treatments of quantum physics I have ever encountered. It's supposed to be a novel, but the cast of characters is shallow, their motivations unrealistic, and their choices insane. Most of the book is devoted to long, boring examinations of quantum physics. Stuff that excites astrophysicists but means little in the day-to-day life of most people. In this book Stephen Baxter makes a feeble effort to create a scenario where quantum concerns have daily application, but winds up spending more time explaining his vision of reality than telling his story.If you're looking for a treatise on quantum physics with an emphasis on time travel and hopping through parallel universes, then this book will please you. If you're looking for a realistic plot with complex characters facing insurmountable obstacles, then skip this book entirely."},{"Title":"Manifold: Time","review":"I tried. I really tried.The book is just one page after another of absolutely inane assumptions and completely illogical/contrary to real life ideas. At least the first half, couldn't get past that.SPOILER ALERT. Detailing a few of my gripes, can't even cover them all and that's just for the first half!!Ignoring the fact that Ancient greeks were good enough mathematicians that they could have made the same calculation supposedly \\"proving\\" that humanity would end 200 years later (among other things). I still rolled my eyes at the fact that a CEO would change many-million-dollars plans after a 40 second speech including nonsensical math by a random weirdo. Nevermind that said weirdo then went on to ask him to spend another few million on reading messages from far-future humans, thereby indicating that he himself didn't even believe in his silly idea of 200years to humanity extinction.Then came the genetically-engineered squid capable of mac-guyvering an extension to their habitat with a few tips to learn biology, chemistry etc over a few days. Suuuure. Next time the space station has a critical failure, we'll just send a squid to fix it since all those super-smart humans can't.Then there's humanity supposedly going crazy because wacko guy got on TV to say he had \\"proof\\" that everyone would be dead in 200 years. Yawn. Can't get people to care that the earth could be dying in ~50 years despite changes people can SEE and people would go crazy about something hundreds of years in the future with no proof whatsoever?Even that I tried to just gloss over, but that same humanity supposedly got \\"angry\\" at kids for being smart!!! And those supposedly super-smart kids can be rounded up and put in concentration camps by a sect without anyone raising a fuss??? Hundreds or thousands of them? uh...Not sure what planet this guy's writing about, but it just totally stopped being one I could relate to.Nevermind that those kids are all put there not to develop their super-brains to help solve any of humanity's actual real, present issues. Nono. They just wanted one specific super-kid. How'd they know's not explained, and it's dumb luck that the kid got in while he could still put his thoughts on paper and someone happened to see it. Good thing he didn't arrive later when they weren't given paper (or much of anything) anymore.Oh yeah, and the part that just made me give up is when the main characters manage to extrapolate what future beings were doing in space and all they were capable of, in a few minutes of watching pictures of future space.I love that it's supposed to be because future beings will be \\"constrained\\" by the laws of Physics. Good thing those immutable perfect and complete laws of physics were discovered in the past 40 years or so, as otherwise the book would have been \\"we're going to all die in 200 years\\" \\"oh ok\\". The end.Of course, no other game-changing refinements/new laws of physics that completely change how we see/understand the universe(s) will be discovered in the next Trillion-billion-gazillion years. No, we just happened to figure all those out in the past few years.If at least that'd been short. But noooo it goes on for pages and pages and pages of looking a few million years, then billions then trillion billions etc!! And when the main character looks at a fuzzy \\"picture\\" of space in a million billion years in the future and basically says that those guys must suck and be stupid since they can't do a better job... that just blew me away. How utterly inept do you have to be to make such a comment when you know you can't know???So yeah, just skip it. ReadEnder's Gameinstead or something."},{"Title":"Manifold: Time","review":"I must give Baxter four stars for even attempting a doomsday script. End-of-the-universe stories present little personal edification or box office value. However, this is as much a cosmology textbook as it is a novel. Rewarding as it may be to plow through, it would be best to read the ten books and articles mentioned in the Afterword before settling down to read the story. Unmotivated, abstruse theories on cosmology and physics spout out from several characters none of who survive to the ending. Real obstacles to enjoying the story. It is one matter to frame a story with hard science and theory but Baxter tries to use this story to explore too many speculative (he says real) topics such as black holes, false vacuums, probabilistic doomsday, Feynman radio waves from the future, quark nuggets, proton decay and on and on and on. All this is at the expense of developing characters and keeping the action moving.To go downstream in time was to travel into the future. The gimmick used to save the principle character Reid from his doomsday was to fling his dead body through the \\"blue portal\\"--\\"downstream,\\" where he is reconstructed. Just another Alice's Through the Looking Glass device. (Yes, he died, but his spectral self is downstream or up above watching.) As to narration, too frequent shiftings from the first person to the third person for no apparent reason are problematic. For example, the narrator reveals Emma's innermost thoughts but when the crying \\"Blue Kids\\" embrace her we read: \\"And maybe she{Emma} was weeping too; it was hard to tell.\\" The reader often wonders who is telling this story -- I still don't know.As long as his characters stayed within one time frame I could identify and care about them, but when they were flung into the future or brought back from the dead they became like disembodied mouths spouting gobbledygook. When a character died this didn't mean finality because she might be raised from the dead ten pages later. Parts of the story became unattached, unframed and incomprehensible even to the fictive characters involved. I got the idea there was enough material printed here for a trilogy. What I found myself reading was the Author's notebook for a novel. All this is not to say that a physics professor wouldn't find the story a much easier and enjoyable read than I did."},{"Title":"Manifold: Time","review":"While the main character, Reid Malenfant, seems at time to be nothing more than a foil for other characters, the plot and ideas more than make up for this slight detraction. A facinating look that combines various ideas from as far back as twenty years ago. Very reminisicent of &quot;2001&quot; in its sense of wonder. But since it is a substantially larger book, the ideas are bigger and more numerous. Baxter's predictions of the future are disquieting because of how logical he has extrapolated his ideas. A near flawless science fiction novel."},{"Title":"Manifold: Time","review":"Isaac Asimov once said a good SF writer will ask his reader to suspend disbelief only once. Here, Stephen Baxter asks us to do it, oh, 472 times (once per page). There is nothing remotely plausible about anything that happens in this book. It reminds me of a typical &quot;postmodern&quot; Hollywood movie-- stitched together from parts of other books or movies, never bothering to pretend that anything here could actually take place. Sections of &quot;Children of the Damned&quot; and &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot; are lifted whole, as are long passages of Stephen Hawking's &quot;A Brief History of Time.&quot; OK, so it's intended to be a &quot;romp&quot; of sorts through the latest loopy theories about space-time and multiple universes. At least he could have made it a fun, engaging romp, instead of a grueling, depressing one.&quot;Manifold: Time&quot; ranks as a major disappointment for this reader, who after devouring &quot;Voyage&quot; and &quot;Titan&quot; was well on his way to becoming a Baxter fan. But here, all of the negative habits that were merely annoying in his earlier efforts completely take over the work. As noted by other reviewers, there are no true &quot;characters&quot; here, only a series of pompous names attached to long blasts of expository &quot;dialogue.&quot; Everyone-- even six-year-old kids-- talks like a nuclear physicist. Baxter's deep pessimism about the human race, his contempt for all forms of religion (but especially Christianity), and his apparent fascination with doomsday theories take center stage here, while the gritty, nuts-and-bolts realism and sense of adventure that made &quot;Voyage&quot; and parts of &quot;Titan&quot; so enjoyable are completely lacking. A Brit, he displays a puzzling lack of knowledge about how the U.S. government works, investing a mere congresswoman with all kinds of executive decision-making powers. But the worst sin is to make the notion that multiple universes might exist somehow boring! For a real &quot;romp&quot; through quantum physics and space-time, read Michael Crichton's &quot;Timeline.&quot; It may be a piece of fluff, but at least you won't kick yourself for having wasted your time reading it, as I did with &quot;Manifold: Time.&quot;"},{"Title":"Manifold: Time","review":"This was my first Baxter novel and I don't think it was good enough to get me to read another. It wasn't horrible or anything, but it was too far out there for my tastes. I want my sci-fi to be somewhat believable for me. I need to buy into the innovations and concepts to truly enjoy it. Yeah, it might never happen, but I need to think that maybe it could. I could not buy into the squids in this book and although the &quot;universe views&quot; were interesting, I couldn't accept the resolution of the book. I don't want to say more without wrecking it. I enjoyed the characters and Baxter's style and parts I found humorous. And there was certainly enough good here to get me through the novel. It started wonderfully and then got weird, and I thought it might redeem itself, but in the end, I was shaking my head and wondering where this thing had gone. Manifold:Time is the first part of a trilogy, but I don't see myself coming back for the last two segments. It's just not my brand of sci-fi."},{"Title":"Manifold: Time","review":"I have never come across a novel like this one. Many are plot driven. The better ones are character driven. This one is really neither; it is science driven. To clarify, the driving force is science, but the pilot is humanism, with all its sometimes annoying egocentric glory. This book is simply a compilation of interesting scientific facts laid out around a very loose plot run by characters who don't have personalities.*non specific spoilers*Sure, it is fun to think about 'What if?' especially when it is asked about a small clutch of interesting scientific facts, and mathmatically proven ideas. But to think about it over and over and over again in the course of a novel which is designed to entertain is annoying. I would rather read the science in a complete form rather than in some souped up scifi where the fiction and the science intertwine.There are a few bits of bad writing here. Sometimes, Baxter uses unnecessary words to make it sound more scientific. For example, the squid was referred to as having \\"prehensile arms.\\" Well, all animalian \\"arms\\" are prehensile, otherwise there is no need for the anthropomorphism. Dogs, horses, pigs, etc. have forelimbs, but not arms. They are what we call four legged, since the forelimbs are not prehensile. Tails are the distinguishing limbs designed for the term prehensile, since not all animalian tails are prehensile. There are other examples, but the point is made...Describing Baxter's characters as flat doesn't even do it justice. These characters have less feelings than the settings in which they exist. Many times the settings are described in vivid living detail, yet the characters show no sign of life outside of the plot. They never say a word which does not directly impact the plot, to the point that every explanation of every event is never challenged, because there is only one interpretation. For example, a kid spins around and says he does it so that he can feel the stars pull him around. The explanation is that he is highly intellegent and highly sensitive to mass effects. Another explanation is he is just any dumb kid who likes to use simile.Another thing I didn't like is the overly sensitive stance on biological experiments; specifically the internal debate regarding the morality of experimenting on calamari. I like mine battered, fried, and with marinara sauce, please. But seriously, the author stated (in the notes at the end of the book) that the intellegent squid are real. What does that mean? Who knows? It is a safe assumption that the intellegent squid in question cannot pilot space vehicles yet. At least, I hope so, because the US has no anti-squid-terroist counter measures in place that I know of yet.The last thing is the \\"meta-message.\\" Humans are the most important intellegence in the universe. Humans must survive. Humans must outlive the universe. Humans must have some \\"higher purpose.\\" I understand humanism. I get it. I don't believe in it. I don't want to read a book (especially a humanist book) that flaunts itself as inspirational literature. It just seems like the author is saying that people cannot exist without religion, even if it is self worship. That is not the case.The book gets five stars for the incredible amount of information that went into it. But, Baxter loses three stars for the way he presented it.Still recommended, but don't expect to get great enjoyment from it."},{"Title":"Manifold: Time","review":"I bought this as a freebie, hoping to discover an author that I would like, and was gravely disappointed. There is such a thing as erudition getting in the way of the story, and while I have no problem with a whodunit, this book is just ridiculous. Not to mention, depressing - the entire second half of the book is about death: personal, global, universal. The denoument makes no sense, either, because it simply prolongs the ultimate fate."},{"Title":"Manifold: Time","review":"Usually a fan, but a somewhat tedious book unless you really enjoy quasi-hard SciFi. Science and physics appear showy and construed, writing is stilted. Malenfant emerges fully-formed as a foil and rapscalion, without any character development.

For one thing, Baxter is highly educated with advanced degrees in both mathematics and engineering. For another thing, Baxter served as an apprentice of sorts to that uber science fiction light Arthur C. Clarke (among other things the two co authored the Time's Eye series together). For yet another thing, Baxter has highly distinquished himself in his own, earning the right to author the authorized sequel to Time Machine (his award winning Time Ships which continues the future saga of the Morlocks).Like a planet revolving about its axis this book revolves around the future legendary Reid Malanfant, a sort Bill Gates/Howard Hughes hybrid who's future business is into everything from medicine to outer space. As one reads this book one easily detects the unabashed joy Baxter takes in speculating about all the wonderful future technologies the talented Mr. Malanfant has extended his company into.Most pertinent to the book however is Malanfant's desire to go to outer space. Having been denied earlier in life for astronaut training Malanfant has managed nothing less than to create his own space program with its own targets. At the suggestion of another character Malanfant's company sets sail for a near Earth asteroid whose most interesting property will remind readers of Arthur C. Clarke's immortal 2001: A Space Odyssey. In fact, watchful readers will see a lot of other great Clarke ideas in this book including his also immortal Childhood's End, and his Time's Eye series (which I guess Baxter lays more legitimate claim to because after he was at least the co author of THAT).To describe the plot or developments further I think would probably constitute the very defination of spoiler. However I think I can safely say that even science fiction savy readers will be satisfied with the novel combination of plot elements even if the elements themselves are recycled. Other than that I think I can guarantee science savy readers will be delighted at all the wonderful speculation Baxter brings out in this book about future technologies.And his punchline...this book's take on the Fermi Paradox...let's just say that when you get to it you won't feel like you wasted your time."},{"Title":"Manifold: Time","review":"The tantamount question of &quot;Manifold: Time&quot;--and, in fact, the entire series--is known as &quot;Fermi's paradox&quot;--if there is intelligent life elsewhere in the Universe, why haven't we found it yet? [This question is tackled further in the remaining books of the series, &quot;Space&quot; and &quot;Origin&quot;.]Setting the plot in motion is Cornelius Taine, who presents to ex-astronaut Reid Malenfant the (real) &quot;Carter catastrophe&quot;--the idea that humanity is likely to go extinct in the &quot;near future&quot; (200 years), *even if mankind colonizes space.* At first, Taine convinces Malenfant that it may be up to Malenfant to save the human race from the Carter catastrophe, and that salvation may come from a message that points to Cruithne, a satellite sharing Earth's orbit. But, as the plot progresses, Malenfant begins to question why he was brought to Cruithne.[I had the chance to speak to Baxter about the Carter hypothesis at a recent SF convention. He finds it intriguing, although he has his doubts, especially regarding Carter's analogy (a box with one special ball out of either 10 balls or 1000). In part, the &quot;e-mail&quot; containing ways to refute the Carter catastrophe represents his own doubts.]Moreover, Baxter intertwines this plot with the rise (and fall) of the &quot;Blues,&quot; a group of preternaturally gifted children. In the end, Baxter provides a possible answer to Fermi's paradox--and it is an extremely startling one.If you look carefully, there *is* one medium-sized plot hole with the final part of the book, although it isn't immediately obvious (in fact, it was only on a second reading that I caught it myself). That gaffe aside, this book is a thought-provoking, challenging work, and I look forward eagerly to finishing the trilogy.Additional recommendations: I would recommend this book to fans of &quot;Earth&quot; by David Brin and &quot;Mother of Storms&quot; by John Barnes, and vice versa."},{"Title":"Manifold: Time","review":"You've got to admire Stephen Baxter for undertaking such a difficult project: an adventure across the slopes of time, evolution and the universe to find humanity's place. I think he pulls it off. Some of the concepts were difficult, but the characters are there searching for understanding as well. It's a fun and wondrous read. This book stands with 2001, Fantastic Voyage and even Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy."},{"Title":"Manifold: Time","review":"Only read this book if you like cardboard characters, flawed premises, whiny pseudo-spiritual nonsense and don't need a plot to keep your interest. The real point of this book is for the author to hypothesize about how a far-future civilization might harness every possible watt of energy in a dying universe, and to whine about the non-eternal nature of the universe. The central them is that a thousand-trillion years of existence isn't enough and that life is only worth living if the life-span of the universe is eternal. Yeah, it doesn't make sense in the book either.The characters are cardboard...of the worst sort. We have central casting's hero/industrialist right out of Ayn Rand, his sycophantic (ex)wife who improbably follows him into space, the know-it-all mystic advisor who is always right, and the genius children who everyone brutally abuses..for no apparent reason. None of these characters have personalities beyond their central casting role, their voices are identical and most of them are superfluous to the story.The premises are flawed, for example if a generation of geniuses are born, every culture on the planet will respond by locking them in concentration camps and brutally abusing them. Sure, Steve, lot of precedent for that in history... Wait, here's a better one: Do you realize it is more cost effective to send a mission into space using surplus space-shuttle components and old airline navigation systems (Loran anyone...?) than it is to use commercially available lift vehicles? Oh, and you can save even more by skipping tests...that's where NASA went wrong. Just patch the parts together with bailing wire and ignite the engines because that is a more efficient way to reach space. Wait...another of Steve's clever cost saving premises: breed a new species of super-smart squid, train them to perform the mission, launch a full deep-sea biosphere to support the squid...yes, this is sure to be less costly than sending humans into space with caned air and freeze-dried food using mature, highly reliable technologies. I kid you not, these are central premises of the book.Anyway, it gets worse from there. My advice: read the short essay up front, it's interesting, then go find something better to read."},{"Title":"Manifold: Time","review":"This is one of the better sci-fi books I've read in some time. It's only problems is that it presents a lot of information to the reader in the form of scientific theories. The author tries to present them in forms the average reader can understand, but I was still overwhelmed by the sheer amount of information coming at me. You could easily read this book with a modern physics book next to you so you could learn more about all of the different theories that are presented. I also still don't know if I believe in the Carter Catastrophe, but this is a work of fiction so anything could happen.Other than the aforementioned problem this book was excellent. Other than the main characters name of Reid I enjoyed all the characters immensly. They behaved like real people who have the real problem of deciding what to do with the information they have discovered. I don't like the idea of the squid however and thought that was a bit strange, but like I said before this is a book of fiction and alot can happen.The pacing is excellent and every time I thought I knew what was going to happen I was shocked by what was around the corner. This book goes into the deep idea of how humanity is going to survive in the long term, not just a few hundered years, but a few hundered millenia. It tackles the ideas of what our role in the universe is and what we as a species are capable of doing. At the end of the book after reading an ending I was totally suprised by I just sat there in amazement. This book made me think about things I had never thought about before. A really great book if you can get over the deluge of theories it throws at the reader."},{"Title":"Manifold: Time","review":"or at least pilot an interplanetary ship and begin a mining project on an asteroid. What should seem like a silly mess becomes an intriguing science fiction adventure with a sense of wonder that is like that first viewing of 2001 or Star Wars. I look forward to the remainder of the triology and to other works by Baxter."},{"Title":"Manifold: Time","review":"When I first picked up Manifold: Time I was unimpressed and put it down after 15 pages. Weeks later when I started reading it again out of boredom, I couldn't put it down. This book has some of the first new ideas I've come across in a while. Baxter isn't the GREATEST writer of all time, but he is the perfect man for this story. In a way, I see Manifold Time as scientific theology. It gives all life purpose, no matter how insignificant it may seem.That all said, this book probably isn't for you if you hate science and want more of a space opera."},{"Title":"Manifold: Time","review":"This is really remarkable, a tour de force of &quot;hard&quot; science fiction ideas (real theories put to speculative uses). A dimly perceived catastrophic fold in time will wipe out humanity within two centuries. Ostensibly a story of space exploration to escape Earth, deeply layered logical and physical extrapolations draw one wider and wider into fundamental questions of existence, life, and purpose in the universe. Baxter gives us extraordinary visualizations of other universes than our own, endlessly evolving, that would make a great special-effects movie from this book. Until the end you don't realize how much Baxter manipulates the few characters through petty conflicts for cosmic ends rather than drive them from their thin personalities. The mutability of existence eventually turns upon the main characters as well, the author almost starting the story over again with literal second thoughts. Among the disparate elements woven into a fascinating story are sea-creatures already adapted to null gravity, dooms-day equations, the End Times hysteria, super children, and quarks. There's even a list of the science sources for Baxter's most outlandish propositions."},{"Title":"Manifold: Time","review":"Here is a book that has many of the qualities that have been lacking in recent science fiction - a strong plot, good characters, good science, and the courage to grapple with big ideas. The story begins with a maverick attempt to mine the asteroid belt and assure humanity's future, and that's small potatoes compared to its ultimate destination - the fate and purpose of the universe. And lest the weight of these ideas seems ponderous, let it be known that this book is also a page turner."},{"Title":"Manifold: Time","review":"Baxter has produced a fast-paced, mind-blowing adventure loaded with concepts and theoretical physics (much of which has basis in fact) that may frustrate those not familiar with quantum mechanics, universal expansion, heat death, and the nature of matter. The characters are better than one expects, though there are many instances where they are merely observers along for the ride. Malenfant alternates between driven and stubborn-he doesn't let things like laws and rules get in his way. Cornelius remains a mystery throughout, and Emma proves to be both a voice of conscience and (when it's obvious Malenfant isn't listening) a voice of moderation. The story's point-of-view alternates from person to person, with the occasional commentary from fringe characters (even Sheena and her offspring, the space faring cephalopods). Much of the plot revolves around the asteroid Cruithne (which does exist) and the mysterious, time-and-reality spanning artifact found on its surface; its purpose is never fully revealed, though it does play a pivotal role in the story. The artifact, along with the sudden evolution of a generation of earth's children into hyper intelligent geniuses, and one of the places Malenfant stops on a universal jaunt near the end, will remind readers-a little too much-- of two of Arthur C. Clarke's best works: Childhood's End and 2001: A Space Odyssey. Baxter may have intended for the \\"borrowed\\" plot elements to be a tribute, but he never says so in the brief after word. All that aside, the story is never boring, and there's a trip through endless possible realities that has to be read to be believed, as well as a journey to the end of the universe as we know it. Baxter frequently employs theories about the universe's fate-along with mankind's-that are widely accepted among physicists, and are uniformly pessimistic. One also has to tolerate an unending stream of religion-bashing. And the ending is not to be believed-a strange twist that undermines nearly all that has transpired in the story-but does make sense, when one realizes that it answers one of the plot's fundamental questions: What is humanity's role in the universe? Recommended to people who enjoy hard sci-fi; other beware."},{"Title":"Manifold: Time","review":"I'm an avid reader. For 12 years I've consumed an average of 15 sci fi books yearly. I don't suppose that establishes any more than a minimal set of bona fides. Nevertheless:To me, Manifold:Time was extremely entertaining. I just could not set it down. When I did, I could not stop thinking about it. Very absorbing and thought provoking. The sad bit is that all the books I read now will seem shallow pulp until I encounter one of this stature again. It'll probably take Vernor Vinge's next opus to impress me so. Baxter: you blew me away. Thank you!"},{"Title":"Manifold: Time","review":"The concept of the book had great promise; I am always facinated by books involving the manipulation of time. I liked the scientific aspects and some of the characters, but the book simply does not live up to the promise. I am sure that the author expected some oohs and aahs at the scope of this book, but I ended up simply feeling indifferent. If you buy this book you will likely want your money back. If you read it you will want the time back, but time is more easily manipulated in fiction, so don't waste your time in the first place. I would actually rate it zero stars, if that were allowed."},{"Title":"Manifold: Time","review":"Stephen Baxter and several other new writers are continuously compared to Arthur C. Clark, Robert A. Heinlein, Isaac Asimov, and other of the all-time greats. I will stick to the classics. Does one get compared to a legend by copying him? The inside cover reads: \\"Battling national sabotage and international outcry, Malefant's bootstrap company builds a spacecraft, plots its course, and trains the genetically enhanced Sheena 5 for her one-way journey (... b)ut Sheena has plans of her own.\\"What? Another sentient ship? No, it turns out to be a sentient squid! Her part of the story is interesting, but not as involving as HAL-9000. In \\"2001\\" a giant black monolith sparks intelligence in pre-humans. In \\"Time\\" a big blue cylinder sparks superintelligence in humans. Both function as portals, according to the programming. Although not necessarily in the same order, in each the main characters are taken by their respective portals, placed in a virtual motel rooms, turned into advanced programs, and given a grand tour of creation.I would not discourage someone from borrowing this from the library, as I did, if they have the time, it has its merits, but you could read \\"2001,\\" \\"2010\\" and \\"The Last Question\\" by Isaac Asimov in less time and get much more story."},{"Title":"Manifold: Time","review":"This is a short review, so bear with me. This book is VERY boring. I read some of it a year ago, so I have forgotten about it, but what I remember is that it was boring beyond imagining! I had to FORCE myself to read it, because I had paid for the stupid thing out of my own pocket, and it really was horrible..."},{"Title":"Manifold: Time","review":"I would usually understand this kind of writing. This was a bad mixture of unreadable stuff. Reid was not the main character. I got exited to read about time, but this is a put-down book. This is not exeptable as a book."},{"Title":"Manifold: Time","review":"There are so many really good science fiction books out there. Read them. This is one of the worst books, SF or otherwise, I've ever read. The characters are not believable and don't act like real people."},{"Title":"Manifold: Time","review":"Perhaps the worst written science fiction novel I have ever read. The characters were lifeless and not at all engaging. You simply didn't care what they were going to do next. The plot was a paper thin, meandering mess. Despite the fact that I really enjoy novels about twisting time, I just can't find a redeeming feature in this novel. This was the first book I read by Baxter. It will certainly be my last. Don't waste your valuable time on this dreck!"},{"Title":"Manifold: Time","review":"Not being a great writer myself I will let others do the plot summaries and simply state my opinion of the book.I consider Baxter one of the core group of hard science fiction writers however reading his books often feels too much like work...unlike Banks or Reynolds. Maybe its too much exposition on physics and too little character development. The balance between the two is off.All in all, a so so book."},{"Title":"Manifold: Time","review":"It's not often I find a book that I like, but don't love, that I read. This book spent the first 20 to 30 percent of it being so confusing that it would probably have been better as a movie for its actual experience of it than in book form. Actually, I couldn't stop thinking of Richard Branson when I think of the main character of this book because it seemed just like something Richard Branson would have done had he not made himself a billionaire capable of doing what he does on his own and not requiring support or help from anyone else. This book also has several, at least from what I could tell, differences showing that it does not occur in our own world, which is sort of ironic in a way when you're done reading it. I won't spoil it for those of you who haven't read it by doing a plot summary because I know there are reviewers who are fond of doing that. After the halfway point, you finally understand why it felt and read very disjointed and mishmashed, for the most part. I don't hate this book, but I took a star away for the confusion mishmash part and the fact that if I hadn't been reading it on a Kindle, I might never have finished it because of a lack of a dictionary. This book is very heavy on theoretical physics and cosmology to the extreme. If it had toned down some of the science and amped up the relationships between the people and therefore made it more accessible, I might have given it 5 stars. I'm all for technospeak, but this was way over the top for me in this case. I also really hate when a book is not divided by chapters and when the Kindle doesn't have the chapter demarcations at the bottom of the screen so you know how close you are to the end of a chapter. It would have been more easy on the mind of most readers, I think, if it had had a structure more like a book instead of a list of perspectives. The ending, and the last 40 percent of the book, were the best bits to me. I was going to read the next 2 in the series until I found out that, although they use the same characters, they're really not the same because they apparently take place in different version of reality. If I do read the other two books in this trilogy, it will be quite a while. My \\"to be read pile\\" on my Kindle is too large for \\"variations on a theme\\" right now, so to speak. If you have the time, and don't mind trying to keep alternate realities straight, you might be able to give the others a shot, but I can't for the foreseeable future. This book, I think, will be best read by someone who is already conversant with the science, otherwise you'll be rather frustrated unless you don't care to think about the confusing bits."},{"Title":"Manifold: Time","review":"A lot of the concepts in this book are mind-stretching and kind of cool in their own right. The plot, on the other hand, is just bizarre. The portrayal of human behavior is sometimes less that totally believable.The entire population becomes singularly, hopelessly and suicidally fixated upon the idea that the world/universe/something will end in 200 years based upon a theory built upon a house of cards, promoted by a nut, and possibly refuted by direct observation. Then they stay fixated upon this for 200 years! That story has some serious shelf life. Even if you believe the theory, it's 200 years. Seriously - if the average human cared what was going to happen in 200 years, we wouldn't all be driving over-sized, polluting SUV's to work.As an entertaining side note - The book was written in 1999 and set largely in 2010. Despite all of the doom and gloom in this book, the author is pretty darn optimistic in his portrayal of the technology of all of eleven years in the future. The fully automated, self-driving car sounded pretty cool. Where is mine? =("},{"Title":"Manifold: Time","review":"Baxter's 'Manifold Time' focuses on some truly profound ideas and mind-boggling time scales. Very deep.Yes, the dialogue, plot, and characters are at times a bit thin. Overall the plot and writerly craft pick up during the second half. But the point of 'Manifold Time' is the science and the ideas, and sublime ideas they are. If you are just looking for a dumb, cheap thriller, this is not for you. But anyone who appreciates Carl Sagan or Michio Kaku and the accompanying deep thoughts of astrophysics and the universe should appreciate this book."},{"Title":"Manifold: Time","review":"I enjoyed this book, but I finished without having a feeling of commitment or sentiment. It's possible that I might try the second of the series, but that decision hasn't been made yet.Baxter has some interesting ideas about his universe, but his characters are like cardboard cut-outs and exist in order to explain something totally unrelated to the human condition. I read a review that drew a parallel with Heinlein, which was very appropriate. If you want to visualize a universe, then you'll probably enjoy the talk of physics, timescales and technology (I did.) If you want to be engaged by the dirty secrets and motivations of gritty characters, then this book is not for you."},{"Title":"Manifold: Time","review":"Time has been sitting on my bookshelf since the day it was published in 1999. Over the years I've collected the rest of the Manifold Sequence and they too have gathered dust. Every time I thought about starting on Time I'd talk myself out of it. Baxter has a reputation as the hardest of Hard SF writers and I usually just want something simple and fun to read before drifting off each evening. What I always forget is that, regardless of how 'hard' Baxter is, he is always very readable. So I started the book and quickly became so engrossed I was staying up late just to read one more section...and then another. That horrible cliche - of not being able to put it down - became a truth.Baxter's most impressive talent is his ability to take the reader on a journey through time and space that encompasses years and distances that are almost unimaginable. The story begins in the year 2010 on Earth but extends trillions of years into the future and out to the farthest regions of space and through a multitude of universes. Baxter's self-confidence in writing about such grandiose elements permits the reader to be swept along for the ride. All of this is done with a minimum of difficult detail - Time isn't really a Hard SF novel after all. There's lots of science but for the most part it deals with such esoteric and hypothetical situations that it might as well be fantasy. The artefact, found on a near-Earth asteroid, that allows travel through time and space, is in essence a 'magic gate'.I don't think Baxter gets all of his story right. In particular, the way he portrays humanity's response to the Carter Catastrophe and the images from the Deep Future just don't ring true for me. Perhaps I just have a more optimistic opinion of mankind's ability to deal with monumental crises. One of the most common complaints about Baxter's works is that his characters aren't multi-dimensional beings - each is a cypher that represents a single viewpoint. This is still true in Time. The three main characters - Reid Malefant, Emma Stoney and Cornelius Taine - don't behave in rational ways and they certainly don't seem to be entirely human in their motivations. Strangely - and interestingly - the exception to this one-dimensionality is the politician Maura Della. She is the only character that even slightly reflects on the moral dilemmas she encounters.This is Big Picture science fiction and the little people don't matter. Lives are taken. Morality is up-turned. Science is destroyed. Cosmology is reinvented. Humanity fights and loses. And wins. It takes enormous talent to right about these sorts of concepts and to make that writing enjoyable. I'll be starting on Space, the first sequel to Time, fairly soon. I want to know what happens next - and that surely is the best recommendation a book can be given.http://derekspace.blogspot.com/"},{"Title":"Manifold: Time","review":"Manifold: Time is absolutely bursting with amazing science. Anyone interested in cosmology and the physics of time will love this book. Stephen Baxter early on provides a mind-blowing ride from the beginning of the universe through the end of time. After jangling our gray matter about with this whirlwind tour, he then zooms through ever deeper arguments about time and how it fits into our universe. The book encompasses cosmologically huge timescales (bigger than I imagined would be possible), and gives the reader at least a chance to comprehend the universe's huge extent in space and time.Manifold: Time has some other very interesting scientifically based arguments to make concerning the short-term survivability of humanity on earth. A look at the bibliography at the end of the book demonstrates how strongly hard-science based this book really is. Less hard science, but a lot of fun, is Baxter's use of augmented squids to \\"man\\" space flights.For all these positives, Manifold: Time unfortunately also has some major faults. Baxter asks a lot of big questions, and the various outcomes he envisions might be correct. But the people that populate Manifold: Time are not up to the task: they never have enough depth in character or in numbers to match the questions posed. And Baxter is too secular with the story; religion and faith might not have the answers, but humanity would force them to have a much bigger part (both positive and negative) than portrayed in this book. Baxter's presentation feels incomplete and somewhat sterile.The key to Manifold: Time and whether you might enjoy it is cosmology and time. For many, the science may go overboard, and the flawed character development and negatively sterile view of humanity might disappoint. But if you are intrigued by scifi extrapolations about the beginning and end of the universe, and find time paradoxes fun to contemplate, then you will surely enjoy Manifold: Time."},{"Title":"Manifold: Time","review":"The world has turned stagnant. Big projects are not put into motion unless a profit can be proven to be made. A maverick, Reid Malefont wants to fly to an asteroid to mine it for its wealth using genetically enhanced squid. It is this background that Manifold: Time is written in the near future. As he draws plans for his project, a religious fanatic convinces Reid that there is an end of the world scenario likely to occur and the only way to prevent the catastrophe is to build a radio reciever to listen to signals from the future, which he does. The squid is rocketed to the asteroid and on the asteroid a gateway is found to other time/demension.This is a well written book with a few flaws. The character development is done on mostof the characters just to move the story along which is fine except the reader will not care one way or the other for most of them. It is also the first story in a trilogy. So the ending is not the best because it must open into the second book. The basic premiss of the book is very depressing. The end of the world for humanity, but there is a way out. Baxter bounces from many of the characters including the squid to move his story along. My complaint is that as long as he stayed with Malefont, the story progressed nicely. But once he leaves Malefont, the characters are a little flat. Malefont is a perfect example of the type &quot;A&quot; driven individual with a goal in mind and the world be damned. He can be compared to a modern day Ahab. Every bit as destructive and driven as the 19th century version. Baxter also does a nice job with the squid and does not spend enough time on them which is a shame. This book is a good read and enjoyable."},{"Title":"Manifold: Time","review":"Manifold: Time is filled with some good scientific stuff, especially if you have an interest in quantum mechanics and similar fields but don't know much about them. It also presents some theories that are a bit more...let's say, wacky.The story is also interesting. The plot itself was fairly interesting, and the way in which it is written - by continually switching viewpoints - keeps you on your toes. It tackles some neat concepts and in the end, comes out ok.There a few problems, the largest of which is that the book has light material for a very, very heavy subject. This is a fun romp through off-the-beaten path science by an crazy billionaire mixed with apocalypse theories, the purpose of humanity, and characters that could have been drawn out far better. All of those are interesting (well, maybe not the last item), but do not mix well.It also brings up some neat ideas about the need for children (and the need of parents to have them) which I felt could have been brought out a bit more.In the end, a fun read, but I'd suggest one of the Xelee Sequence books (Ring, Flux, Raft...) for first-time Baxter readers.Saltz"},{"Title":"Manifold: Time","review":"Stephen Baxter is an extremely frustrating author. He has good &quot;sense of wonder&quot; ideas with erratic execution. Manifold: Time continues this tradition. Other reviews on Amazon have described the story, so I will just look at the other aspect of the book: the execution.I won't mention character names,either, since they're all the same, male or female, young or old. They exist solely to move the story along. There's no involvement with them since there is nothing to be involved with. This is Baxter's chief failing in my opinion, and when he learns to flesh out his characters his books will finally get the emotional framework they deserve.I suspect my enjoyment of books like Manifold: Time was ruined when I learned critial reading skills in college. Certainly, much of the Science Fiction I enjoyed as a high schooler did not hold up to second readings. The concepts were still there but I now realized that the delivery was faulty. To that extent, knowledge removed some non-critial joy from my life.And that's why I have such a problem with Baxter's novels. Perhaps I'm just being too critical, but when I pay hardcover prices I expect to receive hardcover enjoyment. Manifold: Time is more a paperback novel, to be read on a long trip and then discarded with no regret.Having said that, if you hate NASA, like the idea of multiple universes, and wonder whether humans are the first intelligent life to hit this cosmos, then you'll like the book. Baxter is very good in describing the physical universe, and at times the &quot;sense of wonder&quot; I enjoy bursts through. I think most readers will like some aspect of he book, enough at least to plow through to the ending. And many people don't care about characterization - they're more interested in the author's speculations on the fringes of scientific thought.So don't take this review as totally negative but be prepared for what you'll find within the covers. And be careful. Don't cut yourself on the paper-thin characters."},{"Title":"Manifold: Time","review":"Baxter does it again with an immensely thought provoking blend of hard science and visionary fiction. Like its predecessors - the excellent Moonseed and Titan, Time starts in a world instantly recognisable to us. The impetus of the space race has long since died and responsibility falls on our entrepreneurial hero Malenfant to rekindle the dream. It would be inappropriate to include any spoilers in this review, but suffice it to say that each of the manifold sub-plots has enormous relevance to today's world; Cyberluddism, genetic enhancement, religious fundamentalism, SETI, ecological disaster and, perhaps scariest of all, the appearance in our midst of a next generation of humankind, so intellectually advanced as to generate resentment and homicidal hatred amongst the &quot;normal&quot; disenfranchised homo sapiens. I have always expected nothing less than mind-bogglingly grandiose scope in a Baxter novel and, for my money, Time is his most poetically creative to date. If one universe is not enough, let's have a dozen or a thousand! The fact that the roots of the novel are all based in genuine contemporary science adds to its substantial impact. Astonishing stuff!"},{"Title":"Manifold: Time","review":"When I read the Time Ships by Baxter, I was impressed by his ability to tell a story and even more impressed by his ability to explain the science behind it. This book, while being lighter on the story end than Time Ships, impressed me by going above and beyond the call of duty explaining the theoretical science involved here. It challenged me as a reader and as a science fiction fan. I found myself actually stopping at points to think about what I just read, and the implications of it all if it were true. I love both hard sci-fi and space opera...this had elements of both....a great read...but not as good as Time Ships...."},{"Title":"Manifold: Time","review":"Hard SF is never really about the characters, it's about jamming as many mad ideas that have some basis in science into the closest thing you can get to a plot and then sitting back and watching the readers' heads explode as they try to process it all. Baxter has been doing this for some time so by now he knows how to ease the readers into it gently and let the pressure build without the inevitable eruption. One thing that helps set him apart from other SF writers of the day is his sense of scope, he's a man who can write about scenarios stretching out for billions upon trillions of years and make it all seem plausible. The type of writer where galaxies collide and stars live and die all in the space of a few pages. This book is no different, although where it starts and where it ends are two totally different things. What we have is a typical Heinleinesque lead character (Reid Malfenant, a plucky, can-do American inventor-type) who decides that the best way to ensure the future of humanity is to get into space NOW and colonize the whole galaxy as fast as we can. The close minded types at NASA and the government think he's nuts however and try to shut him down. Meanwhile, an odd professor Cornelius comes to him and tells him of his theories that society is going to collapse in two hundred years anyway so he needs a better plan. And then things start to get weird. Baxter throws out ideas like a mad scientist playing fifty two pickup, all over the place and without caring who he hits in the process. It's all here. Contacting our future descendants to get a clue on how to direct the future toward their particular timeline? Done! Intelligent squids released from the earth to go explore ahead of us? Of course! Hyper-intelligent children suddenly being born and apparently enacting some kind of grand plan? Hey, why not? Exploring the kinds of concepts that might give headaches to a whole room of quantum physicists? You got it! For people with even a moderate interest in science, this book is constantly fascinating on a level of learning, as Baxter explains a lot of hard to grasp concepts that won't put you on a level ground with the debating wing of the Quark Club, but at least gives you some idea of what all the fuss is about when it comes to all those high-falutin' ideas about Heat Death and manifold time and so on. On a plot level, however (and this is an across the board problem with Hard SF, not just Baxter) the book doesn't always connect. While the gradual shift from earthbound drama to mind blowing cosmic spectacle feels natural, not all of the various subplots are given enough room to develop completely and feel rather truncated as a result. The stuff with the squids? Sort of abandoned, having served its purpose. He never really convinces me that people would really go out of their way to beat the crap out of the super-smart kids simply because they're super-smart (although human prejudices shouldn't surprise me, perhaps I'm just naive). Nor do I really buy the planetwide response to the thought of everything ending in two hundred years. With people unable to focus on anything beyond who the next celebrity of the day is going out with, I find it hard to believe that everyone would suddenly go nuts and be gripped with existential crisis. But that's just me. Toward the end things get grandly cosmic and it all starts to slip out of control. It's glorious in its own way because Baxter simply goes nuts with ideas but at the same time, it's a mess on more than one level. Still, he gets bonus points for the slight of hand with the \\"downstreamers\\" actual intentions, what people assume may not actually be true. So while the book never wholly convinces, it never slows down either and sure they may not be the most three dimensional people in the world, but they carry the story well enough and at the end, with a novel like this, it's the ideas that matter most. And the concepts, man, the concepts. If the thought of a story that spans from one end of time to the other doesn't exactly thrill you, then this probably isn't the book for you. For everyone else, grab a couple of aspirin and dive right in."},{"Title":"Manifold: Time","review":"So, after reading a slew of post modern fantastic reality/mythic stuff by Gaiman, Mieville and others, I was in the mood for a good hard science fiction book. Stay with me...so I figure, you know, I keep hearing about this Baxter guy...He's even won science fiction awards and such. Plus, I love &quot;time&quot; stories (think Connie Willis). So I picked up this &quot;Manifold:Time&quot; thing. The thing is, it had a neat looking paperback cover too. Let me tell you - think twice before you make a similar choice.This &quot;story&quot; (and I'm using the word generously) is nothing more than a painfully dull exercise in rehashing all the recent Hawking-type physics speculation that's been going around. The plot, if you can call it one, follows a ultra wealthy space advocate trying to save the human race from an earth-bound destiny. Geeze...Baxter throws in an ex-wife who just can't forsake her super-rich hubby, some emotionally devoid autistic kids, and a handful of super geeks who really have no business in the plot other to endlessly explain scientific theories to the more mentally challenged &quot;characters&quot; (and us, the readers, evidently). In fact, ALL the characters are emotionally void - not only the ones with autism. The most interesting person in the entire story was a squid...But, don't get me wrong - if you like page after page of plotless, characterless scientific banter of a speculative nature, by all means buy this book..."},{"Title":"Manifold: Time","review":"Stephen Baxter's intriguing book provides a new view to predicting Earth's end. His style of writing, although a bit slow at times, allows the characters to develop to bring the story to its irreversible end, and what an ending it is.I am impressed by Baxter's creativity. For an author with such an extensive technical background he goes beyond that call to incorporate simplicity to the scientific material and to explore the depth and interaction of his characters leading to earth's outcome without being humdrum!A most enjoyable book, well written and would recommend it to all sci-fi buffs who really want food for thought.Ceridwen &quot;C.J.&quot; Johnson Toronto, Canada"},{"Title":"Manifold: Time","review":"The author manages to bring together the storylines of multiple characters into a book that spans parallel universes and multiple realities and timelines, and ties it all together with believable and *understandable* theories of how it all fits together. This by itself gets this book a solid 4 stars from me - it is great sci-fi writing - well thought out, researched and executed.Where is started to fall flat for me was that I just couldn't identify with any one of the characters. This may be because the style feels like a historical narrative, and that format doesn't work well for me.I'll definitely read this author again, there is great potential in his imaginings."},{"Title":"Manifold: Time","review":"Let's face it. There's a lot of crummy science fiction out there. A lot of fanciful fluff without a lot of meaning or purpose to it.Stephen Baxter treads a thin line between fluff and hard science fiction. This isn't because he hasn't read up on what he's talking about, but rather because his science fiction is just *so hard* that it seems at some points implausible. The science of it didn't really impress me, I read a lot of scientific text. The fact that he wrapped all those concepts up into one book, and then leapt off the cliff with them impressed me.He has quite an imagination, and wields it impressively. The one thing you might not like about this book is his somewhat peculiar plot trajectory. He sort of starts off slow (the aforementioned &quot;bait and switch&quot;), and then more or less gives the book away right about in the middle, and then it lulls down to this seeming end in futility. At that point it's almost like he starts a new book and begins talking about new ideas, to end in a somewhat ... awkward ending.This isn't to say that the book leaves you feeling cheated or anything. What I got most out of this book was a deep appreciation for how much work he put in to it. It really was a fulfilling book.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Manifold: Time","review":"David Deutsch of Oxford University has said of the Universe's complexity, &quot;If we nudge one of these constants just a few percent in one direction, stars burn out within a million years of their formation, and there is no time for evolution. If we nudge it a few percent in the other direction, then no elements heavier than helium form. No carbon, no life. Not even any chemistry. No complexity at all.&quot;Baxter plays out this scenario to its logical conclusion, the end of our Universe and far beyond. How would you like to save the world? Would it be enough? How about saving the Universe? The author's tightly-plotted tale has a core of realistically-depicted, three-dimensional characters (and two strong female characters just for good measure), and it's well worth a read."},{"Title":"Manifold: Time","review":"&quot;Manifold: Time&quot; is Baxter's most Arthur C. Clarke-ian novel to date: a bold, original retelling of &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot; and &quot;Childhood's End.&quot; The first in a trilogy of cosmological thrillers, &quot;Manifold: Time&quot; is crammed with edgy physics, a rousing argument for colonizing the Solar System, and a large cast of interesting characters whose lives interpenetrate in unexpected ways. Baxter's story-telling ability is in top form, rewarding readers with the thrill of discovery and &quot;sense of wonder&quot; equated with the best of hard SF. &quot;Manifold: Time&quot; is a riveting, if uneven, novel that takes us to the edge of reality and back again. Novels like this make me appreciate the SF genre and its singular virtues; Baxter's cerebral vantage on humanity's place in the cosmos makes for an intellectual and philosophical experience not to be missed."},{"Title":"Manifold: Time","review":"True lovers of &quot;pure&quot; science fiction will love this book. When I first started to read the book and its reference to communicating with the future, I thought it might have borrowed its subject matter from Benford's award winning &quot;Timescape&quot; novel. Boy was I wrong. Though the premise was somewhat the same, Baxter took time travel to a whole new level. This book not only made you think, but was able to convey theoretical physics in such a way that it didn't detract from the story. Some authors like Kim Stanley Robinson seemed determined to impress you with their scientific knowledge at the expense of the story (readability). I enjoyed the twists and turns of this novel and will begin reading the second book in the series immediately."},{"Title":"Manifold: Time","review":"Based on the other reviews, it seems Manifold:Time is a controversial book. Some people loved it, some hated it, and some were in doubt.I'll share with you my perspective:- Mr Baxter's book is full of science. Lots of it. You will find interesting and complex concepts about the origin and destiny of the universe (or \\"universes\\", I shall say), the composition of matter, time traveling, and so forth.- The characters are not deep. They might not be as \\"light\\" as in, by example, Asimov's works, but they are not fully developed.- The book accelerates. Its beginning is slow but it then accelerates. Probably, you won't want to put it down.- It seems to me that, when in doubt, Mr Baxter chose to sacrifice storyline and characters to put more emphasis on the scientific element. It's hard to balance all elements perfectly and I think he chose to put more weight on the science- Mr Baxter share with Arthur C. Clarke an uncanny ability to portray beautiful cosmic events. This ability of his has not been leveraged to the maximum in Manifold:Time. I am not saying he does not do a good job in that regard. I only mean that this is not the key strength of the bookIf you have already read other Baxter books, I don't think you'll have trouble with it. I am pretty sure you will like it. Just be aware of its emphasis on science.On the other hand, if you have not read sci-fi before, I would not recommend you this book. Perhaps you should start with something lighter."},{"Title":"Manifold: Time","review":"Recently a friend and I were talking about science fiction over coffee, and he said that I needed to check out Baxter's work. I usually don't look for new fiction, I let it get suggested to me--that way I have some feeling of why it will appeal to me.I picked Manifold: Time because its title suggested time travel, and I'm a sucker for time travel stories. Straight up time travel, science thrown to the side. I also love hard sci-fi. And Baxter delivered both.When he talked about squid and their communication, I turned the page. I wanted more. He talked about going into space as a commercially viable enterprise, and I thought I was going to read a Heinlein book. Which would have been very good indeed.Then Baxter threw his curve. He introduced an eccentric charater from an organization called Eschatology. At first I thought with a name like Eschatology, I might have stumbled in to Philip K. Dick, but was I wrong.The man from Eschatology introduced the time element; which as I said, I was looking for. The time thread of the book begins, for all purposes, at Fermilab, which is home to the Tevatron. And Baxter painted a picture so accurate that it meshed with my memory--I grew up very near Fermilab. The deal was sealed.He made good on the deal with his use of advance and retarded signals to advance the story. The quantum science of time. Oooo. And what's better than the science being right? Having it all get paid off the right way. No garbage. No deus ex machina. Just honest story telling while trying to unravel and explain the mysteries of our universe.I would wholeheartely recommend this book to anyone who likes hard sci-fi. I'd peg Baxter as somewhere between Philip K. Dick, whose work Baxter has obviously read, and Robert Heinlein."},{"Title":"Manifold: Time","review":"Manifold: Time is filled with some good scientific stuff, especially if you have an interest in quantum mechanics and similar fields but don't know much about them. It also presents some theories that are a bit more...let's say, wacky.The story is also interesting. The plot itself was fairly interesting, and the way in which it is written - by continually switching viewpoints - keeps you on your toes. It tackles some neat concepts and in the end, comes out ok.There a few problems, the largest of which is that the book has light material for a very, very heavy subject. This is a fun romp through off-the-beaten path science by an crazy billionaire mixed with apocalypse theories, the purpose of humanity, and characters that could have been drawn out far better. All of those are interesting (well, maybe not the last item), but do not mix well.It also brings up some neat ideas about the need for children (and the need of parents to have them) which I felt could have been brought out a bit more.In the end, a fun read, but I'd suggest one of the Xelee Sequence books (Ring, Flux, Raft...) for first-time Baxter readers.Saltz"},{"Title":"Manifold: Time","review":"Baxter's novel Manifold: Time is a mind-boggling exercise in concrete scientific concepts put to theoretical use. It is interesting, well-written, and intellectually stimulating. But it has rather thinly drawn characters, and the ending, which is perhaps meant to be uplifting, strikes a depressing note.Baxter tells us his story using multiple points of view. Some characters appear once, and others many times. We occasionally feel some emotion for them, but not much, because they rarely seem fully realized. This book is enjoyable if you wish to read about informed concepts (Baxter has a doctorate in aeroengineering research), and it is successful enough to have been nominated for the 2000 Arthur C. Clark Award. But don't read it for a human story, unless you're interested in one on the galactic scale."},{"Title":"Manifold: Time","review":"I have just finished reading this amazing book, and I really can't sleep. It's not trully the science in it, even it being a &quot;classical&quot; &quot;Hard&quot; Sci-Fi book, so it has got lots of those not yet proven &quot;weird&quot; scientific theories, but it's the way this science is pushed to the limit, to mold society, to makes us understand transcendent roles of our selves. And making this fluidly, with a story that just keeps you turning pages and waiting to see what is coming next.I can't say more without making this a spoiler, but it is really, according to my humble taste, a must read for everybody that wants to have your brains twisted a little. Ah, just to reiterate this, it is a &quot;Hard&quot; Sci-Fi book, so if you don't have a good scientific background, probably you could still enjoy it, but many things will just look too weird to make any sense."},{"Title":"Manifold: Time","review":"When you have probabilistic doomsday predictions, intelligent squids, Feynman radios (to pick up signals from the future) etc. - thrown at you, it could easily have been just a lot of weird stuff that seemed pretty far removed from anything you could relate to. Not so in Stephen Baxters &quot;time&quot;. Here it all seems pretty logical and inevitable. Surely, some future Malenfant guy will genetically enhance a squid brain, and then let the squid control a spaceship instead of some old computer. And surely the squid will rebel and try to get back to Earth with its giant Oceans and lots of room to breed.... Brilliant stuff and thats just just the prelude! I read all 456 pages in one session. Simply I just had to know what would happen next...."},{"Title":"Manifold: Time","review":"This is without a doubt one of the best science fiction novels I've read in a long time.

I'm not kidding when I say it continues to get good right up until 400, where it gets even better. Great book. I'm definitely going to look for more work by Baxter."},{"Title":"Manifold: Time","review":"This was my first exposure to Stephen Baxter. I was impressed by the good reviews this book recieved from some of my favorite authors such as David Brin, and Arthur C. Clarke. Also, I have always had a weakness for a time travel story. I decided to pick it up.Personally, I found the beginning to be a little slow. It took me a little time to really start enjoying the read, maybe fifty pages or so. Nothing major happened in that time and there was no real reason for me to continue turning pages other than a dogged belief that the story would improve.My faith was justified (although I should qualify that statement). The pace rapidly increased and exciting events were interspersed with thought provoking ideas by the end of the first part of the book. However, readers who prefer light fare should beware! This book is dense with ideas. It is a thick and hearty stew so don't come looking for green tea.I have nearly completed a degree in physics so I did understand and/or recognize many of the ideas that Baxter put forth in this novel. He uses these concepts to good effect and spins an intriguing yarn. On the other hand, he gives his microbiologist far too much general knowledge. I can accept the idea of squid &quot;Uplifting&quot; to borrow a term from Brin, but the microbiologist should not be expected to understand relatavistic physics and mechanical engineering!Also, the mathematician is stereotypical and annoying, but I digress.Baxter fills the book with small hints of the ultimate outcome of this book but I only recognized them after the fact. While I was appalled at the treatment of the Blue children, I could not truly say that it was completely unrealistic and I found that to be the most disturbing legacy of this book...."},{"Title":"Manifold: Time","review":"If you were disappointed by &quot;Titan,&quot; you'll probably be disappointed by &quot;Time&quot; as well. It contains roughly the same pessimism toward human nature as does &quot;Titan,&quot; and the plot turns out to be quite similar -- but on a much grander scale.Now that &quot;Time&quot; is out in paperback, however, this is a good opportunity for people to give it a chance. I gave &quot;Time&quot; a much higher rating than &quot;Titan&quot; (admittedly a low hurdle to clear) because the characters are more interesting, as are the ideas. And this book is LOADED with ideas. I can flip to a random page in my hardcover copy and, more often than not, find something that will fascinate me all over again. And although the characters in &quot;Time&quot; suffer the same fate as those in &quot;Titan,&quot; the fact that &quot;Time&quot; is the first novel in Baxter's &quot;Manifold&quot; trilogy suggests that the story does not end here . . . ~DH"},{"Title":"Manifold: Time","review":"Time shows that Stephen Baxter can still spin a good yarn when he wants to. Since his first book, Raft, and the short stories collected together in Vacuum Diagrams, I felt he had lost his way a little, focusing too much on the 'Ooh, wow!' factor provided by his obviously extensive research for every book he produces, and forgetting that a good plot and likeable characters are important, too. Now, at last, he has again put together a complex plot with a whole menagerie of characters who keep things moving towards a truly climactic ending, even by Baxter's Universe spanning standards. Still, a lot of mathematics, probability theory and theoretical physics are thrown at the reader but, provided this is your cup of tea, it rarely gets in the way of the story itself, instead serving to further it.Baxter has often been critisized for poor characterisation in his work, but there are many signs of improvement on that front in Time. Many of the characters are still very samey in a lot of ways, but he does manage to provide the reader with some subtle hints as to the deeper levels of his cast. I was especially impressed by the genius mathematician, Cornelius Taine, and the implication that his insiduous theories about the end of the world have pushed him slightly over the edge of madness. Part of me wished that this idea had been explored more thoroughly, but perhaps leaving unanswered questions about the characters, allowing the reader to flesh out the details themselves, provides for a more entertaining read.A brief description of the plot would be impossible as the book keeps on changing direction, introducing a new sub-plot in good time before the previous one has come to an end. Occasionaly, especially in the last quarter or so of the book, the plot gets spread a little thin as the various threads come to an end without another to replace them. In general, however, the pacing and direction of the book are handled expertly and the reader is always wanting to know what is happening to such and such a character. Baxter uses an interesting trick (to maintain interest in the characters) of starting each section of the book with a heading telling you on whom the next few pages will be focusing. This technique also allows him to unobtrusively throw in news reports and comments from the general populace which flesh out his detailed worldview of this near future Earth.One further problem with the book was that the ending was heavily signposted; another reason why the pace slackened during the final quarter. Nevertheless, predictable as it may be, the ending is tremendously satisfying and uplifiting - making a welcome change to the excellent but ultimately rather depressing Xelee sequence of books. Baxter also manages to save the satisfying conclusion to one of the best of the sub-plots to just the last few pages, further increasing the feel-good factor achieved.Overall, while Time has its flaws, it is nevertheless an excellent, rewarding, exciting, thought-provoking and highly recommended read."},{"Title":"Manifold: Time","review":"(***1/2)This first volume of Baxter's &quot;Manifold&quot; triad is a tour de force of exposition masquerading as fiction. The writing is plenty lively enough, but this is the kind of hard s-f (one of the more satisfying kinds, for my money) in which the plot consists less in what happens to our heroes than in what dawns on them.The characters themselves are two dimensional figures, stolen from old Heinlein stock, elitist and tiresomely self-confident and too crammed with genius to be believed. But that's okay. They are only there as screens onto which Baxter can project his dazzling tutorials on topology, time travel via retarded waves, paradoxical consequences of Bayesian statistics, sound ethical justifications for destroying the universe, and cosmology as a branch of genetics, among other perfectly serious loopy ideas. Who cares if the screen is two dimensional, if the movie succeeds in adding dimensions to your mind (almost painlessly) just for the price of admission?The scale of Baxter's imagination is so large that I often couldn't settle on whether what I was reading was comical or awe-inspiring. And from chapter to chapter the scale keeps expanding. Think Olaf Stapledon on speed, and you'll hit near the mark.Happily, volume one is completely self contained. So much so that it's not possible to conceive of a &quot;sequel.&quot; The remaining two &quot;Manifold&quot; books take place in alternate universes that merely happen to include the same characters. So if you share my phobia of trilogies and tetralogies (&quot;Do I dare crack this book, knowing that if I even half like it I'll have to read the rest to see how it comes out?&quot;), fear no more. By the time this one volume is over, it has *all* come out, in spades. You can wait a decade or two to pick up the &quot;next&quot; volume, if you like, without dropping any threads.If you like hard science fiction, you owe it to yourself to sample Baxter, and this is a fine place to start."},{"Title":"Manifold: Time","review":"For some reason, the current theories about just how our universe came to be and what its ultimate fate will be seems to have captivated many hard SF practitioners in the last few years. This book is certainly a member of that group (to the extreme!), but it also throws in backward quantum waves, quantum nuggets, Bayesian statistics, and an impending catastrophe that will literally wipe out humanity.So there is certainly enough of the \`hard stuff' to satisfy any science enthusiast. But what of the story? This, perhaps, is just as wild as the science, imagining a single individual, Reid Malenfant, trying to propel the world into true space travel, real exploitation of the resources available there, who is just rich enough, and brilliant enough, to possibly bring it off, in the face of the by now de rigor opposition by environmentalists, NASA, EPA, FBI, Congress, and all the rest of the alphabet soup. But Reid becomes sidetracked when he is led to see what he believes is a message from the far future, causing a change of target to a small asteroid with an unusual orbit locked to Earth's. The initial probe is manned by an enhanced squid, whose development and behaviors from a significant sub-plot. But discovered on the asteroid is an obvious \`artifact', (clearly a crib from Clarke's 2001: A Space Odyssey), a glowing blue ring that apparently leads to other times and universes.In the meantime, on Earth there has been a sudden appearance of \`Blue Children', fantastically intelligent, semi-autistic, who quickly gain the abhorrence of almost all \`normal' people as different, a threat to humanity as homo sapiens. Gathered together, these children apparently invent a machine to capture a quantum nugget, with perhaps dire consequences for the world.How these separate threads get folded together into a truly gorgeous trip through the history and future of not just our universe, but many others, (a near biological spawning of universe from universe, each growing towards conditions that might spawn intelligent life), becomes complicated, and the vision itself has to carry the story, reminiscent of Olaf Stapledon in his wilder moments. Baxter almost brings this off, as the vision truly is grand, but in presenting this he seems to lose sight of the story of his characters, and the ultimate message of the book is either extremely depressing or seemingly irrelevant to people of today.The science is real, the complications of the story worthy of something by A. E. van Vogt, but plot and science alone cannot carry the full weight of this story. His characters are introduced well, and I could easily believe in someone like Reid or his former wife and even Cornelius, but their growth (or lack of it) through the later parts of the story did not quite ring true. Neither did the portrayed world reaction to the Blue Children, the message of impending calamity, or the message from the future. A good attempt, but not fully successful.--- Reviewed by Patrick Shepherd (hyperpat)"},{"Title":"Manifold: Time","review":"I found Manifold Time quite an enjoyable read. The story was replete with unexpected (and sometimes expected) twists and turns. I found a few of the main characters in the story to be quite engaging and likeable, although the heroine's character seemed a little silly at times. Stephen Baxter does an absolutely amazing job at surprising his readers. As the story unfolds you find yourself being taken down one seemingly tangent path after another, all the while coming closer and closer to the realization that what Stephen Baxter is weaving around you is not a plot, but rather a web of time. Once I clearly saw the picture that Baxter had been painting in Manifold, I was both devastated and amazed. Perhaps the reason this story is so powerful his science (aside from the genetic engineering) is impeccably rooted in the various fields of science to which he appeals. A couple of the ideas in the book have been combined improperly, but they weren't critical to the story's message. Then again, we have to remember that this science fiction, albeit science fiction at it's very best. The story that Baxter successfully conveys has direct relevance to the title of the book: Manifold Time. And once you find out what that is, you will want to thank the author for taking science and making it human."},{"Title":"Manifold: Time","review":"As a science lesson \\"Manifold Time\\" works to perfection. Unfortunately it's supposed to be a fiction book. The science, anyhow, is certainly fascinating. Radio waves beamed back to the past; \\"quark nuggets\\"; \\"vacuum decay\\"; multiple evolving universes--all real, according to the author's afterword, and all quite challenging.And there's this loopy probability puzzle known as the Carter Catastrophe here. It, too, is real, says Mr. Baxter. But then, so is Zeno's Paradox. I wouldn't get worked up about Carter, although the characters in the book certainly do.That's because the author wants them to get worked up. Mr. Baxter, like Woody Allen in one of his films, is apparently in a funk because the universe is expanding and will eventually wither away by heat death. So why bother? Especially since, well, Mr. Baxter, despite all the fascinating theories about evolving universes, seems to believe we're pretty much alone here--against all odds.And because a few billion more years of evolution, alone, don't quite do it for our Mr. Baxter, he's concocted a truly hashed up plot, filled with stock characters from a Heinlein parody. (His Reid Malenfant is just a pale copy of an RAH \\"grand old man\\"; his colleage, Cornelius, keeps bringing what plot there is to a screeching halt in order to deliver his science lessons. You may actually welcome those intrusions.) The simple folk go absolutely bananas worrying about this catastrophe while Malenfant, who at one point discovers he _is_ the center of things and hurls an invective at Copernicus, manages to take a grand tour of the manifold of universes--it ends up somehow in a virtual hotel room (don't ask!).And then there are the \\"blue children\\"--annoying, brilliant but autistic, mini-Howard Roarks, whose grand scheme is to blow everything up in order to make the evolution of universes more efficient and woe to anyone and anything that impedes them from their appointed rounds. The two characters sympathetic to the children are a Congresswoman and Malanfant's ex-wife. Everybody else wants to delete them with extreme prejudice to prevent them from creating their new order, and after a while some readers may well feel the same way.Others, however, may find this creation of a new order fascinating and necessary. Still others--those of us content simply to have life-as-we-know it hang on here for a few billion more years or so--may find that Mr. Baxter's scenario is, well, fascinatingly fascist.Oh, lest I forget: also appearing here are intelligent space-faring squids. Feisty critters they are too. I rather liked 'em whenever they turned up. They're the meek, who inherit the earth, but by then it isn't worth very much."},{"Title":"Manifold: Time","review":"There's a lot in this book to both engross and frustrate a reader, but I think the plusses significantly outweigh the minuses. &quot;Manifold: Time&quot; is full of fascinating ideas and richly imagined scenarios. I don't know if this is because of the limitations of my thinking or of Baxter's writing, but I often found myself unable to understand his quantum physics for dummies sections. No matter: his weaving together the complexities of time and space utterly fascinating, and if I don't understand how things work, I feel confident that he understands it and is giving us good scientific theory.The book centers on the idea of doom. Is the earth doomed within the next two hundred years? If the universe itself is doomed to destruction with the next multi-trillion of years, what does it all matter anyhow, since we have no future if the universe has no future? Baxter does an amazing job of making the ultimate end of the universe seem both poignant and sad. He spices his story with lots of inviting threads, such as the mysterious, super smart &quot;blue&quot; children, and the increasing intelligent genetically engineered squids, and, of course, the fate of everything.His human characters, by comparison, suffer. I never really care about the people in this book nor completely believe and/or understand their motivations. When the theory, based entirely on statistics, that the earth is doomed in the next two centuries, is released, people turn to rioting in the streets. I found that unlikely. On the other hand, all of this is window dressing for Baxter's big ideas, and I found myself turning the pages and staying up late to see where it was all going.Not a perfect book, but a good one and a worthwhile one. It has left me wanting to read the sequels, but perhaps not right away."},{"Title":"Manifold: Time","review":"Stephen Baxter's Manifold: Time, the first novel of his Manifold series, is a reading experience which has filled me with perfect wonder &amp; curiosity. Mr. Baxter has skillfully drawn the galactic course of book 1 with spell-binding treats: an ambitious theme of galactic urgency in which ALL the right questions regarding the cosmic destiny of all living things are asked; a &quot;doomsday&quot; plot that begins with a dying planet Earth &amp; an unaware human population of the year 2010; current issues in theoretical physics which will help the human race answer these Big Questions &amp; ponder a vast space-time Challenge from which all Life arises.There's more. Sheena generation ships - smart squid forced by human Mind to meet this Cosmic Challenge - reproductively gains more Mind through the multigenerations &amp; leaves a beloved ocean planet behind forever; humanity's globally - oppressive attempts to control the inevitability of Change; the brilliant - and feared - Blue Children. Like Sheena 5, the enhanced squid, these genius youngsters must pay dearly - with possibly their lives - for the rebirth of the Cosmos.On to the main human characters: Reid Malenfant, roguish daredevil ex-astronaut. Man of wealth &amp; founder of Bootstrap. He will take mankind to the stars...and beyond... despite very powerful enemies in government &amp; industry.Along with Malenfant travels his former wife Emma Stoney as the level-headed voice of reason &amp; conscience. A third party will be the mysterious, obsessive, mad-genius physicist/businessman Cornelius Taine. He, too, will journey with Malenfant to the planet Earth's second moon to decipher the future: to seek out mankind's true destiny. Another of the human spacefarers is Michael, an African blue child...despised...a child of remarkable genius who is destined to help Malenfant meet the Challenge. Maura Della is the unwitting politician who is drawn into Malenfant's &quot;crazy&quot; schemes.Read this book for yourself to partake in the Glory of Ideas that is Manifold:Time. Space-time will become for you, as it has for me, a wholly odd &amp; vast cosmic tool. Reid Malenfant, along with the help of an intriguing supporting cast, studies it; uses it. And travels forever to the Stars."},{"Title":"Manifold: Time","review":"For too long Squid have been neglected in Science Fiction circles. This book partially redresses this unfortunate imbalance by featuring genetically enhanced squid, and their journey into space, as one of its story lines. The book bounds along on its scientific roller-coaster ride of ideas. For me this was the main pleasure of the book, but also its ultimate downfall. The breadth of ideas was astounding, as was the pace with which they were delivered. However, with so many ideas present, and some of them being very speculative, (and, on accasion flawed), I felt the fictional \`house of cards' eventually collapsed under its own weight. Yes, the characters were one-dimensional, but this is hard sci-fi so it seems churlish to complain. If you want speculative science, you'll find it here in droves. If you remember to take a deep breath as you enter, engage your sense of wonder, and leave your reality check at the door, then I suspect you will enjoy the ride. In summary, not a great book, but one that was packed with interesting ideas and speculation. It was sufficiently enjoyable that I shall try another of the author's works, but this time I will look for something shorter, in the hope that it will have slightly fewer ideas which will therefore be given more time to breathe."},{"Title":"Manifold: Time","review":"People have criticised Baxter for his paper-thin characterisations. In my opinon, the fast-paced nature of Manifold: Time doesn't lend itself to great character development. You really don't have time to invest feelings in Reid Malenfant, Emma Stoney and the Blue Children, except on a superficial level. This is a story about mind-boggling science, the wonder of the Universe and just what human existence means.Having just finished the book, I'm still in that post-brain-melt stage; the science is staggering. You can't fault Baxter for throwing in as many theories as he does, and every one of them is put to wonderful use. As a suggestion, have a connection to the internet open so you can research these theories as they crop up in the book. Reading about Cruithne and Caribbean Sea Squid added a wonderful sense of learning to the novel.If you're looking for a thought-provoking, hard science novel that never lets up until the last page, I thoroughly recommend Manifold: Time.You'll love the one-line nod to Arthur C. Clarke's &quot;2001&quot;."},{"Title":"Manifold: Time","review":"Manifold:Time is a well paced, well thought out adventure through some of the more esoteric conceptions found in the outskirts of modern physics. The characters, and in particular the main character, who is a entrepeneur in the best sense of the word, for such an idea driven plot, are well developed. The author extrapolates a near term future in which NASA is a strangled bureacracy and the world is beginning to collapse, and without space based material, the world will not be able to continue to expand. Then an artifact is discovered, and perceptions about the world change. In order not to give too much of the plot away, I won't mention each of the different technical devices used, but I particularly like the concept of (I think it was called) Feynman transfer, where messages from the future might be beamed to the present, if only we were able to detect them. I found less persuasive the use of, essentially, Bayesian statistics with relation to extrapolations of population growth and human survival, since such ad hoc assumptions are approximately as accurate as the 7 day outlook on the weather for the seventh day. As a final point, I liked the symetry, similiar to that found in &quot;The weapon shops of Isher&quot;, where events set in motion in the present can affect other parts of time and space, perhaps even in creative and wonderful ways."},{"Title":"Manifold: Time","review":"Up front, let me confess I am a complete and utter fan of Sephen Baxter and his brilliant manipulation of the constants in our Universe. But. This would have to be THE most disappointing book I have ever read by Stephen Baxter (and I thought Titan was pretty bad with no loveable characters and a gruesome plot...). In Time, Baxter starts off Ok - bit of a mixture of Voyage and some of Xeelee stuff and then suddenly, half way through the book - BAM! Total Deja Vu as it degenerates into a basic rehash of some of his previous books from the Xeelee series (although he does take into account advances in our knowledge of the universe).If you are a first time reader of Stephen Baxter, read some of his earlier stuff like Moonseed, Flux, Ring, Raft, Voyage etc!"},{"Title":"Manifold: Time","review":"The characters were weak, but so was the story line. Too many times I had to suspend my understanding of physics to let the author plod to the next impossible description. For example, the author seems to think that reflected light travels at infinite velocity (or very much faster than c) whereas the light coming directly at you from the event is traveling at c. (Characters are watching an expanding sphere of light from an explosion, waiting for it to hit them.) The book has many such flaws. And the characters are equally flawed and thinly portrayed. I can't recommend this book to anyone expecting hard SF, unless you want to groan a lot."},{"Title":"Manifold: Time","review":"In Manifold Time, Baxter explores some great ideas that get lost in weak storytelling. I found it difficult to stomach the arrogant characters with pompous-sounding names. It's obvious that Baxter is a better scientist than a writer, although I have to admit that there are some parts of the book that manage to convey a sense of wonder that is the key to any successful sci-fi book.On a personal level, I found Baxter's world view disturbing. He seems to believe that galactic conquest is the rightful destiny of man. He portrays the lead character, Malenfant, as a savior who pioneers this new &quot;Manifest Destiny&quot;. I was annoyed at how Baxter took it for granted that galactic conquest was something beneficial, without delving into any of the moral dilemmas.Perhaps that is the problem with this book--plenty of science but no humanity."},{"Title":"Manifold: Time","review":"So, after reading a slew of post modern fantastic reality/mythic stuff by Gaiman, Meiville and others, I was in the mood for a good hard science fiction book. Stay with me...so I figure, you know, I keep hearing about this Baxter guy...He's even won science fiction awards and such. Plus, I love &quot;time&quot; stories (think Connie Willis). So I picked up this &quot;Manifold:Time&quot; thing. The thing is, it had a neat looking paperback cover too. Let me tell you - think twice before you make a similar choice.This &quot;story&quot; (and I'm using the word generously) is nothing more than a painfully dull exercise in rehashing all the recent Hawking-type physics speculation that's been going around. The plot, if you can call it one, follows a ultra wealthy space advocate trying to save the human race from an earth-bound destiny. Geeze...Baxter throws in an ex-wife who just can't forsake her super-rich hubby, some emotionally devoid autistic kids, and a handful of super geeks who really have no business in the plot other to endlessly explain scientific theories to the more mentally challenged &quot;characters&quot; (and us, the readers, evidently). In fact, ALL the characters are emotionally void - not only the ones with autism. The most interesting person in the entire story was a squid...But, don't get me wrong - if you like page after page of plotless, characterless scientific banter of a speculative nature, by all means buy this book..."},{"Title":"Manifold: Time","review":"Reid Malenfant is awesome!

Manifold Time is book one in a trilogy about what happens to the world when people discover that the end is in sight. It's not your standard doomsday story, however, for a number of reasons, foremost among them being the painstaking care with which Baxter presents his central thesis: that the earth is doomed not because of an iminent threat such as a comet or global nuclear war but simply because of probability.The book starts out confusing, levels out into understandable and exciting, builds to suspenseful, and then makes a disappointing decline into a long section of bewildering fluxation before finally going out with a fizzle. Hopefully books two and three in the trilogy will pick up a bit; I felt let down by the end of Manifold Time."},{"Title":"Manifold: Time","review":"The accounts of rocket and space craft development are pretty ridiculous, but the 'deep time' sections are spectacular. Manifold Space is probably the strongest book of the trilogy, and Time is good but has a weak ending."},{"Title":"Manifold: Time","review":"Quite a piece of work.

The book comprises such a wide band of theories: front time travel to genetically enhanced squid to alternative universes.

All this, and much more, combined in one work of art.I highly recommend the book."},{"Title":"Manifold: Time","review":"This book was terrible.

Time travel paradoxes? Ho-hum. Animals trained to operate a space ship? WHo cares? Gifted children? What does that have to do with TIME, the main thrust of the book, and half the title?? I think people who do reviews of sci-fi ought to have read some before they get all excited and impressed with another one. If the two main characters hadn't been married/divorced, where would the conflict have come from, since there isn't any, and sparse character development or background. They simply aren't interesting, and they don't do anything. SO the guy launches a space shuttle on his own; so what? How does he plan to get these materials he plans to mine from a hunk of ice & mud, refined and back to Earth? Use a large parachute? Are metals somehow hard to locate on Earth? Last time I checked we're largely iron & nickel. I just don't get it and the book seems like a Waste of TIME; perhaps a better title?"},{"Title":"Manifold: Time","review":"Baxter wrote some very good descriptions of science knows or theorizes now in 2001. The major irritation is that he had to put a plot and make it fictionalized. As the Afterword shows, the major concepts described are real and have been talked about in the major scientific journels. The asteroid is real and the &quot;Carter Catastrophe&quot; is at least theoretically possible (or at least, not ruled out completely), and squid are really quite intelligent for invertibrates. In the speeches he gives his characters, Baxter presents the most mind-numbing concepts in a clear manner.That said, it's the plot. The characters do things that make no logical sense. A billionaire, Reid Malenfant, decides to cobble together a space ship in a manner of months and genetically craft squid to do the driving. Bill Gates, Warren Buffett, and Scrooge MacDuck couldn't and wouldn't even attempt something as off-the-wall as that and do it in a few months. A strange mathemetician pops up and claims the &quot;intelligences&quot; from the far future are attempting to communicate with us Earthlings. Go to this particular asteroid and, voila, our billionaire reconfigures this extremely expensive venture to a whole new target. Again, in a in a short amount of time.Baxter, having read Clarke's superior Childhood's End, has these genius kids cropping up all over the place saying things that a Cal Tech Physicist would have trouble understanding. Are these kids good, bad, or Profoundly Evil. Baxter never quite explains that. There certainly isn't much in the way of to find out. And the squid, suddenly evolved to super-intellectual status, they could max out the SAT too. Are they good, bad, or Profoundly Evil, too? You get the feeling when a sizable portion of them cobble together super-spaceships out of an asteroid decide to decamp out near Jupiter that maybe we are better off without them.Malenfant seems to have a profound God-complex. He gets profoundly depressed when on a jaunt through the Complete History of the Universe finds out that, no matter what, in ten to the one-to-the-one-hundred-and-sixteen years, Humanity or whatever intelligence evolves, will die out. He thus decides to help or at least condone the euthanization of the entire cosmos which the superkids, now living on the moon, are going to do. Jean Luc Picard would have at least waxed eloquent in defense of Humanity. I found the overall storyline to be profoundly depressing. Nevertheless, the Science was right on target."},{"Title":"Manifold: Time","review":"I was really distracted by the constant use of techno-babble throughout the book. Reading Hawking is easier than reading this book.I forced myself to finish the book because I hate to give up, but I'm really glad it was free because this isn't an author I'll try again.I really didn't care about the characters in the book and it was depressing. I love sci-fi and I love time travel even with paradoxes, but this was just techno-babble that makes no sense and doesn't connect me with the characters.And the fact that the author sites scientific journals at the end as facts...just because someone publishes something in a journal doesn't make it true. It's a theory that one researcher may have that will either be confirmed or disputed by their peers.I don't want to know about one journal article, I want to know what the scientific community thinks...especially if the whole book is based on techno babble with no character substance."},{"Title":"Manifold: Time","review":"Since I paid my hard earned money for this book, I was determined to finish it. (Otherwise, I would have put it down.) The science was o.k. however, the story was very weak and predictable."},{"Title":"Manifold: Time","review":"This is an amazingly depressing novel which denies the existence of God and finds Christians to blame for virtually every bad thing that happens.There is a disturbing assumption through out this novel that we know exactly how everything works in the physical universe and that man is the most important thing to come along in this happenstance we call life."},{"Title":"Manifold: Time","review":"I wanted to like this book, but I couldn't even force myself to finish it. Mr. Baxter does a poor job of juggling multiple viewpoints, and as another reviewer described, the characters are &quot;paper thin&quot; - I didn't care about any of them.

Characters and Plot blend well to create a beautiful book!...Olaf Johnson, NYC"},{"Title":"Manifold: Time","review":"This book has interesting ideas. I love science fiction and I read a lot of scientific magazines. This novel gave me the idea that the author picked a bunch of recently published scientific theories and built a story around it. The afterword confirmed what I suspected. As others wrote, the execution is not really great and characters are unidimentional. I also think there were too many scientific ideas that were forcefully connected together with a poor story. A bit more focus might have helped the story. I found the conclusion quite interesting, but the path to get there was not that great. Another reviewer that really like this story mentioned that Baxter reminds him of Robert J. Sawyer. I do not agree. It was my first Bazter novel and I much prefer Sawyer's novels because he focuses on less elements but develop these better."},{"Title":"Manifold: Time","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this book (although I'm thankful I bought the paperback version rather than the hardback). Some of the reviewers complain about shallow characters, but so much of great sci-fi is about mind-blowing ideas and sweeping vistas, rather than character development. It's brain candy - light entertainment. Witness so many of Larry Niven's highly entertaining novels and short stories, where big ideas overshadow the characters.Having said that, there are a few problems with some of Baxter's plot devices. The Carter Catastrophe, while alarming, is based on faulty logic. Using this reasoning, an individual born at any time in human history might deduce that a population collapse is imminent if he or she observes that the population has been growing exponentially. But clearly we haven't experienced an endless series of population reductions throughout history. And how can we assume that individuals are &quot;randomly assigned&quot; to live in a certain era, let alone as a human being as opposed to a bacterium or a beetle, etc.?Another issue: in the last pages of the novel, Malenfant and Michael are observing the demise of the solar system from a location 5 A.U. outside of the plane of the solar system. However, if the wave front of destruction is traveling out at the speed of light from its origin on the Moon, then our characters wouldn't be able to observe the devastation, since the wave front would in fact PRECEDE the images of the destroyed Moon and the Earth. They would see a perfectly peaceful solar system, and then a sudden flash of light that cooks them in less than a second. I don't know. Maybe they could somehow use wormhole telescopes or something . . . it's just a minor qualm from an excellent novel."},{"Title":"Manifold: Time","review":"Great concept, rotten characters I could care less about. A mind is aterrible thing to waste when you don't have characters, or for that matter writing talent, to pull it off. TIME SHIPS was a much better story."},{"Title":"Manifold: Time","review":"I really liked it. The book was filled with new things for me. I learned a lot about not only time, but about how the galaxy was formed and about the randomness (or lack of) of the whole thing.It's also right off the headlines; just check the news about NASA landing on Eros! Could Eros be the beginning of commercial exploration of space? Baxter makes a good case for it.One of those rare books that I will surely re-read many times."},{"Title":"Manifold: Time","review":"Baxter's narrative, especially the squid-pilots, is fairly compelling as noted by other reviewers. But Time is too reminiscent of others' stories and images, especially Clarke's (surprised Time won the Clarke award? it's a look-alike contest!) and Blish's, to seem particularly innovative."},{"Title":"Manifold: Time","review":"After reading the excellent Moonseed the first sci-fi book to get my attention for a long time - I was really looking forward to this book. But my hopes were dashed I'm afraid. This book is manifestly dull and depressing from the get-go.The overall story - the need to discover the true nature of humanities future in order to avoid the &quot;Carter Catastrophe&quot; - a self-fulfilling portent of doom - results in a book that at once expands into the broadest of scales (the future of the Universe) while getting stuck in the merest details of the characters involved.Baxter proved that he can write page-turning midnight-oil-burning sci-fi with Moonseed which combined science, science-fiction and Tom Clancy. It's a pity that this performance wasn't reproduced in this book."},{"Title":"Manifold: Time","review":"Stephen Baxter does indeed turn a hoary asteroid-mining tale into a cosmological epic sprinkled with (seemingly) esoteric mathematics, but he does it BADLY.First, Bayesian statistic does not apply to evolving growing systems of indetemined lifetime, such as human species - especially if you take into account its possible descendants who no longer look human but trace their lineage back to us. In fact, explanation why that is so is present deeply buried in the book, but since that would destroy a major plot point, the faulty use of Bayesian statistic continues on.The second fault is much worse, but is not manifest until the last few pages. Basically, a group of cosmically aware individuals (I won't reveal here who they are) realizes that the heat death of the Universe is inevitable, and that descendant of human race are eventually doomed no matter what. I won't reveal thair solution to this conundrum, but the problem is - their solution (bought at the cost of sacrificing human race *now*) DOES NOT SOLVE ANYTHING. Instead of one Universe doomed to eternal cold, they create many Universes doomed to eternal cold. When I read the last page, I was terribly disappointed.Either Baxter did not think his own idea through, or he figured most readers won't. Judging by the glowing reviews below, he may have been right."},{"Title":"Manifold: Time","review":"None of the reviewers (5 stars) has mentioned Sheena 5. Stephen Baxter created one of the most unique science fiction characters ever published: Sheena 5, the intelligent squid. Yes, fellow Sci Fi readers, see character development for an inhuman character, a squid. Experience the thoughts and emotions of a squid! This is a great book of imaginative fiction with a most memorable character. This is a fabulous story. Sheena happens to be one of my favorite parts of this story."},{"Title":"Manifold: Time","review":"I am a fan of Stephen Baxter's. Vacuum Diagrams and The Time Ships were two of my favorite sci-fi books in the last ten years (at least among the Sci Fi I have read.) And I was looking forward to diving into a meaty trilogy of his that could keep me reading for awhile. However whereas those two novel's took some fascinating contemporary science and built interesting conflicts and narratives on top of them, this book drowns beneath them.Too often the action gets bogged down in a scene where one scientist or mathematician is standing in a room with one of the protagonists (who were neither) explaining some scientific principle or another which Baxter feels is imperative to the story. And just as the protagonists through one cliche or another express their confusion (\\"In English\\" - \\"X...tried to act like they understood.\\" - \\"Malenfant tried to contain his frustrating confusion.\\") over and over and over again, so too was I squinting at the page and struggling to distill the important principles. Invariably the scientist or mathematician would sigh in patronizing frustration at the protagonist/me and simplify things...which they could have just done to begin with.This happens over and over again to the point where I just got bored and ended up getting bogged down in this one for quite awhile. It's a pity because this past weekend I finally made a concerted effort to finish it and, where the first 250 pages were like a pushup drill, the last 150 were a lot of fun and I flew through them. In typical Baxter style, the story was elevated from interesting straightforward premises to questions about the very nature of the universe and what could be our place in it's present, beginning, and ultimate end. Even in the midst of the climax there was STILL that convention of the smart characters stopping to explain what was happening to the dullards in the story, but at that point the action had reached a level that I didn't care.Even though I found this one excruciating at points I'm surprisingly still interested in the sequels, if only because I have no idea how this one could carry on. If you can soldier through the first half this one gets a hesitant recommendation."},{"Title":"Manifold: Time","review":"much less than compelling characters. the truths described in the book make little sense and have other easier explanations. in short. big ideas but trite."},{"Title":"Manifold: Time","review":"I will start by saying that I found \\"Manifold: Time\\" very compelling reading, and I definitely plan on checking out \\"Manifold: Space,\\" if only because I can't imagine what a sequel to this book would be like. The plot contains elements of \\"2001,\\" \\"Childhood's End\\" and \\"The Midwich Cuckoos,\\" but it's all mixed into an intriguing new brew. For lovers of hard sci-fi and intensive, mind-bending and (mostly!) scientifically valid speculations about the nature of reality, this is heady, engrossing stuff.The plotting and the prose style, on the other hand, remind me that the only thing I don't like about science fiction is that it is written by sci-fi authors. If you are looking for ecstatic prose in the vein of Nabokov or Ellison, pass. The characterizations are diagrammatic at best, and the dialog is almost purely expository. A writerly tic from which Baxter suffers, which I can't believe some editor wouldn't have beaten out of him, is his habit of having the characters address each other by name several times in each conversation. People simply do not talk like this, and it became a running joke with me to see how often it happened.In contrast to Baxter's far-future speculations, which seemed plausible and fascinating, his version of the near future missed by a mile. OK, it's easy to take potshots from 2009 about Baxter's speculative 2010, but for all his pessimism about humanity as a whole, his ideas about what technology would be available a mere ten years out from publication is wildly optimistic. We have (among other things) self-driving cars, service robots, hydrogen engines, AI psychoanalysts and genetically-enhanced spaceship-flying squid, but what are these \\"cell phones\\" of which you speak? I know it's not fair for a \\"downstreamer\\" like me to nit-pick thus, but as cell phones were already in use in 2000 their absence, amid all this advanced gear, did seem odd. Perhaps he should have set the near-future sequences a bit further down the line, 2050 maybe. Cue up the book review from 2050 complaining about what *that* gets wrong...Anyway I don't want to pick on Mr. Baxter, he's got a lot of great ideas and despite the stylistic shortcomings, I quite enjoyed it."},{"Title":"Manifold: Time","review":"_Manifold Time_ has edge-of-your-seat action combined with awe inspiring scenes and ideas. The emotional drama of the story rings true. I hope gets made into a movie. Disabling the text-to-speech is lame, but such is life."},{"Title":"Manifold: Time","review":"\\"Time\\", the first book in Stephen Baxter's Manifold trilogy, follows the story of Reid Malenfant, washout NASA astronaut and entrepreneur with ambitions of propelling humanity beyond the the confines of Earth and towards limitless expansion among the stars. However, when a genius mathematician arrives at his Nevada headquarters predicting the end of the human race in only 200 years, Malenfant throws all his efforts into finding out how this potential catastrophe can be avoided. Before long he finds himself on his way to a remote asteroid in search of answers - regarding both the nature of the universe itself and humanity's purpose within it. At the same time a new phenomenon is sweeping Earth: a sudden wave of hyper-intelligent children. Are they to be encouraged or feared? Are they connected to the doomsday predictions? Into the middle of all this Baxter still finds room to work in messages from the future, genetically enhanced squid, and a mysterious alien portal - all of which combine to create a rich and diverse possible future.The story is told in slightly unusual fashion for the genre, employing not only simple third-person narrative but also faux journal entries, newspaper articles and transcripts of television broadcasts. This gives Baxter the flexibility to control the pace of the story as it builds from relatively mundane beginnings towards its epic conclusions. It is also very effective in bringing to life Malenfant's world as it faces up to its future and the prospect of impending apocalypse. His characters are similarly compelling; Malenfant in particular, with his rogueish charisma and classic American can-do spirit, is excellently drawn.As regards the science, the mere fact that Baxter has been able to write a coherent work of fiction about such grand cosmological themes is remarkable. That he has done it in such a plausible and engaging fashion is even more remarkable. Much of what he describes has been drawn together from real scientific research, as he explains in his Afterword. There are perhaps a couple of inconsistencies (as other reviewers have pointed out), but these are mere blemishes in an otherwise excellent book. (Incidentally, for further reading on some of the cosmological questions raised in \\"Time\\", I would highly recommend \\"The Goldilocks Enigma\\" by Paul Davies.)Everything considered, \\"Time\\" is an astounding novel with tremendous scope. Baxter shows himself to be an exemplary writer of modern SF and I very much look forward to reading the sequels, \\"Space\\" and \\"Origin\\"."},{"Title":"Manifold: Time","review":"I enjoyed this first book of the three Manifold series.

Ignoring the conclusions drawn from the scantest of evidence, the repeated misuse of 'anyhow' will drive any 'anyhow' word lover wild, anyhow.Anyhow, I did manage to struggle through to the end which, for me, indicates a reasonable read. Unfortunately all the 'anyhows' lost this book a couple of rating stars, anyhow."},{"Title":"Manifold: Time","review":"It's a decent book, enjoyable but not great.He uses the word \\"regolith\\" a LOT."},{"Title":"Manifold: Time","review":"Baxter's narrative, especially the squid-pilots, is fairly compelling as noted by other reviewers. But Time is too reminiscent of others' stories and images, especially Clarke's (surprised Time won the Clarke award? it's a look-alike contest!) and Blish's, to seem particularly innovative."},{"Title":"Manifold: Time","review":"I like Stephen Baxter. He's one of those sci-fi writers who knows that storytelling is as essential in Sci-Fi as is good science. And Time is really told well; the plot moves at a fair pace, and the writing keeps making you come back for more. It is definetly one of his better books in terms of the way it is told. But what it fails is in the actual science itself. I am an avid science boff, and I really found this book lacking in it's explainations of the things it depicts. It felt like I was in a Sci-Fi movie; the plot and all are good, but there is no real scince in there (except for the occasional mention of 'quark nuggets')"},{"Title":"Manifold: Time","review":"This is a very deceptive book. It starts with no fanfare: I was immediately sucked into what appeared to be a great setup for a plot. However, I soon realized that the plot does not so much develop as advance jerkily and unpredictably. The reader is dropped into implausible situations that exist only to give his \\"scientific evangelist\\" characters a framework from which to lecture, Ayn Rand style, on some aspect of physics. In fact, the constant introduction of new physics seems to substitute for actual plot.As soon as Baxter kills off the physicist responsible for most of the lecturing, the book degrades rapidly. Without physics to substitute for plot, the book drags on for a few hundred pages until it ends abruptly.The idea of this book has merit. I was initially excited to see where Baxter would go with the ideas he proposes in the first chapter. But on many occasions, just when I thought the next physics lecture would tie everything together, he threw in something completely out of the blue.The plot (what there is of it) does not resolve at the end. We are left with an great explosion, and a physics lecture to justify killing off every major character in the book.Don't waste your time on this book."},{"Title":"Manifold: Time","review":"I really enjoyed this book...and the ending was refreshing!

I read the backing, and found it sufficient to sustain my spare time reading for a week.I got home that night and started reading it. After I was done, my mind was blown. This book TOTALLY redefined the way I look at life. Why am I here? Why arn't I bouncing around in zero G on a space station orbiting Jupiter? The entire next day I felt like I was walking around in a surreal environment, as if I was looking at it for the first time (this may have been due to the fact that I spent the whole night reading the book and finished 30min before school).This book is one of the best ive ever read and I would recommend it to anyone who knows how to read."},{"Title":"Manifold: Time","review":"This story left me in awe. I'm a reader of adventure fiction with the occasional science book and biography thrown in for good balance. The reason I read adventure is because I'm inspired by the great courage, greed (while I don't admire greed, I respect its ability to motivate people) and the need for humans to climb over the next mountain range, or cross vast oceans to places unknown. The human species has wandered all over the planet and settled into every corner of it which could support life. The next steps are the oceans and space, and these places present numerous challenges for the explorers. Because of these challenges I like speculative fiction and science fiction as well. It takes a good imagination to overcome obstacles and Spec. and SF offer some of the best imaginative minds in contemporary fiction. I related to the lead character in this story. I admired the entrepeneurial spirit of failed astronaut Reid Malenfant. Like myself, he was frustrated with the lack passion in the NASA administration and it's need to control space. Malenfants' passion with space travel led him to an unusual but oddly satisfying conclusion. As I read the last ten pages I was dazzled, sad, determined and joyous by the time I reached the very last line of this book. This was not a perfect book. On the other hand, it was a very satisfying read. The characters were not as richly portrayed as they could have been but ultimately they weren't the stars of the book. The focus was on the human species as a whole and the setting was the vast possibilities of space-time. Focusing too much on the characters, for me, would have taken considerable time and the pace of the story would have suffered for it. I sympathized with the characters as much as I needed to and felt for them in their various situations. What more could I ask for? Nothing.I'll be buying the next book, &quot;Manifold: Space&quot;, as soon as I catch up on some other reading."},{"Title":"Manifold: Time","review":"I have enjoyed many of Stephen Baxter's books in the past. This one, however, just does not measure up. Statistically showing the world must soon end: Come on, is that the best that he could come up with to get the the book started?. Nevertheless, I read on hoping that I could just suspend disbelief. I was mostly successful, but then got bogged down with characters explaining science to me every 2 pages. Maybe if you know no physics that part is interesting. I found it useless, and typically skipped whole paragraphs that were science tutorial monologs.I'm about to start Manifold: Space. Hopefully it will be better."},{"Title":"Manifold: Time","review":"Caution, Spoilers AheadThis is a really awful book--one of the few truly laughable works of recent so-called \\"hard\\"science fiction. While there are a lot of unrelated sub plots (with some admittedly interesting scientific \\"what if's,\\") the real plot line is simplistic, preposterous, muddle-headed and just downright offensive. In Baxter's hypothetical near future, people of the future somehow reach back in time to create a bunch of super intelligent children whose mission (we find in the end, after countless red herrings) is...wait for it...to destroy the universe! But, these kids are not the bad guys, because (in Baxter's view) the \\"heat death\\" of the universe is somehow intolerable to the human spirit. Thus, by destroying the universe (\\"It's the wrong universe!\\" exclaims one of the children) a new one with different physical laws will be created in its place; and even though everybody in the old universe dies a terrible death, it's ok because the new universe will somehow recreate the human mind and we will all live happily ever after in a universe that is eternal, set free of the horrible laws of thermodynamics.This is about the loopiest idea for a science fiction story I've ever heard. It also puts Baxter squarely in the camp of the \\"we-are-the-only-intelligent-life-in-the-universe\\" crowd. As you may know, there are two lines of thought on extraterrestrial intelligence: \\"we are alone\\" is one; and \\"we are not alone\\" is the other. The math and statistics of each is camp points, not to a right or wrong analysis of the data, but rather insufficient data. It's an argument tantamount to the existence of God, with both sides stridently arguing their obvious correctness.In any case, this novel is pure drivel, with an idiotic premise, and an idiotic conclusion."},{"Title":"Manifold: Time","review":"I've read a lot of heavy stuff over the last year. The Gap series, LOTR, and Atlas Shrugged. They weren't all deep, per se, but the were really intense emotionally. I think that contrast helped me to enjoy Manifold Time, by Stephen Baxter.It's a light book. The characters are animated enough. The plot is engaging and carries the grandest scope I've read yet (yes, even bigger than Battlefield Earth.) Overall, it left me with a, \\"yep, that was a pretty good book\\" feeling. However, it did not pass the, \\"will I read the sequel\\" test.Baxter is an engineer, and no offense, he writes like one (being an engineer, I can say that.) Clear and to the point, his prose draws out an evironment with the delicate love of a draftsman. Actually, most of the draftsmen I've met were very artistic indeed; strike that remark from the record.But dangit, he litters the book with cosmological concepts, and I'm just a sucker for that. Obviously a Clarke fan with no less than two blatant references to the master's works, he builds a vast story within the framework of our current body of science. Not only taking us on a pleasant ride, but teaching us a few things along the way.So the bottom line is, read it, but don't expect it to keep you up all weekend.On a side-note, my New Year's resolution is to write Amazon reviews for all of the books I buy from Amazon this year. Next up, Lila - An Inquiry into Morals. This is Pirsig's follow up to Zen and the Art of Mortocycle Maintenance.

Dichotomy properly asserts the existence of two distinct or substances: the one extended, tangible, and divisible, the object of the senses, and the other unextended and invisible, the thinking, feeling, and willing subject in man.

Before the play opens, the king of Denmark has been murdered by his brother, Claudius, who has taken the throne and married the queen, Gertrude. The ghost of the dead king visits his son, Prince Hamlet, and urges him to avenge the murder. Hamlet, tormented by this revelation, appears to be mad and cruelly rejects Ophelia whom he loved. Using a troupe of visiting players to act out his father's death, the prince prompts Claudius to expose his own guilt. Hamlet then kills Ophelia's father Polonius in mistake for Claudius, and Claudius tries but fails to have Hamlet killed. Ophelia drowns herself in grief, and her brother Laertes fights a duel with Hamlet.Hamlet's dilemma is often seen as typical of those whose thoughtful nature prevents quick and decisive action.Hamlet contains several fine examples of soliloquy, such as &quot; To be or not to be&quot; and Hamlet's earlier speech lamenting his mother's hasty remarriage and Claudius' reign which opens &quot;O! that this too too solid flesh would melt&quot;. Much quoted lined &quot;Neither a borrower nor a lender be&quot;, &quot;Something is rotten in the stste of Denmark&quot;, &quot;Brevity is the soul of wit&quot;, &quot;To sleep: perchance to dream: ay, there's the rub;&quot; The lady doth protest too much, methinks,&quot; and &quot;Alas, poor Yorick&quot;.

With the translated version, for example, it made reading Hamlet's famous soliloquies a pleasure to ponder and to begin to understand.The editor's Introduction gives a concise overview of the life and times of William Shakespeare. It is certainly enough for the casual reader, and but just a rudimentary beginning for any serious student.I have a better understanding of Hamet today than I did when I was in college more than two decades ago.

So in order to score better in Jeopardy, I sought a Shakespeare book that was readable, and by sheer luck, a friend pointed me to the \\"No Fear\\" editions of Shakespeare books. Essentially, the book has a side-by-side comparison of Shakespeare's original play in Old Style English, and on the opposing page, Shakespeare in modern-day english. After reading both versions, I found I prefered the modern version. I am not even through with the book yet, but I am very pleased to read Shakespeare and understand exactly what I am reading without having to interpret the Old English in my mind. My college graduate son says I am taking the easy way out and believes I should read the old style, but I doubt I would read Hamlet, or any of Shakespeare's works if I had to read it in the original text.

Hamlet proves to be a masterpiece of masterpieces -a shining paradigm of unparalleled magnificence unlike any other play ever written. I thoroughly enjoyed Julius Caesar, Othello, Macbeth, Henry V, The Merchant of Venice, Much Ado About Nothing, Romeo & Juliet, The Tempest, etc.Nonetheless, I unquestionably rate Hamlet as Shakespeare's crowning achievement - his magnum opus.Hamlet proves to be a prodigiously powerful and profoundly potent play incredibly chock-full of amazing quotes and axioms that I memorize and incorporate into everyday life - from Polonius's sanctimonious speeches spoken to Laertes and Ophelia(\\"To thine own self be true\\") to Marcellus(\\"Something is rotten in the state of Denmark\\") to of course the avenger himself Prince Hamlet(\\"Frailty, thy name is woman!\\").Although Hamlet's faults of inaction, procrastination, and paradoxical impetuosity preclude our protagonist from overcoming his impending and unalterable doom, I unavoidably empathize with him and his inevitable plight. Hamlet is grievously wronged by so many in his life - his uncle Claudius, his mother Gertrude, his love Ophelia, the ostensibly wise Polonius, shamefully by his traitorous \\"friends\\" Rosencrantz & Guildenstern, and lastly by his murderous foil(no pun intended)Laertes. The undeniable central theme of uncontrollable fatalism pervades throughout Hamlet. I felt as if Hamlet was on an unstoppable one way train going 200 miles/hour straight into a brick wall. Sadly, he knows he shall soon meet his untimely demise as he picks up his foil to fight Laertes. Fittingly, the victorious young Fortinbras proves to personify what could have and should have become of our tragically departed hero.To be read time and time again - even if just for the supremely witty quotes. Recommended AFTER reading: Kenneth Branagh or Laurence Olivier's film versions - both long, but undeniably superb."},{"Title":"Hamlet (Illustrated Shakespeare Ser.)","review":"There's an old joke about a woman who saw Hamlet performed for the first time. &quot;I don't know what anybody sees in that play,&quot; she said, &quot;it's just a bunch of cliches strung together.&quot; Whether Hamlet spawned or merely perpetuated cliches, the play abounds with phrases that have passed into the common speech. From beginning to end, from &quot;There's something rotten in Denmark&quot; to &quot;goodnight sweet prince&quot;, familiar language assaults the ear. The long life of these sayings attests to Shakespeare's powerful plotting and powerful language. Critics have hailed &quot;Hamlet&quot; as Shakespeare's masterpiece, prompting Oscar Wilde to ask &quot;Are the critics mad or merely pretending to be?&quot; It is a complex and paradoxical play, with complex, paradoxical protagonists engaging in complex, illogical behavior. Whether the play is a masterpiece or a disasterpiece, good or bad, is fairly debatable. But good or bad, it commands our attention and entertains us.The &quot;BBC Presents&quot; audio version of Hamlet is long--3 1/2 hours over four cassettes. Most audio publications of Shakespeare's plays run to two cassettes. One contributing factor to the length is the inordinate amount of music. Lengthy musical performances mark the separation between acts and major scenes. The music does not enhance the production."},{"Title":"Hamlet (Illustrated Shakespeare Ser.)","review":"My only complaint about this play is that Shakespeare kills the suspense of the actual play within the play that 'catches the conscience of the king,' with the inappropriate dumbshow. This play is a phenomenal masterpiece. While some plays deal with 2D good and evil characters like Albany and Goneril from &quot;King Lear,&quot; &quot;Hamlet&quot; offers us a hero (Hamlet) with prevalent evil traits and a villain (Claudius) with several good points. Aside from the deep psychological insights into human nature it is an interesting situation. To be sure, Hamlet wants to revenge the murder of his father. But, Hamlet also wants to kill Claudius and get the crown too. Claudius wants to kill Hamlet and keep the crown too. But because they are both loved by the public, direct action is impossible. It is also interesting that Gertrude and Polonius are not intelligent enough to see the plainest point. Hamlet and Claudius on the other hand are both so highly intelligent, that it is like they are playing political chess. I also find it striking that Shakespeare at times presents the hero Hamlet with evil traits such as the brutal killing of Polonius. On the other hand, Claudius the villain shows himself to be a capable ruler, especially when he quells Laertes' raid with pure courage and intelligence. Also, he does not delight in what he had to do to get the crown. He clearly regrets it and suffers for it."},{"Title":"Hamlet (Illustrated Shakespeare Ser.)","review":"The Folger Library series are your best Shakespeare source. They specialize in Shakespeares' greatest plays and are quality books that are perfect companion and translator to Shakespeare. It is loaded with page after page of translation from the Old English expressions that are no longer in use to our modern talk, and pictures as well as historic background information on th Elizabethan era and Shakespeares' life. Hamlet is without question Shakespeare's greatest tragedy, remaining in our theatrical culture to this very day. It has become a conversation piece for English professors, dramatists and screen actors (Mel Gibson tackled the role in 1991) and even psychologists, who claim that Hamlet had the Oedipal complex, especially when they read the scene in which Hamlet is in his mother's bedroom. What makes Hamlet so great ? Why does this old play still come alive when performed on the stage in the hands of the right actors ?Shakespeare, believe it or not, was a people's person and knew about the human condition perhaps more than anyone in his day. Hamlet deals principally with obscession for revenge. Hamlet is a prince whose father has been murdered under the evil conspiracy from his uncle Claudius and even the support of his mother, Queen Gertrude. Depressed, wearing black all the time, and very much as solitary as any \\"Goth\\" would be in our day, Hamlet laments his situation, until his father's ghost appears and urges him to avenge his death. The mystery still remains, is this ghost real ? Is it, as many in Elizabetheans thought, a demon in disguise ? Or is it simply a figment of Hamlet's own emotions and desire for revenge. At any rate, Hamlet's father appears twice and Hamlet spends most of the play planning his revenge. His most striking line that reveals this consuming need is \\"The play's the thing, wherein I'll catch the conscience of the king!\\".Pretending to be mad, he scorns even the love of the woman he genuinely loves, Ophelia, whose mind is shattered and heart is broken and who has an impressive mad scene. The deaths of Hamlet's friends, Rosencrantz and Guildenstern, are also in Hamle'ts hands and a consequence of his revenge. The famous soliloquy in the play, is of course, \\"To be or not to be\\", taken on by such great actors as Lawrence Olivier and Orson Welles. Hamlet muses on the brevity of life and the suffering which can only cease through death, as he holds a skull and is evidently suicidal. Finally, the last scenes are the most dramatic. Hamlet duels with Laertes, Ophelia's brother, and with Claudius himself. The deaths of the main cast, including the Queen, goes to show how tragic the human desire for greed and revenge is.This is Shakespeare's finest tragedy, and quality drama, best seen in a live stage performance, but that also works as a film. As for this book, as I said before, this is the Hamlet to have. You will become more acquianted with Hamlet and Shakespeare even more than taking a year's course with a teacher. This book itself is the teacher."},{"Title":"Hamlet (Illustrated Shakespeare Ser.)","review":"Okay, so I am reviewing \\"Hamlet\\". It's good. Everyone should know that.But more importantly, the character Hamlet is a microcosm of us all. Our potential for reluctance, revenge, soaring intellect, and noble actions. Shakespeare created in this character a person who transcends the play he is in and helps to create a realistic humanity in fiction that has rarely, if ever, been equaled. A good reader is a rereader and \\"Hamlet\\" should be reread after life intervals. This text keeps giving, and that is a marvelous gift!As for the Pelican Shakespeare series, they are my favorite editions as the scholarly research is top notch and the editions themselves looks good as an aesthetic unit. It looks and feels like a play and this compliments the text's contents admirably. The Pelican series was recently reedited and has the latest scholarship on Shakespeare and his time period. Well priced and well worth it."},{"Title":"Hamlet (Illustrated Shakespeare Ser.)","review":"I'm not ashamed to admit it. I find Shakespeare difficult. I need help. The Cambridge School Shakespeare editions, with the classroom activities and assignments on each facing page, give me the focus and direction I need to finally truly enjoy the text.I thought I didn't like Shakespeare until I took a class on several of the plays. It turns out that I love Shakespeare when I'm doing close reading or studying it carefully but for whatever reason I find it extremely difficult to do on my own. The Cambridge School editions allow me to replicate the classroom experience on my own, providing enough background and questions for critical thought that I keep a close focus on the text. Previous times I've attempted to read 'Hamlet' I was struggling just to figure out what was going on; reading this edition I was analyzing the characters and considering different acting and directing choices. It's amazing."},{"Title":"Hamlet (Illustrated Shakespeare Ser.)","review":"As a college student who had to write a paper on Hamlet,Again,I of course had to get away from any classic ideas about the play. Being a student with a talent for writing I would never be able to \\"get away with,\\" these common theories, as professor's expect much more. This book really helped me to create a rather ambitious and interesting thesis; one which went against the criticisms in the book, and was refreshingly new.I like the individual criticisms in this book as they really force you to look harder for textual evidence. One of the BEST things about the book was that it included the whole play as well. That was so useful because I didn't have to juggle two books -one of them being the complete works of Shakespeare which weighs about 20lbs. I was able to take this book everywhere and work on it whenever I had spare time.However, I would not sugesst this book for an individual who does not have a very strong background in Hamlet. You need to know the play Extremely well in order for this book to benefit you. If you do not know Hamlet inside and out, then this book will only cause confusion and you should probably stay away from it, as the theories may be difficult to comprehend."},{"Title":"Hamlet (Illustrated Shakespeare Ser.)","review":"This book is definitely God's gift to all college students.

Some valuable insights too and not just for students."},{"Title":"Hamlet (Illustrated Shakespeare Ser.)","review":"In my eyes, Shakespeare could do almost no wrong, but some of his plays were decidedly better than others--Hamlet, for example--for reasons of literary style, subject matter, etc. In my case, his tragedies are far more interesting than his romances/comedies/histories given the wide range of emotions you're made to feel upon reading them.In any case, Hamlet has the best quotes, and has spawned a million books/movie versions/spin-offs. \\"Get the to a nunnery\\", \\"something rotten in Denmark\\", \\"To be, or not to be\\", \\"A hit; a very palpable hit\\"... the list is endless. If nothing else, it's the kind of material that's easily visualized and easily understood. I might have been 15 years old when I first read it, but it all made sense.Moral dilemma--ethics--deceit--virtue--honour--revenge... these are all things that make a story classic, not rustic. Over 400 years later, the source material is as vital as ever. Excellent stuff."},{"Title":"Hamlet (Illustrated Shakespeare Ser.)","review":"Hamlet is considered by many to be the greatest story in the English language. At any rate, it is one of the most famous of all of Shakespeare's works, only Romeo &amp; Juliet really comes close. I recently finished reading the book in my Honors English class and I truly believe that it stands the test of time, and that it's reputation is well deserved.But I would also like to comment on this edition. It provides a lot of helpful notes on vocabulary and cultural notes about the period in which it was written and takes place. There is also an essay in the end with some analysis, and several pages of notes and helpful facts at the beginning. If you are reading Hamlet on your own and/or this is your first time reading it, I suggest using this edition."},{"Title":"Hamlet (Illustrated Shakespeare Ser.)","review":"Like another reviewer wrote, Hamlet is a tragedy of youth, but it isn't the tragedy of lost innocence, it's a tragedy of youthful rashness. Yes, I said rashness. Hamlet doesn't think too much, he thinks too rashly, too hastily, without mature consideration. Just because his mother is a whore he quickly concludes that all women therefore must be whores. This is why he torments Ophelia and bids her, \\"get thee to a nunnery\\". This is why he decries, \\"woman, thy name weakness\\". This is why he's despondent and unable to respond to his father's injunctions.There are plenty of examples in the play of this youthful recklessness. Laertes, when he learns of his father's death, immediately rushes back to Denmark and assembles an army to exact revenge. Fortinbras does the same thing in order to retake the land his father lost to Hamlet's father. Both are checked in their youthful exuberance by their respective kings. Polonius' advice to his son is nothing but words of caution against youthful excesses (drink, women, gambling). Polonius' advice to his daughter is nothing but strictures against falling hopelessly in love with Hamlet. The little dialogue between Hamlet and Rosencrantz about the state of theater in London is about how a wild and vociferous younger generation of actors have sabotaged the stage and are holding the older generation at bay.Hamlet himself exhibits other rash behavior. When he sees Ophelia's funeral procession and hears Laertes' expressions of grief, he (Hamlet), regardless of the danger he throws himself in, he recklessly jumps into the procession and proclaims HIS love above the brother's. When Hamlet first sees the ghost he doesn't think to question whether the apparition is authentic. He believes it instinctively. It only occurs to him much later that he may have been the dupe of an evil spirit. When he discovers someone eavesdropping on his talk with his mother, he immediately kills him without even looking to see who it is. When the king invites Hamlet to fence with Laertes for a stake, he rashly throws caution to the wind and cavalierly accepts the offer.Cases of this youthful impulsiveness are legion in the play and wherever it goes unchecked, tragedy ennsues. Not just Hamlet's death, but also Laerte's deception by the king, and Ophelia's suicide. Fortinbras alone comes out unscathed, and only because he accepted the wise counsel of the king of Norway.So Hamlet can be seen as a play about the folly of youth. Issues about the evil in human nature are raised, but these are not the central themes. In fact, the play lacks a certain unity of design because there is a big difference between the rashness of youth, which is not an evil, and fratricide and incest, which are. There's a big incongruity between the central and secondary themes. For this reason I give Hamlet less than five stars."},{"Title":"Hamlet (Illustrated Shakespeare Ser.)","review":"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark, written by William Shakespeare, considered to be one of the best playwrights of all time, was a solid, entertaining drama. Hamlet is consistently suspenseful and full of struggle between the characters.As a first time Shakespeare reader, I found the play challenging to read because it contains language written about four centuries ago. However, Shakespeare carefully crafted his words of prose so that every sensible person would enjoy reading it.Hamlet is about a prince of the same name. He learns that his father, once King, had been murdered by his uncle, now the King, who, soon after his father's death, married Hamlet's mother. The ghost of King Hamlet arrives one night and wants Hamlet to revenge his father's death. The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark is woven with many unique characters that only Shakespeare could provide. These characters include the pathetic Polonius, the suicidal Ophelia and the ignorant and foolish Queen Gertrude. Hamlet struggles throughout the play to determine the right thing to do regarding his father's death, and how to do it.I recommend this book to all people who love great drama. In this bold piece of literature and many of his other works, Shakespeare has the unique ability to teach many valuable and interesting lessons, some of which are comical, and some of which are serious. If you are new to the world of dramas such as Hamlet, you may soon become an addict. As you can see, Shakespeare is an amazing playwright, and I hope you have the pleasure of reading this story in the future."},{"Title":"Hamlet (Illustrated Shakespeare Ser.)","review":"Great literature has often been compared to a mirror that reflects man's inner development. Described as the first true modern work, Hamlet is full of the uncertainty and skepticism modern readers are only too familiar with. Unlike other tragic Shakespearean heroes such as Macbeth and Othello, Hamlet is rational before he is valiant. With most of his strife and turmoil being metaphysical rather than physical, Hamlet is at his best an obsessive spectator of the \\"weary, stale, flat, and unprofitable\\" state of human existence. As Harold Bloom puts it, Hamlet is a hero too grandiose for his own play. And indeed, savoring Hamlet's excessive reasoning in retrospection, the reader is able to see how despite his many emotional outbursts, Hamlet gropes beyond the goal of revenge because he is ultimately concerned with the nature and source of evil rather than the means to combat it. Can we then say Hamlet the play is but a decorative device for Hamlet the hero? Why not, Shakespeare needed actions to let his own dark vision of the human psyche unfold through Hamlet, who develops an extremely pessimistic outlook on humanity that has endured over time. By letting the reader discover for himself the same transience prevalent in everything and everyone else, Hamlet shows the daunting immortality of thoughts. Read it for the \\"to be or not to be\\" speech if nothing else."},{"Title":"Hamlet (Illustrated Shakespeare Ser.)","review":"I think this is good representation of the play. The characters are very relatable but at the same time very fictitional. All of them have qualities about them that we see in ourselves and each other. They also have qualities that we want to see in ourselves and each other. Although the plot thickins throughout the play, one still gets an understanding of what is going on. The play has its good and bad parts of it, just like any other book or play. The plot is one that is fictional because this kind of thing usually dosn't happen to people. That is why it is liked so much by people. The play begins actually, slowley, so one gets the point of what is going on, then goes into depth about why this is going on. And about why all this is happening and how it starts. Most of all , the play is understandable. Although the words are old english, one still gets the meaning. Shakespeare put in words what he needs to to get the point across."},{"Title":"Hamlet (Illustrated Shakespeare Ser.)","review":"The plot of Hamlet had many twists and turns. This made the play very complicated but it was still very easy to follow. This was helped by the characters explaining things thoroughly. You never really knew who was going to die and how they were going to die. This was a very well written play. It was written to keep the audience interested while telling a sad and depressing story.Hamlet was interesting because the way it starts out just pulls you into the plot by starting out with the ghost appearing and from there it just get more interesting. This play had many unexpected twists such as Ophelia going insane and all of the other main characters dying. The first twist though was the ghost appearing and talking to Hamlet. This within the first act was what compelled you to read on. then when the players come and Hamlet is going insane that compells you to read even farther.The play of Hamlet Prince of Demnark is possibly one of Shakespeares best written plays and quite possibly one of the best plays ever. Hamlet is a very compelling and involving play with many character and subplots without confusing the reader.

And I still listen to it on long car rides -- it's a great production. Having the full text read so well led me to new insights about the characters. Contrasting these interpretations to those of our own actors showed how flexible Shakespeare's writing is. And listening to the full text helped me understand why our director cut what she did. While the volume level is sometimes uneven (as it always seems to be with BBC Radio and TV productions), this is still essential listening for anyone preparing to act in, direct, or study Hamlet. Branagh is, well, Branagh -- sometimes the ego gets in the way, and sometimes he is astounding. The &quot;oh, that this too, too sullied flesh would melt&quot; speech is one of my favorites -- he falls into a wonderful rhythm that just carries it forward at the perfect pace.

Hamlet is the most famous failed law student in Western culture. Go see a live production. Read the play. Or get a video, or listen to an audio version. Do all four. Versions of Hamlet have been done by Laurence Olivier, Nicol Williamson, Mel Gibson, Kenneth Branagh, Derek Jacobi, or the unattainable version done by Baylor University Theater in the 1950s - the film version won a world film festival in Brussels in 1957. (Yes, I know Jacobi plays the King in Branagh's version, but Jacobi himself played Hamlet - - about the time when Branagh was 15 years old. It's better than his I, Claudius.)Hamlet, like Shakespeare's other plays, has created a huge cottage industry of scholars, actors, theaters and books. The force of Hamlet's personality dwarfs all others, however. To see a man driven mad, and while mad, feign madness, is one of the most clever story twists of world literature. The mind and heart of Hamlet has been thrown into great, tortured pain by several levers -- the death of his father, the overhasty marriage of his mother to his uncle, the usurpation of his throne by his uncle, the threat to the entire kingdom from Fortinbras, the horrifying appearance of the ghost of his father in purgatory torments, the news of the murder of his father from a supernatural phenomenon. The rejection by his lover, Orphelia, and his ensuing mistrust of her, adds nuclear fission to the fire.You must experience Hamlet. Oh, for a true friend like Horatio!"},{"Title":"Hamlet (Illustrated Shakespeare Ser.)","review":"Hamlet has always been thought of as one of the classics of literature. I could not think of another book which deserves this title more. The story of a Danish pricne who learns from his fathers ghost that his father, the king, was murdered by his brother, Hamlet's uncle, who then went on to marry Hamlet's mother. Hamlet is overcome by a longing for revenge, but also indecisive. Shakespeare creates a great amount of tension between the chatacters with powerful confrontatoins and biting language. It is a suspenseful tragedy, filled with anguish.William Shakespeare was a genious when it came to breaking down the human psyche, and Hamlet is perhaps one of the most complex plays when it comes to human emotions. It is undoubtably one of his finest works, full of very complex, interesting characters, and a wonderfully chaotic plot. There are innumerable theories on Hamlet, why he is so indecisive, and if it all comes down to an oedipus complex. whatever way you interpret it, everyone can get something out of it. I feel like I am priveleged to have read such a wonderful play.Hamlet is a character that I can relate to in some ways, being a very indecisive person myself. I felt I could connect with him better than many Shakespeare characters, MacBeth, Ceasar, Juliet, Helena or Hermia. That is one of the reasons that I enjoyed Hamlet so very much. I wish that everyone could love Hamlet as much as I did, but I know, especially being a high-school student, that it is a little much for general reading. For high school students, like me, I very strongly recommend this book, if you really like Shakespeare, and aren't looking for a quick read. Otherwise, it might be a little to much to tackle, if you don't really enjoy Shakespearian tragedies.

On the one hand, Anne Barton tells me that it is, by a wide margin, Shakespeare's longest play. Looking at those 5 acts, 20 scenes and more than 3700 lines, I can well believe it. On the other hand, the sheer popularity of the play is intimidating. I see it repeatedly described as \\"Shakespeare's best\\", \\"one of the most quoted works in the English literature\\", \\"one of the most influential works ever written\\", etc. It is amazing to find so many familiar phrases in Hamlet's lines: \\"Frailty, thy name is woman\\" (I.2.146), \\"To be, or not to be\\" (of course, III.1.56), \\"slings and arrows of outrageous fortune\\" (III.1.58), \\"conscience does make cowards of us all\\" (III.1.83) and many others. The most disappointing of these discoveries was that the famous \\"Something is rotten in the state of Denmark\\" (I.4.90) is actually not spoken by Hamlet. It was a big let-down to \\"hear\\" the words from the mouth of Marcellus. The most surprising discovery was that one of the earliest and most obscure essays by Bertrand Russell took its title from Hamlet's words: \\"Seems, madam? Nay, it is\\" (I.2.76). Clearly, the influence of the play has been tremendous if so many phrases are familiar to somebody who has read virtually no Shakespeare so far.Now, all this is very fascinating but I don't particularly care about it, or at least I will do my best not to care. Scholars may argue where exactly to place \\"To be, or not to be\\" and critics may hail this and the other soliloquies as the most profound stuff ever written. That's their own business. My objective here is much more modest: to formulate as clearly as possible what \\"Hamlet\\" means to me as a newcomer to Shakespeare who is rather anxious to explore what's considered the playwright's best.On the whole, my experience with \\"Hamlet\\" has been like my previous encounters with Shakespeare. I was prepared for something unreadable and overrated: I actually got something compulsively readable and rather underrated. No, of course I don't think it is the greatest work in English, nor do I think Shakespeare is the greatest writer in that language. Neither any single work nor any single writer should be degraded by such cheap accolades. Shakespeare himself, I am sure, would not have taken his modern fame seriously. He might have been offended. But more probably he would have been amused.The play is by no means perfect. It has some dull moments and it has some, indeed many, issues that remain quite unresolved after the final curtain. Above all, there is a tantalising, and often perplexing, ambiguity about the central character. My overall impression, however, is of a superbly crafted piece of theatre that deals with many serious issues. It will not answer any profound philosophical questions. Great literature is not supposed to do that anyway. It is you who should do it for yourself. The best that a great writer can do is to make you think harder than ever before on such questions. That Shakespeare does.Unlike \\"Othello\\" or \\"Romeo and Juliet\\", the action in \\"Hamlet\\" takes place over longer periods of time, weeks and even months, and this may be one of the reasons why it is not quite satisfactory as a structure. The plot depends a little too heavily on eavesdropping, some scenes are unduly extended with material of whose importance I fail to be convinced (e.g. Hamlet's ranting to the players and to Guildenstern and Rosencrantz in II.2. and III.2., or the exquisite but inappropriate comedy with the two gravediggers that opens V.2.), and the mass slaughter in the finale is just a trifle too lurid. Four corpses in four pages tends to turn a tragedy into a comedy. I also expected the critical play within the play (III.2.) to be dramatically more effective; as it is, it gives the impression of something that was written in a haste and remained rather unfinished, or unpolished if you like.Despite all that, \\"Hamlet\\" makes for a surprisingly dramatic read. The second act and the beginning of the third are almost painfully dull, but after III.2., one of the longest and most important scenes, there is no slowing down until the holocaust in the end.I can well see why nearly every actor, including many ill-qualified ones, is only too eager to play the Prince of Denmark. Hamlet is a most fascinating creature, full of contradictions. Much like, broadly speaking, Philip Carey in Somerset Maugham's \\"Of Human Bondage\\" or David Morey in Archibald Cronin's \\"The Judas Tree\\", Hamlet is one of those characters you can always sympathize yet are often exasperated with. The finest description of the Dane I have ever heard is Mel Gibson's: ''Hamlet is more than a part. It's an assault on your personality. Every passing day his doubts become more your doubts.'' Indeed!In the end, somewhat surprisingly, I find myself overwhelmed with sympathy for the Prince. Much as I sometimes want to shake him by the shoulders and cry into his face \\"Get a grip, man!\\", I often find it much easier to identify with Hamlet's uncertain mind, a bizarre mixture of integrity, cowardice, nihilism, morbidity, nobility, madness. So, let's have a look inside Hamlet's head, as revealed in his relationships with the other characters as well as in his famous soliloquies.First of all, it must be said that Hamlet is no fool. In fact, he is well educated, having just returned from the university of Wittenberg, and highly intelligent fellow, as obvious not just from his introspective soliloquies but also from many of his lines addressed to other characters. Nor, with the obvious exception of his deliberate ''antic disposition'', is he insane. Quite to the contrary. He often shows a remarkable capacity for dispassionate self-analysis.The soliloquy in which Hamlet, after reflecting how drama mirrors life, decides to set a ''Mousetrap'' for his uncle is very rich in self-disparaging remarks, one more apt than the other: ''O what a rogue and peasant slave am I!'' (II.2.147), ''A dull and muddy-mettled rascal'' (II.2.164). Please note that this is no pose. There is no one else on the stage for Hamlet to pretend. I wonder how many people can look inside themselves with such degree of honesty. Hamlet goes even further, mocking himself how ''most brave'' his lack of determination is:O, vengeance!Why, what an ass am I! This is most brave,That I, the son of a dear father murdered,Prompted to my revenge by heaven and hell,Must like a whore unpack my heart with wordsAnd fall a-cursing like a very drab,A stallion![II.2.579-585]It is striking how accurately Hamlet describes some of the other characters, too. ''Thou wretched, rash, intruding fool, farewell!'' (III.4.83) suits Polonius perfectly. It's also notable that sometimes he reveals himself, unwittingly, in conversations with others. It is a superb touch of irony that Hamlet, while discussing the drunken habits of the Danes, should make an acute analysis of his own personality. It might even be that he is aware of the irony, but thinks, rightly, that Barnardo and Marcellus wouldn't grasp it and he doesn't mind if Horatio does. Not for nothing did Laurence Olivier start his classic movie version with these lines:So oft it chances in particular menThat - for some vicious mole of nature in them,As in their birth, wherein they are not guilty,Since nature cannot choose his origin,By the o'ergrowth of some complexion,Oft breaking down the pales and forts of reason,Or by some habit that too much o'er-leavensThe form of plausive manners - that these men,Carrying, I say, the stamp of one defect,Being nature's livery or fortune's star,His virtues else, be they as pure as grace,As infinite as man may undergo-Shall in the general censure take corruptionFrom that particular fault.[I.4.23-36]In fact, Olivier even went as far as declaring the above to be the essence of all of Shakespeare's tragic characters: Hamlet, Macbeth, Lear, Othello, Richard (Shylock if you like). This is surely an over-simplification. But it's worth considering.Not the least important, nor the least attractive, feature of Hamlet is his sardonic sense of humour, often expressed by subtle puns and allusions. The very first words of his, prompted by the King's ''my son'' and brilliantly summing-up Hamlet's predicament, immediately establish the Prince as a sharp-tongued fellow: ''A little more than kin, and less than kind!'' Hamlet also has an enviable ability to make quips. Favourite examples include a rebuke of Polonius' complain that the prologue is too long - ''It shall to the barber's, with your beard.'' (II.2.497) - and a daring reply to his uncle who asks where (the now dead) Polonius is. Hamlet replies that he is at supper but ''Not where he eats, but where he is eaten.'' (IV.3.19), and a little later adds ''In heaven. Send thither to see. If your messenger find him not / there, seek him i' th' other place yourself.'' (IV.3.32-34). My favourite example of comedy within the tragedy must be Hamlet's blindly slaying Polonius, hidden behind the arras (III.4.28-29).Queen: What thou hast done?Hamlet: Nay, I know not. Is it the king?Last but not least, when Hamlet is in the mood for talking dirty, the poor Ophelia is left almost speechless. I am grateful to the editor for pointing out to me that ''country matters'' actually means ''sexual intercourse''. Now that's magnificent:Hamlet: Lady, shall I lie in your lap?Ophelia: No, my lord.Hamlet: I mean, my head upon your lap?Ophelia: Ay, my lord.Hamlet: Do you think I meant country matters?Ophelia: I think nothing, my lord.Hamlet: That's a fair thought to lie between maids' legs.[III.2.121-128]On the other hand, Hamlet's inability to make up his own mind is pathological. His complete lack of resolution, his simply outstanding incapacity to take any responsibility, often diminish my sympathy to nearly non-existent levels.In his first soliloquy (I.2.129-158) we see Hamlet distraught by what must be a serious predicament: his father's dead body is still warm, yet his uncle, a ''satyr'' to ''Hyperion'' compared to the old king, has already married his mother. For some rather inscrutable reason the new King and the old Queen insist on Hamlet's staying in court, rather than returning to his studies in Wittenberg. It is understandable that the Prince is depressed by the whole situation, especially considering his obvious love for his late father. Shortly after that, indeed the very same evening (I.5.), Hamlet meets and speaks with the Ghost of the old King. He tells him in no uncertain terms that he had been killed, poisoned by his own brother who, moreover, had an affair with his mother.Then follows, naturally enough, Hamlet's second soliloquy (I.5.92-109), which is a passionate ranting that he would fulfil his father's request and revenge his death. What do you think Hamlet does next? He decides ''To put an antic disposition on'' (I.5.172), in simpler words: to pretend he is crazy in order (presumably) not to be discovered that he has any suspicions. Being a theatre lover and apparently an adept dramatist himself, in his third soliloquy (II.2.547-603) Hamlet decides, with furious passion yet rather sensibly, that he must have something more substantial than a mere Ghost, and the theatre is the perfect weapon for the purpose:I have heardThat guilty creatures sitting at a playHave by the very cunning of the sceneBeen struck so to the soul that presentlyThey have proclaimed their malefactions.For murder, though it have no tongue, will speakWith most miraculous organ. I'll have these playersPlay something like the murder of my fatherBefore mine uncle. I'll observe his looks.I'll tent him to the quick. If he but blench,I know my course. The spirit that I have seenMay be a devil, and the devil hath powerT' assume a pleasing shape, yea, and perhapsOut of my weakness and my melancholy,As he is very potent with such spirits,Abuses me to damn me. I'll have groundsMore relative than this. The play's the thingWherein I'll catch the conscience of the King.[II.2.586-603]It is notable that the Prince has absolutely no idea what he would do if the king did prove guilty. When this duly happens, what do you think Hamlet does next? The answer is absolutely nothing - except his usual specialty of evasive, opaque, obscure, confused reflections. Not deeds or actions or even plans, but just that: thoughts. And there is a superb irony here, an irony I already learn to expect in Shakespeare. Just some fifty lines after the above quote, when Hamlet openly questions the veracity of the Ghost, we, the audience, have our first proof that Claudius is indeed guilty of his brother's death, as clearly expressed in his short soliloquy (III.1.50-54). But never mind that. For there follows an even more exquisite irony.After the critical scene (III.2.) with the inset play, Hamlet has a superb opportunity to kill his uncle. While on his way to Gertrude's closet, he glimpses Claudius on his knees, praying for his sins, altogether an excellent target for some sword practice. What do you think Hamlet does? Why, he soliloquies, of course! This is his fifth monologue (III.3.73-96) as well as one of the most suspenseful scenes in the whole play. Hamlet, of course, does nothing, and his excuses are characteristically vague, not to say stupid. If I kill him now, the Dane reflects wisely, his soul would go straight to Heaven, ''Why, this is hire and salary, not revenge.'' (III.3.79). Such a spineless creature! The sheer dramatic genius of Shakespeare shines brightly in the last two lines of this scene. They belong to Claudius, Hamlet having apparently left the stage, and they make it clear that his prayers had been quite unsuccessful.\\"My words fly up, my thoughts remain below.Words without thoughts never to heaven go.\\"In other words, Hamlet needn't have worried. He might have cut his uncle's throat without his soul going anywhere near Heaven. It really does take a dramatic genius to finish a scene like that.As for Hamlet himself, in his last soliloquy (IV.4.32-66) he continues to agonize over the weakness of human nature, finishing in grand style (my emphasis): \\"My THOUGHTS be bloody, or be nothing worth!\\" It is by no means unimportant that all three killings Hamlet does commit until the final scene are of victims he doesn't see because they are either behind the arras (Polonius) or far away in England (Rosencrantz and Guildenstern). When he finally does kill Claudius, face to face, he knows he has been poisoned and will be dead soon.Yet to condemn the Prince of Denmark for his lack of character is only too easy. And pointless. After all, what could Hamlet do? Kill Claudius and take the throne? Yes, certainly. But imagine what kind of king he would be! Why becoming a king only to have Fortinbras knocking spots off you? Hamlet knows only too well that he would never make half as good a king as his father did. No matter what he choose to do, he is doomed. On the one hand, he is quite unfit by temperament to be king and, on the other hand, his own inactivity and cowardice, not to mention his mother's betrayal with his Cain-like uncle, torture him more painfully than anything else. Perhaps the only thing that Hamlet could possibly have done in order to save himself was to go somewhere far away from Denmark and try to forget the whole thing. But probably it would not have worked anyway.There is, perhaps, a deeper reason for Hamlet's essential incompatibility with this world. I have deliberately left out above his most celebrated soliloquy: ''To be, or not to be'' (III.1.56-89). You know, these thirty lines are very much like Newton's three laws. They are so obvious that it's often neglected how profound they actually are. To be, or not to be, that really is the question to end all questions. Does life have any meaning, and if it does what is it?To be, or not to be - that is the question;Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to sufferThe slings and arrows of outrageous fortuneOr to take arms against a sea of troubles,And by opposing end them.[III.1.56-60]So far as the Dane is concerned, the answer is a resounding ''not to be''. In this soliloquy Hamlet's nihilism, pessimism and morbidity reach their absolute peak. This is a most unhealthy state of mind, to be sure, but if that's what you are, if that's the way your mind has developed, you don't have much choice. Hamlet looks around and is horrified by the world he sees, a world that can be ended once and for all with a ''bare bodkin'':For who would bear the whips and scorns of time,Th' oppressor's wrong, the proud man's contumely,The pangs of despised love, the law's delay,The insolence of office, and the spurnsThat patient merit of th' unworthy takes,When he himself might his quietus makeWith a bare bodkin?[III.1.70-76]What stops Hamlet from committing suicide is what stop us all, myself included, who have the same mental defect: a deep, deeper than anything, fear of this ''consummation / devoutly to be wished'' [III.1.63-64]. Yes, it is tempting. Yet here is another nagging question for which there is no answer. What happens afterwards? Either you simply cease to be - forever: a horrifying enough notion - or something else which, being unknowable, is every bit as frightening:To sleep - perchance to dream. Ay, there's the rub!For in that sleep of death what dreams may comeWhen we have shuffled off this mortal coil,Must give us pause. There's the respectThat makes calamity of so long life.[III.1.65-69]Who would these fardels bear,To grunt and sweat under a weary life,But that the dread of something after death,The undiscovered country, from whose bournNo traveller returns- puzzles the will,And makes us rather bear those ills we haveThan fly to others that we know not of?Thus conscience does make cowards of us all,[III.1.76-83]Most people, no doubt including many who have read Hamlet, never ask themselves questions like ''To be, or not to be''. Their lives are purely instinctive and, to continue echoing Somerset Maugham, theirs may be the greater wisdom. I envy those people for whom the answer is definitely ''to be'', who consider their lives worth living and death not worth bothering about. Didn't Spinoza once say that the free man thinks of nothing less than of death? True. Hamlet is not that kind of man, nor am I. And this is what, above all, makes Shakespeare's \\"Hamlet\\" such a shattering experience for me.Now let's get down from those rarefied planes of metaphysical speculation.There are other extenuating circumstances as regards to Hamlet's endless vacillating. To begin with, the only piece of \\"evidence\\" about his uncle's guilt he has, apart from his own suspicions, are the dubious words of the Ghost or his uncle's leaving the play in the middle, obviously deeply shaken. Both of these are, to say the least, circumstantial. How exactly does one stab in the back a man during his prayer on such grounds? Not until the end of the play (IV.7.) does Hamlet learn about some of the dark sides of the King's character, as he intercepts the letter that asks the British to secure his own death. But even then Hamlet can't really be sure that Claudius committed fratricide. It seems to me that, despite his deeply disturbed mind, Hamlet's refusal to take his revenge does say something about the nobility and the humanity of his character.We, of course, know only too well that Claudius is guilty as hell. Whether he had seduced Gertrude while the old Hamlet was still alive remains elusive (we have only the Ghost's testimony for that), but his two soliloquies made it clear that he did commit fratricide. The reasons for this, as so much in the play, remain unclear. The most likely explanation, it seems to me, is that Claudius did indeed seduce Gertrude, or at least lusted for her while she was married to his brother. I can't see why he, and not Hamlet, should be elected king after his brother's death. The editor is silent on the matter. Does it make any sense rushing into a questionable marriage with your sister-in-law soon after your brother's death if the kingdom is what you really want? The editor doesn't tell me that, either.There is about the King the same duality of character that makes Hamlet so fascinating. The significant difference is that the case of Claudius is black-and-white, far removed from Hamlet's intensely grey mind. The King's decision to kill his nephew, including his chilling plotting with Laertes (IV.7.), are perfectly understandable. After all, the play that Hamlet has arranged, in addition to making it clear that the Prince knows of the fratricide, is as clear a threat to the King's life as anything. In ''The Murder of Gonzago'' it is the nephew who slays the ruler. The dramatic contrast with the King's rather friendly, almost affectionate, attitude in the beginning of the play is very effective. The same is true for the characters on the whole: Hamlet never dares act until he is on the verge of death; Claudius acts immediately after he is provoked, especially after the Prince slays that patent eavesdropper Polonius.By the way, the councillor of the King is not without charm himself. You have to admire the stupendous amount of common sense he imparts to his son before he leaves for France. It may be preachy, but it is nonetheless profound for that. For my money, it's one of the most amazing passages in the play:And these few precepts in thy memoryLook thou character. Give thy thoughts no tongue,Give thy thoughts no tongue,Nor any unproportioned thought his act.Be thou familiar, but by no means vulgar.Those friends thou hast, and their adoption tried,Grapple them unto thy soul with hoops of steel.But do not dull thy palm with entertainmentOf each new-hatched, unfledged courage. BewareOf entrance to a quarrel. But being in,Bear't that th'opposed may beware of thee.Give every man thine ear, but few thy voice.Take each man's censure, but reserve thy judgment.Costly thy habit as thy purse can buy,But not expressed in fancy; rich, not gaudy;For the apparel oft proclaims the man,And they in France of the best rank and stationAre of a most select and generous chief in that.Neither a borrower nor a lender be,For loan oft loses both itself and friend,And borrowing dulleth edge of husbandry.This above all: to thine own self be true,And it must follow, as the night the day,Thou canst not then be false to any man.[I.3.58-80]It is difficult to imagine that there may exist a man on this planet who cannot profit in one way or another from following at least some of these ''precepts''. It's also diverting to learn (III.4.) that in his youth Polonius was an actor and even played ''Julius Caesar'', a nice ironic touch as regards to his death in the very next scene. The verbosity so typical for him is rather amusing; as the editor tells us, in a rare flash of wit, Polonius' first lines are typical: he takes 33 words to say ''yes''.Yet, for all of his apparent wisdom, Polonius is a fool. He is totally taken in by Hamlet's feigned madness (II.2.) and he continues to believe until the end that the sole reason for this is Ophelia's rejection (on his advice) of the Prince's advances. It never passes Polonius' mind that Hamlet may be troubled by trifles like incest and adultery. It is interesting to speculate whether the councillor knows of the King's crime. There is nothing in the play - or if there is, it went above my head - to suggest that he does. This effectively makes Polonius less of a fool. Also, there is no evidence that there ever was any friendship between the Prince and the Prime minister. So it is hardly surprising that Polonius should stick to the easiest explanation of Hamlet's bizarre behaviour. To arrange his murder while doing his favourite thing - eavesdropping - was a masterful stroke of Shakespearean irony.In passing it may be noted that the Ghost is a very fishy subject. That's perhaps not something unusual for a ghost, but it's disappointing that his nature - whether by Shakespeare's deliberate intention or by his fault - is never fully explained. That he is the old Hamlet is certain enough. But he can be neither seen nor heard by his former wife (III.4.), and to the rest of the characters who do see and recognise him (Horatio, Marcellus, Barnardo) he never speaks a word. The oath in the end of I.5. is the only place (except the Closet Scene of course) when the Ghost speaks in the presence of somebody else but Hamlet. But the words of Horatio - ''O day and night, but this is wondrous strange!'' (I.5.164.) - do not necessarily indicate that he can hear the old king; he may be referring to Hamlet's speaking apparently to the air. So it seems most probable, if decidedly strange, that the Ghost, though real enough to be visible at least to some of the characters, is not very talkative.I am inclined to believe that his words materialize only inside Hamlet's head as a kind of vivid imagery of his suspicions. Not for nothing, perhaps, does the Prince exclaim ''O, my prophetic soul'' (I.5.40) when it becomes clear who slew his father. Fascinatingly enough, Hamlet's only basis for such remarkably correct suspicion is the fact that his mother married his uncle rather in haste (a mere month as abundantly clear from the first soliloquy) after the old king's death. It might also be relevant to note that the Ghost explicitly demands of Hamlet not to plot against his mother. I surmise the only reason for his appearance during the Closet Scene two acts later is to prevent his son, now beside himself, from disobeying his command.Another fishy point of contention is Hamlet's frequent harping on incest. Either I am missing something here or \\"incest\\" had a different meaning in Elizabethan times; if the latter, I wish the editor had warned me. We do have Hamlet's words that ''man and wife is one flesh'' (IV.3.) but they seem to be either more devoid of brains than is usual for him or they lean to some obscure convention of the times. For incest between Claudius and Gertrude is, of course, not possible at all. Adultery, yes. But to have incest there must be a blood relationship, preferably a close one. There is no such thing here. Claudius is Gertrude's brother-in-law. This is a legal relationship, not a blood one. This accusation seems to be Hamlet's chief objection to his mother's behaviour, with adultery and hurried marriage firmly on second place. He mentions it in his very first soliloquy and never tires of repeating it throughout the whole play, often including Claudius. The Ghost, too, speaks of incest in I.5.To say the least, this incest obsession is a trifle strange. Even though I do not share \\"Freudian\\" or \\"Oedipal\\" interpretations of Hamlet's relationship with the Queen, they may still play some part in his attitude. Opinions have ranged from Olivier's somewhat blatant pro-Oedipal kisses in his movie to Asimov's complete rejection in his Guide. I would rather view Hamlet's incestuous ramblings as part of his personal weakness, rather than as being motivated by some unconscious desire for his mother. This does not fit really well with his cerebral make-up, yet it might have something to do with his madness (the real and subtle form of it, not the ''antic disposition'').Hamlet's relationships with the two female characters in the play are, perhaps, the most perplexing of all. The fact that the parts of both Gertrude and Ophelia are at best sketchy doesn't help the matter either. Hamlet himself hardly comes out of both confrontations with unstained conscience. His treatment of Ophelia is absolutely abominable. In III.1. he rejects her in a pretty brutal fashion, and in III.2. he constantly uses her as a scapegoat while he is really angry with his mother. Even Gertrude herself hardly deserves the vitriol she gets in III.4., the justly famous \\"Closet Scene\\". But, of course and as always, the things are not that simple. It is certainly significant that in both cases there is in the end something very much like reconciliation, no matter that, again in both cases, it's too late for it.Don't you believe anybody who tells you that there is a love story or any kind of romance between Hamlet and Ophelia. There was something like that, but by the time the play opens it is completely over, presumably because the shock of his father's death and his mother's second marriage had disturbed Hamlet's amorous disposition too much. What is one to make of his confused \\"I loved thee once\\" and then, four lines later (!), \\"I loved thee not\\"? I really don't know. Perhaps it is not worth exploring this direction.Ophelia, after all, is not a character. She is a pawn, blatantly used by her eternally scheming father for demonstrating Hamlet's \\"antic disposition\\". Despite her most affecting madness, I cannot bring myself to be especially sorry for her. Hamlet's feelings, however, might well have been much deeper. Nothing else could explain his outburst at the funeral (V.1.), with the bold declaration to Laertes that 40 000 brothers can't equal his love for Ophelia. Or maybe he just feels guilty? It is never made clear why the girl goes crazy in the first place. I suspect that it was Hamlet's brutal treatment, and not her father's violent death, that was instrumental in that.Gertrude is a more sympathetic character, if very scantily drawn. It is interesting that in the Closet Scene she makes no attempt to defend herself against Hamlet's torrent of abuse. Then again, what does she have to apologize for? The whole problem - adultery, hasty marriage, incest - is mostly in Hamlet's mind, not in the events, most of which are unsubstantiated enough anyway. What seems certain, and what speaks in favour of Gertrude, is that she probably doesn't know anything about the fratricide. It is not that her surprise at Hamlet's mention of it is genuine, but earlier in the play (II.2.56-57) she makes the perfectly accurate diagnosis of her son's mental disease: ''I doubt it is no other but the main, / His father's death and our o'erhasty marriage.'' She tells this to the King alone, and there is no reason why she should not add at least an allusion to the murder of the old Hamlet had she been aware of it. Last but not least, she finally yields to Hamlet's uncompromising requests: ''Assume a virtue, if you have it not.'' (III.4.161). (The editor tells me that ''assume'' here means ''acquire'', but the modern meaning ''to pretend to have a particular quality'' suits the occasion so much better!)In short, Shakespeare's \\"Hamlet\\" does deserve its fabulous fame. It should be required reading for every thinking creature, unless one has some strong aversion to drama, which is unlikely considering how much it resembles life. I suspect it should also be a ''required seeing'' for everybody who enjoys the paper version. Since I have never seen the play on the stage, I have to rely on the cinema.PS The above reflections refer to the edition of the text by T. J. B.

But as well-known as the storyline is, the play itself is what deserves the attention, both for Shakespeare's shadowy plot filled with uncertainty and treachery -- and for his brilliant, immortal writing, which takes on a new dimension when read on the page.Prince Hamlet of Denmark is understandably upset when, only a short time after his father's death, his mother Gertrude marries his uncle Claudius, who is now the new king. Who wouldn't be unhappy? But when Hamlet encounters the tormented ghost of his father (\\"I am thy father's spirit/Doom'd for a certain term to walk the night\\"), he learns that his dad was murdered by his uncle -- but he's plagued by indecision, since he's unsure if the spirit was truly his dad.In response to this vision, Hamlet's behavior becomes more bizarre and erratic -- he dumps his girlfriend Ophelia, arranges a play that mimics real life a little too closely, and generally acts like a loon. But when an argument with his mother ends in tragedy -- and the death of one of Ophelia's loved ones -- Hamlet's fate is sealed as Claudius begins plotting to get rid of him too.Small warning: like all Shakespeare's plays, it's best to read \\"Hamlet\\" after you've seen a good performance, because the entire thing was intended to be acted out. Otherwise, it's like reading a movie script to a movie you haven't seen -- easy to get lost, and the dramatic effects aren't easy to connect to.But if you HAVE seen a good performance of \\"Hamlet,\\" then the play will just jump off the page. The plot is a relatively simple one, but it's tangled up in all sorts of moral dilemmas, personal doubts, deteriorating personal relationships, and a creeping undercurrent of darkness. The best part is that Shakespeare leaves you with all sorts of questions that are left up in the air -- is Hamlet crazy or just faking it? Is the ghost really his dad?And, of course, it contains some of the most intense, powerful examples of Shakespeare's work here -- vivid, nasty imagery (\\"In the rank sweat of an enseamed bed/Stew'd in corruption, honeying and making love/Over the nasty sty\\"), some bleak humor (\\"you're a fishmonger\\"), and Hamlet's immortal soliloquies. It's also one of Shakespeare's most quotable plays -- obviously you've got bits like \\"Alas, poor Yorick,\\" \\"to be or not to be\\" and \\"Something is rotten in the state of Denmark,\\" but there are countless other familiar phrases littered through the text.On the page, Hamlet is basically an embittered young man who is torn between his doubts and convictions, but is still determined to fix things (\\"O cursed spite,/That ever I was born to set it right!\\"). A lot of the supporting cast are hard to follow, but there are some brilliant and enduring roles here -- the incestuous queen Gertrude, the subtle menace of Claudius, the windbag Laertes, and Ophelia, whose uncertainties spiral into madness after her ex-boyfriend kills her dad.It's best to get a grip on this classic tragedy by watching an actual performance, but reading \\"Hamlet's\\" text is a vivid experience on its own. Brilliant, complex and intense."},{"Title":"Hamlet (Illustrated Shakespeare Ser.)","review":"This is one of William Shakespeare's greatest works. The tragedy features ghosts, murder, betrayal. . . . The arc of the play moves from Hamlet's father's ghost appearing to him and speaking of Hamlet's uncle (Claudius) murdering him and taking Hamlet's mother as his queen--a scandalously short time after the murder took place. Talk of vengeance from the ghost. . . . Thus begins the plot line.Hamlet, though, is perhaps too reflective a person and does not take immediate action. Even feigning something like madness (As Polonius observes: \\"Though this be madness, yet there is method in't\\"). The play is filled with lines like that, lines that people use (normally a variation on the original) without knowing that they came from this play. Polonius also mentioned that \\"Brevity is the soul of wit\\" (rather ironic since he was launched into a long speech). His daughter, Ophelia, is enamored of Hamlet; after her father's death, unwittingly killed by Hamlet himself, she goes mad and drowns. A lot of people die in this tragedy!In the context of indecision, Hamlet gives his great soliloquy, beginning with \\"To be or not to be.\\"\\"To be, or not to be: that is the question:Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to sufferThe slings and arrows of outrageous fortune,Or to take arms against a sea of troubles,And by opposing end them? To die: to sleep;No more; and by a sleep to say we endThe heart-ache and the thousand natural shocksThat flesh is heir to, 'tis a consummationDevoutly to be wish'd. To die, to sleep;To sleep: perchance to dream: ay, there's the rub;For in that sleep of death what dreams may comeWhen we have shuffled off this mortal coil,Must give us pause: there's the respectThat makes calamity of so long life. . . .\\"The effort by Hamlet's uncle, Claudius, to dispatch Hamlet provides some impetus for the Prince to make up his mind. A lengthy set of deaths ensues at the close of the tragedy.There are many themes at play in this work. Hamlet's indecision based on his uncertainty about the truth of the ghost's statements, his musings on death and how he might/should die. He is a rather mysterious character and the viewer of the play itself can never be certain what he is thinking. This ambiguity itself lends power to Shakespeare's tragedy.One of the great plays. . . ."},{"Title":"Hamlet (Illustrated Shakespeare Ser.)","review":"Let me begin by saying that Hamlet is truly an amazing play. By far, my favorite drama, Shakespearian or otherwise. Telling the story of a man searching for the light amid mind-boggling darkness, Hamlet reveals more about the conflicts people face in their own lifetimes than any other piece of literature.This edition includes an introduction about the life of Shakespeare, including a completed works list, and even some words of his own creation. After the unabridged play, several very noteworthy critical reviews reveal more and more about Hamlet than any other comparable binding.

I loved the play because of the variety of lessons you can get from the play. For me, Hamlet proves that nurture has as much to do with perception as nature. Hamlet&#8217;s adaptation, and the subsequent change in something as fundamental as perception, makes us realize the importance of being conscious of our actions. Acting how one wants to be could not only let one be true to one&#8217;s desires, but could influence how one sees the world, and then subsequently acts. This is an important reminder for a society filled with people acting ruthlessly now in hopes for a better future for themselves: a strategy that Hamlet demonstrates doesn&#8217;t work."},{"Title":"Hamlet (Illustrated Shakespeare Ser.)","review":"Great for when you need to cart around a bunch of Shakespeare and don't want a huge book/ many books.

How can a book with lines like, &quot;Imperious Caesar, dead and turned to clay, might stop a hole to keep the wind away,&quot; not be seen as humorous. It is almost lightly, though somewhat bitterly, mocking the futile achivements of human kind.

Oddly, I think the humour gives Hamlet more depth and meaning."},{"Title":"Hamlet (Illustrated Shakespeare Ser.)","review":"Simply the best play ever written and a glorious testament to the power of the human language.

It wasn't easy to read, but I'm very proud that I followed through with my decision. Hamlet is about personal conflict and it has sex, murders, and incest. Hamlet is a prince of Denmark who returned from his studies to attend his father's funeral. After only the short time, his mother remarry with Hamlet's Uncle Claudius. Hamlet thought something was rotten in Denmark. Hamlet discovered that Claudius had a hand in his father's murder. This is where Hamlet's conflict lies which is \\"To be or not to be, that is the question.\\" Should he revenge his father's death or should he listened to his mother and forget his father's death and get on with a normal life and eventually, it ends with tragedy, characters either being murdered or committing suicide. I think Hamlet is trying to show us that sometimes it is difficult to make decisions. There are sometimes conflicts between what we think and what we feel."},{"Title":"Hamlet (Illustrated Shakespeare Ser.)","review":"If there was any one novel or play which defines Shakespeare as the greatest writer in the English language, that play would be Hamlet. In it, Shakespeare combines comedy, tragedy, drama and philosophy all with stunning and unimaginable grace.

Besides Shakespeare's usual flare for the English language, Hamlet's quick wit, philosophical and artful masterpieces of soliloque, and a wonderfully tragic plot make Hamlet an engaging read (or viewing, I've done both). The characters arouse all the sympathy, hatred, and love they were intended to. I read this play in a matter of days because I couldn't put it down. If you don't have time to read this play, or comprehending the language is a trial PLEASE see it somewhere. Watching the actors and listening to their voice inflections will help a lot, I promise."},{"Title":"Hamlet (Illustrated Shakespeare Ser.)","review":"With this generation's youth it is difficult to find many students interested in Shakespeare. Shakespeare Made Easy is the key. The general stories that William Shakespeare put down on paper are truly remarkable and quite fun to read. However, these days there is hardly any interest in deeply analyzing pages and pages of Shakespearian English, especially with his longest play, Hamlet.With the original text on one page and a modern translation on the opposing page this version of Hamlet can be an insightful read as well as a pleasure read. By having the option of both translations the reader will be fully immersed in the story, rather than the text, and come out on the other end singing the praises of Shakespeare and Hamlet. This is a breakthrough version of Hamlet and should be the premier choice of teachers and students alike. Nothing, except perhaps the movie, will excite the adolescent world to Shakespeare more than this version of Hamlet."},{"Title":"Hamlet (Illustrated Shakespeare Ser.)","review":"The reading of Hamlet and Lear in high- school helped me understand my father. Or rather my father helped me understand them. All the hesitation and delay and indecision, all the great outpourings of feeling in soliloquy , all the great sense of life as tormenting and impossible and yet somehow great and sublime, all this echoed and reflected from my own childhood family life world back and forth to Hamlet. The great language reaching out to metaphor no ordinary mind could find. This too.Of the plot and the story of the father murdered and the son who needed to revenge and delayed and the mother who betrayed and enticed, this was far far from me. More I loved the language the great speeches even when we were taught that they were ironic and self- condemning (To thine own self be true as triteness not truth) I loved and memorized much of Hamlet's solitary crying , \\" Oh that this too too solid flesh would melt thaw and resolve itself into a dew\\" and felt in the pain of Hamlet my father 's pain and poetry. I know for most this is the greatest play ever played, and I know too how down the generations critics have given their own long theories explaining why Hamlet delayed and what the ultimate meaning of the play is. But what each of us is given in his own way is another story. And if I have here said a few private words it certainly will not harm or change very much that vast sea of readings which have accumulated around this work, and which will grow still larger and larger in time. One of the great works unquestionably, one mankind will go on reading and rereading as long as mankind keeps reading. And for me a hint that my father's life and suffering somehow related to a higher world called Literature where it might have its echo, and who knows one day truly find its meaningful expression."},{"Title":"Hamlet (Illustrated Shakespeare Ser.)","review":"This 2-star rating is based not on the content of the original, which is quite good, but on the absurd &quot;modernisation&quot;.

Since I was young, probably middle school aged, I have loved Shakespeare. Whenever there is a chance to attend a production, I'm the first one signing up. In fact, the boys and I saw Macbeth on stage last spring and will be going to King Lear in a week. Shakespeare was one of the key reasons I decided to major in English in college.That being said, I was skeptical of an abriged version. Shakespeare in sixty minutes sounds like a good idea, especially when you want to expose young minds to the bard without weighing them down with language and lengthy disposition, but, could it be done right?Cass Foster, Professor Emeritus of Theatre, doesn't retell Shakespeare, but, rather, keeps the language and tone of the play intact while condensing some of the lengthier scenes and removing those that are extraneous to the key story. I know Hamlet well. Reading this copy, not a single key event was missed keeping the story and its intriguing tale intact. While some of the excitment of the fighting has been removed, students might find the original rhetoric laborious. Keeping the outcome unchanged makes sure none of the final suspense is lost.I did appreciate that Foster uses footnotes at the end of each page to help explain trickier wordings that may be lost on the young reader. One example - Hamelt states, \\"O, old friend, thy face is valenced since I last saw thee.\\" Valenced is notated and at the bottom of the page is defined as \\"bearded.\\"Additionally, some cues are added to help the instructor use this text as a script for the play. It may not be suitable for school-wide production; however, the comments are helpful if the play were to be enacted in a class or co-op to help the students identify with the characters and really get into the spirit of Shakespeare.There are five additional plays in the Sixty-minute Shakespeare series: Midsummer Night's Dream, Macbeth, Much Ado About Nothing, Romeo and Juliet and Twelfth Night. Personally, I would love to own and read them all. I'm already thinking of how I want to incorporate more Shakespeare into our high school literature.Whether you love Shakespeare and want to introduce it to your children, or you find Shakespeare difficult and would like a simplified option for enjoying these acclaimed stories, I have to say I would readily recommend these books.*** I received this book free via MamaBuzz Media for my honest review..."},{"Title":"Hamlet (Illustrated Shakespeare Ser.)","review":"\\"Hamlet\\" doesn't need any introduction -- the tortured Dane, the ghost, meditations on suicide and a climax full of death.

Icluding deep philosophical meanings in the sililoquis, death, and aslo suspence. The play is well written in terms of charictor development. The only charictor that is not needed is Fortenbras.Fortinbras is not a key player because he has no important role in the play. The only thing he is there for is to be there in the end to show all of the dead bodies. There is suspence in the play whene the main charictors try to figure out who someone died. More suspence is in the play when Hamlet puts on his own play to expose the killer of his father. There are deep philosophial meanings in the sililoquis said by Hamlet. &quot;To be or not to be,&quot; poeple say that he is questioning life and death. He is not; there is a deeper meaning to it. He is questioning mans essence and not his own life. If he were questioning his own life the play whould have no meaning.The play is good in the sence of deep meanings.

It showed what greed and the driving force of vengence does to people. Hamlet became mad with vengence and almost killed everyone around him with it. It showed how a greedy person works.

But I am VERY annoyed at some of things I've heard that belittle Shakespeare and his works, so allow me to elaborate.Yes, we all realize that it is difficult to read, but if you dont like it, dont read it!

If you are one of these people, you'd best turn around, cuz the new Fox lineup is just starting!

What I took away this go-round was how much happens off stage; the murder Hamlet's father, the marriage of Gertrude and Claudius, the love story between Hamlet and Ophelia. I think this give the play great ambiguity and tension which deepens and enriches the experience of watching the play.The Arden edition: the footnotes were often unhelpful. Frequently the notes would concern the derivation of a word or meaning when I what I was looking for was some explanation of the meaning the sentence. Perhaps I am expected to have more knowledge of the play to get value from the notes. I also found several of the introductory essays concerning versions, sources, publication too academic to hold my interest.

Theycould all put on HAMLET and be successful.'

Praised by Shakespeare'scontemporaries for its power to 'please all' [not inthe modern era, 21st century Ameriky on the verge ofsliding into either &quot;A Clockwork Orange&quot; or &quot;Bladerunner&quot;barbarism and mediocre diffusion...] as well as to'please the wiser sort,' it provided his companywith an immediate and continuing success.-- Michael Neill.

When I received it, I was surprised to see highlighting on every page and illegible handwritten notes in nearly every empty space."},{"Title":"Hamlet (Illustrated Shakespeare Ser.)","review":"Admittedly, there is really nothing I can say about Shakespeare's brilliant The Tragedy of Hamlet that has not been said before. The fact that this tragedy is so praiseworthy does not mean it should no longer be praised, though. So many of us had to read Hamlet in school, but there is something to be said and much to be gained by reading it on one's own again for pure pleasure. The story is a compelling one, the characters are sharply presented and unforgettable, and the play represents human tragedy in the fullest sense of the word. No matter how well you know the story, you as a reader are totally captivated by the human drama of the ill-fated prince of Denmark. The Bard's characters are incredibly human, be they good or evil, powerful or fragile. One can delight in the downfall of evil men and lament the fate of their innocent victims. The language is beautiful but difficult, of course. I often found myself rereading lines or entire passages to try and get a better sense of their meaning, and even then some vagaries of the language escaped me. The story itself, though, is vividly revealed through the Bard's poetic words, and even the most insensible lines roll off the tongue beautifully. I was most amazed by all of the famous lines and quotations found in this one drama; pop culture itself almost demands of you some knowledge of Hamlet. If \\"Alas, poor Yorick! I knew him, Horatio\\" or \\"Something is rotten in the state of Denmark\\" mean nothing to you, you would do well to brush up on your Hamlet. If you draw a blank at the words \\"To be or not to be,\\" you might want to check your pulse to see if you still have one.I will not attempt any literary criticism here because libraries are already overflowing with books on the subject. The madness of Hamlet is, I suppose, debatable; certainly, his madness is feigned early on, and I have much admiration for his manner of calling forth the guilty conscience of those who wronged his father through his supposed ravings, but one must particularly question his dealings with the lovely and innocent Ophelia. Madness, rage, murder, incest (of a sort), graveyards, sword fighting, poison, love, betrayal--this play has all of these things and more, yet it is the great humanity of Prince Hamlet himself which makes this tragedy foremost among all of the Great Bard's dramas. Good and evil exist in each soul; evil does not always lose, and good does not always win. Shakespeare understood this, and that is why this tragedy will always serve as a literary mirror in which careful readers can peer into the depths of their own souls."},{"Title":"Hamlet (Illustrated Shakespeare Ser.)","review":"I found this book very helpful.

There are even Marxist, feminist, and psychoanalitical interpretations of it. That fact, alone, says much about the depth and width of &quot;Hamlet&quot;. In this immortal tragedy, the Danish Prince Hamlet is extremely sad and suspicious about the death of his father, the King. His mother has remarried to the King's Brother, Claudius. Hamlet's suspicions are confirmed by the ghost of his father, in an unforgettable scene: yes, Claudius is the murderer of his brother. Hamlet goes mad with pain and fury, and starts to plot his revenge. Its outcome will prove fatal for many people.This peak of drama is an exploration into the human soul, emphasizing emotions such as remorse, rancour, the need for revenge, and folly. Long before existentialism, Hamlet asks for the meaning of existence: what it is and why existence exists.The dramatic tension is perfectly crafted and sustained; Shakespeare's sentences are also perfect and magnificent; the scenes eternal: Hamlet's encounter with the ghost of his father; his monologue on &quot;to be or not to be&quot;; Ophelia's death and burial; the theatrical representaiton of Claudius's sin; the climax at the duel. Hamlet is one of those works of art which have done the magic of becoming part of the popular, &quot;subconscious&quot; culture, much as &quot;Don Quixote&quot;, the &quot;Divine Comedy&quot; or the classic Greek tragedies.

It also gave way to the end of the play and the deaths of all the main characters.The last Act was very suspensful and dramatic. The dual scene is a very good example of Shakespear's ability to conjur a tragedy and make it plausable. The end was good because every one died and it left no loose ends for one to wander about because they were all DEAD.

Many of phrases from Hamlet now challenge Bible for those popular quotes that no one remembers where they came from.

A madness has fallen on Hamlet. Thus the deceased king's apparition is clearly seen and heard. For a time members of the family and others detect Hamlet's queer demeanor. As time passes, it is seen more frequently. It sounds as though he spent much of his salad days with the jester. A reader is not as easily mousetrapped as other readers about Hamlet's motives.

Not only are the charecters dynamic, but the reader will be able to feel the overwhelming emotions flowing throughout the play. The shakespearen language stimulates the mind along with the body. Through Shakespeare's brilliance in the arts, he is able to write a play that can take place in a variety of settings and times. An example of this would be Zefferelli film compared to Bronnach's interpretation of the play. They both illustrate the time and motivation that Shakespeare intended, yet they take place in a different setting. Ophelia, Shakespeare's most dynamic character, overwhelmes the readers with a bluster of feelings. They inlude happiness, depression, true love and many others.

It was the first Shakespeare play I ever read and I liked it. If you haven't read the play, don't read any thing in these: {la la la la la}. Hamlet is very good for quite a few reasons and here they are.The characters, especially Hamlet are very witty. There are several jokes that you don't have to konw anything about Shakespeare's time to enjoy. My personall favorite is the one about Lady Fortune.The characters are very realistic. My favorite is Horatio and Hamlet. They are both smart and witty. During that play, Hamlet goes under a tranformation. He was once a great man, a scholar, war hero, a lover. When the play begins, he has sunk into a deppression {because of his father's death and mother's marraige.}But by the end of the play, he is the man he once was, and it's good to see him back.There is a lot of philosophical talk in this play. More so than in any other Shakespeare plya, in fact. Most of the slioquays are about suicide and death, but they're still good.The way the plaot develops is very good. Most stories take time to build up the story, Hamlet throws you right into mystery and intrigue in the first page or so. In most stories, the book leasds up to the problems, the tension starts to rise to the climax, the climax happens, and then it ends. like a hill.Hamlet works like a mountain that ends at the peak. Know what I mean? The whole play builds up to an amazing climax and then ends. The further the play goes, the better it gets. It's like a wheel. It just keeps going out of control and then blows into a million pieces.WARNING: Most of the words in the book are managable. However, as the play carries on, there are harder words.

Sure, he says a lot of fine things about him, but doesn't this raise a red flag? Isn't he maybe idealizing his pa? Hamlet, after all, is the only person who sings the king's praises. Some evidence in the play suggests that Hamlet Sr may not have been all his son cut him out to be. For example, if the ex-king was such a wise leader, then why did he have such a fool as Polonius for a counselor? And if he was such a good husband, then why did his loving wife fly so quickly into the arms of another man? And what about those sins that he mentions himself, the ones he's paying the price for by wondering the face of the earth in the night. Was Hamlet Sr really a great and virtuous man? And if he wasn't, then is it possible Hamlet Jr is secretly scornful of his dad? And is that perhaps the reason he doesn't take his revenge right away?Just food for thought. Something else that bothered me about the play are Rosencrantz and Guildenstern. These two guys are supposed to be two close friends of Hamlet. Yet they're both dim-wits and total mercenaries. Just the opposite of what Hamlet is. What could Hamlet ever have seen in these two guys? It doesn't make sense. Something else that belies belief is Polonius. How is it that the king's chief counselor cannot suspect that Claudius had a hand in the king's death? This kind of thing was not unknown is those times and Polonius must have known the character of Claudius, not to mention his dalliances with the queen. How can someone who is so close to the crown not suspect something? His innocence is hard to believe."},{"Title":"Hamlet (Illustrated Shakespeare Ser.)","review":"I'll use one line to show the problem with this text. Many other lines have a similar problem. Shakespeare has:\\"Speak the speech, I pray you, as I pronounced it to you,trippingly on the tongue.\\"'No Fear' has:\\"Perform the speech just as I taught you, musically and smoothly.\\"Do you really have to translate \\"Speak the speech\\" as \\"Perform the speech\\"? If you can't understand \\"Speak the speech\\" then you need more help than any book can give (e.g., a very good teacher!)Also, Shakespeare is being more exact than \\"no fear\\" here. \\"Perform\\" is too vague. Shakespeare is talking precisely about speech and pronunciation. Note how 'no fear' translates 'as I pronounced it to you' as 'as I taught you', again losing Shakespeare's stress on vocalisation, and again wrongly translating something that should be left as obvious.'Musically and smoothly' is an even graver error. Trippingly is used in a sense that might trip up students here, so they certainly need help. But all 'no fear' does is confuse them. Does trippingly literally mean musically and smoothly? No it doesn't. If you look 'trip' up in a good concise dictionary you are given the main literal meaning that Shakespeare is using as a metaphor. That is: 'walk or dance with quick light steps'(concise OED).Then again, although this is the main meaning, Hamlet might be joking with the player. That is, using both (or all 10!) meanings of 'trip' in a multiple metaphor. But I digress, one meaning will do for the first run through in a 'non-honours' class.But 'no fear' will do for no one.Shakespeare is hard. Students need help. But not this kind of help.Check out the \\"Oxford School Shakespeare\\" series to see a better approach. If you like a more \\"adult\\", and more lightly annotated, text then try the RSC Shakespeare version edited by Jonathan Bate. If you want heavyweight commentary then Arden might be best (though Oxford UP and Cambridge UP also publish detailed versions worth looking at.)I gave an extra star for the attempt to make Shakespeare a smoother read for the general reader and school child.

Rendering Shakespeare into prosaic, colloquial American English not only explains what Shakespeare was saying, but reveals how much better he said it!

In the original, she says, \\"This is the very coinage of your brain.\\" That's vivid.Rosencrantz tells Hamlet in modern lingo, \\"You're not doing yourself any good by refusing to tell your friends what's bothering you.\\" Sounds like a reprimand. The original line sounds like a threat: \\"You do surely bar the door upon your own liberty if you deny your griefs to your friend.\\"Hamlet remembers his mother's relationship with his father: \\"She would hang on to him, and the more she was with him the more she wanted to be with him; she couldn't get enough of him.\\" Sounds good, but the original sounds disturbing: \\"Why, she would hang on him / As if increase of appetitite had grown / By what it fed on . . .\\" Change the word \\"she\\" to \\"it\\" and you have the image of a parasite.

Unfortunately for Shakespeare and his creations, the English language has changed over the past four hundred years, and people have gotten out of the habit of reading and understanding poetry. This is where Alan Durband's edition of &quot;Hamlet&quot; in the Barron's Books &quot;Shakespeare Made Easy&quot; series comes to the rescue of the inexperienced reader. Its modern &quot;translation&quot; of Shakespeare's text is readable and clear, making this masterpiece approachable for those who find Elizabethan English too thorny. Having watched college freshmen struggle with &quot;Hamlet&quot; for some twelve years, and having discovered the Barron's edition during the summer, I strongly recommended the book this past fall as a supplement to the assigned literature anthology. About half the students in my Freshman Comp classes bought the book, either from the university book store or from amazon.com. (Amazon's price was better.) To my great pleasure, I found that more students than at any time before were asking questions in class, answering my own questions with knowledge and insight, and even debating points of interpretation among themselves. It was the most fun I have ever had teaching &quot;Hamlet,&quot; outside of a Shakespeare course. So now my syllabus suggests this book as an important supplement, and now I look forward to teaching &quot;Hamlet&quot; with confidence that many of the students will be able to experience the enthusiasm for literature that educators so dearly love to communicate.

Whereas most annotated texts of Shakespeare place annotations on the other side of the page, here they are at the bottom. Considering your eyes spend much more time across the lines and down the page, instead of the small amount of time your eyes take jumping to another page, this annotation makes for a very fluid and efficient way of reading. I think this is the best annotation I've ever seen of Shakespeare. The quality isn't just present in form, however: the substitutions and explanations are always accurate and almost never redundant (to the average reader, not the average professor =]).The introduction by Burton Raffel and the concluding essay by the legendary Harold Bloom only add to the benefits the book presents, and help to understand the book from a wider perspective once your ideas and feelings reconcile with theirs.All in all, a great product for anyone who loves Shakespeare, literature, or expanding their minds!"},{"Title":"Hamlet (Illustrated Shakespeare Ser.)","review":"Man, I wish I would've had this book 25 years ago!I've always been interested in Shakespeare but it's been hard introducing anyone else I know to the greatness of his plays: the language is just too hard for most people to follow.Thankfully, the No Fear Shakespeare books have come along, and I've been buying them for myself as well as others. It's wonderful to have a side-by-side comparison of the Bard's original lines with a modern translation that makes the play easy to read.I hope the publishers do this with all of Shakespeare's plays!"},{"Title":"Hamlet (Illustrated Shakespeare Ser.)","review":"I hated Shakespeare in high school, partly because I could only understand about one word out of every three. Recently -- that is, thirty years post-high-school -- I forced myself to read it again, in the Signet edition, and was dumbfounded at how different my response was. All the difficult terms were explained at the bottom of each page in footnotes. I learned the difference between the two terms of address, \\"Sir\\" and \\"Sirrah,\\" and a lot of other things as well. As an adolescent I asked myself why the hero didn't just kill Claudius right of the bat and have done with it. The reason, it seemed to me, is that there wouldn't have been any play. Hamlet refuses to use his sword on his uncle for the same reason the Indians don't shoot the horses when they're chasing the stagecoach. What a change time has wrought. I guess when you're a kid you don't know the meaning of the term \\"moral doubt\\" because so many things seem black and white. It takes a certain degree of maturation to realize that murdering a king because some ghost told you to is a bit morally -- well, fuzzy. For instance, can you be absolutely certain that you're doing it to avenge your father instead of being jealous about your mother's affections? Questions like that, which a thoughtful adult might ask himself, are enough to give anyone pause. It's a fascinating tragedy. Probably the best film about it is still Olivier's from 1947 or 1948, which won an Academy Award if that still means anything. The signet edition is extremely helpful too in providing brief critical essays that review the play from differing perspectives, the Freudian, the feminist, and so on."},{"Title":"Hamlet (Illustrated Shakespeare Ser.)","review":"This is truly a No Fear way to understand Shakespeare. There is a modern day interpretation writing on one side of the book and the Shakespeare way on the other. It was a lifesaver!"},{"Title":"Hamlet (Illustrated Shakespeare Ser.)","review":"Ah, yes. Hailed by many as Shakespeare's Magnum Opus (is that right?), this is certainly one of his most significant dramatic works. Hamlet is an atmosperic story of internalization - of feelings (guilt, love, hatred), of people, thoughts, and actions. Marked by indecision and a strong sense of self-pity and self-consciousness, Hamlet makes the slow transition from fear to determination in his quest to avenge his father's death. Oedipal complex, supernatural powers, royal incest, revenge - these are all explored in the play. Several famous questions are posed and thoughts explored - of existence, suicide, meaning, value. Hamlet is just packed with philosophy, psychology, and humanity. A must-read in which you will find many of the most famous soliloquies in all of Shakespeare. Thrown in Yorick's skull, poor Ophelia, good Horatio, Rosencrantz and Guildenstern, you've got yourself one awesome play."},{"Title":"Hamlet (Illustrated Shakespeare Ser.)","review":"If you could read only one thing in your lifetime Hamlet should be that one thing. It is Shakespeare's best work by far, and within its pages is more meaning than you could find within the pages of an entire library full of books, or plays as the case may be. A mere review, a couple words, cannot do Hamlet justice. At times I realize that the language of Shakespeare can be difficult that is why I recommend the Folger version because it helps to make the images expressed by Shakespeare's characters clear to the reader, and allows them to get their own deep personal meaning from Hamlet, Shakespeare's greatest work, with out being bogged down in trying to decipher and interpret his antiquarian English. Don't just listen to what I say, or read what I write, read the play on your own outside the cumbersome restraints of a classroom and see for yourself what I mean."},{"Title":"Hamlet (Illustrated Shakespeare Ser.)","review":"I cannot more highly recommend this particular book, No Fear Shakespeare's Hamlet.I am approaching 50 years old and my only real experience trying to read Shakespeare was in high school where we were assigned roles in class and made to read, without comprehension, Romeo and Juliet and Julius Cesar. In the interim, I tried watching a few plays and dragged my kids to see the play Taming of the Shrew, which they hated because they couldn't understand the language nor the plot. Rather than becoming a Shakespeare hater, I've always felt inadequate and dumb for this huge hole in my education.My current inspiration to try Shakespeare again was my desire to try and help my high school aged son become more educated and cultured than I have been.I tried first with the Folger annotated editions of Shakespeare. They look excellent and define the unfamiliar words, but I still could not make sense of a substantial portion of the dialogue. I guess maybe I'm just dumb, I don't know.Anyway, I saw good reviews about this No Fear series, and I ordered several. So far I have read the modern English translations of Hamlet, Macbeth, Othello, King Lear, and The Tempest. While I feel a bit like I'm 'cheating', I actually have really enjoyed all the plays and at least now I know the plots and the characters and even some of the more subtle themes. I can't answer the complaints that the translations don't adequately translate Shakespeare's meanings. There are a few side notes that point out double meanings and things like that, though there are not extensive footnotes or sidenotes.To answer those who rate these books one or two stars, my answer is that they are at least a door into the world of Shakespeare for those of us unable to navigate the originals on our own. And they only take a couple of hours to read. It's not like this is a lifetime commitment or anything. The book only costs five bucks, so why not invest a couple of hours and read it? And, for me, I liked the plays so much that I AM now going to dig out the Folger editions and read the originals, with the No Fear books available in case I get in trouble. These modalities of trying to appreciate Shakespeare are not mutually exclusive.Well, hopefully that's helpful to someone. I wanted to write this so that people would know that these books are not just for lazy students hoping to avoid reading the originals or somehow 'cheat' in their English classes. I'm not a Shakespeare scholar or teacher and never will be, just an ordinary guy, but for me, these books were the window of opportunity that I had been searching for. Two thumbs up, most definitely."},{"Title":"Hamlet (Illustrated Shakespeare Ser.)","review":"There they lay, dead on the page, all the incomprehensible words of Shakespeare. I saw them all through school, starting with Macbeth in sixth grade. Then years later a girlfriend recorded on cassette for me the Hamlet of Paul Scofield and I played it night after night through the next two years as I commuted to school. Driving in the dead middle of the night through the pine forests of south Alabama the world I knew vanished, and all that remained was the world of Hamlet-- the prince maddened by grief, the treacherous uncle, the uncomprehending Gertrude, innocent Ophelia, her passionate brother and foolish father, faithful Horatio, the players and all the rest-- more alive to me than my own life.To know Hamlet you cannot read it, you must hear it, whether on stage or elsewhere. And the more you hear it the more its lines come back to you, whether in earnest or in whimsy-- &quot;safely stowed&quot;, &quot;meet it is I set it down, that one may smile and smile, and be a villain&quot;, &quot;thus conscience doth make cowards of us all, and thus the native hue of resolution is sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought&quot;, &quot;alas, poor Yorick. I knew him Horatio. A fellow of infinite jest.&quot; And so many more. If there is any hope that you will fall in love with language, then you will fall for Hamlet.There is even some sense that you will never have completely spoken English until you have said the lines of Hamlet.Paul Scofield has never been replaced in my affections by another Hamlet.

This is a perfect solution. On the facing page is the modern translation; on the opposite page, the original text (for the more courageous reader). The modern text is not too simple, but easy enough to grasp. Murders, revenge, love, ghosts, poison, swordfights, spying, suicide, and (yes) humor--alas, if only more people knew what they were missing! (P.S. The Ken Branagh movie is absolutely heavenly--for those willing to sit through four hours, it's an absolute treat!)"},{"Title":"Hamlet (Illustrated Shakespeare Ser.)","review":"Hamlet is a classic in every possible way; he is in all of us, and will never die. Although some claim this play to be flawed, that is the beauty of it--it is not perfect, as Hamlet certainly is not.

The only thing that would be more helpful would be a &quot;real life&quot; scholar. Congratulations to this publisher for making Shakespere more understandable."},{"Title":"Hamlet (Illustrated Shakespeare Ser.)","review":"Hamlet is, by far, the most complex of Shakespeare's many plays. Many of the themes covered are love vs hate, action vs non-action, revenge, and jealousy. Hamlet discovers that \\"something is rotten in the state of Denmark\\" when he encounters the ghost of his father, the King, who has recently been killed in battle. From here, Hamlet goes on a search for the discovery of what happened to his father. However, Hamlet not only uncovers secrets of the past, but also the depths of his own being.The Folger Edition of Hamlet is a great edition to buy, especially for those who are studying this play in high school or college, because it is relatively cheap in price and is very \\"reader-friendly\\" with side notes and footnotes that accompany each page of each scene. So, even if you aren't a Shakespeare lover or if Shakespeare is just a little intimidating (we all know how this feels), this version at least allows you to get the gist of what is going on. Also, there are summaries of each scene within each act, to let you know in layman's terms what is taking place. I highly recommend this edition."},{"Title":"Hamlet (Illustrated Shakespeare Ser.)","review":"I am writing this review not so much as in reference to any one particular title, rather to the Folger Library editions of Shakepeare.

It is often hard for some to understand the complexities of Shakeperean work, and I have seen the way Folger's organizes their books help readers to understand them better. Any book you order from this company will be enlightening and helpful, providing you with a more enjoyable exposure the Shakespeare's great works."},{"Title":"Hamlet (Illustrated Shakespeare Ser.)","review":"It would serve no useful purpose to write a review of Hamlet.

Like fine wine it gets better, much better, with age."},{"Title":"Hamlet (Illustrated Shakespeare Ser.)","review":"Hamlet is considered, by many scholars, the pinnacle of Shakespeare's dramas. If you haven't read it yet this this Case Studies in Contemporary Criticism edition would be a great place to begin.The text notes that are included with the play are very helpful to understand some of the more difficult language nuances that are inevitable with any Shakespeare. The structure is well laid out and conclusive. It complements the complexity of Hamlet very well.Of course Hamlet is one of the great paradoxes and mysteries every written. The search of finding yourself and what it is that fuels the human spirit. Hamlet can be a very confusing play because of the depth of substance. However, the critical essays that suppliment the reading make it very accessable.Each of the critical essays are of different schools of literary criticism: Feminist Criticism, psychoanalytic criticism, post-structuralist (deconstuctionist) criticism, Marxist critism, and finally a New Historicist criticism. Before each critism there is clearly written introduction to explain the motives and histories of that type of criticism.This edition of Hamlet will not only introduce the reader to more Shakespeare, but also explain the play and help to familiarize the reader with literary criticism too. It is a beautiful volume that cannot be more recommended if you are wanting to buy a copy Hamlet."},{"Title":"Hamlet (Illustrated Shakespeare Ser.)","review":"This cover caught my eye, with its snazzy black and red thing. Plus, when I paged through it, I wasn't disappointed. Clear text, useful notes (footnotes, not endnotes), and an informative introduction and following essay. I'm only an amateur, but I would recommend this edition over any of the others I've seen."},{"Title":"Hamlet (Illustrated Shakespeare Ser.)","review":"Hamlet is one of Shakespheare's more complex plays, which doesn't exactly make it more enjoyable, although I recommend reading it for its famous \\"to be or not to be\\" speech. After reading a few of the bard's plays, his patterns, conceits, and crutches begin to emerge. Often he has characters comtemplating suicide or mortality like Hamlet does in the play; he usually has a dead body pile-up at the end of the play; he often favors poison as as a means to kill his characters off; there is usually a bit of court intrigue or underhanded dealing which leads to disaster, and he likes to have characters go mad.Hamlet feigns madness in this play and after reading it four times, I still don't know why he does this. As far as I can tell, he doesn't really say. If this is a strategic move, it is a bad one, because it only makes his uncle King Claudius, who has killed Hamlet's father and married his mother, more suspicious that Hamlet knows of his committing this \\"murder most foul\\" and is upset by it. There are a lot of madness scenes in the play in which different characters try to figure out why Hamlet is upset--Is it because of his girlfriend Ophelia's feigned rejection of him? Or is it the death of his father and quick marraige of his mother to his uncle? Or does he know something about the murder of his father? I thought there were too many scenes like this which made the play overly long. Since there was no explanation for Hamlet's madness, the whole conceit of having him feign madness left me confused.I also thought that the characters weren't very appealing in this play. Most of the time the play is focused on Hamlet and his indecisiveness about killing off King Claudius because of his lack of courage, even though he was a war hero. Much of Hamlet's brooding over the matter isn't particularly interesting and tends to slow the play down to a standstill. I suppose he was afraid of being accused of treason since Hamlet only knows about the murder of his father by way of his father's ghost--he has no evidence. Finally near the end, Claudius plots against Hamlet's life, which backfires and Hamlet gets his revenge even as he is dying.Probably the most difficult part of the play is the middle in which Hamlet puts on a play that is very much like the reality of King Claudius killing off Hamlet's father. This is done to see whether Claudius looks or acts guilty during the play. It seems Hamlet does not totally trust his father's ghost's revelation that his father has been killed and he needs further confimation. This middle part refers the Aenied in which Pyrrhus hesitates to kill Priam, just like Hamlet hesitates to kill Claudius-get it? I had to read this passage several times to learn its significance. This middle part also contains a lot of in-jokes about the theatre business at the time which seemed self-indulgent to me.There is also another confusing part of the play in which references to battles and a coming war are made at the beginning and a warring noble named Fortinbras shows up near the end to ascend the throne as king after Hamlet dies. I don't think these scenes were necessary.Shakespheare writes often in a high poetic style that I'm generally biased against--to me it comes off as stilted when compared to having characters speak in a more normal conversational manner. --Hey, but thank Providence for modern language translation of Shakespheare; I don't think I could have made it on my own without it. It's the best thing since guitar tab, bicycle training wheels, and pocket calculators! I suppose there will be those who say that you've got to read everything in the original language to really understand the text, but until I thoroughly bone up on Greek, Latin, Arabic, Old and Middle English, Russian and French, modern English is good enough for me.Here ends my rather cheeky review of the Bard's Hamlet. I hope I'm not haunted by his ghost just for explaining why I didn't like the play that much."},{"Title":"Hamlet (Illustrated Shakespeare Ser.)","review":"This Kindle preview is lacking because it doesn't include a sample of Shakespeare's text.

These editions are always exceptional, but in Kindle format? I can't tell."},{"Title":"Hamlet (Illustrated Shakespeare Ser.)","review":"\\"Hamlet\\" doesn't need any introduction -- the tortured Dane, the ghost, meditations on suicide and a climax full of death. But as well-known as the storyline is, the play itself is what deserves the attention, both for Shakespeare's shadowy plot filled with uncertainty and treachery -- and for his brilliant, immortal writing, which takes on a new dimension when read on the page.Prince Hamlet of Denmark is understandably upset when, only a short time after his father's death, his mother Gertrude marries his uncle Claudius, who is now the new king. Who wouldn't be unhappy? But when Hamlet encounters the tormented ghost of his father (\\"I am thy father's spirit/Doom'd for a certain term to walk the night\\"), he learns that his dad was murdered by his uncle -- but he's plagued by indecision, since he's unsure if the spirit was truly his dad.In response to this vision, Hamlet's behavior becomes more bizarre and erratic -- he dumps his girlfriend Ophelia, arranges a play that mimics real life a little too closely, and generally acts like a loon. But when an argument with his mother ends in tragedy -- and the death of one of Ophelia's loved ones -- Hamlet's fate is sealed as Claudius begins plotting to get rid of him too.Small warning: like all Shakespeare's plays, it's best to read \\"Hamlet\\" after you've seen a good performance, because the entire thing was intended to be acted out. Otherwise, it's like reading a movie script to a movie you haven't seen -- easy to get lost, and the dramatic effects aren't easy to connect to.But if you HAVE seen a good performance of \\"Hamlet,\\" then the play will just jump off the page. The plot is a relatively simple one, but it's tangled up in all sorts of moral dilemmas, personal doubts, deteriorating personal relationships, and a creeping undercurrent of darkness. The best part is that Shakespeare leaves you with all sorts of questions that are left up in the air -- is Hamlet crazy or just faking it? Is the ghost really his dad?And, of course, it contains some of the most intense, powerful examples of Shakespeare's work here -- vivid, nasty imagery (\\"In the rank sweat of an enseamed bed/Stew'd in corruption, honeying and making love/Over the nasty sty\\"), some bleak humor (\\"you're a fishmonger\\"), and Hamlet's immortal soliloquies. It's also one of Shakespeare's most quotable plays -- obviously you've got bits like \\"Alas, poor Yorick,\\" \\"to be or not to be\\" and \\"Something is rotten in the state of Denmark,\\" but there are countless other familiar phrases littered through the text.On the page, Hamlet is basically an embittered young man who is torn between his doubts and convictions, but is still determined to fix things (\\"O cursed spite,/That ever I was born to set it right!\\"). A lot of the supporting cast are hard to follow, but there are some brilliant and enduring roles here -- the incestuous queen Gertrude, the subtle menace of Claudius, the windbag Laertes, and Ophelia, whose uncertainties spiral into madness after her ex-boyfriend kills her dad.It's best to get a grip on this classic tragedy by watching an actual performance, but reading \\"Hamlet's\\" text is a vivid experience on its own. Brilliant, complex and intense."},{"Title":"Hamlet (Illustrated Shakespeare Ser.)","review":"Just so all of you are aware, Shakespeare was not in the practice of writing \\"books\\". He was a playwright, so when you go ahead and say that this \\"book\\" was boring, or hard to follow, make sure you realize that what you have in front of you is dialogue never intended to be read by the public, but only seen on stage. This gives the words more power and more accessibility. If someone reads you the To Be or Not To Be soliloquy aloud, you will understand it far better than a first glance at the text.I would simply state that for many in this day and age, reading Hamlet is a very difficult undertaking. We are not trained in this language, and can hardly tie our attentions down for a 10 line speech, let alone the so-called \\"ranting\\" discourses that take place in this play. This does not make the material worse, it makes us inferior to the text. The play touches on themes that every person must face at some point, love, familial duty, vengeance, politics, friendship and betrayal. It is about Hamlet's struggle to discover what life is, and he discovers this by defining death. It is a brilliant text with some of the best use of language before the publication of Moby Dick in 1851 (another reportedly long and boring work that, in fact, touches on nearly everything man has thought)."},{"Title":"Hamlet (Illustrated Shakespeare Ser.)","review":"I recommend this for anyone who has had trouble with reading Shakespeare line for line in the past.

Or how do you make it possible for those who just don't have the time to do the play full justice, but nevertheless want to have more than just a taste of the bard, to find the time to read it? The answer is the Sixty-Minute Shakespeare series. I've got in my hands their version of Hamlet. There are two important distinctions to this edition. First, it is abridged. The core of the play is left untouched, so the play and its themes are still understandable. Famous soliloquies are also left untouched. The dialogue that fleshes out the minor characters is often abbreviated. Second, the play is rendered in the original language, but uses standard spelling. This is not a modernized version of the play.The Sixty Minute Shakespeare series was also written to give a shorter, easier to produce version of the play for theater groups that wanted to put on a production of a Shakespearean play. Any of this series would be a great production piece for a homeschool theater group. I recommend Hamlet in particular because there are so many resources available to help young actors learn more about their roles, especially the many fine productions of Hamlet on video or DVD. A short section on staging a production gives useful advice for staging and pacing of a production.For those who want to use this edition for a study of Hamlet, I suggest getting a study guide to help with understanding the themes of the play. The notes at the bottom of each page help with understanding some of the unfamiliar words used, but those who are not familiar with Shakespeare will benefit from additional explanations of what is happening in the text."},{"Title":"Hamlet (Illustrated Shakespeare Ser.)","review":"I really didn't enjoy reading this book and I wish that our English teacher wouldn't force my class to read this play.

Though it is acclaimed as the greatest work of drama ever, it is hardly that. People who say such things, have absolutely no credibility. Hamlet's only purpose is to confuse the reader. Any intelligent person can see through his character and realize that he is little more than a feeble mind with a large vocabulary. He is almost the mirror image of Lennie in OF MICE AND MEN, Barnaby Rudge in the Dickens' book of the same name, Benjy in THE SOUND AND THE FURY, or Dogberry in Shakespeare's own MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING. The rest of the main characters (Claudius, Gerturde, Polonius, Ophelia, Laertes, The Ghost, Horatio, Rosencrantz, Guildensern, The Player King, Fortinbras, The First Gravedigger, Barnardo, Reynaldo, and Osric) are ridiculous and annoying caricatures. HAMLET would have been a much better play had these characters been eliminated entirely. Their only contribution lies in the fustian and obfuscating nature of a horrid play. Take my advice: if you want some real entertainment, read Shakespeare's TITUS ANDRONICUS with the great intellect Aaron the Moor, the forerunner of Iago, or THE SPANISH TRAGEDY, containing the sublime Hieronimo, the forerunner of Jane Austen's Anne Elliot.

Hamlet does too much talking and not enough stuff. He needs to shape up and show them who's boss. Maybe Shakespeare fans of Hamlet should take a rest on the book tragedy! Ha ha!"},{"Title":"Hamlet (Illustrated Shakespeare Ser.)","review":"In my opinion all of Shakespeare's writings are long winded, drawn out words with no possibility of ever coming close to being remotly interesting. Hamlet was actually one of the most terribly boring, predictable, useless book ever written. The plot had no vital juices. The charachters were devoid of all emotion and energy. Even more devastating to the book is how it all ended. I actually got to say once Hamlet,Gertrude, and Claudius died I was leaping with joy, it was impossible to contain my excitment. Why? Because it meant that if every one is dead, well, IT IS FINALLY OVER! Finally, this book not only is long, boring, and an embaressment to the whole romantic time period. It has no long lasting effect on anyone. So, what I'm trying to say is that any poor, unfortunate soul that has to read this book will never even understand let alone remember what actually went on through the course of the play."},{"Title":"Hamlet (Illustrated Shakespeare Ser.)","review":"We believe the Hamlet was an interesting book and was a very well organized version of the play. The act where Ophelia becomes insane was the best written part on the whole book. The book was difficult to read, but in the end it was well worth it. Also, the battle part of the book were well written. We did have a little trouble understanding most of the book, but after rereading it a couple times, it made sence. Our favorite characters in the book were Ophelia and Hamlet. They were the most well written parts in the whole play. Our overall opinion on the book was that it was well written and grabbed your attention."},{"Title":"Hamlet (Illustrated Shakespeare Ser.)","review":"What makes Hamlet the most unforgettable of Shakespeare's plays ? I found out the very first time I read it. I was in the fifth grade and it was my first exposure to Shakespeare. After reading it through, I found out. The ghost, the swordfights, revenge, life and death, madness and human frailty. It was the play that made me enjoy Shakespeare. The biggest thing I remember was Hamlet himself- the mystery behind his nature and of course, the swordfight at the end. I recommend everyone to read Hamlet."},{"Title":"Hamlet (Illustrated Shakespeare Ser.)","review":"There's an old joke about a woman who saw Hamlet performed for the first time. &quot;I don't know what anybody sees in that play,&quot; she said, &quot;it's just a bunch of cliches strung together.&quot; Whether Hamlet spawned or merely perpetuated cliches, the play abounds with phrases that have passed into the common speech. From beginning to end, from &quot;There's something rotten in Denmark&quot; to &quot;goodnight sweet prince&quot;, familiar language assaults the ear. The long life of these sayings attests to Shakespeare's powerful plotting and powerful language. Critics have hailed &quot;Hamlet&quot; as Shakespeare's masterpiece, prompting Oscar Wilde to ask &quot;Are the critics mad or merely pretending to be?&quot; It is a complex and paradoxical play, with complex, paradoxical protagonists engaging in complex, illogical behavior. Whether the play is a masterpiece or a disasterpiece, good or bad, is fairly debatable. But good or bad, it commands our attention and entertains us.The Dover Thrift Edition provides quality reading at a rock bottom price.

Much of the book was incomprehendable due to our modern ebonics, but with a little group discussion, the understanding of Hamlet became much clearer. Discussion is a must to fully appreciate the clarity, objectives of the characters, and the upcoming actions of characters. Unless you're an avid reader of Shakespeare's work, the &quot;lingo&quot; is rather difficult. Among the better parts of Hamlet, we enjoyed the scene with Ophelia, where she was handing out flowers to the special people that she felt close to. The symbolism of these flowers was a powerful touch to the scene, which would commonly make any sentimental reader feel touched. Also, the fact that she was so lost in the head contributed to the personal feelings one gets while reading this most potent of scenes. The set-up of characters is most intriguing. Claudius had the modivation of an incestuious lunatic, which created a sense of needed tension between him and Hamlet. The Ghost was a wealthy attribute, in which his short scenes scarcely do the play justice. The Gravedigger added a glimpes into the happy childhood that Hamlet once had.

It contains all of the characteristics needed for a good story Such as murder, revenge, friendship, trust, life, and death. Hamlet also expresses how many different emotions people can have such as love, hate, anger, sadness, and much more. This story shows how important family and love are.In Hamlet a young boy, named Hamlet finds out that his father, the king, was murdered in his sleep and the king's brother wants to marry the queen. Soon after the wedding Hamlet is visited by the ghost of his dad. The ghost tells him that his brother, now the king, is the one that killed him with help from the queen. The ghost asks hamlet to avenge his death by killing the new king. Through most of the play hamlet has to decide what to believe. While he is doing that his girlfriend thinks he is going crazy because he has been acting so strangely. All of the other people in the castle also start to believe that he is insane.Is the middle of the play Hamlet says the most famous lines ever written and most people have probably heard them somewhere. What he says is, \\"To be or not to be, that is the question, for is it nobler in the mind to suffer the slings and arrows of outrageous misfortune of to take arms against the sea of troubles in by opposing in them. To die, to sleep, no more.\\" Hamlet is the longest play ever written but it is very good. Without all of the things in it the story would not be so interesting.I am sure you probably have many questions about the book. To find out how the story ends you will just have to read the book. I am sure you wont be disappointed."},{"Title":"Hamlet (Illustrated Shakespeare Ser.)","review":"Item was delivered during the promised delivery period, no problems at all. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Hamlet (Illustrated Shakespeare Ser.)","review":"\\"Hamlet\\" doesn't need any introduction -- the tortured Dane, the ghost, meditations on suicide and a climax full of death. But as well-known as the storyline is, the play itself is what deserves the attention, both for Shakespeare's shadowy plot filled with uncertainty and treachery -- and for his brilliant, immortal writing, which takes on a new dimension when read on the page.Prince Hamlet of Denmark is understandably upset when, only a short time after his father's death, his mother Gertrude marries his uncle Claudius, who is now the new king. Who wouldn't be unhappy? But when Hamlet encounters the tormented ghost of his father (\\"I am thy father's spirit/Doom'd for a certain term to walk the night\\"), he learns that his dad was murdered by his uncle -- but he's plagued by indecision, since he's unsure if the spirit was truly his dad.In response to this vision, Hamlet's behavior becomes more bizarre and erratic -- he dumps his girlfriend Ophelia, arranges a play that mimics real life a little too closely, and generally acts like a loon. But when an argument with his mother ends in tragedy -- and the death of one of Ophelia's loved ones -- Hamlet's fate is sealed as Claudius begins plotting to get rid of him too.Small warning: like all Shakespeare's plays, it's best to read \\"Hamlet\\" after you've seen a good performance, because the entire thing was intended to be acted out.

Brilliant, complex and intense."},{"Title":"Hamlet (Illustrated Shakespeare Ser.)","review":"\\"Hamlet\\" is for everybody, but not for everybody to enjoy equally. The sad truth is I am one of those who have come, through some application, to feel real appreciation for the play, yet never loved it. The fault is mine and not Shakespeare's, but it is an honest fault worth exploring.The story is pretty straightforward on its face. The king of Denmark has died, and as his son Hamlet fights overwhelming grief, he comes to discover the father died at the hand of his successor, Hamlet's uncle Claudius. As he contemplates the enormity of this knowledge, he wrestles with the fact his friends and court advisors are in league with the uncle. Even Hamlet's mother has compromised her connection with him by marrying Claudius soon after being widowed. Through all this turmoil a cosmic consciousness slowly emerges in young Hamlet.\\"There are more things in Heaven and Earth, Horatio/Than are dreamt of in your philosophy.\\"It's that cosmic consciousness that's at the heart of why \\"Hamlet\\" sticks out so. At the same time, it's a revenge play, and in the end one of Shakespeare's bloodiest this side of \\"Titus Andronicus\\". \\"Hamlet's\\" murky origins are explored in an essay, \\"A Note On The Sources\\", included in the Signet edition. This discusses evidence for an earlier text of the play, before the version we have, possibly written by Thomas Kyd who penned a popular bloodbath called \\"The Spanish Tragedy\\".Our \\"Hamlet\\" has at times a two-headed aspect; if it were a movie, it might have been co-directed by Quentin Tarantino and Ingmar Bergman. A lot of soul-searching dominates the first three acts; monologues abound, some more gripping than others. The story is kicked off very dramatically by a pair of soldiers who have spotted the ghost of Hamlet's father, but slows up to accommodate one of Shakespeare's overdone devices, the play-within-the-play. Hamlet's madness is a topic of much discussion, but is he even acting mad? It's hard to tell from the text, which has our hero going off in several directions at once. His love for the waifish Ophelia is said to be a great motivator, but all we see him do with her is blow her off.\\"This is the story of a man who could not make up his mind.\\" The 1948 film by Laurence Olivier began with that statement, but this question of Hamlet's indecision, like the madness thing, is unsatisfying reductivist. Olivier's film is terrific, in part for some judicious trims that do away with the subplot about a Norwegian invasion and focus more attention on Hamlet himself. One wonders if Shakespeare's longest play is a little too, well, long.Who is Hamlet? I don't think Shakespeare tries to answer that. What he did was build something so enigmatic that civilization stepped in to fill and refill the blanks.What we have from Shakespeare is an underbaked or rebaked story, many of the best lines of dialogue in English, a few puns that haven't aged as well, and achingly deep thoughts about the nature of man; alternately nihilist, existentialist, and Christian in tone - sometimes all three at once. Is man just \\"food for worms\\" in the end, or is there indeed \\"a divinity that shapes our ends/Rough-hew them how we will\\"? Shakespeare was too great an artist to attempt a definitive answer, and that's the glory of \\"Hamlet\\". But there's frustration also in the open-ended nature of its characters and narrative. Sometimes you're better off not trying to cram too much into a simple revenge story."},{"Title":"Hamlet (Illustrated Shakespeare Ser.)","review":"Not only does this book make understanding Shakespeare much easier, but it came WAY earlier than expected and was in time for me to use in my class."},{"Title":"Hamlet (Illustrated Shakespeare Ser.)","review":"The description of the book said that it was used, but in near-new condition with no markings.

I first picked up this book while on the treadmill in gym class at my school. In the beginning, I thought I should whip out my Shakespeare dictionary and begin to translate every word, but alas this was not the case. Instead, Shakespeare managed to make this book oddly understandable. Sure, it's sprinkled with Shakespeare's traditional tongue, but the context clues are frequent enough so that the book can be easily read. Definately a must for beginner Shakespeare readers. This particular edition is also the best due to the fact that it has pages dedicated to the history of Hamlet's time.

I liked Romeo and Juliet better than I liked Hamlet but I still thought that it was a good play. I think that I understood this version as well as could be suspected, considering that Shakespeare can be very difficult to read. My favorite character in Hamlet was Ophelia.

Now that Old Hamlet is dead, Young Fortinbras wants his land back and is willing to take it by force. Meanwhile back in D&auml;nemark Prince Hamlet who is excessively grieving the loss of his father, the king, gets an interesting insight from his father's ghost.

I would definately recommend it to some one who likes Shakespeare."},{"Title":"Hamlet (Illustrated Shakespeare Ser.)","review":"I thought that this book was interesting. I had never read the story Hamlet before I read this, and I was able to understand it because it had both English and Shakespeare version. I just read the modern version because once i started to read the Shakespeare version i was not able to understand it so i had to read the modern version again. I am glad that we could read this book and i would recommend it to anybody that wanted to read Shakespeare."},{"Title":"Hamlet (Illustrated Shakespeare Ser.)","review":"this book was a great help to me because of the book format. it was easy to compare the original text and find out what it meant. the transalation was very accurate, following Shakerspeare's original words. it was very helpful to my classmates and i while we studied this WONDERFUL book. the text is right down to a toddler's reading level."},{"Title":"Hamlet (Illustrated Shakespeare Ser.)","review":"I thought this book was one of the most interesting pieces of work that Shakespeare has written that I have read yet. I would recommend to anyone who has a lot of spare times on his or her hands to read this Shakespearean play because it will take a lot of time to read this piece of work. You have to take the time and want to be able to understand this before you can say whether or not you like or dislike anything written by Shakespeare. To fully understand this play you have to understand the way it was written and take the time to look up what words that you do not fully understand. I t will help you to get a hold of some Cliff's Notes to help you along while reading this play. But I would recommend to anyone to pick up a copy of Hamlet and read it. It is a great learning experience and a way to appreciate a great piece of literary work. If Shakespeare was alive today, I think this review would make him very happy to know that young adults are reading his work and that many of them really appreciate it for what it is. I really would recommend this to anyone."},{"Title":"Hamlet (Illustrated Shakespeare Ser.)","review":"I played Ophelia at the Alliance, and was able to thoroughly study the text.

Very professional package, signed by Branagh. A wonderful companion book to the stunning film version of Hamlet."},{"Title":"Hamlet (Illustrated Shakespeare Ser.)","review":"This is a play without an equal. The words that Shakespeare wrote some 400 years ago still ring fresh and true with every reading.

But with Hamlet my eyes opened, and I saw the sheer brilliance.Whereever you are Bill, helluva story."},{"Title":"Hamlet (Illustrated Shakespeare Ser.)","review":"Fascinating as well as amusing because of Branagh's own subtexts. Apart from being Hamlet, he focuses the thoughts behind the lines of other figures and gives more devices of his interpretation of the great drama. And more, his own rememberances of the preface are worth the book alone. The signature edition is marvellous and beautifully made. Get it while it is available!"},{"Title":"Hamlet (Illustrated Shakespeare Ser.)","review":"i have to confess that i LOVE all of Shakespeare's works. Yet &quot;Hamlet&quot; delights me most of all. This is easily the best-written of any Shakespeare play, and it may very well be one of the best plays ever to boot. The characterization is superb, the plot is exciting. . . and Rosencrantz and Guildenstern deserve a mention. if you don't believe me, read &quot;Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead&quot; by Tom Stoppard. It gives the average reader an even greater appreciation of Shakespeare's literary genius (as if THAT were possible!)."},{"Title":"Hamlet (Illustrated Shakespeare Ser.)","review":"This book is an excellent way to read Shakespeare.

It is definitely up there though and I can completely understand why it is so well liked. Next to MacBeth, no play in history has topped Hamlet. A bit complicated to read however at first. As for the 1996 film it is DEFINTELY the best film version of the play ever made. One of the best films of the 90's."},{"Title":"Hamlet (Illustrated Shakespeare Ser.)","review":"Excellent version of the play. The criticism and general knowledge sections add insight and value to this amazing piece of work. Shakespeare is so good."},{"Title":"Hamlet (Illustrated Shakespeare Ser.)","review":"All of the no fear Shakespear books are a must when required to read Shakespeare for class.

So I've bought the set again just to replace that CD, and I think it was 30 well spent. What surprises me is how few copies there seem to be left in the world."},{"Title":"Hamlet (Illustrated Shakespeare Ser.)","review":"Hamlet is the longest, most complicated and famous of Shakespeare's 39 plays. The role of Hamlet requires the actor to deliver 40% of the over 4,000 lines in the play. Shakespeare is the supreme playwright of the ages and Hamlet is the pinnacle of his dramatic genius.Hamlet is haunted by the ghost of his father old Hamlet. The ghost is in purgatory; Hamlet has returned from study at Wittenberg University. The Ghost tells Hamlet to kill Claudius. Claudius murdered his brother old Hamlet and married his widow Gertrude. Hamlet renounces his lover Ophelia the daughter of Polonius an advisor to to King Claudius. Ophelia goes mad and drowns in the river as a suicide victim. Hamlet mistakenly kills Polonius thinking he is Claudius. Hamlet and Laertes fight a duel but each dies; Claudius and Gertrude also succumb to poison. The play ends with bodies littering the \\"prison of Denmark\\" as wasteland imagery abounds. Fortinbras and the Norwegian army seize Elsinore Castle.This relatively simple plot of a revenge play is turned into a philosophical inquiry into such weighty subjects as Death; Family dynamics; the afterlife; incest; murder and love. No generation or actor can plum the full depths of Hamlet.One thinks of the great lines:To thine own self be trueTis kind to be cruelTo be or not to bewords, words, wordsthe play's the thingfrailty thy name is womanthere is something rotten in the state of Denmarkall the rest is silenceThe list of memorable words and the enigma of young intellectual Hamlet forced to act make this the play of the ages. Shakespeare is not easy to read or understand but knowing Hamlet is essential to everyone's cultural education."},{"Title":"Hamlet (Illustrated Shakespeare Ser.)","review":"There really is no way to review a masterpiece like this. Shakespeare is considered by most to be the greatest writer of all time, and Hamlet is almost universally considered to be one of his best works. There are so many immortal phrases and lines in this play, the most famous being &quot;to be or not to be.&quot; The play contains seven soliloquies by Hamlet which provide an interesting look at his character. If you consider these soliloquies side by side, you can see a sort of 'backstory' dealing with the development of Hamlet's character, from suffering to suicidal to vengeful (&quot;My thoughts be bloody, or be nothing worth&quot;).It is impossible to study Shakespeare without studying Hamlet. This is certainly one of the cornerstones of English literature. These folger editions are light and convenient to carry, and are very affordable as well. Hamlet is an excellent place to start if you want to become acquainted with Shakespeare."},{"Title":"Hamlet (Illustrated Shakespeare Ser.)","review":"This was a great book. I enjoyed it immensely. Hamlet was very clever but was quite a brat. Towards the begining when he was busy feeling sorry for himself, he said he would kill himself if God wasn't against it. But what would Hamlet care. He only murdered about 10 million people throughout the play. To me, Hamlet seemed more of a villian than a hero. In this Shakespeare play a lot of people die but I think the only truly sad dealth was Opelia's. The modern version really helped me get so much more out of the play."},{"Title":"Hamlet (Illustrated Shakespeare Ser.)","review":"Before this book, my wife and I never enjoyed Shakespeare very much. This book makes the play perfectly clear, and with the side-by-side arrangement, makes the original poetry understandable and beautiful. We watched the play afterward and finally began to glimpse the wonder that is hidden within the words."},{"Title":"Hamlet (Illustrated Shakespeare Ser.)","review":"Is revenge bad? In a book about revenge there is no way revenge is bad when it is necessary. Hamlet had all the reason for his form of revenge. When you find that your father is dead and the person sleeping with your mother is his murderer, is that revenge or a necessary just.With Hamlet's Edipus complex, is he mad at the new King for doing to his father what he wanted to do for himself. Hamlet like other young boys love their mothers' and by loosing his father, he felt it was his right to take his father's place. The revenge of Hamlet is not only for the death of his father but for the taking of his place.When the ghost of his father comes to his mother's room after the Mouse Trap, Hamlet finds himself on the bed with his mother. When he sees the ghost he gets off the bed and pleads with his mother from his knees. With the mother believing he was crazy, he tried to proove to her he was thinking sensibly. Earlier in the play when Hamlet speaks the familiar line, &quot;To be or not to be&quot;, is he really wondering to himself if he is to be or not to be with his mother.With the death of his father Hamlet feels unwanted and shunned by his mother. For the rest of the play Hamlet is trying to proove he could be the man to feel his father's shoes. His hate for the new King stems from the feelings of inadequacy he brings on himself. Hamlet knows one day the kingdom will be his but with the new king in the way he will never have his kingdom or his mother."},{"Title":"Hamlet (Illustrated Shakespeare Ser.)","review":"Readers should note that this site does not distinguish between the various editions of Shakespeare, so the reviews you read may be for audiotapes, modern translations, etc. I am reviewing the Kenneth Branaugh BBC Radio recording of Hamlet. It is adequate, which I consider high praise for this challenging play. Like Branaugh's movie a few years later, it includes the entire text of the play, which is a nice way to remind yourself of some issues you may have forgotten.The performances are pretty good, and include Branaugh (of course) as Hamlet and Derek Jacobi as Claudius, giving us a hint of the performances they would later give in the movie. No one's performance really blew me away, although Jacobi was excellent.Ultimately, the play loses quite a bit when transferred to audio only. There's a lot to be conveyed with stage placement, physican action, expression, etc. Somehow, listening to the play limited my imagination on those issues, preventing my from using my &quot;mind's eye&quot; to the fullest."},{"Title":"Hamlet (Illustrated Shakespeare Ser.)","review":"This edition of Hamlet, with its accompanying critical essays is a good introduction to literary theory (in fact, my lit interpretation professor used it as exactly that). Wofford's essay on the critical history of Hamlet is clear and concise, with an interesting focus on the performance of the play. The critical essays' perspectives include feminist and Marxist theory."},{"Title":"Hamlet (Illustrated Shakespeare Ser.)","review":"Hamlet is a very intricate book that requires very in-depth reading or even a little help from essays written on Hamlet or something of that nature. It is a very good book with a nice blend of puns and paradoxes to foreshadowing. It is a story of a Danish prince caught in the middle of an uncle who recently became king at the death of Hamlet's father, a mother who married Hamlet's uncle after Hamlet's father's death, and a girlfriend who is a bit crazy. This all sets up a Shakespeare's classic. It is a reference of the monarchies of the late 1500's early 1600's when family members killed other family members for the monarchy. Their is the outside conflict Hamlet has with his mother and uncle but also their is the intricate inner conflict in Hamlet of what to do. This discussion leads to the question is Hamlet crazy. This all sets up one of the most famous speech in literature, \\"To be or not to be? That is the question.\\""},{"Title":"Hamlet (Illustrated Shakespeare Ser.)","review":"It is obvious that a work of this kind may simplify Shakespeare's masterpiece, but I understand that it is necessary, just like translations; I am Brasilian and one of my first books ever read was Hamlet, in a translation to portuguese.

I love his use of language ,along with his underlineing themes which give each play a Shakespeare's touch. Hamlet was a great play, filled with exciment of Hamlet's next move,mystery of the ghost,treason and finally death. Hamlet's procrastination is his tragic flaw; Laertes is a nice contrasting character to Hamlet and is a great example of Hamlet's tragic flaw directly effecting others in the play.Hamlet is filled with sorrow and grief, it is easy for the reader to sympathize with the characters of the play. I would recommend this play to every Shakespeare fan!"},{"Title":"Hamlet (Illustrated Shakespeare Ser.)","review":"I used, and will continue to use, this version of Shakespeare's Hamlet with my 10th grade literature students and had much success.

It has some different approaches and moves into some different areas where other Holmes books don't attempt (such as the last story). This is supposedly the author's first book and it's not bad in that regard. I read some of the other reviews and noticed that the &quot;purest&quot; of the Holmes society have once again tried to trash anyone who tries to write out of the original canon. Shame on them. There are some editing problems in the book, but I have found that these are somewhat common from the specific publisher."},{"Title":"Sherlock Holmes: Mysteries of the Victorian Era","review":"I am relatively new to the world of Sherlock Holmes and I very much enjoyed this compilation of stories. The book contains 5 short stories. Each story was well-developed and contained just the right amount of mystery. I particularly liked the last of the stories, &quot;The Adventure of Jackthorn Circle&quot;. What an ending!!The book cover indicates that this is the first book for this author (although you wouldn't know it based on his writing). I will be sure to buy future books by Mr. DiLisio."},{"Title":"Sherlock Holmes: Mysteries of the Victorian Era","review":"It is unfortunate that this type of poor pastiche is allowed to be published. For example, in the first story, the murder weapon is a vial of &quot;Liquid Nitrogen&quot; into which a copper coil is dipped. After 3 days, the vial is still steaming. Any 4th grade student knows Nitrogen exists as a liquid only under high pressure, and is not going to sit around in a glass vial.In addition, the grammar and spelling is atrocious! Perhaps my guess at the work being of a 4th grade level is not so far off.One of the worst of many Sherlock Holmes pastiches I have read."},{"Title":"Sherlock Holmes: Mysteries of the Victorian Era","review":"Since we can no longer add to the original 56 stories written by Conan Doyle, we have to accept and be somewhat pleased with anyone who attempts to keep the Sherlock Holmes name in the limelight and allows us to sink into the Victorian Era for ever so short periods of time. I thank the author for that.This book is not for the pure Holmes fan. It appears to be more of light-hearted attempt at writing some Holmes stories (something that most Holmes followers have done). This is a self-published book (since it is iUniverse) and that must be taken into consideration. A couple of the stories are pretty good and it states this is the author's first book so take it for what it's worth. For entertainment, it's fine."},{"Title":"Sherlock Holmes: Mysteries of the Victorian Era","review":"I found this book to lean to a scientific side, though I don't believe that the author is a scientist. For the average person, most of the resolutions sound good. It's a somewhat different approach to Holmes, which may intrigue some. The attempt to follow the Conan Doyle style of writing is not easy and that can be sensed in this book. It's an average read.Hey, as long as someone keeps writing about Holmes..I'm happy!"},{"Title":"Sherlock Holmes: Mysteries of the Victorian Era","review":"This book was fairly good. I think that the author had some difficulty with the British phrasing/grammer, which explains some of the awkward sentence structure. Conan-Doyle wrote in a very baroque style and some authors have difficulty following it, especially if they are not British. I liked a couple of the stories, the others could have used more detail."},{"Title":"Sherlock Holmes: Mysteries of the Victorian Era","review":"This is dreadful.

Introductory information on these habitats give the reader an introduction to the ecology and dynamics of these quiet fresh water bodies."},{"Title":"Pond life;: A guide to common plants and animals of North American ponds and lakes, (A Golden nature guide)","review":"I have always been a big fan of the Golden Nature Guide series and have been since a very small boy. They were a very important part of my learning process and I had quite a number of these books while growing up. (I still have most of them stashed here and there throughout the house).This one, \\"Pond Life,\\" is as another reviewer has pointed out, probably one of the best books for young people covering this aspect of nature. It is clear, concise, well illustrated, and does not bog the young reader down with page after page of complex text. It is also geared to prod the young reader's curiosity and is designed to start this young reader down many interesting paths. It is what I call a \\"seed\\" book; a book that should stimulate and encourage further research; both in books in the outdoors.The book covers the subject of ponds. Ponds are a rather unique and important ecosystem within themselves and are quite available for study in most part of our country and indeed, the world. Each pond of course is unique but this little book most certainly gives a wonderful overview of what can be found.The book is broken down into sections which include plants and then animals. It covers living organisms from the microscopic all the way to up to the large vertebrates, including mammals, reptiles, birds, fishes and lampreys. The plant section covers areas starting with algae through vascular plants. It is all here folks.This work also includes a section as to how to study a pond; observations an collection methods. It also covers in a very nice fashion the dynamics of a living pond.A couple of things to note: As has been pointed out, much of the equipment here is geared toward what was available in the 1960s and early 1970s. We have come a long way since then. At present we have very affordable microscopes available which will enhance any study. We have specialty binoculars available which allow the study of insect live at a distance which brings the image of the creature being studied to the point that we normally could only find under a dissection microscope. This lack of \\"modern\\" equipment though does not distract from the scientific facts presented in this work.This cost of this work is small and the book certainly should be included in all school libraries and is an ideal work to be used by the home school crowd.The entire book is set up in a field guide format which is quite workable.Don BlankenshipThe Ozarks"},{"Title":"Pond life;: A guide to common plants and animals of North American ponds and lakes, (A Golden nature guide)","review":"This is one of the most helpful books you'll find for identifying creatures and plants in streams and ponds.

The Golden Guides are invaluable for kids especially, and as the local \\"nature guy\\" that everyone in town comes to for identifying plants and animals, this book has been a valuable resource.

I'm just happy that it is still in print."},{"Title":"Pond life;: A guide to common plants and animals of North American ponds and lakes, (A Golden nature guide)","review":"Price and size are what makes this guide so great. It provides a good overview of pond life - flora and fauna - in a very portable format.The small size, however, means that the illustrations are not as large or detailed as we would prefer. It also limits the amount of specific information that can be included. We recently relocated to the Pacific Northwest and have found region-specific books (particularly from Lone Pine Publishers) to be superb.I recommend this as a great resource at a very good price."},{"Title":"Pond life;: A guide to common plants and animals of North American ponds and lakes, (A Golden nature guide)","review":"Pond life is a convenient booklet for me to dash into the wilderness with any resource to help me identify different aquatic animals.

I'm a college student and have studied environmental science and biology, but this book breaks it all down, and is very easy to understand. I read it cover to cover before i went into the field and it was extremely helpful. It is not an extensive field guide, but it teaches you how to identify a sedge from a grass, for example. Knowing all of this information makes it much easier to go through a local field guide to identify the grass or sedge your looking at. It covers all aspects of wetland life from alga to mammals. It's not to be-all-that-ends-all in wetland identification, but it makes all other field guides less overwhelming. I highly recommend this book for anyone interested in wetlands."},{"Title":"Pond life;: A guide to common plants and animals of North American ponds and lakes, (A Golden nature guide)","review":"I am very pleased with the variety of plants and animals identified in this book.

For more detail you need to select a book on the related subjects."},{"Title":"Pond life;: A guide to common plants and animals of North American ponds and lakes, (A Golden nature guide)","review":"Pond Life is like a general biology introduction to life found in ponds. All types of life are covered, albeit in very brief introductions. Plants and animals (microscopic to mammals to birds) each receive tertiary coverage. The book does not get into specifics on how wetlands function relation to other ecosystems, and such coverage would have been useful, but the overall emphasis is still relevant.The book is likely not intended to be read from cover to cover, as it is a field guide. Field guides are really meant to be brought along in a pocket for easy reference when making field identifications. In this respect, I am a big fan of other field guides in the series.This volume and its companions should be readily available at nature centers, but the price is low enough for people to purchase it for their own libraries. What it lacks in detail it makes up for in compactness and readability."},{"Title":"Pond life;: A guide to common plants and animals of North American ponds and lakes, (A Golden nature guide)","review":"Golden Guides are often described as books for children just discovering the natural world. While the series is eminently usable by young naturalists, Golden Guides are solid introductory field guides. One of the strengths of &quot;Pond Life&quot; is its comprehensive scope covering everything from protozoa to plants to mammals. Indeed, it provides more good basic information on identifying types of water plants than any other source I know complete with measurements and color illustrations. The same applies to its coverage of invertebrates as well, though the minor objection of the previous reviewer concerning its scanty treatment of protozoa is a valid one. I would add to the strength of &quot;Pond Life&quot; its portability, which packs a plethora of information into a small package. Another weakness (of the Golden Guides in general) is its datedness to the 1950's and 60's. This does not affect its basic science in most cases, though it is strange (albeit nostalgic for some) to see the equipment suggested for pond watching."},{"Title":"Pond life;: A guide to common plants and animals of North American ponds and lakes, (A Golden nature guide)","review":"This little book is a bargain if you want to identify aquatic plants, animals, etc. commonly found in US lakes &amp; ponds.

While all of the Golden Guides contain some information beyond that needed for identification, this book has much more of an emphasis on broadly educating readers about the intricacies of pond life.Taking on an entire ecosystem, Reid has given himself plenty of space to talk about the various types of pond habitats, the nature of water and how that fits into the picture, and the different seasons as they affect pond life. I found all of these sections to be highly informative, with the Golden Guide trademark of sophisticated knowledge being passed on in manageable chunks.Reid doesn't talk down to the reader in the slightest; any young reader will sense that this guidebook is appropriate for amateur scientists of all ages.Even the identification section is more word-laden than other Golden Guides, and much emphasis is put upon identifying different families and classes of organisms, rather than being limited to species identification alone.No family that lives within striking distance of a pond should be without this handy little book. At the very least, it can provide a couple of magical afternoons exploring this amazing habitat together."},{"Title":"Pond life;: A guide to common plants and animals of North American ponds and lakes, (A Golden nature guide)","review":"I'm very much a nature lover. When this book arrived, I saw the small size (about 6\\" x 4\\") I felt a little dissappointed. I thought at least it would be something 'cute' for my kids, but would be far too basic for me.NOT AT ALL!I'm learning things I had no idea about. Did you know there are FRESHWATER JELLYFISH! I didn't!Do you get energized learning about things in the natural environment? If so, you might really want to give this book a try. The book does not go into tremendous detail about each critter or topic covered, but does so enough to grasp the subject matter, and further research if you're interested. As I did with freshwater jellyfish - for which I now have bookmarked videos of them.Another thing I liked, my attention span is not all that good. In my day, you got a smack on the back of the head, now they call it adhd....I found the book easy to read and follow. It's not like the longwinded boring educational type of book. You can flip through, find pictures of stuff you want to learn about and read - you don't have to read in a cover to cover manner.Very cool book, very nice suprises reading it!"},{"Title":"Pond life;: A guide to common plants and animals of North American ponds and lakes, (A Golden nature guide)","review":"Typical of the Golden Guides, this book is written for audiences of all age levels, from elementary school through college. The style and tone are appealing and allow the reader to seek any level of depth. The drawings and illustrations provide useful complementary information to the text. Somehow, the author has managed to make the phylogenetic and zoological information accessible to a general reader. This book would be equally at home on the shelf of a middle school student taking his first biological sciences class or a college student studying limnology or stream ecology. Information on identification of organisms is generally sufficient, but not overbearing. Some of the material is dated, such as the use of the phylum name Coelenterata rather than Cnidaria, but the nonexpert will be unaffected by this. As an added bonus, the Golden Guides are priced extremely attractively."},{"Title":"Pond life;: A guide to common plants and animals of North American ponds and lakes, (A Golden nature guide)","review":"If your child loves science and has an interest with frogs, insects, and pond life, this little book is a wonderful colorfully illustrated book they would surely enjoy! Informative and detailed illustrations to go along with easy reading of plants, birds, fish, and microscopic life you can find in a pond. Small enough to place in their back pocket or book bag. I think Golden Guide books St. Martin present a very easy book to understand and explore all kinds of animal and plant life."},{"Title":"Pond life;: A guide to common plants and animals of North American ponds and lakes, (A Golden nature guide)","review":"This is one of the best books in the entire series, and I have probably over 30 of them, including some that are out of print (such as the one on Non-Flowering plants).I worked in the publishing industry as a writer and editor for eight years, and in my humble opinion the little Golden Guides are an almost unique set of books. They convey a tremendous amount of information in small compass (the guides are all 256 pages long, interestingly enough), and extremely well written and illustrated. They have been the primers for several generations of young people interested in natural history, and their influence has been substantial.Originally starting out with titles such as Birds and Mammals, back in the 40s, by the 60s they had branched out into other areas with guides on other natural history areas such as Insects, Spiders, Rocks and Minerals, structural geology, The Stars, The Sky Obsevers Guide, Light and Color, which covered the science of Optics. In physiology there was the guide on The Heart, and even books on Guns and Fishing. The guides on Botany, Pond Life, and Non-Flowering plants were some of the highest level ones they did.This guide covers everything from protozoa to macroscopic life forms that can be found in a pond. As a 9 year old boy with his first microscope, I used this guide to help identify the first green alga that I found, which was chlorella, which was quite common. I also found rotifers, paramecia, blue green algae, and a few euglena. But for a long time, this was my only guide. Eventually I acquired other more advanced books in junior high and high school, and went on to major in and study physiology and botany in college and grad school, but in many ways this wonderful little set of books was where my interest and education all started. Overall, this is another great book in the series, and as I said, possibly the greatest little series of its type ever written. Many other series have come out since, but none have accomplished as much in such small format as these terrific little books."},{"Title":"Pond life;: A guide to common plants and animals of North American ponds and lakes, (A Golden nature guide)","review":"I used to rent this book so much from the parochial school library that the nuns used to scold me for not sharing it to others. It is a great book for the budding natualist or the field explorer. The insights into pond evoloutions are great in explainations.

In it I found a sympathetic character in Elizabeth, the protagonist of this story. I could well sympathize with her inability to make friends easily (I had that same challenge) and agonizing over her small stature. I had the opposite problem -- I always thought I was abnormally tall until I reached my maximum height at 12 and am NOT tall for any adult!It was an interesting coming together of these two loners, Elizabeth and Jennifer. I think the whole \\"witchcraft\\" thing was to a large extent, childhood wishful thinking and playacting and the natural wish to distinguish oneself among one's peers. I loved this book and delighted in the antics of the two girls.Elizabeth's nemesis, the phony, duplicitous Cynthia is easily recognizable. I had to endure my share of \\"Cynthias\\" growing up and I can remember thinking how laughably clueless adults were to the phony, smarmy charm such creeps like Cynthia oozed. I thought it was mean of Elizabeth's mother to make her attend Cynthia's birthday party and to constantly sing Cynthia's praises to her. People who praise Other People's Children to their own make me tired. That certainly did not help Elizabeth's esteem. I could relate to that because my mother used to sing the praises of Other People's Children to me. I can remember telling her time and again, \\"She's/They're just pretending to be nice because YOU'RE here. I can't just walk up to kids and make friends.\\" It was only after I had become an adult myself that I realized that my mother and her peers were not as susceptible to the smarmy Cynthias as I had been led to believe. It was in recent years that she has told me that she knew all along what sneaky, miserable little wretches those \\"Cynthias\\" were and that she was \\"friendly to them in the hopes they'd be nicer to me\\" whether she was present or not. How wonderful it would have been to have told me that in the first place! I would have known she was an ally then instead of easily misled by Other People's Children! This book is an eye opener for all ages.I still laugh uproariously over the way Elizabeth ate a raw onion per Jennifer's direction for a week. Her bizarre eating habits paid off -- I loved it when her onion breath scared nasty Cynthia who ran off the stage during a school play. I also loved the way she fixed Cynthia's wagon at Cynthia's birthday party by challenging her phony charm. Each time Cynthia oohed and aahed over a gift and asked who it was from, Elizabeth would call out the name of the giver, thus spoiling Cynthia's fun. I cheered when Elizabeth stepped on nasty Cynthia's foot when the latter stuck her tongue out at her when she left the party. I remember at 8 thinking, \\"Elizabeth, you don't need Cynthia. One of these days she'll get it.\\" Many years later, I wanted to say, \\"Just remember, there is life after elementary/middle school. Creeps like Cynthia may have won a battle or two, but they won't win the war. I hope you see Cynthia fall flat on her phony face.\\"It is a delightful treasure trove of memories and a book well worth reading at any age. I still love it and I have my original hard back copy that I got when I was eight.Ideal companion book to MY SECRET BULLY, which is the flip side of this book. Instead of condoning the bullying behavior in aggressive girls, Katie's mother defends her daughter and helps empower her by giving strategies on how to deal with the malicious, destructive behavior of bullying girls."},{"Title":"Russian Language and People: A Course for Beginners Learning Russian","review":"This BBC course (which comes with cassettes) is extremely well thought out and supports you the whole way through. For example, instead of trying to teach you the whole cyrillic alphabet at one gulp, it spreads the unfamiliar squiggles over 4 lessons all the while moving you directly into the heart of Russian language and culture with each lesson. The exercises are imaginative and very useful; using lots of actual realia (train tickets, shop signs, play bills, menus, etc) that are fascinating on their own. You're even doing Russian Crossword puzzles by lesson 5!! The structure allows you to continually reuse the things you've learned in the previous lessons and concentrates on practical language necessities and situations while you're in Russia. I am a foreign language teacher myself, and needed to learn some Russian quickly. I found that this series gave me exactly the 'building blocks&quot; with which to make myself understood and really enjoy my trip!"},{"Title":"Russian Language and People: A Course for Beginners Learning Russian","review":"I found this course to be quite helpful in attempting to learn Russian with minimal assistance from a Russian tutor.The lessons are real world oriented and of a length that allows the student to consume the language in reasonably sized bites.I was able to get by in Russia and the Ukraine after studying for less than six months.The best of the low priced language courses."},{"Title":"DEATH IN THE DEVIL'S ACRE (INSPECTOR PITT)","review":"A doctor is found murdered in the part of London deservedly known as the Devil's Acre. What was such a respectable man doing there? And, even more puzzling, why did his killer horribly mutilate the corpse? Inspector Thomas Pitt must try to find the answers to those questions. For once his well born wife, Charlotte, can play no self-assigned role in the investigation. It has no connection at all to the life she once lived as Miss Ellison, and none to the life of her sister Emily, who is now Lady Ashworth. Not until other murders take place, one of them with a victim whose fiancee Emily does at least slightly know...and one with a victim whom Charlotte remembers from involving herself in Pitt's Callander Square case.As usual, author Perry handles themes of Victorian social issues with spot on accuracy. She gets the details of the era right, too, unfailingly; and her characters engaged me even before some of my Callander Square favorites returned. There is nothing easy about the world Perry's writing depicts, but somehow she keeps me turning pages anyway.--Reviewed by Nina M. Osier, author of 2005 science fiction EPPIE winner \\"Regs\\""},{"Title":"DEATH IN THE DEVIL'S ACRE (INSPECTOR PITT)","review":"This is the 7th in the Charlotte and Thomas Pitt series. It starts off in the year 1887 with an interesting premise, and it moves steadily toward an exciting finish. The character of Thomas is more likable than last time, and his wife Charlotte, who doesn't have much to do in the first part of the book, becomes very active later, as does her sister Emily. And there are characters brought back from previous books. Along the way, because of Charlotte's unusual social circumstances and Thomas's profession, we learn some fascinating insights into the class system of that time and place.The author is consistent in her ability to create a sense of place and character. In DEATH IN THE DEVIL'S ACRE the atmosphere is dark and moody, with a very unpleasant topic. But the book is well done and adds to the series."},{"Title":"DEATH IN THE DEVIL'S ACRE (INSPECTOR PITT)","review":"Having previously read several of Anne Perry's short Sherlock Holmes pastiches, I desperately wanted to like this book. Her Victorian writing style was accurate, and general knowledge of the era seemed profound. Always appreciating an author who researches the time period in which they write so as to increase authenticity while avoiding jarring anachronisms, I was even more excited about her Thomas & Charlotte Pitt novels as the plots appeared much more promising than those of her pastiches.The book's opening is both engaging and intriguing, hooking the reader with a winning blend of likable characters and fascinating plot. That the writing style was reminiscent of something more of an authentic feeling period piece rather than a book conspicuously written by a 20th Century hand trying to imitate Victorian writers was another bonus. The author did have an annoying habit of switching to multiple POVs, but this was overlooked. As was the rather dull way the story then unfolded with Pitt asking the obvious people obvious questions. I was expecting it to pick up pace in the second half, but was genuinely enjoying her characterizations and the Thomas/Charlotte interactions.What I cannot forgive is how halfway through the book, Perry's POVs become erratic, shifting away from her main detectives to Emily (Charlotte's sister) then General Ballantyne, which was not only irritating after we've been introduced to and have warmed up to the former, but here she decides to bog the story down with excessive amounts of introspection/exposition that have more to do with an often misguided societal commentary than moving the story along. In small doses, it would have increased the book's authenticity. With the copious way it is used as useless filler it only makes for an annoying deviance from plot.I also could not help but feel like this was not the book I signed up for (and spent $15 on). If I wanted to read about two women who attend boring dinner parties and ADMIT they veered off course and never even made the attempt to acquire the information they were there for, or traipse around the town prattling on about their dresses, etc., then I would have bought such a book. I like strong women characters, but these two seem unbelievable as that for the time period in which they live. I also seem to be in the minority as I prefer male dominated mysteries but of course am open to anything, so this has me further aggravated that most of the men are portrayed as either doormats, effeminate, or sleazes that, in differing ways, are only there to oppress womankind. Doing such does not, in turn, make your female characters more authentic or stronger willed. It just makes the author look unduly hostile... like some of her characters.In summation, I have been reading Death in the Devil's Acre for well over three weeks and am now stuck firmly on page 163. I do not yet want to give up on this, though, and if I ever do finish, I might tweak my rating and review accordingly. But for the time being, I will say this is a HUGE disappointment and it's very unlikely I'll ever pick up one of Perry's novels again."},{"Title":"DEATH IN THE DEVIL'S ACRE (INSPECTOR PITT)","review":"Pitt and Charlotte are at it again. The subjects Ms. Perry chooses always seem to startle me, only because I feel in the Victorian time, it would be such a scandal, which ofcourse is what makes it delicious for us. The women of the Victorian times are trying to break out from some of their perceived roles as women.Having read these in order, it's fun to see characters reintroduced.With all the shows on TV, like CSI,it's fun to see what things they did to identify bodies, how long they could keep a dead body, etc.Very enjoyable read."},{"Title":"DEATH IN THE DEVIL'S ACRE (INSPECTOR PITT)","review":"Anne Perry writes a very interesting story with mounds of character and period development. If you read the entire series in the order which she wrote the Thomas Pitt mysteries, you will get a lot more out of each book. You must read until you get to Cardington Crescent. Its got to be the best one she wrote so far."},{"Title":"DEATH IN THE DEVIL'S ACRE (INSPECTOR PITT)","review":"This is probably one of the most engrossing novels I have ever read. I could barely put it down. As with all of Anne Perry's novels there is a LOT of discussing, speculating, Ect. but there is some interesting information on how differently the claases lived. And of course there is much excitment when Pitt is investigating in the Devil's Acre. Pitt and his wife, Charolette (I spelled it wrong, didn't I?) seem to be a bit competitive in this one. Charolette (don't mock me 'cause I can't spell) acts like she wants to solve the case for Pitt or before him. All in all, I reccomend this book to any reader, diehard Perry and/or CSI fan."},{"Title":"DEATH IN THE DEVIL'S ACRE (INSPECTOR PITT)","review":"I very much enjoyed the mystery aspect of this book and could not wait to find out who the murderer was (I thought it was someone different than who it turned out to be). However, the thing that bothered me throughout the entire book was the odd interaction between Charlotte and Thomas. I have read a number of the other books and I certainly could not see that there was any type of \\"collaboration\\" between the two of them. There seemed to be very little contact between them to begin with and what there was consisted almost entirely of him telling her to mind her own business. Of course, being Charlotte, she ignored him and did what she felt was necessary to gather information which she never really gave to him. Nevertheless, the story was well written and kept the reader interested."},{"Title":"DEATH IN THE DEVIL'S ACRE (INSPECTOR PITT)","review":"This novel has all the twists and turns that Anne Perry is famous for in her historical novels.

The detective work was incredible and the murders were beyond belief!"},{"Title":"DEATH IN THE DEVIL'S ACRE (INSPECTOR PITT)","review":"In this seventh novel in the Charlotte and Thomas Pitt high Victorian mystery series, we leave the exclusive circles of high London society for the brothels and slums, where first a seemingly respectable doctor and then Max, the blackmailing footman from CALLANDER SQUARE, are not only murdered but mutilated -- and then a third murder brings into play Charlotte's connections with London's drawing room society. Perry does a good job in this one, especially in delineating the characters of those whose existence middle class London would rather know about."},{"Title":"DEATH IN THE DEVIL'S ACRE (INSPECTOR PITT)","review":"Death in the Devil's Acre is the seventh book in Anne Perry's Thomas and Charlotte Pitt historical mystery series is an intoxicating thriller from start to finish with mesmerizing characters.A doctor of good standing and impeccable character is found slashed to death in the Devil's Acre, one of Victorian London's slums near the docks. Then another body is found with the same \\"calling card.\\" A serial killer?Pitt is called on to investigate. Recurring characters figure prominently in this mystery, especially Charlotte, helping Pitt with his investigation, but the crimes are not solved until the final pages after a particularly exciting chase involving some of Perry's most riveting characters.Another unputdownable Perry mystery, one that satisfies the lover of historical mysteries with period detail and, in particular, facts about the poverty and suffering of children in this rigid and hypocritical society.I admit to the book's being one of my favorites in the Pitt series, and, I believe, with it, Ms. Perry's mastery of the genre comes into its own. What sets it above the earlier novels, I think, is the fascinating character development of the antagonist and other minor villains.However, since a review is supposed to focus objectively on what historical readers would like--given character development, intricacy of plot, accuracy of historic detail, and the requisite number of suspects, clues, and red herrings, its solution logically formed without an undue stretch of circumstance--I need to give it a four-star rating. It is a novel I re-read from time to time, and also listen to Davina Porter's wonderful unabridged reading of the story. It would be 4.5, if we were allowed half sizes."},{"Title":"DEATH IN THE DEVIL'S ACRE (INSPECTOR PITT)","review":"I really enjoy the stories of Anne Perry and this one is, I think, one of her best.

In time, however, he discovers that Adam was born with FAS, a condition Dorris knows very little about. Believing that proper care can reverse the effects of FAS, he takes on the daunting and nearly futile task of helping Adam achieve a \\"normal\\" boyhood. The damage done, it turns out, is irreversible; Adam is almost maddeningly unable to learn simple tasks and responsibilities. FAS-related health problems, including seizures, often turn merely difficult days and nights into nightmares for the single father.The book Dorris writes is meant as an eye-opener for readers who are unaware of the potential harm in consuming alcohol during pregnancy. Given naturally to research and study, he shares with the reader much of what he learns about FAS and the Native American culture that has had such a fatal connection with alcohol. To that extent, this is almost a textbook on the subject.But this is also the story of a father and son, and most poignant, for this reader, is the relationship between them that is a thread throughout the book. Dorris never surrenders to the barriers that exist between him and his son. Having taken responsibility for Adam, he gives his all to making even the smallest difference in the boy's life. It's a heroic effort and often heartbreaking."},{"Title":"The Broken Cord","review":"This is a vivid and moving account of a father's initiation into (single) parenthood and the rigorous journey of seeing a handicapped child into adulthood. It is both laugh-out-loud funny and profoundly sad. This book works best on the level of personal story-- what it means to live with a child who will never be normal, as you both fear and deny the reality that your kid is handicapped. (As the adoptive mother of a girl who has a constellation of emotional and psychological problems, but with no definitive cause, I could relate to Dorris' experience.) For me, the book bogged down in Dorris' lengthy research findings pertaining to FAS and its impact on native american communities. Dorris adopted his son, Adam, with no forewarning of Adam's FAS diagnosis and wrote the book during the early days of FAS research. Therefore, this info. was groundbreaking at the time of the book's publication, but it is dated today. Because this book is the story of only one individual-- one who was extremely handicapped by his condition-- it paints a pretty depressing picture of FAS, and the book is NOT one I would recommend first to anyone who had just taken on the responsibility of raising a child with FAS or FAE. There are more ways to treat and support individuals with FAS/FAE than were available when Dorris was raising Adam, and foster and adoptive parents of FAS/FAE children need to be pointed to resources that give them a broader view of the possibilities for their youngsters."},{"Title":"The Broken Cord","review":"I first read this book in early 1990. Prior to reading this book, I did not know about Fetal Alcohol Syndrome/Effect (FAS/FAE). Mr. Dorris gives a good overview of this tragic condition and his references throughout this book certainly augment the points he makes. I like the lyrical tone Abel's (called &quot;Adam&quot; in the book) story takes when the author includes references to nature and natural phenomena. This book is also culturally enriching by providing glimpses of Native American traditions, e.g. Adam's naming ceremony and the gatherings the Dorris family takes later in the book.Two things saddened me deeply about this book in addition to Adam's congenital condition. The author was involved in a very unfortunate controversy and committed suicide a few years ago. Adam was run over by a car and killed. It made for a very tragic postcript to the lives of the Dorris family and to all those who cared about them personally."},{"Title":"The Broken Cord","review":"I have an adopted son with possible FAE not FAS. The recent studies are saying that FAE is just as bad as FAS because you don't know what it is so readily. My son was the product of a 17 year old drug addict/acoholic who lived on the streets prostituting. So far he is a happy healthy boy, but is tremendously developmentally delayed. He's 8 years old functioning around age 3-4. He will never be OK. When I'm so sad or overwhelmed with his behaviors I like to sit down and watch the TV version (which I recorded) of The Broken Cord. It truely gives me strength to carry on. I have subsequently fallen in love with Jimmy Smits who played Adam's dad on the show. What an excellent job! He portrays, so well, the true frustration these innocent little people bring into your life. I especially relate to the &quot;choo-choo&quot; dialogue and how it started out so cute and became the biggest source of aggrevation. My son does similar things and on occasion I just sit and cry. Michael Dorris did the world a wonderful job of getting the medical profession to begin thinking about this terrible syndrome. Let's keep working! Michael, despite the reasons for your death - you are truely missed and highly respected. You understand these children more than anyone else I know. Doctors - wake up!"},{"Title":"The Broken Cord","review":"Dorris's intent in writing this text is to enlighten people about the disease called Fetal Alcohol Syndrome. His primary focus is how Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS) is affecting the Native American culture. However, he does mention how this disease knows no limits of culture and is occurring across all nationalities.The various parts of the text are divided into Dorris's denial, tolerance and then acceptance of the effects of FAS. Dorris writes about his life as a single parent, when at the age of 26 he decides to adopt a child. Dorris was informed about his adopted son Adam having problems developing. He thought that with enough love and nurturing Adam could overcome any obstacles. The beginning part of the text Dorris is in denial. He blames Adam's shortcomings on a slow start, bias tests, and incompetent assessments. Dorris writes, \\"I periodically concluded that Adam's teachers must be incompetent, badly trained, or lazy when they failed to stimulate his performance in the classroom.\\"(p. 65)Dorris has trouble even thinking that his son might have a problem. Once Dorris adopted two more children, he noticed that the other children developed very fast in comparison to Adam and soon were at the same level of Adam. He still held out hope that Adam would have some hidden talent that would balance out his shortcomings. This is the part of the text where he tolerated the fact that Adam was different than most children his age. Dorris still had not grasped the extent of the damage the drinking Adam's birth mother had caused. Dorris does seem to have a breaking point when he leaves with his wife to a dinner party and the children are left alone. At this point Adam is 19 and he breaks a pipe in his parents' bathroom. He then turns off the light, shuts the bathroom door, and goes to his bedroom. Dorris and his wife come home to find the house flooded. They clean up the mess without saying a word and go to bed. This event is their final defeat at thinking Adam will ever have the independence of living alone.From this point the text takes a turning point where Dorris starts to accept that Adam is the person he is and no amount of love and nurturing can completely erase the effects of FAS. Dorris and his wife find a vocational program where Adam can find employment and living accommodations. Adam works at a bowling alley and Dorris goes to visit Adam on a lunch break. Dorris has partially accepted that Adam's development and choices will not change. On the other hand, as a parent he cannot fight the urge to give unsolicited advice. I do not view his comments on how Adam should eat or take care of himself better as Dorris still in denial. I believe that a parent will always have the insatiable urge to give unsolicited advice no matter what developmental stage their child is at.I would recommend this text to other students with the explanation that this text was written when FAS was very new and when little information was out about FAS. This text gives a good start into what FAS is and what are the effects of FAS. The text also goes into depth the love of a parent for a disabled child so that a future teacher can further understand from what experiences a parent might come from.The strengths of the text include Dorris not sugar coating FAS and his ability to reveal all the ups and downs of Adams life as well as his own. In my personal life, I am looking at becoming a mother and the plain way he has explained the dangers of even occasional drinks during pregnancy have made me scrutinize my old beliefs. I can also empathize with Dorris and Adam's accomplishments and disappointments through the style of writing Dorris employs in his text.The main weakness of the text is that most of the data is outdated. The book was written about 14 years ago. As stated earlier, this text is a good start to understanding FAS. However, this text starts only a foundation to understanding FAS. Further research is needed to fully understand the current techniques for working with a child that suffers from FAS.While reading this text I kept asking myself how I would implement the information given into teaching procedures within my classroom. The main point I kept coming back to was a quote stated, \\"Perhaps the single most important coping skills when working with FAS/FAE is a sense of humor.\\"(p. 347) If a sense of humor is not kept then there is no focus. As an educator or parent, if there is no sense of humor then all sanity is lost. The stress of perfection will put too much pressure on the child as well as the facilitator.My overall impression of this text is one of mixed emotion. At first I thought the text would just contain depressing stories with some insight. I was pleasantly surprised to find myself laughing at certain parts like when Dorris spent a week making the perfect train cake for Adams sixth birthday and the comical fiasco that followed. After reading the text I was intrigued about how Adams future had turned out. I investigated and was saddened to read that Adam was killed at age 23 in a hit and run accident. I was further upset to read that Michael Dorris committed suicide when abuse charges were pending. Real life does not always paint a beautiful picture when we search for truth and hope."},{"Title":"The Broken Cord","review":"This memoir/ public health history is engaging, disturbing and educational. It touched on many things to which I can relate...having a degree in anthropology (as the author does), being a former social worker and currently in school to become Special Ed. teacher I want to give this book to everyone I know who doesn't live in my world and see these things happening around them and to those who do live in my world so we can start a discussion about how to combat this tragedy.I had my own first emotional experience with a young man who, as a social worker, I took a special interest in. After several evaluations and diagnoses nothing added up. Some said depression, others said ADHD; then it became Oppositional Defiant Disorder....After nearly everything was exhausted a Drug Rehab counselor asked him to draw a circle (fine motor skills) and pulled me aside and said he was FAE; It was an aha moment....I realized that many of the clients I had been beating my head against the wall over because nothing helped exhibited many FASD signs...It's not just the small kids with cleft lip....It was interesting hearing Michael Dorris' discussion of the Indian Community and the overwhelming pull of alcohol. I worked at an American Indian Center and had parents and children who regularly drank together; something that I could not fathom and which I was told was \\"an Indian thing.\\" Dorris gives more in depth historical perspective as well as holding people accountable for their individual actions. As a liberal (and anthropologist) I could relate to his hesitance to blame the moms...but it was good to see a mirror held up to myself; the problem exists and we must take personal responsibility and do everything to stop it. I know these kids and it is a tragic life. Read this book!"},{"Title":"The Broken Cord","review":"The book is well written and interesting.You may not want to read further if you want to experience the book as it was intended to be read. It is especially interesting considering that a few years later (in 1991), \\"Adam\\" was hit by a car and killed, Dorris and Erdrich were accused of child abuse by their second son, and the couple divorced in 1995, the same year Dorris entered alcohol treatment. In 1997, Dorris committed suicide."},{"Title":"The Broken Cord","review":"Michael Dorris, a single 26 year old professor of Native American Studies at Dartmouth, decided he wanted to adopt a child by himself, he didn't really know what he was getting himself into in The Broken Cord by Michael Dorris, a book that should be highly recommended to any reader.Through the long hard process of adoption, he finally became a father to a young boy named Adam. Michael was told that Adam had some severe developmental problems due to his FAS (Fetal Alcohol Syndrome) and the abuse and neglect from his biological mother. Michael was aware of these developmental problems; however he seemed to ignore them, or at least think that they would be easily overcome and he would mature like a normal child. However after adopting two more children later, Sava and Madeline, he realized that they developed much faster, and were quickly at the same level as Adam. In the beginning of the book, Michael was in denial. He blamed Adam's developmental issues on unfair tests, a sluggish start, and useless assessments. At one point, he wrote, \\"I periodically concluded that Adam's teachers must be incompetent, badly trained, or lazy when they failed to stimulate his performance in the classroom.\\"(pg 65) Michael learned about determination and unconditional love through his life. It took a lot of work from him, teachers, and other people in the community to help Adam develop slowly.There are many humorous stories, such as the train birthday cake that Michael made for Adam's daycare, which he made using some extremely bold dyes for the icing, and got a call from the owner of the daycare who was very concerned. \\"\`It's when they put the kids to bed,' she said. \`When they took them to the potty. They noticed before they flushed! The water in the toilet bowl was green! Or bright blue! Electric yellow! Orange!'\\" (page 69) Like he mentioned in one part of the book, it is almost necessary when dealing with FAS to have a sense of humor about it.This book is very well written, and contains a lot of history and facts about the Native American culture, as well as about Fetal Alcohol Syndrome and its strain and effects on development. There were also many examples of good literature. \\"My cabin perched on a bank above the beach, high enough so that I seemed entirely surrounded by improbable light, awhirl in the energy of star and sea.\\" (page 3) This passage brings about a taste of the immense imagery and high-quality descriptions found in The Broken Cord.I would recommend this book to anyone interested in another culture, and in learning about FAS. Personally, I didn't know what Fetal Alcohol Syndrome really entailed until I read The Broken Cord. It's full of laughter, love, devotion, and tragedy, a little something for everyone."},{"Title":"The Broken Cord","review":"Thank goodness Michael Dorris wrote this book before we lost him. If you are raising or working with a child with FAS, buy it and read it and read it again. When I first read it, my daughter was 16. Her biological mother was profoundly alcoholic, and died as a result. My daughter has many of the FAS anomalies. Reading The Broken Cord gave me hope--and understanding. And it changed the way I interacted with her. From that point forward--and because she had the world's most patient and dedicated Special Education teacher--my daughter began (finally!) making forward progress. Today she lives in Hawaii and works for a major cruise line. Not bad for an FAS kid! This book still stands as the best book available on FAS children. I recommend it without reservation."},{"Title":"The Broken Cord","review":"Although the author had lots of great information on his FAS child his history and experience as an anthropologist makes the reading difficult. He sometimes spends more time describing the wind or the surroundings than he does talking about his son's issues. Two other books I read on the same subject were riveting and sad in their own way. Michael Dorris' detours made me not want to read the book because paragraphs would go by describing the grass swaying in the wind rather than how he was coping or dealing with his son's terrible affliction. I wish the movie was available for viewing because in this case the summarized cinematic version might be better."},{"Title":"The Broken Cord","review":"I am writing this review as information for other consumers, but not as a critique of the vendor who was responsive to my needs in every way. I would definitely use them again. I ordered the audio cassette of The Broken Cord for my uncle who is legally blind. He said most of the audio was okay but toward the end of the cassette, the audio was distorted and not listenable. Realizing how difficult it is to assure sound quality with old cassette tapes, I won't risk ordering used cassettes again."},{"Title":"The Broken Cord","review":"In my 9th grade English class, we were allowed to choose from six books the book we wanted to read. I chose this book for the sole reason of reading about the actual life of Michael Dorris, and not at all about the Native American inclination to alcoholism or the implications of Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS). As I started reading it, I found it painfully difficult to read the endless chapters of technical terms and Dorris' own interpretation of Native Americans, which turned out to be most of the book. I did find the parts where he described actual events that happened to Adam and him somewhat interesting, but that was the farthest extent to which I enjoyed this book. I was forced to continue reading this book since it was for my English class, but otherwise I would have stopped long before the second half. However, since I had no other option, I chose to be optimistic, thinking that the book couldn't possibly get any worse. It got worse. Especially the part where he interviews the FAS researchers, in which he asked them the exact same questions, and recieved the exact same answers. The final thing that bothered me about this book was Dorris' use of language. Intricate vocabulary and complex sentence structure do, to some extent, make the prose more enjoyable, but his word choice made the book difficult to understand and even more difficult to enjoy. My last statement will be this: All the other reviewers of this book may have enjoyed it because of their interest in FAS, and that was why they enjoyed it so much. So if you're looking for a book about a man and his adopted child, and their relationship, DO NOT READ THIS BOOK. But if you are looking for information on FAS, by all means, disregard this review."},{"Title":"The Broken Cord","review":"I consider this one of the most important books I've ever read (and like you, I've read A LOT of books). It's one of the few books you pick up in a lifetime that change how you see the world. Along with \\"Plagues and Peoples\\" and \\"Guns, Germs and Steel,\\" it's in my permanent Top Three for non-fiction books.No one asks to be born with FAS or other mental disabilities. They don't ask to be harmed in utero, or neglected afterward, either by their parents or by society. Yet they must somehow cope in life, and so must those around them.That we live in the richest country in the world, yet are too selfish to ensure adequate pre- and post-natal care for every child is horrifying, and we all pay the price in the long run."},{"Title":"The Broken Cord","review":"Heartbreaking look at the darker side of what's going on in our country.

Captivating. I had no idea the affects of fetal alchohol syndrome had on these poor chidren that suffer from this thru No fault of their own, Just because their parents drank too much during pregnancy these children have such a hard road ahead of them. The author explains in vivid, honest and grippig detail of what it is like raising a child like this when he didnt find out this is what his child was suffering from until many many years later. A real eye opener. I think every obgyn doctor should make their patients read this book!!!"},{"Title":"The Broken Cord","review":"This is an exquisitely moving book about Michael Dorris and his adopted son, Adam. Adam suffers from fetal alcohol effects and this book documents the family's first hint that something is not right, to their discovery of how wrong things are.Dorris describes the every day relationships, frustrations and triumphs that occur between himself and Adam. He discusses his dealings with schools, psychologists and physicians - the good and the bad. He openly examines the pain of loss- of the Adam who might have been had his birth mother abstained from drinking.The book delivers a poignant plea for abstinence for all pregnant women and Dorris even advocates forced incarceration, if necessary, to guarantee abstinence from alcohol. The book examines the problems of alcoholism specific to American Indian people and ways that this tragedy might be addressed.It is totally readable and mesmerizing. It is a legacy of love, determination and heartbreak."},{"Title":"The Broken Cord","review":"Great account of a parent dealing with a child with Fetal Alcohol Syndrome. The read was light and interesting. Highly recommended for those who want a different perspective on Fetal Alcohol Syndrome."},{"Title":"The Broken Cord","review":"Michael Dorris is and advocate for the poor innocent victims of fetal alcohol effect and fetal alcohol syndrome. In \\"The Broken Cord\\", Michael sets out to inform his readers about this unfortunate condition. Fetal alcohol syndrome and fetal alcohol effect happens to babies when they are still in the womb. Basically, if the biological mother of the child consumes excessive amounts of alcohol while still carrying the baby, it can cause severe disfigurations, as well as a lack of development of the brain. Alcohol affects these children in a different way than a grown person. The Broken Cord shows how great the effects of alcohol can be on these children.Mr. Dorris is a college educator of Native American descent. He is an adoptive father to three children and a biological father to three children, that he has had with his wife, Louise. Michael has personally experienced fetal alcohol syndrome, through his child. One of his adopted children, Adam, has a more severe case of fetal alcohol syndrome. Mr. Dorris really knows how unfair it is for these kids to have to deal with this, when it wasn't even their fault or their choice.Mr. Dorris really does an excellent job of communicating through his many personal stories and statistics, how important it is for people to be informed about fetal alcohol syndrome and fetal alcohol effect. When Michael explains the hardships that he has had to face with his son Adam because of this situation, and when he talks about how Adam will never be able to function normally, it really makes you think about how lucky many of us are.Throughout the book, Michael Dorris clearly explains and informs you about the conditions, while also holding your interest with his touching and accurate stories. These stories assist the understanding of the effects of FAS and FAE, for example, not learning from your mistakes. After reading this book and finding out how fetal alcohol syndrome and fetal alcohol effect affect so many people's lives, it will make you want to learn more about FAS and FAE."},{"Title":"The Broken Cord","review":"This is the story of a man and his adopted son and the devotion Dorris had to his son.

His presence and God-given message was as powerful then - and I believe in much the same way this book is now.He guides the reader through his impressionable years and talks of how he was impacted. He unapologetically explains that his twin brother was not affected in the same way by the same experiences. This was not explored further in the book, but it points out a great psychological truth -- we all develop diferently based on our individual interpretations of the same experiences.Use this book to re-examine your early life and decisions!!"},{"Title":"Thunder Overhead: How a Little Boy Survived Chicago","review":"Through his skillful use of words, Millhuff tells a compelling story that captivates both heart and mind. It allows the reader to connect with the emotional pain of a young child and, as an outcome, to more adequately understand children who are unable to adapt to the rigid systems of their cultural environments. Though only one story, this narrative undoubtedly represents the experiences of many troubled children. Reading this record of Millhuff's perceptions of childhood events gave me new insight about and empathy for these children.This book is recommended reading for my university students who are education majors. I feel that Millhuff's telling account will influence the way teachers view all children and encourage them to strive to meet the needs of each student in caring ways."},{"Title":"Thunder Overhead: How a Little Boy Survived Chicago","review":"I first met Dr Millhuff in 1988 in Hemet, CA during a Revival Meeting.

I loved him in &quot;Evelyn&quot;. I love him as Bond. I've seen and read every interview I've come across, and was looking forward to reading his biography.York Membery's statement that the biography is unofficial and was conducted without the direct support of the actor is probaby the biggest understatement I've seen in a long time. After reading the book for a few pages, I flipped to the acknowledgements, where the National Enquirer, Sun, and many other tabloids were listed as helpful sources of information.Though some parts seem to be true, compared with what Brosnan has said in recent interviews, the majority of it reads like an over-dramatized soap opera. It's not that Pierce's story is bad. His biography, I'm sure, would be immensely interesting to read. However, this book feels like nothing more than a rumor mill of over a hundred pages. Some things that supposedly happened Brosnan has blatantly denied in recent interviews, and this makes me want to take most of what's in it with a grain of salt. Certain suggestions that the book makes seem unreal compared with what has been printed and screened by credible sources, such as Entertainment Tonight.Honestly, I would have loved to have read a biography about my favorite actor. This, however, is not that. The sleazy suggestions the book makes belong more on the cover of a tabloid than in the biography section of a bookstore. The writing is atrocious, and the sources seem only somewhat credible at best. If you're a Brosnan fan, as I am, I would wait for an official bio to come out - or watch something like E!s &quot;Pierce Brosnan Revealed&quot;, which condcted actual interviews with Pierce and his family. Pass on this one. You'll be glad you did."},{"Title":"Becquerel Rays & the Properties of Radium","review":"This marvelous book provides unique insights into the state of physics ca. 1904. The year 1904 marks the middle of a period during which physics underwent a major revolution, comparable to the one engendered by Newton -- or the current revolution in DNA/microbiology. Beginning with Konrad Roentgen's 1895 discovery of x-rays, came an unprecedented streak of discoveries: Becquerel's discovery of radioactivity in uranium ores (1896); J. J. Thomson discovery of the electron (1897); radioactivity of thorium (1898); Curies identify radium and polonium and coin the term \\"radioactivity\\" (1898). In the years following additional discoveries continued to pour in, so that by the nineteen-thirties a fairly clear and consistent picture of the atom and its nucleus had emerged.The amount of knowledge, understanding, and intelligent conjectures contained in this book is truly amazing -- considering that only eight years had elapses since the discovery of radioactivity. For example: alpha, beta, and gamma rays had been identified, and it was recognized that radioactivity transmuted one element into another -- something considered impossible before. Also of great interest is that in 1904 there were already clues that the mass of a particle increases as the speed of light is approached - and this was at least a year before Einstein's celebrated paper. All this is clearly presented in this book.Areas which posed special difficulties to the early pioneers deserve special attention. For example: expecting to find positively charged particles similar in charge-to mass ratio as the electron, the early pioneers failed to recognize the hydrogen nucleus as the basic positive particle (i.e., the proton). (The positron, analogous to the electron, is a rare particle, discovered only much later.) They also had difficulty with why the atomic weights were not always integral multiples of hydrogen. (Thus, chlorine is 37.5, or halfway between two multiples of hydrogen. The element tellurium has a greater atomic weight than iodine, even though it tellurium precedes iodine in the periodic table.) The answer to the riddle, of course, lies with the neutron, and the existence of isotopes. However, the concept of a neutral particle did not come easy, and so it took a number of years to resolve these issues.The style of the book is somewhat along the lines of Scientific American, in that concepts are clearly presented, while math is kept to a minimum. The book is a photocopy of the 1904 editions. Though a small amount of blurring is discernible, it is still fairly easy to read. Since there are no copyrights the cost of the book is kept quite low."},{"Title":"Ghosthunt (Diadem)","review":"With the unusual talent she shows in her other Diadem novels, with the adventure's of Alytys', Jo Clayton has another winner on her hands.

It lacks the spirituality promised in the introduction and is full of sweeping and often inaccurate generalities about quilting. It is also quite judgmental about those who don't finish their quilt projects without exploring the Zen behind that. In fact drawing connections between Zen and quilting seems to have been forgotten after the first chapter. The author talks a lot about her own past projects and making blocks for the book, (which we never see) but not much about other peoples experiences other than to mention names. I wanted their stories and deeper meanings behind their quilting experiences. What we got was superficial, cursory, and unsatisfing. It was clear that insufficient research was done to do the subject justice. I also suspect that Sarah Winchester, if she were still alive, would be quite surprised to find Mrs. Remington (page 180) being given credit for the design of the Winchester Mystery House. As a spritual book it misses the mark, and as a quilting book it's inadequate.

There's even a little bit of history thrown in.Perhaps I didn't pay close enough attention, but I kind of missed a lot of the zen-y bits. And I didn't really learn much about quilting either. I also wasn't all that interested in what Jane Smith or Mary Jones did or what they thought about this and that.

Harrison which Shakespearean neophytes would certainly find vastly illuminating, but which the Bard authorities should avoid.At least two things immediately distinguish Mr Harrison's writing. One is an admirable combination of clarity, conciseness and humour, the other is a vast historical knowledge and erudition. It says a great deal that not only I read all chapters on plays I am not familiar with, something I normally don't do, but I have already forgiven the author quite a few violent disagreements. It takes great writing to achieve that.This is an altogether exceptionally curious book. It has grave faults and great merits, so intertwined that it's difficult to separate them. For the sake of the \\"review\\", let's try something like that.Among the chief drawbacks, oddly enough, is Mr Harrison's general attitude. From the very beginning he makes it clear that his book is a reaction against the rigidly philosophical and moralistic point of view expressed by Andrew Cecil Bradley is his fabled lectures on Will's \\"Big Four\\", first published in 1904. However, though he may not be a philosopher, Mr Harrison is certainly a moralist. To my mind this is a serious limitation when dealing with a writer who encompassed in his works so wide a range of humanity as Shakespeare certainly did. And yet, somehow the author gets away with it.In the very first chapter, Mr Harrison suggests that one of the four essential qualities of the tragic dramatist is a \\"profound moral sense\\", which in other words means \\"the ability to appreciate the essential meaning of an event\\", or if you prefer Virgil's untranslatable original: \\"Sunt lacrimae rerur et mentem mortalia tangunt\\". It may well be true that Shakespeare had this quality in much higher degree than any of his contemporaries, including Ben Jonson, Kyd and Marlowe, but I am inclined to believe that this condition leads Mr Harrison to certain oversimplification of characters and underestimation of plays.According to Mr Harrison the second quality of the tragic dramatist is what Virgil called \\"mortalia\\", that is \\"the ability to feel the pathos in human suffering\\". The last two conditions - superb technique and an essentially tragic story in itself - are more objective, yet even here opinions can differ greatly. The author's criteria are so severe, that he finally declares, having weighed arguments for and against with an almost scientific imitation of impartiality, that only two of those eleven tragedies - Othello and King Lear - are real \\"deep tragedies\\", that is works through the experience of which the \\"emotions are purged\\" and one experiences what Aristotle has described with the stunningly accurate word \\"catharsis\\".The marvelous directness of Mr Harrison's writing has the disadvantage that he often sounds presumptuous, high-handed and even downright dogmatic. I guess this can't be helped. In any case it's much better than the vague and obscure writing of modern scholars that passes for \\"objective\\"; indeed, one can almost assume that nowadays vagueness and obscurity are regarded as virtues. Whatever his faults may be, Mr Harrison is always perfectly honest with his readers. This certainly includes his most negative comments, all of them expressed with superb bluntness.Certainly, the author's irreverence, though a fine antidote to moronic Bard worship, is at once amusing and exasperating. Never one to mince words, Mr Harrison considers Macbeth \\"extravagantly over-praised\\" and Romeo and Juliet \\"pathetic rather than moving\\". Hamlet is \\"the most fascinating and interesting play in the English language\\", but Shakespeare also used it as \\"a vessel into which to pour his thoughts on all kinds of matters which have very little to do with the action of the play.\\" Antony and Cleopatra, despite being \\"the most magnificent of all Shakespeare's plays\\", deals with the essentially un-tragic story of \\"a man who throws his wealth into the lap of a harlot and then kills himself\\", and so on and so forth.Last but perhaps not least, a fairly serious drawback is that all chapters - essays, really, as they are entirely self-sufficient - dedicated to separate plays contain synopses of the plots. Now this is wrong from every point of view: experienced readers don't need it, newcomers should avoid it. Yet, of course, there is a counterbalancing virtue as well. Mr Harrison's retelling of the plots is not just dry listing of facts. It is highly selective, omitting countless details, and it makes a number of provocative observations about the characters along the way.So one should be on one's guard when reading about plays one is not yet familiar with. Mr Harrison may well be highly illuminating about characters you are already intimately familiar with. But he may well spoil your full appreciation of characters you don't yet have a primary knowledge of. Please note that here words like \\"spoilers\\" and \\"spoiling\\" are used in the sense of any prior knowledge of certain work, especially one which is intensely subjective and personal as Mr Harrison's assuredly is. Spoilers in terms of mere plot details, with Shakespeare as with any other great writer, of course don't matter at all.Despite all these so-called \\"faults\\", the book is tremendously entertaining and magnificently stimulating. It rewards re-reading. Mr Harrison's opening essay alone is worth the price of admission. It's a sheer masterpiece of immense scope. It stirs the mind on countless levels.To begin with, his is a curiously ambiguous yet compelling method. It is as scientific as it is possible for something which is so appallingly subjective. Yet it is based on intangible emotional qualities that can neither be defined in words nor expressed verbally in any way.Perhaps a fanciful comparison would illustrate better why I find Mr Harrison's style to be among the most endearing I have so far encountered in literary criticism. Your modern Shakespearean scholar would say something like this: \\"Now, this is the Bard's back garden. It's small and nice and quiet. This is the place of our in-depth research. So get your teaspoons and let's disturb the surface of the soil. Gently. Gently!\\" Mr Harrison, in a complete contrast, would say something as brutal as that: \\"Here is a spade. It's a spade, isn't it? So grip it and start digging, the deeper the better. The whole place is ours and by Jove, I don't want to see a stone unturned.\\"First of all, Mr Harrison sets the stage. What exactly does \\"Shakespearean tragedy\\" mean? That is the question, and not a very easy one.The adjective \\"Shakespearean\\" is discussed in great detail. This means a lot more than merely \\"written by Shakespeare\\". It also means written in a certain historical period, some four centuries apart from ours and therefore profoundly different. The modern Shakespearean scholar has the obligation to study this period in the greatest possible detail and then relate it to the Bard. This is wise. Shakespeare is often so ludicrously extolled, that people seem to think he lived in a vacuum. Only he didn't. As a matter of fact, if his plays are anything to go by, he was very much a man of his own time, sharing all knowledge and all prejudices of his contemporaries.Let Mr Harrison himself explain the huge burden that weighs on the shoulders of the modern Elizabethan scholar. He does so in a superbly punctuated prose that is all but Shakespearean in its compulsive rhythm and accumulative power. A lengthy quotation is fully justified:Nothing, indeed, is irrelevant for the Shakespearean scholar, who must take all Elizabethan knowledge as his particular field. He is thus concerned with Shakespeare himself, his family and their affairs, with Stratford-on-Avon, its church, school, Corporation, town records, tithes, tillage and taxes; with the Players' Companies and their patrons and playhouses, and their styles of acting; with clowns and tragic actors and their families and lawsuits; and, therefore, with Court's of the King's Bench, Chancery and Star Chamber; with depositions, examinations, judgements, wills, probates, fines, recognisances and recoveries; with Ecclesiastical Courts, pedigrees, visitations; with heralds of all kinds, shapes and colours; with funeral monuments, parish registers, historical collections; with national, aristocratic, civic records; with current events and national events; with Queens, Kings and nobles, knights and gentlemen; with chronicles, diaries, letters, and Acts of the Privy Council, debates in the Parliament; with every kind of printed or written word, works of divinity, science, philosophy, theology, history, political science, geography, venery, toxophily, military science, music and gardening; with translations and romances, poems of all kinds, almanacs, news-pamphlets, sermons by the hundred, sonnets, songs and song books; with volumes of learned publications, articles and journals, notes and queries, theses and bibliographies; with stationers and booksellers, censors, registers, entries, dedications and epistles, first editions and second editions, piracies and cancels, imprints, signatures and gatherings, forgeries and water marks; and so ultimately with the materials of writing, with paper made of rags, parchment which is the inner skin of a sheep, ink formerly made of gal, and finally with quill pens provided by the goose. Small wonder if sometimes the researcher is overwhelmed beneath his material or that some Shakespearean scholars should know everything about the problems and nothing about the plays. The connotations of the word Shakespearean are indeed endless.Mr Harrison must have felt more at home in Elizabethan times than in the twentieth century. The above passage is no mere show-off: it is reflected in his writing. I am awed by his stupendous knowledge of the period. He seems to know intimately the works of totally forgotten writers as well as the everyday life in minute detail - at least as far it can be known. The Elizabethan outlook, spiritual climate, and every significant event - artistic, religious, royal - that affected this strange society seem to have no secrets for him. All this makes his historical background unusually illuminating in a myriad of different ways.Take King Lear for instance. Whether Shakespeare expressed his own deep pessimism is this dark play we have no way of knowing. But he certainly expressed the pessimism of his own time. Mr Harrison supplies an impressive list of facts. To begin with, on 24th March 1603 Queen Elizabeth died. The expected chaos didn't ensue in the following years, but there was a noticeable degeneration of the court morality under King James. On the same year a most violent Plague (not my capital) broke in London, taking the lives of some 30 000 people. Today it's impossible to imagine the terror of such epidemics, the profound psychological effect they had on people's superstitious minds. The year 1605 even was called the \\"Black Year\\" which culminated in the discovery of the great Gunpowder Plot on November 5th, another massive shock for the Elizabethan court.The Elizabethans were simple-minded enough to equate the condition of their own society with the universe, so they naturally concluded that the latter is meaningless. The funny thing is that they were completely right by sheer intuition, with no help from any science. Perhaps Mr Harrison has a more important point than it seems at first glance when he appeals for \\"a humane rather than a scientific outlook on life\\".When he compares Shakespeare to his contemporaries in terms of such elusive qualities as \\"moral sense\\" and \\"the ability to feel the pathos in human suffering\\", Mr Harrison's rock solid historical knowledge comes very handy indeed. All this is frightfully subjective yet irresistibly quotable. Also, it demonstrates the author's almost raffish sense of humour:This moral sense - the ability to appreciate the essential meaning of an event - is part of Shakespeare's universality, and it is one of the qualities so conspicuously lacking in his contemporaries. Ben Jonson, for all his cant of being the castigator of vice and folly, lacked true moral sense because he had no eye for goodness. [...] Nor were Beaumont or Fletcher, or Webster, more successful. In spite of their exquisite technical skill, these men never achieved purgation, though their dramas are full of that conflict which Bradley demanded as the essence of tragedy, because the conflict was the struggle of wits, not of principles... [...] Nor did Beaumont or Fletcher have much more moral feeling for their long-suffering, misunderstood young women or their clean-limbed but misunderstanding young men. At one of the tensest moments in The Maid's Tragedy, when Evadne is about to murder the King, her wronger, she cries out: \\"O, the conscience of a lost virgin.\\" One can see Francis nodding approval to John at a very effective line; but neither of them, one suspects, was deeply moved or horrified at the nature or the circumstances of Evadne's loss. It was not so with Shakespeare, though his sense of morality was not necessarily that of the superintendent of a Sunday-school. Nor does he intentionally set out to moralize, or to teach any lesson of conduct or system of behaviour.[...]The second quality is a sense of what Virgil called mortalia, the ability to feel the pathos in human suffering. This is essentially a civilized quality, a humane rather than a scientific outlook on life. Shakespeare possessed it abundantly.[...]Naturally, this sense of human pathos is not confined to Shakespeare. It pervades the tragedies of the great Greek masters, especially Sophocles and Euripides. In a lesser extent it is apparent in Marlowe's greatest tragedies, Tamburlane and Doctor Faustus, for we can, though far more dimply, see our own ambitions reflected in these supermen. [...] Professors, it is true, do not often solemnly conjure up the Devil in smoke and sulphur, but we welcome him very warmly when he comes in guise of a publisher with a fat contract for a college text-book or a Government official with a subsidized request for research into the destructive power of atomic energy.It should be stressed that, as alluded above in the passage about the lack of deliberate moralizing, Mr Harrison never claims that Shakespeare consciously set out to embody in his tragedies Virgil's dictum. Surely he didn't. The process must have been instinctive and completely unconscious. Still, I remain convinced that Mr Harrison's notions of \\"moral sense\\" and \\"purgation\\" are a trifle narrow-minded outlook that doesn't always serve him well in his critical analyses. But if you ask what arguments I have against it, I would be forced to confess that I have none. It's a just a gut feeling, floating somewhere between the conscious and unconscious, essentially and completely non-verbal. As for Mr Harrison's outlook, it's obviously part and parcel of the man. One has to take it or leave it.One of the main aspects of Mr Harrison's point of view is that Shakespeare's plays must be experienced live in the theatre, preferably an intimate Elizabethan affair. This is another reaction against Bradley's intensely introverted approach - it's quite safe to assume that never did it pass through Andrew's head that Shakespeare wrote drama at all; he wrote only philosophical treatises - and it may explain why Mr Harrison spends considerable amount of space on plot descriptions. He simply wants to show that Othello, Hamlet, Macbeth, Romeo and Juliet - in fact, all of the Shakespeare's plays - are not just great poetry and sharply revealed characters. They are exciting theatre, too.In the end of \\"Shakespearean Tragedy\\", among many other fascinating details (such as a fine tribute to the generally underestimated Shakespearean audience), Mr Harrison makes a fine case that the plays, though written for the stage, can be appreciated on paper as well. This is where the role of the critic lies. Mr Harrison's description of the five types of Shakespearean critics is hilarious enough - and serious enough - to merit extended quotation. These paragraphs should be on the desk, or at least on the desktop, of every person who considers career as a literary critic:There are five distinct types of these Shakespearean critics. The first and most numerous but least important are the pedantic critics, if indeed we may term them critics at all. Their work appears in learned journals and is usually concerned with minute, unprofitable speculations worthy of their predecessors, the Schoolmen.[...]The second kind is the puzzled critic, sometimes regarded as modern. In this age of breakdown of certain forms of religious fate, many estimable persons, who sixty years ago would naturally have become ministers of religion and preachers, to-day become Professors of English. In their bewilderment they try to work out their own philosophy of life through the interpretation of literature, especially Shakespeare. In much of the modern study of Shakespeare's imagery and symbolism, or Shakespeare and the World Pattern, or Shakespeare and the Heritage of Thomist Philosophy, the writer is far less concerned with Shakespeare than with his own soul. Such studies are not always of great value in interpretation of Shakespeare's plays, but they should be intensely interesting to the psychologist.The third type is the thwarted critic, the man who has very little to say out of his own mind but must make his noise in the world of letters by belabouring his neighbours, usually in strident reviews.Then there is the ingenious critic, intent on displaying his cleverness by proving that nothing that was so is so, and if only he could have been present in the printing house at the setting of Shakespeare's manuscript, he could have told the Elizabethan printer a thing or two about scientific bibliography.Finally, there is the curious critic who speculates on such mysteries as the parentage of the Dark Lady of the Sonnets. All these have their place in the picture, even if it be not always a very profitable place.One is right to wonder if there is any use of critics in the first place, and if yes, is it possible for such personalities to exist at all? The answer, of course, is \\"yes\\". Having delivered the retribution, Mr Harrison turns to the justification of critics in general and Shakespearean ones in particular. Perhaps it is not too cynical to suppose that the author puts himself in this delightful category which he calls \\"vocal readers\\". He finishes in a rather subdued manner, but from my personal experience I can guarantee that his modest expectations about the value of this book have been completely surpassed:The best critics in the English language belong usually to one of two kinds: philosophers or vocal readers. The philosopher sees all literary art as part of a universal pattern, and he relates the individual work to the general scheme. Few of the greatest English critics are, as a matter of fact or history, aesthetic philosophers of this kind. The vocal reader is indeed more entertaining. He is a man of the world and of books, who reads with gusto, expands on his enthusiasm and justifies his prejudices. We read him for his own sake than for his judgements which do not always add very much to our understanding or to our sensibilities, but we are glad to be in his good company; for he reminds us that great literature is a comment on life, and not dead matter to be anatomized and dissected by specialists.The Shakespearean critic of to-day needs certain equipment. In the first place he must be something of a scholar. Shakespeare's greatest work was of all time, but not all of it. Many of his essential notions have ceased to be valid, so that the central, fundamental ideas even of some of the greatest tragedies have no longer the same significance. [...] It is the critic's first business to make his reader aware of such changes in feeling and ideas, especially where they are fundamental to understanding.Then the critic must be a student of drama and a playgoer. Until he has seen a play acted, preferably in a variety of styles, he is handicapped in his judgements as if one had to judge the effect of a frock from the peg and not on the person. [...] He must also be a man with some knowledge of the world. Too many Shakespearean critics have been recluses and mere book men. The critic must know enough of life in its variety to be able to appreciate Shakespeare not only as an Elizabethan but as a man.Few possess this abundance of gifts. One man in our own day had it superlatively - Harley Granville-Barker, whose death in August, 1946, was an irreparable loss to English drama and English letters, was himself actor, producer, scholar, critic and man of the world, one moreover who knew how to lecture and how to write. [...] An hour in his company taught one more of Shakespeare than a year's reading. But Granville-Barker's powers as a critic did not long endure. As he grew older he became more and more critical of himself and less willing to commit finally to paper his own fine thoughts. To my generation the best of his work creates that kind of despair which an earlier generation felt when they first read Bradley. Indeed, I should perhaps make apology for venturing to discuss this topic at all. Nevertheless, when one has studied and taught a subject for a quarter of a century, there comes a time when one feels an attempt may be made to put out one's own views, in the hope that a little of the enthusiasm be passed on, perhaps even that something fresh may be added.Having thus defined the basic terms \\"Shakespearean\\" and \\"tragedy\\", as well as the critic's responsibilities, Mr Harrison embarks on a lively, fresh, pertinent and sharply provocative journey through Shakespeare's eleven tragedies. Despite a number of fierce disagreements, I am never angry with Mr Harrison, and that's saying a great deal. Even more telling is the fact that I actually profited, in one way or another, from each of these eleven essays, however much I may deplore some of the conclusions in them.For example, I do consider both Hamlet and Macbeth to be \\"deep tragedies\\" in every sense of the phrase - so, for that matter, is Romeo and Juliet. About the latter Mr Harrison launches the well-known, and much echoed since (by T. J. B. Spencer in the New Penguin Shakespeare, for instance), theory that it's a weak tragedy because too much in it happens by pure chance:If only Romeo had not been a Montague, if Tybalt had not met Mercutio at the wrong moment, if old Capulet had kept his temper with Juliet, if Friar John had delivered the letter, if Friar Laurence had reached the tomb five minutes earlier, then all would have been well. As it is, at every critical moment something goes wrong by unlucky accident; and it is mainly for this reason that Romeo and Juliet never achieves deep tragedy. For the disaster in the play is caused not so much by some moral issue but by sheer bad luck.Well, two can play at that game. Quite a few flaws in the characters can also be regarded as instrumental in the tragic outcome: if Friar Laurence hadn't been a romantic fool, if Juliet's mind hadn't been poisoned by her demented cousin with nonsense about the feud, if Mercutio had been a tad less mercurial and more capable of taking a joke at his expense. All these flaws are not accidental: they are inherent in the characters. So is the Capulet's brutish behavior mentioned by Mr Harrison. In short, the lovers are so much \\"star-crossed\\" as they are \\"stupidity-crossed\\". Human folly may not be the most exalted subject of tragedy, but it is nonetheless relevant for that.The author seems to have recognized, if not developed, this idea. He mentions casually that Shakespeare, rather unusually for him, was working out a specific theme, namely the possible role of family feuds as generators of tragedy. Even though Mr Harrison is not moved by the \\"pathetic rather than tragic\\" death of Romeo and Juliet, he praises highly the characterization - just consider the marked individuality of the vastly different main male characters: Romeo, Mercutio, Benvolio, Tybalt - and he remains convinced that it's a \\"superb play\\", always effective in performance. However, his best shot is concerned with the plays's - arguably - tremendous historical importance; consider this absorbing opening paragraph:One of the hardest feats of the critical imagination is to realize a time when the great masterpieces of English literature were still unborn. Shakespeare wrote Romeo and Juliet about 1594; at that date few plays produced on the public stages were in print and of these only Tamburlane, Edward II and The Spanish Tragedy can be called, even in excess of charity, great drama. Romeo and Juliet at its first performance was by far the best tragedy for the stage that had yet been produced in the English language. Nor is it too fanciful to suggest that more than any other single play Romeo and Juliet was responsible for the sudden flowering of English drama in the last decade of the sixteenth century and the first of the seventeenth. It has little of the magnificent orotundity of Tamburlane. It never touches the sublime moments of Doctor Faustus, nor does it reach down to the level of deep tragedy; but for variety and sustained interest, for skillful characterization and technical competence, it was an object lesson for all playwrights. Romeo and Juliet was certainly a sensation when it first appeared, and it showed young gentlemen with a taste for poetry and drama vistas they had never before realized. Moreover, it coincided with the sudden vogue for sonneteering, which was so fashionable in the early 1590's.Now this is a stirring passage! Mr Harrison's discussion of Hamlet also starts with compelling opening paragraph about the ludicrous amount of prejudice that's part and parcel of the play and how, therefore, it's virtually impossible to appreciate it with an open mind. Well, he does - and he all but reduces a mighty tragedy to an ordinary revenge play. He has many perceptive things to say about revenge dramas per se, and it should never be forgotten that this is most probably how Hamlet began its life. But then Shakespeare apparently got carried away with the plot and especially with the main character, finally producing an ever-fascinating, if ever-perplexing, masterpiece that transcends completely the shallow conventions of revenge plays. Yet Mr Harrison seems to be largely unaware of this:...some of the more famous of the set speeches are comments on general problems which neither help the plot nor greatly add to the characterization: the long speech on drunkenness in I, iv, Hamlet's thoughts on suicide, on men and the universe, on fate, on the behavior of spirits, on flattery and sincerity, on the handwriting of statements... [...] No one would wish to cut these speeches away; they are Shakespeare himself unloading his thoughts at a time when he and every thinking man of his generation is passing through a period of profound disillusion and pessimism...Well, this certainly puts Hamlet in his place: a perfectly commonplace revenge hero. The estimation is preposterous. The play does contain some superfluous speeches, including some of Hamlet's own, but none of the above-listed is among them. They are all essential for the building of his character as a curiously introverted, almost pathologically cerebral individual. To put it mildly, Mr Harrison has completely missed the point of the whole play.It is no wonder that the author would also be highly unconvincing when he tries to explain Hamlet's inability to kill his uncle in the famous scene when the king is praying for his sins. Mr Harrison tries to get away with the most commonplace explanation: the religious one. This makes sense only if we accept that Hamlet is a fervent believer himself. Of course this is nonsense; \\"To be, or not to be\\" is enough to refute it. Then again, there is a strong religious streak in Mr Harrison's background - he was married to a clergymen's daughter and had strong connections with the Church of England, later in his life with the Catholic church too - and it is reasonable to suppose that in this case his religious background led him astray. Eager to surpass himself in the realms of the nonsensical, after quoting Fortinbras' final speech, Mr Harrison observes:The last thought on Hamlet, thrice stressed, is that he was a soldier; and the soldierly virtues are courage, intelligence, resolution, quick determination, ruthlessness. Hamlet was endowed with them all.This is sheer claptrap; inanity par excellence. What the heck does Fortinbras know about Hamlet? The Norwegian hero has barely appeared on the stage or been mentioned. We, the audience, have spent four hours watching this play. At least half of this time we have been inside Hamlet's head and have experienced the intricacies of his mind with an unprecedented degree of intimacy. Certainly, we know him far better than Fortinbras does. And we are dead positive that Hamlet possessed none of the soldier's \\"virtues\\" listed by Mr Harrison. If he did, there would be no play.King Lear is the one essay where Mr Harrison is not just consistently compelling, as always, but uncommonly convincing as well. The enormously complicated plot is dissected with consummate skill and rare lucidity; none of the large and varied cast is neglected or misrepresented. After reading such an essay one really comes out with a brand new admiration for Shakespeare as an outstanding craftsman. This is a part of his genius that seldom receives its due. As for the relentlessly bleak and depressing pessimism that pervades the play, Mr Harrisons offers a striking parallel with the (then recent) history of the twentieth century:It is as well to face the moral implications of this tragedy squarely and honestly. The lesson, motive and motto of Lear is contained in Gloucester's words:As flies to wanton boys are we to the gods:They kills us for their sport.Indeed, Lear was written by a man who had seen a vision of absolute evil such as was given to those who sat through the Nuremberg trials, or who first entered Dachau or Belsen in 1945 - a world in which good, however pure and refined, is futile and overwhelmed by evil, in which man, the paragon of animals, has become a savage, a vicious beast. Moreover, the pessimism is in Shakespeare himself and not in the story of Lear.Admittedly, Mr Harrison's inflexible moralism can on occasion produce commendable results. Now, to be sure this passage is rife with dangers and contradictions. It borders on the far-fetched and on the rhetorical, both potentially harmful tendencies, and the claim about Shakespeare's own pessimism is impossible to confirm, although it does fit nicely with the zeitgeist. All the same, it is such passages that make this book worth reading. And there are quite a few of them.There are countless such moments in this book that call for comment. Atmospheric descriptions of scenes, insightful observations on characters, enlightening historical background, enraging nonsense on all three counts, whatever you like: there is everything. I expect this will be one of the more often re-read books as my familiarity with the Shakespearean canon slowly grows in the future.Much as I obviously adore G. B. Harrison's Shakespeare's Tragedies, I cannot honestly advise you to buy a new copy. The book is currently in print as one of the so-called Routledge Library Editions, but it is offered on Amazon for something like 150 euros or $220. Such prices are slightly outrageous. Fortunately for all passionate newcomers to Shakespeare, second-hand copies are widely available. They aren't cheap either, yet prices like $26 or 44 euros do sound fairly reasonable. But I suggest you skip the greedy fellows on Amazon. Abebooks offers very nice copies for still twice lower prices. Now that's a steal!

But what if the world is meant to stay the way it is?

His father is mentally retarded and his mother is often sickly and thinks she might die. His father and mother are like children when they are together. JP's grandmother is the one who holds the family together, and the four of them live together in a happy home.Then JP's grandmother dies unexpectedly when he is fifteen, and the safety of his world shatters. Without his grandmother there for stability, things deteriorate into chaos. JP, who thrives on routine and the expected, is more and more uncomfortable every day.Things get worse. JP's mother is spending a great deal of time with the doctor who treated her the most recent time she was in the hospital, and JP is convinced they are having an affair. When JP's mother wins an old farmhouse in an essay contest, she uproots JP and his father and the three of them move in. But they aren't the only ones to move there. Bobbi, a neighbor of theirs whose father beats her, joins them. There are few people JP hates worse than Bobbi. One of those people he hates worse, though, may just be his friend Tim's older brother Larry, a former drug addict whose family doesn't speak to him anymore. JP's mother also has Larry move in with them.Soon the entire house is filled with weird people, who disrupt JP's routine and borrow his things without asking. He can't stand this life and can't stand the way he feels about everything. But is there any way for him to fit in with this new family?I liked all of the different characters in this book and the ways JP found to relate to them. I also liked how the emphasis of the story was entirely on JP's home life, and his school life wasn't discussed at all.I thought JP's mother was incredibly insensitive. I couldn't believe she didn't see something was wrong with her son and didn't make an effort to make him more comfortable in his own home."},{"Title":"A Face in Every Window","review":"Even though JP is bitter about everything his mom did, he learns to accept it in the end, which leaves you with a warm feeling.

They fit closely (Tidyman wrote the book and the movie screenplay), but there are a few differences. Shaft is a good character, with his own ideals and views of life. He's not quite as hard-boiled as other private investigators (Mike Hammer, Jack Hagee to name a few), but he has his moments.This book is a good read if you are a fan of mysteries, but especially if you like the private eye genre, then it's essential. Tidyman's description rivals other great authors of the genre, his dialoge reminds me of Elmore Leonard at times.The only thing that doesn't give this book the fifth star is that it has too many slow moments, and takes a while for the book to get going."},{"Title":"Shaft","review":"I approached this novel after viewings of the 1971 film. I still was lost, as Ernest Tidyman's writing - for this novel, at least - goes in and out of inner monologues without any notification who is actually doing the monologue. Also, the plot isn't really clear: Shaft is supposed to find the daughter of a Harlem mobster (here named Knocks Parsons, differing from his movie counterpart in name and physical stature) but there is also the matter of gangland wars occurring, and black revolutionaries being involved in the matter. It seems like Italian mobsters want Harlem and have kidnapped Knock's daughter to blackmail him into handing over his turf and they are doing this by framing or inciting war with black revolutionaries, and eventually Shaft asks Buford and Knocks to create a riot in a predominantly white neighborhood in order to save the daughter. It's confusing. Too, I think the movie was more credible in handling the daughter's rescue, since it is a straight-forward rescue.Shaft seems to be impulsive in this novel, and not a clear thinker. For example, he kills a mobster in cold blood who is supposedly leading him to the kidnapped girl. However, based on the described circumstances, Shaft doesn't know what is behind the door at the location the mobster led him to, and killing said mobster seems to kill his lead to the girl.As for the love interests, there are two Shaft girls in this novel: Ellie and Valerie. Ellie is arguably Caucasian here in the novel based on the description of blue-grey eyes and pale, white flesh, but \\"black\\" in the film; of course, she could be biracial, but Tidyman doesn't give any evidence of this. Valerie is a girl Shaft meets at his usual hangout, the No Name Bar; in the film she was named \\"Linda,\\" I believe.Overall, a passable introduction to the John Shaft character, but there are stronger books featuring the character that followed."},{"Title":"Shaft","review":"this book was quite possible the best book i have ever read, keeping in mind i have read all of the works by shakespeare and faulkner and hemmingway.

This book is a superb tome on the right to dissent from being governed.I am sure those with an interest in political philosophy will enjoy this quick and thought provoking read."},{"Title":"Civil disobedience","review":"Henry David Thoreau's \\"Resistance to Civil Government\\" - or \\"Civil Disobedience,\\" as it became known - is an essential part of American literature, culture, and history. Even more remarkably, it is undeniable proof that great literature can have a real effect on the world even long after it is written and ignored. The essay is world famous as the founding text of civil disobedience, i.e., non-violent protest, and its effect on such luminaries as Mohandas Gandhi and Martin Luther King was profound, thus sealing its immortality. This alone makes it essential for all.However, it is easy to forget that the essay is a masterpiece in itself. Essentially Thoreau's highly individual expression of his mentor Emerson's self-reliance doctrine applied to government, it has a wealth of depth and nuance despite its brevity. The words are few but the implications endless; it has enough food for proverbial thought to last a lifetime. The gist is very clear, but the implications have spoken very differently to many different people. The work's nature - and Thoreau's generally - is such that it and he are championed by everyone from neocons to libertarians to liberals, and the truly notable thing is that all are justified. This underscores the importance of reading the essay for ourselves.Its main query is \\"What does the individual owe the state?,\\" the answer being a resounding \\"Nothing.\\" Thoreau takes the maxim that the government that governs least governs best to its logical conclusion by wishing for one that governs not at all - a brave wish very few have seriously dared to make or even conceive. He makes a highly principled stand for individual rights and autonomy, arguing very persuasively that people should be able to go about their business without interference. This of course sounds very much like current libertarians, and their position has indeed hardly ever been better argued. Many related and implied issues - protests against taxation, conscription, etc. - also seem to support them. However, it is important to remember that the essay's crux and most famous section - Thoreau's account of a night spent in jail for refusing to pay a poll tax because he did not want to support war or slavery - was and is immensely liberal. Few issues can be more central to current liberalism than an anti-war stance, and slavery was the era's great liberal cause. All this must be kept firmly in mind amid the many attempts to reduce Thoreau to a current party platform. He was at once too simple and too complex for this and would not have suffered himself to be thus reduced; nor does the essay justify it.Integral as all this is, the work's core point is arguably a new self-reliance argument above and beyond immediate practical considerations. Thoreau certainly had a practical, political streak, especially compared to relative idealists like Emerson, but he thought individuality more sacred than anything. He articulated this more fully elsewhere, but it is very present here. His work is thus in many ways the best kind of self-help material - and, unlike the mass of current self-help tripe littering bookshelves, is intellectually and even aesthetically pleasing. Thoreau was the most thoroughly local writer that can be imagined, but his willingness to look deep inside himself for the eternal truths present in all people has made him an inspiration to millions and millions of people from across the political spectrum and indeed the world. This essay is a major part of his legacy and thus one of the very few works that literally everyone should read. Few can be the same afterward, and it will change many lives; it is nothing less than one of the most important documents ever written, and its value simply cannot be exaggerated. It is an excellent primer for those new to Thoreau, and those who have not already done so should open their minds to him immediately - and once done, they will never be closed again."},{"Title":"Civil disobedience","review":"Here is a fiery and direct book or rather, a long essay. They should certainly be teaching this in high school civics classes (as soon as they restore the practice of teaching civics in public school.)Thoreau wrote this in opposition to slavery and the Mexican War but it is full of parallels and lessons for us today. Most especially useful and relevant is his tracing of the responsibility, that those who vote, share for the atrocities committed by those they vote for.If you vote in a corrupt society, Thoreau makes you a murderer, a rapist, a thief. I could not agree more and was happy to find this herein. He does not simply advocate a boycotting of the vote, however, but calls for the revolutionary overthrow of corrupt society, through the direct action and resistance of those who are just.There is no \\"lesser evil\\" or middle ground in Thoreau's worldview. You are just, and you are actively working to overthrow the system, or you are evil.I cannot recommend this book enough. It will take you only a few hours to read it and it will embed itself in the foundations of your political reasoning.Though the Anarchists claim Thoreau, I think he would have favored Marx to Bakunin."},{"Title":"Civil disobedience","review":"Revisiting this classic is increasingly important as political unrest and coups appear world-wide. The straight-forward dissertations, while HDT wrote them during another policital-cultural environment, give some insight into what drives those who orchestrate take-overs, toppling governments, imposition of regulation, and the list goes on. Much is to be learned from these 27 pages. Civil Disobedience is not a quick read when one contemplates contemporary application; that aside, the message offers challenge, concentration, consideration. Revisiting CD is worth the time! Amazon's electronic transmission is instant!"},{"Title":"Civil disobedience","review":"In Civil Disobedience, first published in 1849, Henry David Thoreau asserts that when a government acts in a way contrary to the conscience of one of its individual subjects, that individual has a duty to deny any allegiance to that government by ceasing to pay taxes and refusing to obey unjust laws. While Thoreau was focused on the issues of slavery and the Mexican-American War, much of the rhetoric in Civil Disobedience is broad enough that it can be used as an inspirational rallying cry for dissenters of every stripe, from anarchists to Tea Partiers. By today's standards, Thoreau's own political thought was a fiercely individualistic mix of liberalism and libertarianism. He was a staunch pacifist, anti-military, and critical of the judicial and penal systems, yet he was also against big government, trade regulation, and taxation. In Thoreau's view, all governments are inherently corrupt. Just because democracy is based on majority rule doesn't make it any less corrupt, because the approval of the majority is no guarantee of justice and right. Instead of waiting for their government to become just, citizens should behave justly, even if that means breaking the law.Civil Disobedience amounts to about thirty pages in printed form, and takes about an hour to read, depending on how much time you want to spend dissecting Thoreau's antiquated grammar and syntax. From the perspective of the language alone, this is a more difficult, less accessible read than his best-known work, Walden. More effort is required to decipher Thoreau's prose in order to extract the kernel of his message. The Kindle file that's available for free on Amazon was created by Project Gutenberg. The text was typed rather than scanned, but doesn't seem to have been proofread, as it still contains several typographical errors. The file includes only the text of Thoreau's essay, with no introduction or notes. In this case, notes can be helpful in clarifying some of Thoreau's historical references, so a well-edited paperback edition may provide a more helpful reading experience for first-time readers. For those familiar with Thoreau and this great work, however, a digital, highlightable copy makes for a welcome addition to your portable e-book library."},{"Title":"Civil disobedience","review":"This book is a classic.

I believe we as citizens should be given the choice of which taxes to support and which to not have to pay. Case in point I pay property taxes through the money that I give to my landlord for the schools in my area but yet I have no children those in a community should be given the option to say no to a portion of their property taxes if they do not have children in school and also those that chose to send their children to private school should be given the same option.

So keep in mind that this was written in the mid 19th century, still years before the emancipation proclamation, a very young nation still. Having said that, let us take a quick look at some of Thoreau's ideas. Most of his relevant subject matter was in regards to slavery, the war in Mexico, and American Imperialism in general. Thoreau felt a moral obligation to stop such things which he deemed unworthy, and being a citizen he felt it was his duty to make a stand in the name of all citizens. The idea was that if you were a just citizen being controlled by an unjust government, then it would be better to go to jail than to pay that government taxes, which it would in turn use to kill people in Mexico or support slavery with. He knew that a single man would not bring much change and it certainly seems that his broader goal was to influence, with his writings and speeches, others to do the same as him, with enough people resisting, the government would lose strength. And as he famously wrote, \\"That government is best which governs least.\\".In retrospect I think his ideas might have been too aggressive for a nation such as ours. He seems to always be looking for a path to revolution instead of putting trust in evolution. The republic did free the slaves a few years after he wrote this paper, and it was of course the very government which he distrusted that made that happen. I could see his ideas being quite effective in certain situations and in certain locations, but not so much in America. I feel pretty strongly that we eventually get things right here. There's no doubt that we often make many wrong choices along the way, but with the living Constitution under us and a Democratic representation, I feel that the need for Civil Disobedience as a tool has not and is still not the best strategy for change in our nation... It is instead, to simply vote."},{"Title":"Civil disobedience","review":"Thoreau's writing on \\"Duty of Civil Disobedience\\" is brilliant!

His focus is on the primacy of the individual - and he disagrees that the individual should \\"serve\\" the State, especially when the state is unjust.Some of his memorable quotes include:-- The mass of men serve the State thus, not as men mainly, but as machines, with their bodies.-- (The state) is not armed with superior wit or honesty, but with superior physical strength. I was not born to be forced.-- When I meet a government which says to me, \\"Your money or your life,\\" why should I be in haste to give it my money?Ironic as it seems, what was written by Thoreau about the Congress in 1849 is still true today:\\"Our legislators have not yet learned the comparative value of free trade and of freed, of union, and of rectitude, to a nation. They have no genius or talent for comparatively humble questions of taxation and finance, commerce and manufactures and agriculture. If we were left solely to the wordy wit of legislators in Congress for our guidance, uncorrected by the seasonable experience and the effectual complaints of the people, America would not long retain her rank among the nations.\\"Thoreau concludes that \\"there will never be a free and enlightened State until the State comes to recognize the individual as a higher and independent power, from which all its own power and authority are derived, and treats him accordingly.\\"This could serve as a primer for the Tea Party Movement!Dr. B Leland Baker, author of Tea Party Revival, The Conscience of a Conservative RebornTea Party Revival - The Conscience of a Conservative Reborn: The Tea Party Revolt Against Unconstrained Spending and Growth of the Federal Government"},{"Title":"Civil disobedience","review":"Henry David Thoreau, &lt;strong>Civil Disobedience&lt;/strong> (CreateSpace, 1849)I have put off releasing my best reads of 2011 list for all these months because I still haven't quite figured out how to review &lt;em>Civil Disobedience&lt;/em>, which is #3 on it. You see, the problem is I've always kind of hated Thoreau, who is widely held responsible for the foundation of the modern ecological movement (I'm a diehard pave-the-earth guy and have been for decades). Because of that, I spent my reading time avoiding the guy, but when I picked up a Kobo, with its 100 pre-loaded classic titles, I figured I'd start working my way through them. And thus I found myself reading &lt;em>Civil Disobedience&lt;/em>, since it seemed like it would be preferable to &lt;em>Walden&lt;/em>. My jaw hit the floor with the very first sentence, which contains one of my favorite quotes (\\"I heartily accept the motto, 'That government is best which governs least'; and I should like to see it acted up to more rapidly and systematically.\\"), and I kept being stunned as I kept reading. This is fantastic stuff. No wonder it's considered dangerous (Joseph McCarty proposed banning it, and even the study aid SparkNotes mentions that Thoreau's ideas would be \\"dangerous if universalized\\").It's also even more relevant today than it was smack in the middle of the nineteenth century. \\"All men recognize the right of revolution; that is, the right to refuse allegiance to, and to resist, the government, when its tyranny or inefficiency are great and unendurable.\\" Indeed, during the early years of America, all men &lt;em>did&lt;/em>; it is, in fact, one of the founding principles of the United States. But I'd be willing to bet that if you showed that quote, stripped of its attribution, to a hundred random Americans, more than half would disagree with it. (Show it to a hundred random elected officials and you might find yourself in jail.) This is one of those books, along with John Stuart Mill's &lt;em>On Liberty&lt;/em> (also considered dangerous by the right; it made Human Events' list of the top ten most harmful books of the past two centuries), that needs to be read by every American, so that we can understand where we come from--and how many of those who try to tell us these days where they think we come from lie, lie, and lie some more. After all, as Thoreau himself tells us, \\"No man with a genius for legislation has appeared in America.\\" (I would quibble with the word \\"appeared\\", since we did at one point host Alexis de Tocqueville...)And when you're ready to dismiss all this and blunder and nonsense and go back to thinking that there's really a difference in America's two ruling parties, remember once again that it has traditionally been the &lt;em>right&lt;/em> (or those who call themselves that) who have attacked this book, and then read this lovely passage:\\"There will never be a really free and enlightened State until the State comes to recognize the individual as a higher and independent power, form which all its own power and authority are derived, and treats him accordingly. I please myself with imagining a State at last which can afford to be just to all men, and to treat the individual with respect as a neighbor....A State which bore this kind of fruit, and suffered it to drop off as fast as it ripened, would prepare the way for a still more perfect and glorious State, which I have also imagined, but not yet anywhere seen.\\"That's &lt;em>true&lt;/em> right-wing thinking there, kids. (And note that Thoreau's \\"more perfect and glorious State\\" is peaceful anarchy, which is the end product of both post-State socialism and post-State libertarianism--mention THAT fact to a neocon and watch his head explode!) But the way the current \\"right\\" attacks it, I can't imagine most liberals would have a problem with it, either. In other words, it doesn't matter who you are. Read this. You may hate it, you may love it, but you will come away from it with a better understanding of how things have changed in this country in the past 150 years, and how terrifying those changes are, and that cannot be a bad thing. *****"},{"Title":"Civil disobedience","review":"Civil Disobedience....A short book I found interesting only because I wanted to know what people thought before my time.

Like all great works of philosophy, it is as relevant today as it has ever been, as it transcends space and time. Don't let the abolitionist nature mislead you: this book is not merely about abolition and slavery. Rather, it is about Man Against the State, individuality, and Thoreau's philosophy of how one man can stand up to government and society, driven by his own convictions of right and wrong, as summarized by the timeless quote \\"Any man more right than his neighbors constitutes a majority of one already\\".Thoreau's main point is that the best - and many times, the only - method for fighting injustice is through passive disobedience. By refusing to cooperate with the machinery of injustice, the individual can become the friction that stops the machine. Active resistance is bound for failure, as the machine (the State, society, etc.) is too formidable for the individual to fight. But, by refusing to cooperate, justice can be achieved and injustice toppled.If you are looking for a marvelous primer on individuality and the fight for justice, start with this book."},{"Title":"Civil disobedience","review":"In \\"Civil Disobedience\\" Thoreau presents political theories in which he dissects democracy and the interaction between citizens and their government.Understandably, Thoreau was deeply concerned about injustices he witnessed during his life, such as enslavement of one sixth of the population and the invasion of Mexico by the United States.Thoreau does not oppose the institution of government; he believes that when a government becomes \\"abused and perverted\\", it ceases to represent the will of the people. When a government makes decisions that promulgate harm and injustice, it is the duty of its citizens to rebel and break those chains of injustices.Arguably, the strongest idea Thoreau presents, is the notion of individualism. Thoreau encourages skepticism of the government and rejects blind loyalty to it. Thoreau perceives citizens, who give blind loyalty to their government's decisions without questioning them, as participants in every injustice committed by that government. Whether this point of view is correct or not, it is worth debating, especially in view of the horrific injustices that are extant in today's world and the way the masses so easily accept them without considering the negative impact on others."},{"Title":"Civil disobedience","review":"This is a thoroughly American view on political theory given the emphasis on the individual coupled with the call for civil disobedience.

This is a very influential work by Thoreau that is the foundation of civil disobedience. Gandhi and Martin Luther King were greatly influenced by this work.A famous quote from this work is \\"That government is best which governs least\\". Today's bloated government would literally drive him mad. I've also read \\"Walden\\" and it expresses similar sentiments.This short pamphlet should be read by everyone. I would personally love to see less government and agree that civil disobedience is a very good way to encourage change. It sounds like politicians back then were similar to what we have today. Some things never change.These kindle freebies have given me a great and easy way to review several items I have wanted to read for years."},{"Title":"Civil disobedience","review":"Civil Disobedience sits quietly in the national psyche as one of the founding documents of modern American liberalism. It's well known to liberals but not well read. It is worth the reading and would likely surprise liberals and non-liberals alike - as it did me. Sure, it's anti-war and anti-slavery, but it's also a lot more. The confused hodgepodge of modern isms that dominate current political thought could use the purity, consistency, and clarity that were second nature to thinkers nearer the American Revolution.Consider, for example, Thoreau's political philosophy:\\"I heartily accept the motto, - \\"That government is best which governs least;\\" and I should like to see it acted up to more rapidly and systematically.\\"Or his take on government aid to societal improvement:\\"Yet this government never of itself furthered any enterprise, but by the alacrity with which it got out of the way. It does not keep the country free. It does not settle the West. It does not educate. The character inherent in the American people has done all that has been accomplished; and it would have done somewhat more, if the government had not sometimes got in its way.\\"Thoreau on economic policy:\\"Trade and commerce, if they were not made of India-rubber, would never manage to bounce over the obstacles which legislators are continually putting in their way.\\"1848 was also the year of another seminal work, the Communist Manifesto by Karl Marx. Where Thoreau looked back to the 18th century, Marx looked forward to the 20th . Where Thoreau recognized that the power of the state will not easily be compartmentalized, that power to do one thing will infect all things, Marx looked to the state to solve every problem. Where Thoreau knew that state power does not peacefully or voluntarily diminish, Marx justified his appeal for total state power - the dictatorship of the proletariat - with the nave expectation that government would dissolve away into a stateless utopian paradise.Thoreau, I expect, would have no trouble explaining why Americans who protest wars but advocate government intervention in the economy, get wars; or why Americans who advocate nonintervention in the economy, small taxes, and small government but support a worldwide military presence, get controlled markets, high taxes, and large government.It has been pointed out that the structural deficits which have finally brought U.S. governmental finances to the point of crisis, got their start in the Vietnam War and Great Society. Us moderns tend to blame/praise conservatives for the wars and liberals for the social programs, but Thoreau knew wars and social programs are joined at the hip. We can have both or neither but not one or the other. Conservatives and liberals share equal responsibility. Civil Disobedience points to the solution."},{"Title":"Civil disobedience","review":"I give it 5 stars because Civil Disobedience is a masterful bit of writing. However, save your money on this.

They are all inspirational, above average, writings. Well, about this book, a strong critic to United States government of his time (why not to extend that to ours, since it seems not much has changed...). He takes a position against slavery, as well as the war with Mexico.I believe this is one of the most well written works fighting for the liberty of expression and against slavery I ever read.His ideas about an unexistent State are at least discussible, since it seems very difficult to people live without any organizational structure. But, of course, we SHOULD discuss about State's authority, as well its limits...Thoreau's own natural life was his inspiration, and (as we can see in his texts) he loved nature, and he spent a lot of time of his life around it. He liked freedom, and in this work he depicts his ideas about freedom, and how it should be applied to him, as well as all mankind."},{"Title":"Civil disobedience","review":"Though many statements Thoreau has made seem a little flakey around the edges, when it came to free will and individual choice he had the right idea and the courage to see it through.

A book that has not lost its relevance."},{"Title":"Civil disobedience","review":"Civil Disobedience ReviewCivil Disobedience by Henry David Thoreau is one of the most important philosophical pieces of work man has ever seen. The main point of this piece of literature is man's right to refuse cooperating with government so as to not become a soldier of injustice for the standing government. \\"Under a government which imprisons any unjustly, the true place for a just man is also a prison\\", in this quote Thoreau tells the American people that \\"We should be men first and subjects later.\\"Civil Disobedience is a piece of literature that has taught the American people and people around the world that the way to defy the government is to refuse to cooperate with it. Not cooperating with the government is the only way to stop the injustice. Active resistance will not succeed because of the governments' size and strength. The only true form to stop injustice is by not cooperating with it.Henry David Thoreau's Civil Disobedience has transcended time and space and is as relevant today as when it was written. I recommend this to any reader interested in the right of man to resist and to prove their individuality and strength.

There were articles on the need (or lack of need) for Israel, whether Israel treated Arabs fairly, whether the United States ought to support Israel, and on Israel's international role and future. Now, in 2005, the Greenhaven Press has come up with a new (albeit noticeably shorter) book on Israel. It continues in the same fine tradition. There are all sorts of viewpoints here!The book starts with a couple of articles on Israel's right to exist. However, nations do exist, and for reasons. I think it is silly to say a nation has a right to exist, and even more absurd to say that a nation has no such right. In any case, Yaron Brook and Peter Schwartz make the point that the Arabs who want a new Levantine state do not want freedom but the right to attack Jews. If America appeases such demands, it will make matters worse. Meanwhile, Ahron Cohen says that Zionism annoys Muslims and must therefore be abandoned, with Jews returning to their prior relationship to Muslims (dhimmihood). Those of us who support human rights are unlikely to be convinced.Given that nations have features that differentiate them, it is easy to argue that Israel ought to be Jewish. And the Kinneret agreement does just that. But Joel Kovel argues that such an Israel would fight for Jewish exceptionalism! In fact, getting rid of Israel's Jewish nature would make Judaism truly exceptional, and result in a special lack of rights just for Jews.Tony Judt argues that Israel was formed only in 1948, and that is too late! That's preposterous. He calls Israel (but not any other state) a \\"dysfunctional anachronism.\\" But that is simply an attack on human rights by Judt, as Jonathan Rosenblum points out. After all, the Arab nationalism that opposes Israel is far more virulent and exclusivist. I agree. The threats to human rights that made Israel a necessity in the first place are still present.James Inhofe argues that Israel rightfully belongs to the Jews. I think a more convincing case can be made, but he raises some good points. The Arab counterargument is astonishing. It simply greedily demands everything. There is no recognition that other people live on this planet too.Nevertheless, Paul Eisen's article probably has the most misinformation. It rhetorically asks if Israel's ethnicity is the major obstacle to a just peace. Well, no, it isn't. The major obstacle to a just peace is the refusal to abide Israel's insistence on everyone, even Jews, being granted human rights. Barry Block makes this point more strongly, explaining that Zionism is the national liberation movement of the Jewish people. \\"Liberating and saving the life of one's own people is not racism.\\"Jonathan Rosenblum argues that no Levantine Arab is above suspicion in the present war. After all, women and kids are sometimes suicide bombers. But this raises more questions than it answers. Obviously, some Arabs want to be law-abiding, and a way needs to be found to distinguish them from those who want to engage in violence against Jews.Patrick Johnston's article argues that Israel is a terrorist state, that Zionists (such as myself) must be declared terrorists, that there must be war crimes tribunals against Israeli leaders, and that the UN must impose harsh sanctions against Israel. But everything he says against Israel and Zionism can be applied to anyone. I think one could use the same argument to justify getting rid of all humans.Ziad Asali argues that peace between Israel and the Levantine Arabs is possible, but only on Arab terms. Basically, those terms seem to be \\"what is mine is mine, what is yours I'll take most of, and the rest we'll share until I want that too.\\" That's not peace. David Horowitz correctly argues that peace with the Levantine Arabs is not possible because their only real demand is for the destruction of Israel. Peace will have to entail that demand being thwarted or dropped. Don Feder agrees: the advertised \\"two-state\\" solution will not bring peace. But a George Bush speech is included which indeed advertises just this solution.Uzi Landau argues in favor of the security fence between Israel and the Arabs. But he also argues that Arabs must continue to be allowed to live in Israel, and that by symmetry, Jews must be allowed to live across the border in Arab territory. Catherine Cook expresses her outrage that Israel actually claims a tiny amount of land that happens to be heavily Jewish demographically. If there is a protecting fence, she wants West Bank Jews to be outside it. But that makes her appear as if she wants those Jews to be murdered.Bruce Thornton argues coherently that all of us who value law and individual freedom ought to support Israel. Sarah Helm disagrees, asking us to sacrifice Israel to appease Arabs and saying (quite unconvincingly) that Israel is immoral anyway. Paul Findley blames the 9/11 terrorist attacks on American support for Israel and says that \\"Israel is a scofflaw nation and should be treated as such.\\" Once again, I feel that if even Israel is a scofflaw, everyone is. The Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs points out that it is Israel's existence, not the status of the peace process, that is the main Levantine issue.Lee Hamilton argues that the United States can help resolve the conflict by getting both sides to recognize the legitimacy of the other. I disagree, of course, and feel that the Arab side is not a genuine potential peace partner. Leon Hadar takes a different point of view, and says that the United States should not attempt to mediate, as our most recent attempt simply got both sides to harden their positions. I disagree with that as well.I highly recommend this fascinating book."},{"Title":"Opposing Viewpoints Series - Israel (paperback edition) (Opposing Viewpoints Series)","review":"this books is a good way for us laymen to begin to understand the many complex viewpoints surrounding the state of Israel.I am not very politcal, but this helped me to understand alot more about a country where there is alot of history, alot of emotion, and MANY view points.Lori"},{"Title":"Opposing Viewpoints Series - Israel (paperback edition) (Opposing Viewpoints Series)","review":"I'll give this book four stars for its effort to present both sides to the argument about Israel and the Palestinians. There is an essay titled \\"Israel belongs to the Jews\\" and a counter essay titled \\"Palestine belongs to the Arabs,\\" an essay that says Israelis are terrorists and another that says Palestinians are terrorists. Point, counterpoint.I have some complaints, however. The essays tend to be shallow rehashes of familiar material. As an example, the usual Israeli claim is made that Palestine before Jews was a nearly uninhabited wilderness and that Israelis made the desert bloom. That's incorrect; every bush and every rock in this ancient land has had an owner for at least 10,000 years. And even if it were correct it wouldn't mean that the earlier inhabitants of Palestine have no property or human rights. There is also much unneccesary Israeli and Arab bashing. No need exists for either side to demonize the other; the great majority of both Jews and Arabs are decent people who would prefer peace to the long-standing conflict in the Holy Land.Some important issues hardly receive attention. What about the 700,000 Palestinians displaced by Israel in 1948? How many of them departed voluntarily and how many were thrown out and had their property seized without compensation by Israel? Should they have the right to return and reclaim their property if deprived of it by force?Another problem is the lack of Palestinian voices in this book. From the list of about 20 authors contributing essays I can only identify with certainty two originating with Arabs. One of them by Ziad Asali is about the only forward looking essay in the book. The remainer of the pro-Palestinian essays are written by Americans and Israelis. Can't the Palestinians speak for themselves? This book is worth reading for a quick look at the common points by both sides in this long standing war of words and arms, but meatier and more thoughtful material is available.Smallchief"},{"Title":"Social Work Theories In Action","review":"I have not read it as yet, but it will be very helpful with my studies which i start shortly."},{"Title":"The electroform unified field theory","review":"The transition from general relativity to unified field theory took place in a way that was unexpected: the classical general theory of relativity could itself be ruled out with non-self-consistency theorems, although it was believed to be entirely self-consistent by most physicists for decades. That the non-self-consistency theorems could coincide with the miraculous GR prediction of the perhelion precession of Mercury, the curvature of light around the sun, and the gravitational red shiftwas, however, surprising, as GR seemed to be proven by experiment, although careful study shows it can not be the correct theory for reasons accessible only to the minds of mathematical physicists. Before the experiment was even done, classical General Relativity could have been ruled out. However, the linearized field equations suggested that in local coordinates at least, the gravitational field would look like a mirror-image of the usual Maxwell's equations, with like-charges-attract coupling automatically producing right-hand rule magnetic-like effects. However, Einstein's theory predicted a magnetic component 4 times larger that one would would obtain if the magnetic part of the field were due strictly to the Lorentz time-dialation, as is the case in relativistic electrodynamics. The extra factor of 4 finally produces a violation of the conservation laws in the form of a violation of the equation of continuity, which provides the foundation of the 1st overthrow theorem. If we look for theories that do not have the unwanted factor of 4, we find that a suitable generalization of vector-boson field theory works out for the short- range nuclear forces as well as for gravitation and electromagnetism if the field equations are taken as locally valid in flat space with gravitational time-dialation only. Then one can derive all of Einstein's miraculous GR effects from a conservative quantum field theory, as shown in this book. 3rd edition, small hardback, 192 pp, 22 illustrations.

Well, this collection was a delight and a surprize! Most of these poems are from the early 1970's when Bukowski lived in East Hollywood. In these poems, (which have never been published until now) he belts out hymns to the outsiders, the lost, the cheated and the ignored. He trains his eye on the poor and the underdog. I personally thought this collection was nothing short of magnificent. Bukowski is back! No freeway, bottle and music up in a room old man poems. I liked those too but I'd had enough of them.

So I picked up &quot;What Matters Most Is How Well You Walk Through the Fire&quot; in a bookstore, opened up to a random poem, and started reading. Well, I was hooked from that moment.&quot;What Matters&quot; is a posthumous volume of poetry by the prolific Bukowski, who died in 1994. According to the acknowledgments on the copyright page, these poems were written between 1970 and 1990 and were part of an archive which the poet left to be published after his death.The poems in &quot;What Matters&quot; are written in free verse. Bukowski's vernacular language has an energy, charm, and down-to-earth accessibilty. His main themes are as follows: gambling at the racetrack, drinking, women, death and aging, other writers and artists, poetry itself, and his own public image as a hard-drinking dirty old man. He often writes about people or animals who might be seen as pathetic or seedy.The book is full of intriguing literary references; he mentions Wallace Stevens, Pablo Neruda, Kafka, Rilke, Lorca, Oscar Wilde, Hemingway, Auden, Henry Miller, &quot;gutsy Ezra Pound,&quot; and many more writers. There are many narrative poems, often featuring &quot;Henry Chinaski,&quot; who appears to be Bukowski's alter ego.&quot;What Matters&quot; is full of the cruder side of urban life: the reader will encounter pimps, gamblers, the &quot;dreary and doped / battalions&quot; of prostitutes, a &quot;flowing / tide of piss&quot; from a clogged Salt Lake City urinal, etc. There is often suffering. But through it all, Bukowski is often funny, philosophical, and even gentle. He can even find an epiphany in the act of shaving: &quot;&amp; I'm aware of ghosts &amp; spirits &amp; clouds / &amp; blood &amp; weeping &amp; skeletons &amp; / much more.&quot;In the poem &quot;they arrived in time,&quot; Bukowski pays tribute to some of the writers who have moved him: he calls them &quot;those friends / deep in my blood.&quot; If you read &quot;What Matters,&quot; you might find Bukowski getting deep into your own blood."},{"Title":"What Matters Most is How Well You Walk Through the Fire","review":"It&#65533;s astonishing just how many people, when they hear the name Bukowski, are ready to dismiss him, in less than a breath, as some sort of sexist, macho, skid-row bard, caught up in his teufelskreis of booze, broads, and back-rent, whose poetics consisted of nothing more than a &#65533;gritty roominghouse lyricism.&#65533; In these days of postmodern, deconstructed, politically correct aesthetics, it&#65533;s easy to forget the immense contribution that Bukowski made to American poetry. Picking up where W.C. Williams and the Beats left off, Bukowski reasserted the power of the demotic and its relevance to American experience. Of course this has not been without its negative flip-side, the result being a deluge of confessional, &#65533;slice-of-life,&#65533; petit moi poetry, from which contemporary American poetry has yet to recover. But what sets Bukowski apart from all of his imitators is his ability to turn his bleak, existential vision into something truly universal, which is also the secret of his worldwide popularity. You don&#65533;t have to be intimately familiar with dingy bars, nasty whores, run-down hotels, and the harsh Los Angeles sun to know where Bukowski is coming from. His understanding of the human dilemma, his compassion for animals, and his impatience with conformity and the &#65533;dead-before-death gang&#65533; transcended the claustrophobic milieu of down-and-out, blue-collar Los Angeles, and the true crux of Bukowski&#65533;s art was his remarkable talent to turn his quotidian despair into something that even Japanese bank executives or Spanish art students can relate to, approximating a sort of tongue-in-cheek Kafka of American poetry.What Matters Most is How Well You Walk Through the Fire is the second in Black Sparrow&#65533;s series of posthumous volumes of Bukowski&#65533;s poetry, and is full of some of his most incendiary poetry to date. This is not just some old mothballed Bukowski that John Martin has dusted off and wheeled out to help pay the rent now that Black Sparrow&#65533;s star poet is gone; at 412 pages, this is a veritable tome of vintage Bukowski culled from the early 1970s up to the 1990s, from one of America&#65533;s most influential, oft-imitated, yet essentially inimitable poets ever.Aside from the usual bar, racetrack, flophouse, and hangover poems, all blazing brilliantly with Bukowski&#65533;s trademark fusion of angst and irony, there are also many poems of sheer, exacting, even frightening, beauty, executed with all the boldness and audacity of a German expressionist painter, such as the haunting &#65533;full moon,&#65533; here in its entirety;red flower of lovecut at the stempassion has its ownwayand hatred too.the curtain blows openand the sky is blackout there tonight.across the waya man and a womanstanding up against a darkenedwall,the red moonwhirls,a mouse runs alongthe windowsillchanging colors.I am alone in torn levisand a white sweat shirt.she&#65533;s with her man nowin the shadow of that walland as he enters herI draw upon mycigarette.Of course one can&#65533;t help speculating as to the true strategy behind such posthumous collections. Did the author feel the poems weren&#65533;t strong enough to be included in other collections? Were they purposely held back by the publisher in anticipation of the author&#65533;s eventual death and the ensuing dry spell? Or were they simply too personal, too gut-level and potentially libelous to risk publishing during the author&#65533;s lifetime? In the case of Bukowski, it was obviously partly the latter. He takes merciless jabs, pokes, and swings at many peers and contemporaries, as in the hilarious &#65533;4 Christs,&#65533; where Bukowski attends a poetry reading in Santa Cruz with &#65533;Ginsbing,&#65533; &#65533;Beerlinghetti,&#65533; &#65533;G. Cider,&#65533; and &#65533;Jack Bitcheline&#65533;. In other poems, many other writers, such as Henry Miller and Diane Wakoski, are also caught in the beam of Bukowski&#65533;s critical searchlight.For anyone who wishes to re-examine the work of this immensely popular, highly contested poet, this collection is an excellent place to begin, covering as it does a span of over twenty years. For fans wishing to fill out their collection of already published Bukowski, this is a must, a cornucopia of outtakes and bonus tracks that will further establish Bukowski&#65533;s already enduring place in American literature."},{"Title":"What Matters Most is How Well You Walk Through the Fire","review":"Charles Bukowski, What Matters Most Is How Well You Walk Through the Fire (Black Sparrow, 1999)With the exception of The Captain Is Out to Lunch and the Sailors Have Taken Over the Ship, the posthumously published Bukowski material just doesn't live up to the stuff he published while he was still alive; cynical readers will likely say he made his reputation while alive, then left the leftovers to be published afterwards. Be that as it may, that's not to say the posthumous stuff isn't worth reading. Bukowski hit his stride as a poet in the mid-fifties, and snatches of greatness continued up through the late seventies/early eighties with regularity; much of the material here was written during the latter half of that time period, and, as expected, flashes of brilliance show through. Flashes, however, are not likely to sustain a reader coming to Bukowski for the first time over the course of four hundred nine pages of poetry; the neophyte would be well advised to turn to Burning in Water, Drowning in Flame or War All the Time for a first crack at the man who made it all look so easy. What Matters Most... is best left for after you're an established Buk fan and know how to separate the what from the chaff. This is about half and half, but remember, chaff is a whole lot lighter, and so you can pack more of it in, pound for pound. **"},{"Title":"What Matters Most is How Well You Walk Through the Fire","review":"Here is another collection of Bukowski poems posthumously released and what else can be said that hasn't been said before. If you have read any of his poetry in the past and you are a fan, here you go folks; more edgey, off beat, colorful stories told in Bukowski's unique poetry rhetoric.

But after reading enough crap you begin to think so.Please read this only out of morbid curiosity, or as a study on successful marketing, because John Martin, the owner of Black Sparrow Press, is ceratinly making a killing off of the Bukowski books published since the author's death in 1994."},{"Title":"What Matters Most is How Well You Walk Through the Fire","review":"Good old Hank: they keep on coming and even if the new ones are increasingly a hit-and-miss affair it's still worth ploughing through.

Bukowski paints vivid, sad and pathetic caricatures of life and people. He has a powerful ability to move the reader into his frame of reference and to love the seamingly grotesque, and to help the reader feel if only for a moment the authors isolation and creative fire. I personally like bukowski's poetry, I have 6 other poetry books by Bukowski the only one I might recommend ahead of this one would be, love is like a dog from hell. This contains poems that can be read hundreds of times and still feel intense. It closes with, Roll The Dice which does more to me in 44 short broken lines than most other writers can accomplish in a novel and most other poets can't match in a lifetime of work. His work is seen by some as offensive, crude and simplistic, yet hundreds of thousands are touched by his work, and he has spawned an endless number of stylistic offshoots some horrbile some inspired.

Sometimes Christ only gets mentioned at the very end of a lecture.The book can be summed up as an accumalation of lectures of \\"cosmic life\\" if you like: the spiritual life that is connected with, and influences, life as seen only from/with physical senses.In the book is recorded about several \\"ages\\" (Golden Age, Silver Age, Iron Age and Dark Age), and that how in each age clairvoyant abilities - [or really spiritual consciousness] - diminished with each age, and that the Dark Age has ended in 1899AC and that in this current Age people need to become spiritually aware again to the point where they have a \\"Damascus experience\\" (experience of Saul - later Paul - in which he saw Christ in Etheric form).People who do not become spiritually aware will be bound into the Earth consciousness/sphere and could cause disturbances in the Earth.In this light, Rudolf Steiner communicated about the brotherhoods - in Western and Eastern countries - and how they try to prevent people from developing spiritually to the point where they will be able to meet Christ in the Etheric (= 2nd coming of Christ (coming in the Etheric)... and in future times coming of Christ (i.e. manifestation/presence of Christ in the astral)).In the book is also recorded about the Sermon on the Mount - with the Beautitudes (recorded in Matthew 5) where Jesus communicated about the development of the soul (as recorded in other books by Rudolf Steiner (sentient soul, intellectual soul, etc.)).In the book is also recorded about \\"the afterlife\\" if you like: life of souls who have passed away and are still Earthbound, and how those souls are connected to those souls that are incarnated in a physical body in Earth.In the book is communicated about different levels in the 'afterlife' and how feelings and will are active. It is recorded about astral plane, lower devachan and higher devachan in \\"Etherization of the Blood\\" and later on again in \\"Three Realms between Death and Rebirth\\" where is recorded in greater detail how activity in those realms is connected with life of souls incarnated in the Earth and how Christ is also present there and can be experienced in Earthly life as 'destiny'... and how people are so focused on what is, or has happened, but don't pay attention to what is result of it not happening (e.g. getting delayed for an appointment, or coming ('unexpectedly') too early etc.). Destiny is at work, with Christ having its workings present in it according to Rudolf Steiner.In the book is also located about \\"the double\\" and how forces from within the Earth influence it [geo-biology]. Ireland was a place where those influences where most 'healthy' for spiritual development/cognition and Ireland was the place where Christianity was able to flourish and waver out from to Europe by Irish monks."},{"Title":"The Reappearance of Christ in the Etheric","review":"This book contains 13 lectures by Rudolf Steiner, the founder of Anthroposophy. One of the differences between Anthroposophy and its \\"parent religion\\" Theosophy is that Steiner placed more emphasis on the person and role of Jesus Christ in the cosmic drama. This book contains some of Steiner's ideas on the Christ and his role in human spiritual evolution.Steiner seems to believe that spiritual evolution follows a dialectical scheme of thesis-antithesis-synthesis. Originally, humans were aware of the spiritual world, and had a kind of dream-like clairvoyance. Gradually, human consciousness became more and more physical and \\"materialist\\". This was necessary to develop individual autonomy, but it also cut humanity off from beneficial spiritual influences. The future synthesis and ultimate goal of evolution is conscious clairvoyance. Humans must communicate with the spirit-world without loosing their individual consciousness and freedom.Steiner believes that human evolution was in danger of getting off track about 2000 years ago, as more and more people were loosing their clairvoyant abilities. Christ was a sun-spirit who incarnated on Earth in order to set things right. At the cross, Christ shed \\"etherized blood\\" which got into the energy field of the planet and then into our etheric bodies, thereby aiding our spiritual development. This is the Mystery of Golgotha. Unless I misunderstood Steiner, the etherized blood of Christ is therefore really a spiritual substance and somehow needs to be \\"turned on\\" by certain meditation techniques. It's unclear why Christ had to be crucified in order to accomplish this feat!Steiner hotly denies that Christ will reappear in a physical form. At least in part, this is a polemic against the Adyar branch of Theosophy, which was promoting Jiddu Krishnamurti as a future \\"World Teacher\\" and saviour. By contrast, Steiner holds that Christ will reappear in the etheric, a spiritual dimension visible only to clairvoyants. This will take place at some point between 1930 and 1940. Over the next 2,500 years more and more people will become clairvoyant and see the etheric Christ. Together with Christ, the ancient wonderland of Shamballa will also appear in the etheric realm. There is a constant tension in Steiner's thinking between a strong determinism and a more open-ended view of human history, where evil forces can fool humanity to go off track again.In another lecture, Steiner contrasts Buddhism with Christianity. Buddha wanted his followers to leave the earthly incarnation altogether due to the evil and suffering of physical existence. Steiner's explanation is that humans weren't sufficiently firmly incarnated in the physical during this period, and hence hoped to escape their suffering by withdrawing back to the spiritual realms. Christianity, by contrast, taught the transformation of the earthly realm. In order to get people to exert themselves to the maximum, Christianity therefore denied the fact of reincarnation (at least officially). In the future, Buddhism and Christianity must unite and teach both the Christ and reincarnation. Steiner even claims that Maitreya will appear physically on Earth in the future as a kind of World Teacher. (Valentin Tomberg, an apostate from Anthroposophy, later drew upon this idea to claim that Maitreya would somehow be Christian! Note that Maitreya is really the Buddhist saviour figure, a kind of Buddhist Messiah.)The book also contains lectures only marginally connected to the reappearance of Christ in the etheric. Thus, Steiner claims that comets are feminine and innovative, but also materialist. Apparently, Halley's Comet caused the 18th century Enlightenment! Two lectures summarize themes more extensively dealt with in another book, \\"Secret Brotherhoods and the Mystery of the Human Double\\". They deal with the war in Heaven in 1879, secret societies of black magicians, and so on. Finally, Steiner claims that the truth about Jesus isn't accessibly through modern historical-critical scholarship. (A modern foreword to the book mocks the Jesus Seminar for their minimalist view of Jesus.) The events surrounding the life and ministry of Christ can only be accessed through \\"spiritual science\\", i.e. Anthroposophy. The most important event in cosmic evolution can only be known by those willing to embrace Steiner's own message.Steiner's writings are not an easy read. They are in some strange fashion simultaneously both dull and weird. Another problem is that Steiner constantly introduces new ideas seemingly unconnected to what went before, making his full teachings extremely unwieldy. \\"The reappearance of Christ in the etheric\\" only contains a small portion of the Anthroposophical view of Jesus.Still, since this book is relatively easy to read for a Steiner tome, I will give it three stars."},{"Title":"In the Shadow of \\"Just Wars\\": Violence, Politics, and Humanitarian Action","review":"This collection of essays brought together by Medecins Sans Frontieres intends to help readers explore the current state of international \\"humanitarian\\" aid in the wake of the \\"just wars\\" that were fought on humanitarian pretexts in the Balkans last decade.Contrary to what government officials prefer to brag, most humanitarian aid is not humanitarian at all, but is an extension of politics. This work expounds on that theme, implying that the \\"just wars\\" of the last decade were the demise of truly independent and humanitarian work. In keeping with this theme, the essays in this book, with the exception of one or two, delve into the politics of a complex emergency and explore how the international community has failed to live up to the humanitarian ideal -- either by abstaining from involvement or manipulating aid.There is particular focus on Africa, since the cases were chosen by ranking complex emergencies according to their cost in human lives, and focusing on the most serious. This annoyed me to an extent because the essays on the African conflicts tend to give tremendous amounts of information in only small amounts of space. By the time the reader covers three or four of the African conflicts, he cannot help but jumble and confuse the names of the main players and the acronyms of the liberation armies.Also, several different authors all seem to use the same words and have the same style of writing. At first I suspected some sort of conspiracy on the part of MSF, but then I realized that most of the essays were probably written in foreign languages then later translated by Fabrice Weissman into English. The result is that I began to tire of the book's style and diction halfway through. One word in particular -- I forget which -- must have been used twenty or thirty times, despite not being a commonly used word. The soporific effect of this phenomenon cannot be overlooked in evaluating the book's merit.By the end, however, every reader should at least be more informed about the civil wars taking place in Africa. And he should also be able to more critically assess news reports describing humanitarian emergencies and humanitarian assistance. Thus the book does deliver some reward, although each of these messages is better articulated by David Rieff in his book \\"A Bed for the Night.\\"I would recommend this collection only for those with a deep interest in humanitarian aid."},{"Title":"Mania's angel: My life story","review":"I'm Marie's cousin, so I disqualify myself to write a review -- it would be biased. Instead I'll include the description of her life on the back cover of her book and add a little more:Marie Brandstetter was born in Blaszki, Poland. Forced to flee Poland after the Nazi invasion in 1939, she and her family sought refuge during the war in small towns and villages throughout the Soviet Union and Central Asia. In 1947, Marie was aboard the ill-fated Exodus bound for Palestine but turned back by British troops. In 1950, she and her younger brother immigrated to the San Francisco Bay Area. This book tells of the family's struggles to survive and to stay together during the most terrible times of the 20th century.Marie spent much of her time travelling and giving talks to schools and other places about her experiences. Her book is a good read and describes well what was in the mind of a young girl going through her experiences. She carried a bullet scar on her leg as a reminder of the English hospitality on the Exodus."},{"Title":"To the Resurrection Station","review":"Belinda Smith is a student on New Hope, vague on future plans but happy with her classes, her roomate and her small well-lit room full of flowers. Her happy existence suddenly changes, as her guardian takes her out of school and into the derelict family mansion. Strange adventures ensue, including her encounter with the native humanoid tribes, an old robot, and a number of quirky phenomena.The protagonist is not particularly heroic, but very likable. Just as she--or her companions start to slide into a template (like a plucky young heroine)--the author skewers the stereotype, but in a very believable, human way.The adventures that ensue are frequently unbelivable, yet that is a part of the plot. There is no grand conflict; instead it's a series of adventures with amusing and sometimes touching aspects. There are plenty of light-hearted references, often ironic, to literature, psychology and metaphysics. The lack of a central plot is a weakness, but the characters--they are not heroes--are engaging, and so is the book.--inotherworlds.com"},{"Title":"To the Resurrection Station","review":"Extremely shallow plot about a privileged, ditzy, bisexual female that lucks through life and even has a \\"magic talent\\" of being lucky.

This book is very strong on pastoral tips for preaching through Luke. It delivers on the claim implied in its title.One of the points I disagree with this author on would be his view that Luke could not have written the gospel of Luke. I believe D.L. Bock and others have established a very solid case from multiple points to support the view that Luke, Paul's traveling companion, wrote this gospel. Nickle states the Luke could not have written this gospel. Other major commentators have convincingly concluded that Paul's traveling companion, Luke, did write this gospel.His conclusion reveals a bias. He also states that Luke is inconsistentwith Paul's own accounts of his travels...(that's part of his argument that the Luke who wrote this gospel could not have been Paul's companion).FF Bruce and others have laid that opinion to rest, in my view. I think this author would be viewed as tilting to the left by most evangelical pastors because of statements he makes about the historical integrity of Luke's gospel.I also have found that this book is not as detailed as some of the heavier commentaries (and it is not meant to be as detailed). But sometimes this can work against a pastor/teacher using this commentary. For example, at the end of the book on the road to Emmaus, there is a great chiastic structure that Nickle points out. However, the focus of the chiasm is not as clear in his analysis as it is in Joel Green's (NICNT). I found that Nickle missed two of the pairs in the chiasm. He also has an incorrect verse reference in the structure. I think that sometimes he is better for presentation ideas than for technical detail.Here is a summary of Nickle's chiastic structure for Luke 24 road to Emmaus.A - Jerusalem (leaving)....B - Jesus arrives........C - Their eyes are kept from recognizing Jesus.............D - Dialogue and Interaction........C' - Their eyes are opened to seeing Jesus....B' - Jesus vanishesA' - Jerusalem (returning to it)Thie leaves us looking at the very vague...D dialogue and interaction.In addition, he says Jesus vanishes in the wrong verse (not a big deal, but still an error).Joel Green (NICNT Commentary on Luke) gives a much more detailed chiastic structure for the same passage...AND look at the resulting clarity in the primary point of his chiasm. Jesus is alive!A. Journey from Jerusalem..B. Appearance...obstructed eyes...unable to recognize.....C. Interaction.........D. Summary of 'the things'..............E. Empty Tomb & Vision.................F. Jesus is alive.............E'. Empty Tomb but no vision.........D'. Interpretation of 'the things'......C'. Interaction..B'. Opened Eyes...recognition & vanishingA'. Journey to Jerusalem.Joel Green leaves you meditating on the point of the chiasm,that Jesus really is alive!. Nickle leaves you meditatingon the dialog and interaction of Jesus with the disciples.This story is in the chapter on the resurrection and exaltationof Jesus, and I have to say that Green's work is much more helpfulon this particular story.Having said all that, I love the 'royal rule' emphasis in this book. The inauguration of the Kingdom as an aspect of Luke's gospel needs to be preached. If a pastor has a theological grid for this, Nickle's concepts can be very helpful. As an evangelical pastor commited to announcing and preaching the gospel of the Kingdom of God, this particular Homiletical Commentary is packed with good ideas.For example, on Luke 9:28-36 Transfiguration account, Nickle draws the allusion to Moses and his appearance transformation. He encourages preachers to point out that the transfiguration is an inauguration of a new exodus. This sort of contrast to the OT/Law showing a contrast between Jesus and Moses is an excellent pointer (and this book has many of them) for sermon crafting.In my mind this book fits in well AFTER one has done his exegetical work on a passage...and during the time when you are hammering out crucial points for your sermon based on your exegesis. It is not a commentary, but an application guide.In my collection on Luke it fills a unique position, and is a welcome addition. I recommend this book for the pastor who has time and has a practice of doing careful exegesis before writing his sermons. For exegetical commentaries, I really like Bock (ECNT), Marshall (NIGTC) out of the ones I have. I would consult them BEFORE using Nickle. But where regular commentaries stop, great application tips, this book starts. It's a great idea.I do recommend this book with the qualifiers mentioned above."},{"Title":"Preaching in the Gospel of Luke: Proclaiming God's Royal Rule","review":"I have used this book in tandem with Joel Green's excellent commentary on Luke in the NICNT series and have appreciated Nickle's work. For those of us who face 52 Sundays worth of sermons on Luke's gospel in the lectionary year C, Nickle's book is a must have.

Chambers' &quot;The King in Yellow&quot; is a book within a book. Or, more properly, it's a collection of macabre short stories with a common theme; a fictional two-act play that brings decadence, hallucinations, and madness to any reader.The stories within this collection, published in 1895, are set in a fictional militaristic 1920s in both the USA and Europe. The tales stand free of each other, and are told from a number of different perspectives, by socialites, soldiers, and artists. Each tells how the lives of the narrator and colleagues have been affected by reading &quot;The King in Yellow&quot;, a controversial play that has been denounced by the church and suppressed by governments. After coming into contact with it, their lives are tragically affected. Some find themselves hounded by shadowy agents, while others become confused and delusional. Others are driven to act out the play's sad and decadent events, while some simply go insane.The substance of the play itself is only alluded to, or hinted at in brief extracts. It is clearly a tragedy, but the motivations and actions of its central characters, including the mysterious King in Yellow himself, are not clear. Like many authors of macabre tales, Chambers was content for our imaginations to do the work, and this book is more powerful for it.(And by the way, if the central theme of a forbidden book that induces insanity is familiar to you, you've probably read some of the Mythos tales of H.P.Lovecraft. In fact, I doubt that too many people come to read &quot;The King in Yellow&quot; by any other route; Chambers' book is clearly stated as a strong influence on Lovecraft's work.)To be honest, I was shocked to find myself reading a book that was over a HUNDRED years old, an activity I had assumed was reserved for crusty academics and lovers of classical literature. But, more pointedly, I was surprised to find that &quot;The King in Yellow&quot; is a highly readable volume, full of entertaining, colourful and disturbi! ng tales with a very modern feel to them.The only downside I found was that the final few stories lose the central theme. I found myself wondering if these thinner, romantic tales, were more representative of Chambers' other work, and were, in effect, &quot;fillers&quot;. But perhaps I missed the point? It is only this that stops me from awarding five stars to this impressive book.Overall, if you've had a bellyful of today's crop of relentless gore and explicit sexuality, take a literary Alka Seltzer by checking out the &quot;King in Yellow&quot;.It's a classic, and I'm not talking Jane Austen."},{"Title":"The king in yellow,","review":"Most of the other reviews here rightly criticizethe syrupy romance of Chambers and the thincharacter development in this book.

I am pleased to report that it did not drive me mad.The King in Yellowis a collection of ten loosely connected short stories - the first few reminiscent of Edgar Allen Poe with a distinct focus on the King in Yellow, his yellow sign, and his play; the remainder more romantic, less macabre, and sharing only a common character or setting with the stories preceding. At times the work has an engaging and modern feel; at others one is reminded of bad English novels and bored children listening to ghost stories by a campfire.

You will not be disappointed."},{"Title":"The king in yellow,","review":"Robert Chambers probably would not be remembered today without H. P. Lovecraft.The sole title he's is now recognized for is The King in Yellow. Like most literary works, it was drifting into the dark and cold zone of cultural oblivion. Then he was caught in the gravity well of that coalescing star of weird fiction, H. P. Lovecraft. And, once illuminated by Lovecraft's in his Supernatural Horror in Literature, this work became sort of a bright satellite beckoning Lovecraft fans to explore it.But Chambers' book is one of those moons with only one face of any interest.To be sure, there is the appearance, in several connected stories, of the sinister effects and reputation of the titular volume and its enigmatic references to the Pallid Mask and Carcosa and Hastur and the lake of Hali. And the notion of such a book definitely inspired Lovecraft to create his more famous book of blasphemy, the Necronomicon.But that's only half the book, five weird stories. This group of stories is just connected enough to justify reading in order.\\"The Repairer of Reputations\\" first seems to be an unexpected piece of science fiction, the future world of 1920 as imagined in 1895 with attendant projections of Progressive-era politics, turn of the century American imperialism, and contemporary anti-Semitism. Taken on those terms alone, it's interesting, but we also get a plot about a mysterious Mr. Wilde who has allegedly built up, via social coercion and blackmail, a vast network of political control. Such a powerful network, in fact, that the artist protagonist of the story dreams of using it to usurp his cousin's place as heir to the Imperial Dynasty of America. Or maybe not. Not everything is as it seem,s and some of the clues to that are in later stories.\\"The Mask\\"'s plot - hinging on an artist who has discovered a way of petrifying living matter while preserving its most delicate structures - has little interest and kind of a sappy ending. However, the bits expanding Chambers' mythology and the mystery of the King in Yellow make it worth reading.\\"In the Court of the Dragon\\" is another slight story. After reading The King in Yellow, its hero encounters a menacing organist at a church service and begins to see the threatening man everywhere. As with \\"The Mask\\", the real interest is the tantalizing bits we get about \\"the towers of Carcosa\\".\\"The Yellow Sign\\" is justifiably the most anthologized of the stories here and the high point of the book. Like most of the stories in the book, it involves an artist. Outside his studio, he sees a young man who reminds him of a \\"coffin-worm\\". His favorite model, for whom he has great affection, tells him of a dream she had with the same man driving a hearse with the artist as its dead cargo. Chambers not only packs plenty of weirdness in, gives us the largest description of the contents of The King in Yellow of any story here, but also gives us an ending which I suspect influenced Lovecraft's work.\\"The Demoiselle D'Ys\\" eschews the usual Paris or New York City settings of the other stories, but it's a standard and predictable time-slip romance.And that's it for the book's interest as weird fiction. We then get a bunch of enigmatic vignettes and poems and then a batch of uninteresting and forgettable romantic stories of American artists in Paris. To be fair, though, there is one interesting part in \\"The Street of the First Shell\\" set, it seems, during the siege of Paris in the Franco-Prussian War of 1871. There is an extended passage in part three when the hero joins a French army attempting a breakout. It is an eerie account with a supernatural quality in its descriptions of the fog-shrouded battle, the confusion, and vivid bits of description.So, for those who are interested in Carcosa and the related bits of Chambers' mythology (actually some of it comes from Ambrose Bierce), the first half of this book is a must read. For those just looking for good quality weird fiction, just read \\"The Repairer of Reputations\\" and \\"The Yellow Sign\\"."},{"Title":"The king in yellow,","review":"Has anyone noticed the plagiarism regarding the Japanese movie [now remade in the United States] called \\"The Ring\\" and \\"The King In Yellow\\"? --In the 1895 novel, whoever read this banned play went mad . . . and in \\"The Ring\\" whoever came upon a video turned up dead.

Its generally worth picking up for the better half of its tales, and also one for Lovecraft enthusiasts, as the Yellow Sign has come to be incorporated into the Cthulhu mythos by later writers, and is now featured in the various Cthulhu board and card games, etc.However, this edition leaves something to be desired. Its cheaply printed, and full of typos and formatting errors. I'd recommend finding a better edition before purchasing."},{"Title":"The king in yellow,","review":"I had so looked forward to reading this book because of the hype it got from the Lovecraft crowd. It was so boring that I had to take a break from it about halfway through and read something else.

The mini-series &#34;king in yellow&#34;is tantalizing, though I respectfully disagree with Lovecraft,I believe the first story to be the masterpiece, though it isa masterpiece of satirical science fiction which wasn'tLovecraft's interest. The other tales are goodalthough weaker. The time travel tale is charmingand beautifully written; Chambers is a good writerin this particular book and should not be disparragedsimply because he wrote in other genres.The second set of tales are enjoyable,though far more conventional, which is whythey so thoroughly disappoint the sci-fi/horror crowd. As a look into the ParisianArt crowd of the era it's fun and the characterizationsare very good.

They are &#34;The Repairer of Reputations&#34;, &#34;In the Court of the Dragon&#34;, and &#34;The Yellow Sign&#34; (obviously). The story &#34;The Mask&#34; makes a passing reference to the play because one of the characters owns a copy of it, but that's it.The rest of the stories are really bland, and have nothing to do with the King in Yellow at all. Most of them have nothing supernatural in them whatever. They seem to be simple filler with no central theme other than their location (France) and their protaganists being artisits.Since this book is free on Kindle, there's no reason not to get it, but I wouldn't bother reading past the first four stories unless you have OCD and have to complete every book you start."},{"Title":"The king in yellow,","review":"I first learned about this book after researching what inspired the horror master himself, H.P. Lovecraft. This book is really interesting to me because it contains well written short stories, but not only that but Robert Chambers was one of the first authors to deal with the idea of what the future could be like. His stories take place about 25 years ahead of when he himself is alive. This makes him pretty fundamental reading to anyone taking a serious interest in science fiction or horror literature."},{"Title":"The king in yellow,","review":"As the title suggests I have been waiting for this book for a good while and I have finally found it here at Amazon. Since many of the hardcovers are out of print \\"The King in Yellow\\" is hard to come by. However some publishers have carried on printing hardcovers and this one is very nice. It has a library binding which means they added a lot of reinforcing stiching to strengthen it and make it easier to read as well. Needless to say they did a good job! I just love the subtle horror of the stories. I almost wish the terrible fictional book of the same name as this one existed."},{"Title":"The king in yellow,","review":"It is nice that someone decided to republish this book (when I was a kid it was almost impossible to find). Anyway, the edition is nice, but it would be cool if someone did an academic edition of the book. I am surprised no one has thought of this yet."},{"Title":"The king in yellow,","review":"The King in Yellow has been put on an inexplicably high literary pedestal among the ranks of classic horror and fantasy fiction {Dedalus Press labels it 'one of the top 100 horror novels of all time}. How disappointing when I stopped reading the critics and actually read the book!This is not a novel, but a collection of 10 loosely-associated stories allegedly connected by an imaginary tome called &quot;The King in Yellow.&quot; The first 5 stories follow the promised theme, with &quot;The Yellow Sign&quot; being the most effective. Also noteworthy are &quot;Court of the Dragon&quot; and &quot;Street of the Four Winds,&quot; which are quite haunting.But the second half of the book is composed of stories that have NOTHING to do with the King in Yellow, nor even a vague reference. It unhappily degenerates into a rather pointless collection of silly romance tales. HALF the book, folks.The worst is &quot;The Street of Our Lady of the Fields,&quot; 40+ pages of cloying drivel about a poofy young artist infatuated with a young French girl who contemplates suicide rather than admit she's a trollop. Lots of pontificating, eye-batting and swooning, complete with a sickening &quot;Oh John, oh Martha!&quot; type finale. Yech.The closer, &quot;Rue Barree&quot; features the *same* spoiled artsy-fartsy Parisian painters, fopping and flitting and being oh-so clever. The twist here, though, is that another poofy artist becomes infatuated with a different trollop. He buys an entire cartload of flowers, then gets drunk and climbs into her balcony. Trollop gives him a flower. No kidding.Horror &amp; fantasy fans will fare better with any of several anthologies with &quot;The Yellow Sign&quot; - but the bulk of this tome is only for true diehards, and masochists."},{"Title":"The king in yellow,","review":"This series of stories is an early science-fiction/horror work first published in 1895. It was recommended by Stephen King in his history of horror, \\"Danse Macabre.\\" Despite its early date, the series is certainly science fiction: the first story projects the setting to 1920, and reviews the \\"history\\" till then, getting it all wrong, of course, but interestingly so. The second story posits the invention of a way to create sculpture instantly from life forms, much as photography had usurped realistic painting in that day, and reminds one of the 3-D printers just showing up now.\\"The King in Yellow\\" is also certainly horror fiction. The first stories are framed by account of a morally appalling play of that name, which drives everyone mad who reads it. The play has widely been banned and criticized from pulpits and boards of review everywhere. The key to this book is that 1895 was the date of Oscar Wilde's trial for perversion, and \\"the King in Yellow\\" is surely a reference to Wilde's play \\"Salome,\\" which was also widely banned and criticized for its moral decadence. The principals in these stories all know each other and are all artists or writers, like Wilde and his friends. A gravely deformed man, apparently deformed by the exigiencies of law, is a mad character in the lead story named Wilde, and he has a cat that alternately attacks him and lounges on his lap purring: the reference is presumably to Wilde's unstable lover, Lord Alfred Douglas, who was responsible for most of Wilde's problems and his eventual imprisonment and death not long after release. (See the excellent modern biography of this remarkable character, \\"Bosie\\" by Douglas Murray.)\\"The King in Yellow\\" therefore fits in with a then-literary fashion of revulsion toward the Wilde fin-de-siecle decadence, especially after Wilde's trial, when even his famous illustrator of \\"Salome,\\" Aubrey Beardsley, cut him dead in Paris when Beardsley happened to walk past a caf&eacute; where Wilde was sitting. (See the brilliant and definitive modern biography \\"The Secret Life of Oscar Wilde\\" by Neil McKenna.) \\"The Green Carnation\\" was another such work, published anonymously and variously attributed to men who had travelled with Bosie, at least, and had heard libelous stories of misbehavior with young boys.\\"The Green Carnation\\" doesn't stand on its own: it's a roman &agrave; clef and you need to know the key. \\"The King in Yellow\\" does stand on its own, however, being a creepy series of horror stories with surprisingly modern notes of science fiction. After the framed stories, there is a charming if traditional story involving falcons, and then some psychological thrillers not related to the eponymous series."},{"Title":"The king in yellow,","review":"Robert W. Chambers is a romance novelist caught up in the Gothic, romantic nonsense that was the Victorian era of long-winded, overly dramatic and moody books that were better used for kindling in the long English winter nights than for reading. I guess he must have thought his syrupy tales of love weren't selling, so he turn a right turn off the Harlequin Romance Turnpike and headed for Pulpsville.He could have been another Maugham, but he wasn't as good with characters. He could have been another Fitzgerald, but his literary tapestry was often quite bleak.So, with &quot;The Repairer of Reputations&quot; you have what could have been an edgy Wells story about a future world with Suicide Booths (anyone watch Futurama?) and an Imperial United States and a weird book that makes people go mad...blah blah blah...it shows a story in need of a good editor.Its keynote short story, &quot;The Yellow Sign&quot; is reprinted often enough that you don't need to buy this book to read it. It is the best tale in the book and remains one of the best short stories in the genre. &quot;Repairer of Reputations&quot; is to &quot;The Yellow Sign&quot; what Meatballs 2 was to the original. The rest of the stories equate to all subsequent films featuring the Bill Murray-less Camp North Star. Of course &quot;Meatballs&quot; is no &quot;Stripes&quot; and likewise &quot;The Yellow Sign&quot; is no &quot;Dunwich Horror&quot; but its still a very good story. Yes, there is the vapid love story between the cynical artist and the young model Tessie and, yeah, there's no explanation why the artist has the most totally evil book in the universe in his closet, and yeah, a lot of what happens just does - without any set-up or rational cause...but when the puffy dead guy looks up at you from the churchyard, its time to clean the shorts, my friends.The main reason this book is a must-have for the collector of 20th century horror fiction is that it is part of the genre's development. Lovecraft and others claim it as an influence and a particularly large building block in the foundation of modern horror. So what if three of the stories could have been written by chimps with crayons tied to their toes? Heck, not all books of the Bible are rip-snorting romps through the afterworld, either. But most Christians still have an uncracked copy somewhere in the house. Not to say &quot;KIY&quot; is as important to the genre as the Bible is to its own, but it contains bits and pieces often quoted and expanded upon by Lovecraft and his posse when they constructed their universe of evil monsters, unnammable and indescribable abominations.Bottom line: If you study it, you must own it.

Too bad to resell."},{"Title":"The Serial","review":"The Serial is a soap opera set in Marin County, California. Just north of the Golden Gate bridge it is the affluent epicenter of the self-obsessed. It's the tail end of the decade and the free spirit ideals of the hippy generation have become commodified and trend obsessed: natural fibres and organic produce are de rigueur, radical chic is bought in designer boutiques and everyone talks (without ever really communicating) in the psycho-babble of faddish self-help manuals. Transcendental meditation, personal growth, rebirthing, zen jogging and pet psychiatry are the order of the day. Though everyone in the hip Marin enclave thinks they're liberated and really together, they've simply become an hilarious parody of the straight world they're trying so hard to leave behind. The soap follows Kate and Harvey Holroyd's attempts to keep up with their wacked-out neighbours' fashionable credentials. A year in which they have a trial separation and experiment unsuccessfully with alternative partners and lifestyles.The book has 52 short (2 page) chapters that my significant other and I found just right to read to each other at bedtime.The book was often villified by fellow Marinites. Marin County had all of the wacky new age stuff, open marriages, etc., long before the rest of the country did, and this book follows a couple locked deep in the heart of it. Maybe it's not so surprising now, but it was certainly a shocker then. Otherwise, it's a funny blast from the past which means even more to me as I have lived there."},{"Title":"The Serial","review":"I read this novel as an adolescent when it first came out and was prepared to find it dated because I remembered, vaguely, that it was about open relationships and all sorts of hippie stuff that was so prevelant at the time.How a novel that is so ensconced in a time and place can still sound relevant is remarkable. If you were to change some of the details--hairstyles, labels, even the television programs--you could transplant these characters into the present without compromising the characters or their experiences.I reread it and found myself laughing and cringing. If everything old is new again then this book definitely proves the point. For better or worse, maybe we have not come as far as we had thought."},{"Title":"The Serial","review":"This book is hilarious.

Can we spoof the 70s California lifestyle more than it spoofs itself? No easy task, but McFadden pulls it off quite well. And her wit and wordplay are sharp enough to draw blood. The only negative is that the characters don't grow and the plot is just a one-trick pony trotted out again and again. Yes, that IS part of the point! Part of the satire. I get it. But still, that repetitiveness did make me glad to spread it out over several sittings. I like the book, and I'm happy I have her Pulitzer-nominated memoir on my shelf, unread, waiting for me. It's a test of my willpower."},{"Title":"The Serial","review":"I remember reading this when it first came out years ago and loving it.

I have no idea why I was smart enough to buy it when it came out, but we have loved it ever since. It is spot-on about the time and place, spot-on about the language, the attitudes, every nuance, in fact. The drawings are satirical and very close to beautiful at the same time, and there's a real tension between the humor and the precision of them.McFadden is a remarkably funny and unusually clever writer, not only here but in her wonderful memoir, \\"Rain or Shine\\", as well. I wish her newspaper columns would be collected into a book; I bet that would make a wonderful read too.Clearly, it is no longer practical to obtain a first edition, and the regular size paperback couldn't have quite the same impact, but I'm sure it would still be extrememly entertaining to anyone who lived through the 70s in Marin County, knew someone who did, wished they had or were glad they hadn't.Sorry to say, the movie, with its very fine-but-not-quite-perfectly-cast stars, didn't quite make it."},{"Title":"The Serial","review":"Having grown up in SoCal in the 70s (although in the striving lower middle class), this novel hit home in more ways than I should admit.

The book is completely bend in several places, and a few pages were ripped.I am not a happy customer right now"},{"Title":"A Land of Stone and Thyme: An Anthology of Palestinian Short Stories","review":"The book contained 38 works by 22 writers. It focused mainly on the generation that came of age in the 1960s and 1970s, and three earlier writers, Emile Habiby, Samira Azzam and Ghassan Kanafani. Most of the stories weren't dated precisely, but the majority appeared to come from the 1970s and 1980s, and the rest from the 1960s and early 1990s.An introduction briefly mentioned Palestinian short story writers going back to the 1920s, but dismissed works from the early years as overly didactic and lacking subtlety. Writers who were published in the 1940s or 1950s such as Aref al-Azouni, Najwa Qawar, Asma Touba, Abdulamid Yasin and Jabra Ibrahim Jabra were mentioned, but nothing from them was included.The pieces in the book were grouped under the themes of paradise lost, exile, refugees living abroad in hostile cities, various kinds of miscommunication, life and death, and dreams of paradise redeemed. The themes were compelling, but for me a number of the works weren't especially striking illustrations of them or utterly memorable stories.Those that were included a piece by Farouk Wadi (\\"Black Lines\\") about a protagonist who lacked identity papers, a job, a lover, a home, and eventually freedom -- except within the span of his imagination -- and two by Ahmed Omar Shaheen: \\"The Tree,\\" which used the changes to a beloved tree, its tying, branding and withering, to symbolize history, and \\"Four Colors,\\" which contained one of the anthology's few positive visions, that of an established homeland. Another was \\"Flying Carpet,\\" by Riyad Baidas, involving a conversation between a Palestinian and an Israeli that aimed to show how they saw differently things like their surroundings, human contact and peace of mind.A number of the other stories were too brief (1-2 pages) and/or dreamlike and diffuse for me to understand. Many recalled parables by Kafka. Lack of familiarity with cultural or social references and allusions probably made this kind of writing more difficult than usual to grasp.An example of this type would be a story about a woman who stepped outside to pluck leaves from a vine, was stopped by a guard of the \\"ruling party's headquarters\\" and asked what she was doing. She gave him a recipe for the leaves and was asked to let him taste the dish. Returning home, she saw a sunken car looming out of torrents of water, thought drowning was a bad omen and a sign that she shouldn't return, and went home without looking behind her.Opponents, whether \\"Zionist\\" or those in cities in the Arab world where some of the works took place, when they appeared, were usually at some distance in the background. Dislocation, dream visions and despair were at the fore. It was a surprise that so few stories focused on the loving relations between, say, a couple or parents and children or friends.One that did, \\"The Man Who Lies a Lot,\\" by Zaki Darwish, showed a father's love for his young daughter ending unintentionally in tragedy, in magic realist style. In another, the budding relationship between two teenagers was broken up when the girl was detained for throwing a Molotov cocktail. In another, the narrator's life had been wrecked by the shooting death of his pregnant wife. Many of the stories contained an isolated protagonist, nearly three-quarters were written in the first person.In the end, I appreciated this anthology mainly for the pieces named above, several stories by Kanafani, and one by Azzam, whose work I read here for the first time. Readers interested in writing by Palestinian authors are naturally among those who'd find the collection worthwhile. I wondered whether additional writers and short stories in more direct, naturalistic styles were available for inclusion in it to represent the times. And whether earlier writers could've been added without detracting from the themes."},{"Title":"A Land of Stone and Thyme: An Anthology of Palestinian Short Stories","review":"Interesting introduction to the Palestinians own perceptions of their occupation and diaspora. Also a good window into a literary tradition very different from that of the West - and therefore it can sometimes be hard for Western readers to fully understand some of the cultural and literary allusions. Subjects are often approached very indirectly. Unsurprisingly, stories are bleak, raw and sad at times. They're also very personal, and a good counter-balance to the usually very politicized accounts of the situation in the media."},{"Title":"the Inheritors","review":"\\"...It seemed to end a little abruptly; I felt like I was just beginning to get to know the humans, and would have liked to know more about them, if not in further chapters, then perhaps in a sequel. Most people are probably only familiar with an earlier novel of Golding's, Lord of the Flies, since it seems to be a required reading staple in high schools across the country. I really enjoyed reading that one when I took senior English, and I'm not sure now why it took me so long to read something else of his. I definitely recommend this for something a little out of the ordinary on your reading list, especially since this is Golding's favorite of all his own work.\\"For full review, please visit me at Here Be Bookwyrms on Blogger!herebebookwyrms dot blogspot dot com"},{"Title":"the Inheritors","review":"I wouldn't have read the book if i didnt need it for a university class. However I did enjoy it. Won't read it again but it was good for a quick read."},{"Title":"the Inheritors","review":"Make this a 2.5 star review because I\`ll give Golding the benefit of the doubt that his writing is way over my head. No reason to mark his novel down just because my poor Cro-Magnon pea brain couldn't follow it. However, I expected better execution in the writing from a Nobel Prize winner.The story line and point of view are good. If this isn't a parable about the effect that human contact has with any other species, environment, or place, I don't know what is. Golding gets points for making me ashamed of my own species as he describes what happens when the peaceful Neanderthal world collides with Homo sapiens in very dramatic and unpleasant ways.Perhaps that is his point; the Neanderthals were pushed out of existence because they were not as intellectually developed as their Homo sapiens \`Inheritors'.I caught on early that the Neanderthals' \`pictures' were personal ideas and memories, and the \`shared pictures' are ideas and memories transmitted telepathically. However, Golding tries to describe these pictures in a contrivance of words instead of pictures, and decides to constrain the description of the pictures to the individual's limited perception. That was a noble goal, and done well. However, when he cannot succeed via that route in describing events, he inserts an expository third-person (writer)point of view. That completely confused my pea brain about what was happening. Some scenes are terribly confusing because of this.I likened my experience of reading \`The Inheritors' to that of Anthony Burgess' \`A Clockwork Orange', which IMHO was a more successful writing experiment. Burgess at least provided us with a glossary to define the futurespeak of his Droog culture. Golding could have invented a word-picture map.I cannot believe that schools are recommending this as a reading assignment. But then in my day they were forcing the dreadful \`Catcher in the Rye' on us."},{"Title":"the Inheritors","review":"As a fan of Lord of the Flies and someone very interested in the subject matter of this novel - the interface between anatomically modern humans and Neanderthals - I was really looking forward to reading this book. Sadly, it failed to deliver either in terms of the story and writing quality I expect of Golding or as an interesting exploration of its topic.Golding's portrayal of the Neanderthals - the main characters of the book through whose eyes we experience its events - suffers from outdated notions of these intelligent and resourceful hominins as bestial if likable buffoons. One wonders how these dunderheads survived the harshest imaginable conditions for hundreds of thousands of years.Apart from that, I think Golding had the right idea, imagining a group of anatomically modern humans appearing as newcomers and coming into conflict with the indigenous Neanderthals. It's fertile ground for drama and Golding does not fail completely to exploit it. But as another reviewer commented, I think his ambition exceeded his grasp, and whether it's because he chose to imagine his main character as a Palaeolithic \\"Rain Man\\" or because his literary powers weren't chugging on all cylinders, Golding did not attain the clarity, coherence, or emotional impact I expected of him. Unlike fine wine, this book has not aged well."},{"Title":"the Inheritors","review":"One might think that Aesop could have covered such an elementary principle with a more direct and poignant simplicity and essentialy kept it more moving. Perhaps I am just too much a fan of the haiku and other displays of Eastern efficiency and Golding's overdone style is simply not my interest, but there is only a certain degree one can take the &quot;we are simple people so we must burden a perceptive reader with our intellectual baggage&quot; novelty just so far before it becomes a chore to read.One more thing, on the back of my book there is a quotation from the New York Times Book Review which reinforces my disdain for their apparent practice of reading a summary of any classic author before proceeding to pelt him with praise. &quot;His prose is forceful and compact. He tells a rousing good story.&quot; The story is laborious, the prose is detailed and soft, not forceful, and I can not imagine anyone in their right mind declaring his prose &quot;compact&quot;. It's laughable.I suppose I should read &quot;The Lord of the Flies&quot; before my opinion of Golding falls too far.The only reason I didn't give it 1 star is because I've read some truly horrific books."},{"Title":"the Inheritors","review":"At a first glance the book just seems to tell a story that kind of makes little sense at points but is very baisic all in all. This first notion isn't true at all. When you read it over carefully and study it you start to get a sense of that great complexity of the book. If you have to read this book for a class make sure you read it a couple of times it really isn't what it seems."},{"Title":"the Inheritors","review":"Golding's \\"The Inheritors\\" was originally published in 1955, and was his first book after \\"Lord of the Flies\\" made his name. Unfortunately, while his first novel was intriguing, well-written and suspenseful, \\"The Inheritors\\" is one of the most bizarre and confused novels of its time.There's no real story here. Neanderthal man encounters cro-magnon, and is killed off. While it sounds like an exciting premise, this book actually consists of little more than endless, repetitious, vague landscapes, repeated over and over and over again. These landscapes, which describe each and every leaf, rock, patch of dirt or sparkle of light on the water of a flowing river, take up literally sixty percent of this brief but agonizingly slow moving novel's pages. Along with the landscapes, we are told in painfully tedious detail of each character's physical movements as he or she walks among the minutely described leaves, rocks and patches of dirt, while looking at the sparkle of the light on the river. These details take up most of the rest of the book. There is very little here that actually constitutes narrative; instead, there is only description and accumulation of sentences.The two main characters, Fa and Lok, are quite different. While Fa is a smart and resourceful Neanderthal, Lok, who stands at the center of the descriptions, is extraordinarily dense and slow-witted, even for a caveman. Within a few pages, this reader found Lok annoying and exasperating. Why Golding chose to make him the center of the book is a mystery.One last point. This novel seems to have been edited severely (and not particularly carefully) from a longer manuscript, since many pages and the entire second-to-last chapter don't flow together in a coherent fashion. This only adds to the book's inertia and mystification. It's amazing that this was ever published in any form.I really wanted to like \\"The Inheritors.\\" Unfortunately, I had to force myself to finish it and ended up loathing it as much as any book I've ever read."},{"Title":"the Inheritors","review":"William Golding likes to kill you with detail in this book and he comes pretty close! There is one part about a fox and you wish that you would just die. The characters are confusing and the book is just bad!"},{"Title":"the Inheritors","review":"I'm reading this reviews and I'm just apalled. So it's boring isn't it? What did you expect for Christsakes, fireworks? It's just a bloody book and it's full of letters. In a way it's not finished until you read it. And it's up to you to bring it to life in your own brain. Have you got one? Stick to Swcharzenager."},{"Title":"the Inheritors","review":"This book frustrated me to no end. While I can respect the endeavor to write a book from the perspective of prehistoric man, it just didn't follow through. While Golding's theme of dichotomous man was intriguing, switching from character to character, not clarifying who was who, and the generally unengaging characters made this a very average reading experience for me."},{"Title":"the Inheritors","review":"I had the honor of reading this book in my 9th grade Advanced English class and while I am an avid reader and love all different types of literature this book still makes me cringe when I see it on summer reading list.While I've read review and I wish I read what they read because it seems like a very good book, but I could not make it through this book to save me. It was 10years ago I had to read this book and I often wonder if I picked it up today would it make any sense? But out of all the books I read throughout highschool and College this book is tedious and very difficult to read.Even with a tutor and note taking I still did not pass the exams that were related to this book."},{"Title":"the Inheritors","review":"We don't know what they were thinking when they chose this book as required reading but it was bad with a capital B. We love reading but give us a break. Lord of the flies must have been written by another author. We do not recommend this book unless you need help falling asleep."},{"Title":"the Inheritors","review":"A previous reviewer said that as a teacher he's found that students never fail to enjoy William Golding's THE INHERITORS. When this reviewer was a sophomore English student, I can assure him that I failed to enjoy this book. My teacher thought this book was one of the all-time literary greats. I just thought it was boring.And now I have an even bigger reason to dislike this book. I happen to hate reading screeds that trash the author's own ancestors. I'm sure homo sapiens were not perfect, but please show me a race or culture of people who are.My plea to high school English teachers everywhere: If you must require your students to read Golding, have them read LORD OF THE FLIES. It's marginally better than THE INHERITORS and, if I remember correctly, does not include ancestor bashing."},{"Title":"the Inheritors","review":"Unfortunately, I have been forced to read this novel for my English class. It is extremely difficult due to the fact that the main characters haven't mastered a little thing we like to call language yet. Because Golding refuses to help the reader along with proper narration, the outcome is nothing short of a migrane. Just wanted to give all of you presently sane people out there a little warning before throwing all of that sanity away attempting to decipher meaning in this book."},{"Title":"the Inheritors","review":"Golding simply holds up as an excellent, if not classic, author no matter what subject he researched and pursued. I couldn't put this novel down. Golding takes his readers on a journey into a world seen through the eyes, visions, and emerging language expressions of primitive man. His sensitively drawn characters, whose language is limited, form \`pictures' in their minds and use this mental illumination to guide them to food, to their seasonal homes and to acquaint them to possible dangers. The descriptions are marvelous: cold, wet, hungry, dependence on a sense of smell (you find yourself sniffing a lot), stones for weapons, hyenas signaling a kill for the band of our earliest ancestors to steal, recipes cooked in a style that remind one of haggis (no refrigerator raiding is elicited in this read by the way) and a lush plant entwined forest of the early spring replete with mystical ice women to be worshipped.Within the pages, the author's imagination, ideas, and symbols are used at their best removing the reader from the world of 2001 into a consideration of the earth and stars alone, untouched by any sort of technology. Essentially it is Lok and his small Neanderthal band that are faced with other humans, unlike themselves, for the first time. The 'other' (homo-sapiens) is armed with bows and arrows, sharpened tools made from bone and an ability to cross rivers and lakes by rowing logs. Golding possibly was inspired by the scientific find of a primitive people who could cross the water discovered sometime in the early 1950's. In any event this is a story that readers will find to be absorbing and has the potential to provide an insight into a daily life of a society devoted to survival with only the earth as a guide to how. Wiliam Golding tells a stirring, astonishing story with a writer's technical virtuosity applied as only he can do."},{"Title":"the Inheritors","review":"I haven't been so emotionally involved in a book since...well, for a long time.This novel is about a family group of Neanderthals who travel to their cave for the warmer part of the year and meet there a group of modern men. The resulting events are as intense and terrifying for the reader as they are for the Neanderthals. Because Golding shows everything from their point of view, we are often left as puzzled and uncomprehending as they. The descriptions of objects the we know about -- bows and arrows, boats, alcohol -- are written as the Neanderthals saw them. The actions of the modern humans -- their rituals and hierarchy -- Golding makes successfully foreign -- but when we sit and think about what we've read, we realize, wait, I *know* this, this is what humans do.The characterization is achieved deftly and sensitively, Lok and Fa are compelling as is their fate. Prehistory was very likely *not* like this -- but the themes stand, and this book is powerful.I do not think Golding is doing a disservice to our species, because this is how we are. He is telling a damn good, if tragic, story. I will re-read this book over and over again, I know. Golding is truly great, and this book is greater, in my opinion, than the oft-assigned &quot;Lord of the Flies.&quot;"},{"Title":"the Inheritors","review":"This amazingly inventive piece of fiction takes on some of the same themes the author dealt with in Lord of the Flies, but in a surprising way. In this novel, the protagonists are the last of the Neandrathals who are in deadly conflict with emergent Homo Sapiens for their survival. Golding imagines these people as being essentially pre-verbal and it is a testiment to his skill as a writer that he can create effective characters without the tool of dialogue. Because of this convention, and the need to keep the story from the Neandrathal's (not quite human) point of view, it takes some time for the reader to achieve an understanding of what is happening and why. It becomes, nevertheless, a very moving story and one of the more inventive tales in serious modern literature.As a companion piece from the current Homo Sapien point of view, one might want to read Beards novel about a hypothetical new jump in evolution, Darwin's Radio."},{"Title":"the Inheritors","review":"This book is complex but worth the effort if you have an IQ of more than room-temperature.The comment by a previous reviewer is worth taking up:&quot;And now I have an even bigger reason to dislike this book. I happen to hate reading screeds that trash the author's own ancestors. I'm sure homo sapiens were not perfect, but please show me a race or culture of people who are.&quot; Well, I'd agree, strongly. But it's not as simple as that: the Homo Sapiens Sapiens in The Inheritors are not shown as deliberately and strategically wiping out the last Homo Sapiens Neanderthalus. Rather, they are terrified of them. They think they are defending themselves against horrifying demons - why do they submit to the discipline of the whip to drag the canoe up the portage? Plainly they are half out of their minds with terror, which the Neanderthals cannot comprehend. Further, the Neanderthals, though gentle and innocent, are plainly inadequate. The process of their replacement by the Homo Sapiens Sapiens, or Cro-Magnards, is cruel but it is not morbid. The Neanderthals, it is clearly demonstrated, are at a dead-end (they are only a vestige of a tribe at the beginning of the story). The survival of the Neanderthal infant means some of their gentleness and innocence may survive into the new world. It is actually a relief to get into the Cro-Magnards' minds in the final chapter after the limitation of having to see everything from a Neanderthal point of view. The Cro-Magnards are at one point called &quot;the people of the fall&quot; - in religious terms they are the people of the &quot;Fall&quot; indeed - Postlapsarian Man. Unlike the Neanderthals, they do have knowledge of good and evil, and we see at the end even the rudiments of conscience - which is not to say the end of the Neanderthals is not utterly tragic.Like all Golding's earlier works, this is the exploration of difficult moral dilemnas. There are lessons there but they are not easy."},{"Title":"the Inheritors","review":"Golding's better-known \\"Lord of the Flies\\" examines humanity at its most primitive, and creates a painful but inarguable image. He does that again in \\"The Inheritors,\\" but this time from an outsider's view of humankind. He takes the unique perspective of Lok, a Neandertal, in the brief period when our two species coexisted.The greatest achievement of this book may be in Golding's creation of a whole mentality that is intelligent and articulate, far from the human norm but still comprehensible. His Neandertals are visual people, who think in images. They reason by matching the here-and-now to visual memories. To understand someone means 'to see their picture.' (I've known visual artists who almost seem to work this way.) Their animistic world is a place where fire may wake up, and where a log decides how to place itself in the river. Despite the harshness of their world, they are gentle, affectionate, and hopeful. \\"People understand each other,\\" says one, early on.Although heartfelt by its speaker, the book treats that statement with cynicism and disdain. Homo sapiens arrive, clever, complex, and surrounded by mysterious made objects. Saying much more would say too much - but H. sapiens is a very poor neighbor.Although I like this book, it could have been proportioned differently. I would have looked for more of the interaction with H. sapiens, and described Lok's people more succinctly. I'm not the Nobel winner, though, and Golding is. It's a meaningful, if discouraging look at what being human is all about, from the viewpoint of someone who doesn't.//wiredweird"},{"Title":"the Inheritors","review":"The basic requirement of reading is to remember and connect. I would ask those who have a distaste for such activity to refrain from criticing a book for its ambition and complication. To write successfuly through the eyes of a species whose experience of the world is different from ours is a difficult feat and one which remarkably, Golding has managed to pull off with both relative spareness and grace. Golding's &quot;ancestor bashing&quot; is, in truth, nothing more than a reminder and exploration of a given truth- the &quot;darkness&quot; in the heart of man and a human history full of violence and savagery. Moreover Golding's exploration is complicated- no simple black and white message is being propagated. The carving that one of the Homo Sapiens Sapiens works on at the end of the novel symbolises a future where the surviving Neaderthal will interbreed with the new race of Homo Sapiens. The idea is that modern man is comprised of both the innocent and caring nature that characterises the Neaderthals and the immorality of the more &quot;advanced&quot; species. Darkness visible by its very nature shows both light and darkness."},{"Title":"the Inheritors","review":"The Inheritors takes you back to a time when the gentle Neanderthals became faced with the emergance of Homo-Sapiens, a collision which could only favour the Darwinian imperative of the survival of the fittest.The story unfolds in such a way as to make you identify with our Neanderthal cousins, who, skilled in their own environment but lacking in technology, must face the sheer ignorance of a more technologically advanced &quot;master-race&quot; which sees them as nothing more than strange and dangerous animals.The poignancy of this unequal contest is conveyed in a way which none the less makes Homo-Sapiens bad by accident rather than design. A lesson to all in these days of &quot;ethnic cleansing&quot; and fear of those from other cultures. A haunting morality tale which has you praying for &quot;the other side&quot; to win."},{"Title":"the Inheritors","review":"I read this book about six years ago and I still frequently think about it. The book is brilliant and as savage and ruthless, in its own way, as Shakespeare's Lear. I actually read the book in the first place because I had gotten interested in real Neanderthals: what did they look like, what were they like, where and how did they live, why did they die? etc. I soon discovered that these questions were largely unanswerable; frustrated, I remembered that Golding had written a \\"Neanderthal novel,\\" and, science failing, I turned to art and read it.One of the chief virtues of the book is its invention of \\"Neanderthal consciousness,\\" a rather uncanny and striking sensibility which is definitely superior to animals, and definitely inferior to humans. We are drawn into the intimate--outer and inner--details of their world, and in the end of course they die. Humans populate the book as well, but in a far different way. I cannot say too much more without giving away a critical feature of the book's structure, except to say that the reader has no idea how good the book is until he/she finishes it. You must read it all, and then you will know.Why do the human beings behave the way they do in the book? It is not really possible to answer this question. The eye cannot see itself, and we who are human cannot see....this."},{"Title":"the Inheritors","review":"The Inheritors is a fascinating fable of the time in history (not so long ago - only five hundred generations or so before you, valued reader), when Neanderthals co-existed with homosapiens. Golding brings all his imaginative powers to bear to imagine himself in the Neanderthal consciousness. Simple named characters such as Lok and Mal and Fa witness strange things happening in their limited world - such as the disappearance of their precious log bridge across the river. Horrific things start happening, which shake their world view, their limited conceptions of events as 'pictures' rather than a human consciousness, comunicated in linguistic form. This is the era of the end of their people.Golding draws the human conquerors as advanced only in the sense that they have mobilised natural resources to more sophisticated ends - such as hollowing out trees to make boats, and developing more sophisticated tools than the rudimentary Neanderthal implements. Morally, they are far more savage than the primitives they displace - a cruel, selfish species who will kill those alien to themselves, capture their young and become inheritors of the earth. The Neanderthals are an endearing, enclosed people with tender rituals of caring for each other and burying their dead. Their knowledge of things is fatally limited, and they struggle to express their horror of what is happening to them as they cannot muster up the language. They rely on their simple religion, Oa, the earth goddess who is a far more gentle and tender influence than the harsh pragmatic religion of the homosapiens with their savage stag mutilating rituals.By the end, the last Neanderthal is hunched in a ball, gibbering with grief and bewilderment as he has witnessed the end of his people. The humans, meanwhile, sail aimlessly in their log boats on the river, struggling themselves to make sense of their aims and purpose in a world without structure or meaning.Thirty thousand years later, are things any different?"},{"Title":"the Inheritors","review":"I read THE INHERITORS back in the early 60's when I was a home mother with six kids. The book was so intellectually stimulating that I could not forget it. I have been a Great Books leader, a journalist, and a novelist in the forty or so years since reading THE INHERITORS and I still consider it a classic. I have been asked to nominate a book of the 60's to Pinellas County, Fl. libraries for discussion and have chosen THE INHERITORS. It combines the depth of literature with an implicit concept of the underpinnings of the 60's. My books are STAND FAST and FREEDOM'S COST."},{"Title":"the Inheritors","review":"In reading some of these other reviews, I've discovered that a lot of people found this book worthwhile. I wouldn't say I didn't, but I found it very difficult to read. I held out to the bitter end because I sensed that there was something great here, but I must confess that I was very lost for pages at a time at certain points.As most of the other reviewers have mentioned, I was drawn to Golding's other books (this and The Spire) by my experience with The Lord of the Flies. I recognize that this book may be no less of a masterpiece, but it's unfortunate that it is so inaccessible. I believe that worthwhile things are worth the expenditure of time and effort but, unfortunately, the nature of the modern world is that we don't have unlimited resources to spend on every literary work we come across. So, for good or for bad, the more accessible ones usually win out.I do think I'll hold on to the book and give it a try again sometime down the road, but I have to say it wasn't one of my more memorable reading experiences (as Lord of the Flies definitely was many years ago when I was a youth).I'm reading The Spire now, and much of what I have said about The Inheritors above goes for that book, as well. I'm not through with Golding, though. I intend to seek out yet others of his novels to see what else he had to say."},{"Title":"the Inheritors","review":"Had I known how difficult THE INHERITORS was going into it, I probably wouldn't have read it. Please understand that when I say \\"difficult\\", I don't mean \\"mildly challenging\\", I mean \\"one of the four or five hardest novels I've read in my entire life\\"; if you can picture a version of Faulkner'sThe Sound and the Fury: The Corrected Textin which Benjy, instead of merely being the point of view character for the first quarter of the book, serves the same function for 90% of it, you'll have some idea of what I'm talking about.William Golding was a writer of enormous imagination and subtlety; he requires readers of this novel to empathize with the protagonist, Lok, in a fashion and to a degree that, as far as I'm aware, is unprecedented in fiction. He also never lets the narrative slip into the kind of facile misanthropy that I suspect a lesser writer would. Having said that, it would be disingenuos of me to suggest that I enjoyed this more than I would have if a skilled writer of popular fiction had handled the same subject. THE INHERITORS was, in sum, a fascinating story that for me was largely drained of pleasure by the effort required to figure out what the hell was going on. I wouldn't recommend this novel to anyone who isn't prepared to tackle a very challenging piece of work."},{"Title":"the Inheritors","review":"Really enjoyed this book. Another cautionary tale of the great capacity of Homo Sapiens to destroy, plunder, and feel guilty about it all at the same time.The writing, as is typical with Golding, is sculptured and evocative."},{"Title":"the Inheritors","review":"I looked at this book from the perspective of its title. There is a question of the fate of the Neanderthals, and this book gives one possible, and credible answer. The Neanderthals and the Cro-Magnon were very, very different, according to Golding.The Neanderthals were simple, crude, and gentle, but with an understanding of their own mortality, and employing rituals for important occasions. They may have gone around unclothed, and with minimal tools, sometimes walking on all fours, but they were not \\"animals\\" in the common meaning of that term.The Cro-Magnon people had already been building boats, had used the bow-and-arrow as a formidable weapon, developed a more complex social structure, knew how to ferment honey into liquor, and had an understanding of protection against the elements. These two peoples never seemed to develop a common view of each other, with the Neanderthal having more curiosity than fear, and more fear than curiosity from the Cro-Magnon. In all, a credible look at ancient peoples."},{"Title":"the Inheritors","review":"When asked to read this book my first reaction was, it looks so old, it can't be good. As i started to read it i found it different from all other books that i had read. The book is slow at the start but it does become more interesting as the author discribes the way the world is seen by Neanderthal man; 'pictures' are memories and they believe logs are alive and have a mind of their own. William Golding's view point on their world is really an eye opener and this is a book that should be read by all. Inspiring!"},{"Title":"the Inheritors","review":"I found this to be a very disjointed, and often confusing, description of the clash between two human groups. Golding missed a good opportunity to create a compelling case that the Neanderthals could not compete with the new, more advanced, humans."},{"Title":"the Inheritors","review":"To approach this story as any other is to board a train going the wrong direction. Before reading the first page you have to understand that this tale begins before human intelligence, and that every thought, every sight, sound, smell, taste, and feeling is a simple interpretation by a lower order of being. Just as many have spoken of much of what is written in the Bible as things interpretted by those less technologically advanced as ourselves, Golding endeavors to strip away a million years of evolution and learning and to think like a neanderthal. To enjoy the book the reader must do the same.This is the tale of the extinction of a species and their lack of understanding of what is happening. In that the book is very contemporary. The neanderthals attempt to understand; to put what they see into ideas they can understand, just as we do the same today. Golding bears that philosophical point like a club. However, reading the thoughts of a primitive beast, as interpretted by Golding, isn't so easy as one would think and the story tends to be as hard to follow as a mountain trail. In the end though, I think it's a story worth reading."},{"Title":"the Inheritors","review":"A friend recommended this to me because I'm doing a thesis in philosophy of language and she felt I'd be interested in a book written from a Neanderthal point of view. She believed The Inheritors argued the Neanderthals were unable to compete against Cro Magnon men because their language didn't have words for cause-and-effect concepts, only static images. \\"Now there's a man holding a stick in his hand. Now there's a stick coming through the air at me. Now my arm hurts and is bleeding.\\" Cro Magnon man, by contrast, would describe the same incident as \\"A man attacked me with a spear\\". This is an exciting and ingenious idea.Unfortunately I found this book too slow, immensely difficult to follow at times and I thoroughly disliked the main character, the cowardly, boastful and ineffectual Lok. Had the brave and much smarter Fa been the main character I suspect I would've stuck with it. As it was I gave up halfway through and skipped to the last 2 chapters. I would've liked to see more from the point of view of the Cro Magnons.I get the impression that most of the 4 and 5 star reviews are from people who approve of the misanthropic viewpoint. \\"Yes! humans ARE vicious, fearful, evil, always destroying the gentle and innocent\\". Some humans are like that, most are not."},{"Title":"the Inheritors","review":"But at some points there is just way to much to take in. Although the plot is very interesting and the characters and scene are well developed, you have to be very dedicated to reading this novel.

Told almost entirely from the viewpoint of Lok, a slightly dim Neanderthal \\"with many words and no pictures,\\" it's an interesting story and a sad one. But the power of the tale is softened considerably by Golding's laborious, descriptive prose. At times I found it very hard to understand what was going on, as the Homo sapiens' activities - drinking wine, portaging boats, arguing - were described in Lok's limited terms at length, with little clarity. Discounting those passages, the novel was a good one, capped off quite amazingly with passages in two more narrative voices. First we see Lok as a hairy \\"creature,\\" an \\"it,\\" and then finally we hear the story from the view of one of the humans, who, it turns out, are as scared and confused as the Neanderthals, whom they consider fierce devils. A skillful comment on how far humans have come from a natural state of innocence, acceptance and wonder."},{"Title":"the Inheritors","review":"Golding takes us back to one of the earliest clashes between Homo sapiens and another culture, that of Homo neanderthalensis. In doing so, Golding seems to be pointing out that humanity's distrust of, and often violent response to, alien beings and ideas goes back a long, long time. The Neanderthals are the protagonists for most of this story and we see virtually all the action through their minds. They have a different way of thinking about the world in which they live and in communicating about it. They are the innocents who have the misfortune to encounter an encampment of Cro Magnon men. At the very end, Golding switches the point of view to the Cro Magnons and provides us with a different take on events.As a teacher, I've found this to be a terrific novel for teaching about the clash of cultures, fearing what we don't understand, different ways of seeing, thinking about and imagining the world in which we live. Students never fail to enjoy it."},{"Title":"the Inheritors","review":"The Inheritors tells the story of a small group of Neanderthals, primarily focusing on Lok and Fa, as they encounter strange \\"new people\\" who walk upright, have little body hair, shoot pointed twigs through the air, and ride across the water on hollow logs. The Neanderthal tribe includes a young girl and a baby (\\"the new one\\") who end up with the new people. Lok and Fa must face their fears of the new people as they try to bring the girl and baby home.The word that kept coming to mind as I read and thought about this book was \\"clever.\\" Writing about life from the Neanderthal perspective poses a challenge, and Golding used some clever devices to describe the limitations of primitive beings. Golding's Neanderthals communicate by gesture and empathy as much as by language. Their names are simple compared to the polysyllabic names of the humans. The Neanderthals live very much in the here and now; they aren't good at planning; when they talk about doing something new they say they have a \\"picture\\" of it, as if they are having a vision. They search for food only when they feel hunger; if they're sated they don't bother to store food for the future. They prefer not to eat meat but they will if one animal has been killed by another; they don't want the \\"blame\\" of causing an animal's death. They have a touching burial ritual but they don't appear to contemplate the possibility of an afterlife.A startling event occurs toward the end of the novel that makes the whole thing rather depressing, particularly for those who (perhaps unrealistically) expect humans to behave more civilly than Neanderthals. Golding may be saying that the simple decency of primitive life was supplanted by early humans who (like those who followed them) lacked respect for other forms of life, killed ruthlessly, and used their wits to advance at the expense of others. If Golding is saying that these are human traits, the product of an evolutionary imperative, I don't know that the point is particularly profound (although it might have seemed so in 1955 when the book was first published). Still, the story illustrates that lesson in an entertaining way. The last chapter shifts to the point of view of the humans: again, a clever way to distinguish between the dying past and the evolving present, and a device that adds insight by demonstrating that the human's view of the Neanderthal may not have been much different than the Neanderthal's view of the human.According to the cover blurb, some critics think The Inheritors is Golding's best work (and Golding apparently thought so himself). I preferLord of the Flies, but The Inheritors is worth reading. I would give it 4 1/2 stars is Amazon made that option available."},{"Title":"the Inheritors","review":"Lord of the Flies is of course among the toughest acts to follow, and though this second William Golding novel does not match its immortal greatness, it is excellent in itself and would be many writers' best. Fans of Lord will most likely enjoy it, as the misanthropic viewpoint is carried over, and several themes are similar. However, in the first sign of the great diversity that would characterize Golding's fiction, The Inheritors is very different in setting, characters, dialogue, and nearly everything else.Where Lord made waves by using supposedly innocent children to illustrate evil, this focuses on an even more primitive group - the last surviving Neanderthals. Golding's skill truly comes into play here; he uses a limited narrative perspective, an extremely simple style, and broken dialogue to portray the Neanderthals' world. This is of course almost entirely speculative, but there is great verisimilitude; we see how Neanderthals' lives may have been in every aspect from speech to relationships to social functions. Golding pulls a brilliant trick by throwing us into the story with no introduction, leading many to assume primitive humans are featured. However, it eventually becomes clear that they are a prior step on evolution's ladder, which may first lead to strange surprise. Soon, though, we come to identify with them because of thoughts and feelings that, though far from civilized, are very much human; in particular, the depiction of love is one of literature's least conventional yet one of its most moving.The novel would be interesting for this alone, but it goes further by bringing in early modern humans and vividly dramatizing the ensuing conflict. As one might expect from an author with Golding's pessimistic reputation, the results are dark. Humans recklessly destroy the Neanderthals without realizing their significance or the magnitude of what they have done. They indeed fear the Neanderthals with superstition and ignorant assumptions that they are ostensibly too advanced to make. Along with lack of empathy, these factors get to the heart of Golding's bleak view of humanity, which is put forth less powerfully but more subtly than in Lord. Those stirred by the latter will find themselves agreeing again with Golding's tragic vision, while those who did not take to it for various reasons may be newly convinced.The unique style makes for difficult reading, especially early on, but I strongly encourage anyone having difficulty to persevere. As nearly always in such cases, it soon becomes nearly second nature, and the book is certainly great enough to be worth it. Highly emotional yet extremely thought-provoking, this is one of the rare works that can make one think as easily as it can make one cry. This combination is the key to Golding's greatness, and The Inheritors is a preeminent example."},{"Title":"the Inheritors","review":"Since reading \\"Lord of the Flies,\\" I've stumbled over other Golding titles in hopes I would find the same brevity, clarity, and thought-provoking concepts. \\"The Spire\\" came close, but lacked the imaginative setting. \\"Pincher Martin\\" had the setting, but became so myopic as to be disorienting, eventually losing its footing.Along comes \\"The Inheritors.\\" Reviews here gave mixed signals: \\"A mess.\\" \\"A work of genius.\\" \\"Bored to tears.\\"As with Golding's bestselling masterpiece, \\"The Inheritors\\" pulls us quickly into the story of an isolated people. This time, instead of marooned school children, we discover Neanderthal types who are utterly believable and likeable. This alone shows Golding's genius. He makes us care about these characters and see them as people we can relate to, and yet he gives little by means of communication or description. They act like humans with true personalities. Soon, though, the group is threatened by another group of pale-skinned Others. These intruders seem equally bent on survival, but by more violent means if necessary.In many ways, this is an elongated short story. It could've been told in less pages, albeit with less ambience. While I admired the setting and characterization, I despaired for more plot, more action, more...something. In so many ways, this was a masterful book. In the end, however, it seemed to be a work of muddled beauty. It lacked impact. For those who love Golding's style, as I do, you will surely appreciate this book. For others, it may be a slight disappointment."},{"Title":"the Inheritors","review":"I too, am appalled by the number of ignorant, uninformed Amazon reviews of \\"The Inheritors\\" by William Golding. It must be his greatness that has created such a polarizing reaction. It's difficult for me to be objective, however, because I am in awe of this book, Golding's craft, and his work in general (I have also read \\"Lord of the Flies\\" and \\"Darkness Visible\\"). However incomprehensible or confusing one finds this text to be, the writing itself is transcendent. And if this book is difficult, then Western culture is definitely in a serious decline. All right, the Neanderthals had some trouble articulating. But please, this is a work of fiction. I am impressed by what must have been prodigious research on Golding's part to gain insight into the world of the Neanderthals, about whose specific reality modern man can only speculate. Whatever the Neanderthals lacked in intellectual capability, they more than made up for in their ability to use their senses, especially that of smell. As well as their possible telekinetic activity, which would have been unencumbered by more advanced intellectual processes. Golding's Neanderthals have an intuitive grasp of their world that is lacking in the modern human; on the other hand, the Neanderthals also live more wholly at the mercy of \\"Oa\\" (Mother Earth). The innocence of the Neanderthals is endearing, the \\"new people\\" Homo sapiens are dangerous and menacing. I felt compassion for the Neanderthals, and contempt for \\"the new people\\". The emotion that binds both species together is fear; -IE- Homo sapiens refer to the Neanderthals as \\"devils\\"; Fa tells Lok that \\"the new people are frightened of the air\\".The prose within \\"The Inheritors\\" is highly poetic; Golding paints an intricate portrait of a primeval landscape, such as our planet will probably never experience again; this description in itself adds to the atmosphere of suspense the author creates in this novel. It is not just that landscape in itself that is impressionable, but also how it is perceived by the Neanderthals and their \\"mind-dream-pictures\\"; -IE- the heightened colors seen by Lok during his hangover from the honey-drink. Golding shrouds his worlds in mystery to create a background of heightened effect, which becomes an integral part of the story; Richard Wagner used a similar technique by employing the orchestra as an additional \\"voice\\" in \\"Der Ring des Nibelungen\\". One of the major themes of this book focuses on the evolution of innocence into corruption; a problem, as other Amazon reviewers have noted, that still exists in humans today. This novel also points out the Machiavellian nature of mankind as whole, specifically in how that behaviour was starting to evolve in Golding's portrait of Homo sapiens. I actually found this work to be more engaging than the more commercially accessible LOTF (and certainly more so than the experimental-yet-inconsistent \\"Darkness Visible\\"). Golding is a recent discovery of mine, and I am looking forward to reading more of his work.Stephen C.

It follows up on Bovill's GOLDEN TRADE OF THE MOORS and fills out Berber history in association with Richard Fletcher's MOORISH SPAIN. The author's stated objective is to examine the Banu Marin's contributions to the development of the Islamic Berber state.This interesting, if sometimes dry, book is divided into 3 main parts, according to the author's Introduction: (1) the Berbers' search for their place in Islamic history, (2) the development of an Islamic State, and (3) the implementation of Islamic Institutions.The first part of the book studies the acculturation and resistance of the Berbers to the society of the conquering Arabs: original physical - and continued social - opposition toward the conquerors; the development of the myth that Berbers were originally of Arabic stock (in opposition to Arab ideas of superiority); and the praise of Berber culture and society during the taifa period of al-Andalus (Islamic Spain) after the fall of the caliphate and the rise of small, ethnic kingdoms & conflicts.The second part of the book deals with the rise of the Banu Marin (or Marinid dynasty of 1250 to 1465) of Zanata Berber stock after the fall of the Almohads. It looks at Arabic and popular opposition to the legitimacy of the Marinids and of the backlash against the Jewish population associated with the Banu Marin regime and the attempt to gain control of appointments in religious and social institutions as the State continued to be reformed along Islamic lines.The 3rd part of the book looks at the evolution of tribal customs as they are integrated into the developing Islamic culture, as well as the development of numerous endowments for religious and other education - especially of the Medresas - and the conflict between the religious schools and the religious leadership. The Conclusion touches on the \\"importance of history in the creation of national identity\\" and the problem of historical accuracy in this context.This book is very much so a scholarly paper - probably developed from an earlier Master's thesis or Doctoral dissertation - complete with a mild style and copious end notes."},{"Title":"The Berbers and the Islamic State: The Marinid Experience in Pre-Protectorate Morocco","review":"\\"For deep background of contemporary problems, \\"The Berbers and the Islamic State\\" is a good place to start. Shatzmillers work explains skillfully, based on much original research, the uneasy relations of Berbers to Islam and the state over the course of a millennium already by the eleventh century, she(Shatzmiller) notes, the Berbers have taken over the state in North Africa, but they also experienced a cultural alienation from what she calls the \\"intellectual onslaught of the Islamic and Arabic norms.\\"--Middle East Forum\\"This book represents one of the first attempts to reconsider Berber resistance and acculturation in the Islamic period. . . . An extremely important contribution to the study of North Africa in the Islamic period that consciously confronts enduring historical biases. Shatzmiller offers extraordinarily detailed research as well as admirable charts and appendices, which are invaluable guides to other scholars.\\" --Arab Studies JournalFrom the International History Review:\\"BOOKS OF AN interpretive nature written in European languages and focusing on Moroccan history between 650 and 1500 are relatively few. If one narrows one's compass to works in English, the number shrinks to the merest handful. Thus, the name of the Mannid family that dominated the Moroccan political scene from 1259 to 1550 is largely unknown beyond the fraternity of historians specializing on Muslim North Africa and'Spain.Unlike their immediate predecessors, the religiously assertive Almoravids and Almohads, the Marinids have been seen as lacking the charisma of religious legit-imacy that resumed with the Sharifian dynasties that succeeded them, and there-fore not to fit well into the master narrative of Moroccan history that weds Islam with monarchy. Rather, they have been portrayed as unsophisticated Berber-speaking tribesmen conveniently filling the time between their charismatic pre-decessors and successors. That they are the last important Berber dynasty in Moroccan history has not been thought important.Against this background, Maya Shatzmiller's insightful and provocative studies of Mannid history and Berber historical identity constitute a welcome new depart-ure in the interpretation of North African history. Rarely does a collection of previously published articles flow so smoothly as to give the impression of being conceived together to be read in the current order; this is one of those rare com-pilations. However, the easy and logical transitions from chapter to chapter con-ceal a deeper structure that contributes to the book's excellence.The three essays making up part l, 'The Berbers' Search for Their Place in Islamic History', were published between 1983 and 1989, well after four of the six subsequent articles on particular aspects of Marinid rule, which appeared between 1976 and 1979. The reader benefits, therefore, from Shatzmiller's leisurely reflections on her detailed research on the Marinids. How many scholars wish they could add to their published books the afterthoughts of a decade later! Though the particular accounts of Jewish courtiers and Muslim divines, of religious schools and pious endowments, and of royal taxation and urban institu-tions are all of substantial interest to specialists, the thematic direction imparted in part l provides a cohesion they could not have had as independent journal articles.Morocco is today an integral part of the Arab world and the Muslim world. From time immemorial, however, its indigenous population spoke one or another Berber language or dialect, as a substantial proportion still does today; and it took several centuries for Islam to supplant the country's pre-existing faiths. The formation of Berber, Arab, and Muslim identities forms the theme of part l. Shatz-miller presents three different approaches, primarily genealogical, to establishing Berber historical identity in written sources from the Middle East, Spain, and North Africa itself, each of them carrying different implications for the relationship of the Berbers to the Arabs and to the Islamic religion.Thus, Shatzmiller sets the stage for her examination of the Marinid practice of government in the following two parts, sparing us in the process a tedious narration of Marinid political history and military campaigns. Not surprisingly, though not as dramatically charismatic in its foundation as earlier and later Moroc-can dynasties, the Marinid polity proves to have relied much more on Islamic values and themes than one would have surmised from a conventional reading of Moroccan history. And its introduction of madrasas, or colleges for the higher study of Islam, furthers a transition to more conventional Islamic institutions. Thus, Shatzmiller turns what was previously a near void in the interpretation of Morocco's history into a complex period of transition.North African history in general, and Moroccan history in particular, have received far less attention in anglophone scholarship than the heartland of the caliphate from Egypt to Iran and Islamic Spain, with its connections to medieval Europe. This has encouraged largely separate interpretations of these two seemingly disconnected wings of medieval Islamic civilization. Shatzmiller has performed a valuable service in helping to fill in the space between those wings, and she has done so with an interpretive flare that should encourage more com-parative study of Islamic societies, not to mention more study of Morocco in particular. Against the value of what she has accomplished in this short book, her sometimes capricious transliteration weighs as nothing.\\"Columbia UniversityRICHAKO W.

Dan honored me by asking me twice to read drafts of &quot;The Contract Surgeon&quot; during it's creation. It's his best work. It has nothing to do with Falconry or dogs. It's rather a Historical Novel depicting Dan's conception of the death of Crazy Horse. Not just the death of the greatest known American Indian War Chief but the death of a social order we today have little record of. In &quot;Instinct&quot;, Anthony Hopkins portrayed for us what we as humans have lost since we separated form wildness. In &quot;The Contract Surgeon&quot; Dan describes how we lost it.Based on the scant facts available today, &quot;The Contract Surgeon&quot; tells the story of the last hours of Crazy Horse as he laid dying in the small Adjutants Office at Fort Robinson in Nebraska Territory in the late 1800's after he tried to surrender. During these short hours, and by the use of flashbacks and other literary tricks, Dan tells the story of the death of the culture of the American Plains Indians.For those of us who have little or no knowledge of American Indian history, Dan provides a chronology that is very helpful and enables Dan to avoid a treatise length book while creating a Novel that is difficult to put down.

But more importantly Dan introduces us to several others like Valentine McGillycuddy, truly a remarkable person the figment of no one's imagination who sought no fame or fortune.Dan's writing are full of questions about what our lives are all about and &quot;The Contract Surgeon&quot; is his best example. &quot;The Contract Surgeon&quot; is must reading for anyone who reads Dan's books for more than just the Falcons, dogs and their relationship to our souls."},{"Title":"Contract Surgeon","review":"I met Dan O'Brien in 1975 when a common love for fine horses, bird dogs and all things wild had enticed each of us into the early advent of what the practical in heart prophisied to be the follies of misguided youth. Our paths crossed and ran parallel for about three years until our separate and multifaceted career paths dictated decisions leading us in different directions. Even though I had been able to follow his successes with the Perigine foundation through reports from common aquaintences, I had not, until recently, known how far Dan had progessed in his desire to become a respected author. THE CONTRACT SURGEON, a far cry from the short stories of his youth, is the combination of careful research, and an intimacy with the land that can only be expressed by someone whose livelihood is hinged upon the vitality of a place as hostile yet fragile as the ancient grasslands of North America. Dan's vibrant word pictures, painted through army surgeon Valentine McGillycuddy's recollections of his own youthful passion for the Great Plains and its inhabitants, create a sensory overload which compelled me to read the whole book in one setting. No contemporary author has driven me to that point in many years. If you have ever connected with the land, fine horseflesh and wild places, keep a bandanna handy. Same goes for the warrior who has wondered how you can hate yet respect and even love the enemy. For the dreamers and the politically correct, who need a reality check, this one is for you too.A fine read, crafted by a man whose misguided youth has proved visionary, not misspent. My compliments to Dan and his own Dr. McGraw. Whoever he is."},{"Title":"Contract Surgeon","review":"This is a well-written and exciting literary historical novel. O'Brien manages to steer clear of the cliches that are rampant in this genre by fully developing all of the novel's characters and creating dialogue that is never stilted or preachy. Above all, he presents a well-paced story set against the background of a complicated and humanistic take on the violent collision of two cultures that may not have been as different as we often think."},{"Title":"Contract Surgeon","review":"This is beautifully written historical fiction with some excellent medical scenes. I'm a librarian and I read everything and this was the best book I've read so far this year. Riveting medical drama, a lovely romance, and excellent historical details make this a terrific read. Highly recommended by me!"},{"Title":"Contract Surgeon","review":"Crazy Horse comes off noble and courageous as he probably was. The author did mix in episodes of the great warrior's cruelty that fell well within the category of atrocity. However, the treatment was not overly sentimental and told of the hostilities that existed between the tribes, who had been united to defeat the white man's ignoring of existing treaties.The surgeon and his love for his wife offered an interesting juxtaposition to the harshness of frontier life. I found this book infomative and enjoyable."},{"Title":"Contract Surgeon","review":"This is the best Dan O'brien book I've read to date. I simply love how he can take an old story and bring it to life by sculpting visions in my head that are vivid months later. I can see the long dry plains and feel the sweltering heat...and sense the cool relief of a pond. Besides the imagery, he is able to bring humanness and emotion to people who are long gone. O'brien has the perfect blend of action and description in his writing..love it. Thoroughly enjoyed this book...and you should too."},{"Title":"Contract Surgeon","review":"O'Brien tells a good story and The Contract Surgeon is a great read. I was particularly intrigued by the way he framed the story, having the narrator, Dr Valentine McGillycuddy, tell his tale from a vantage point of old age, nearly sixty years after the day that Crazy Horse died. This \\"old guy\\" narrator seems to keep popping up in my reading lately, notably in books like RULES FOR OLD MEN WAITING and the recent Pulitzer Prize winner, TINKERS. And it's cool; I like it. O'Brien had the foresight to make the most of this narrative tool by including A Chronology of Events that gives you a thumbnail history of the western Indian wars of the 1870s. This helps you follow the back and forth nature of the narrative. But the principals here - McGillycuddy and his wife Fanny - come across as very real people. Crazy Horse is not quite so well-realized. But perhaps the author felt there had already been enough written about this notorious war chief. Or maybe \\"notorious\\" is the wrong word, because Crazy Horse stories have run the gamut over the years. He has been both villified and deified. My guess is he was just a man, and O'Brien does a pretty good job of making him just that, in this case a pretty good man, who did the best he could. This was a pretty quick read. I was surprised how quickly it was over. If you are interested in western history, you'll probably like The Contract Surgeon. I don't think I've enjoyed a western novel quite this much since reading Will Henry's I, TOM HORN years ago. - Tim Bazzett, author of SOLDIER BOY: AT PLAY IN THE ASA"},{"Title":"Contract Surgeon","review":"The Contract Surgeon is a compelling read that, through the auspices of looking at the Sioux warrior Crazy Horse, provides a mirror that shows a disturbing look at the nature of man. The best read I've experienced so far this year, the novel looks deeply into the plains Indian wars where the reader finds both white man and Indian sharing the human weaknesses of pride, greed, and destructiveness, the latter especially trademarked by the white man here.Easy to discern throughout the story is the author's deep respect for the man called Crazy Horse. Though not turned into a hero or superman, the nobility emanating from him fills the pages.For those looking for a better understanding of the forces that determined the plight of the great plains, look no further. Read this fine work."},{"Title":"Contract Surgeon","review":"I got my book in a good time.

Children learn the letters of the alphabet and enjoy &quot;watching&quot; the letters morph into many different objects, animals, and birds. This book keeps the preschooler next door entertained every time she picks it up."},{"Title":"Alphabatics","review":"In Suse MacDonald's 1987 Caldecott Honor Book Alphabatics, letters transform acrobatically from letters into objects that illustrate the letter and its sound. By way of an introduction, an \\"A\\" in a boxed frame grows arms and legs and vaults out of its box across the first pages of the book until it becomes an acrobat perched on the title on the title page. In later pages, an \\"i\\" splits in half, spreads its wings, and transforms into an insect; an \\"r\\" sprouts feathers and grows a beak, becoming a rooster; a \\"Y\\" bulges and transforms into the head and horns of a yak. Each letter of the alphabet receives a two-page spread. The upper- and lower-case letters are printed in a bold sans serif font in the upper left corner of the left-hand page. Just beneath, either the upper- or lower-case first appears unaltered in a box and its transformation is shown step-by-step across to the pages. The final object is shown on the right-hand page along with the word. The illustrations are comprised of bright blocks of color, presented on a crisp white background. The treatment of the alphabet is letter-focused and demonstrates to children just beginning to recognize letters that letters are special shapes that transform into words and meaning."},{"Title":"Alphabatics","review":"I have a daycare in my home and read as much as possible to my little people...this book has always been a favorite with ages 0-5 ...they love that they can actually \\"read\\" it. I bought this hard back copy for my own grandson. I have worn out about 4 paperbacks."},{"Title":"The Cat","review":"In this 1967 novel (one of roughly 400 published before his 1973 retirement), Georges Simenon portrayed an elderly couple that had come to hate each other. It is not that they had been living together for decades. Both had outlived earlier spouses and wed eight years before. Marguerite fancies herself a fine lady. She still owns some buildings, though her father once owned the whole street, which is named for him. Emile was a working man who helped her with a burst pipe and stayed around. He dotes on a cat that Emile cannot stand for a number of reasons, including concern about her own pet, a parrot.While he is sick, she poisons the cat. He takes vengeance on the tail feathers of the parrot, worries about being poisoned himself, runs away (not very far to a room above the bar his sometimes sexual partner runs) for a while. Marguerite is humiliated by his departure and silently implores him to return, where they continue to prepare food separately and communicate only by notes. As the houses across the street (which her father once owned) are being loudly demolished, several time, \\"he almost spoke to her; he wanted to say something, anything, appeasing words. He realized that it was too late now and that neither of them could turn back.\\" They are together until death doth them part.The novel is a portrait of savage marital disgust for each other, strongly ( but not entirely) slanted to the grievances of the man. Simenon seems to share Emil's view that \\"she needed to be unhappy, a victim of men's wickedness,\\" forgetting no outrage to her refined sensibility and not recognizing any faults of her own. Husbands getting fed up and leaving was a recurrent theme for Simenon (M. Monde Vanishes). \\"The Cat\\" was filmed with Jean Gabin and Simone Signoret as a couple who had once loved each other, a past unlike the one Simenon supplied the characters."},{"Title":"The Cat","review":"The Cat was first published in 1967 as Le Chat. It has been translated into English by Bernard Frechtman. This book has been seen as another autobiographical one, based on the 40 year second marriage of Simenon's mother Henriette, but more (in this interpretation) about the relationship of Simenon and his mother, who remained apparently indifferent to him all her life. Emile Bouin and Marguerite Doise have both lost their spouses, and live opposite one another in a cul de sac once owned by Marguerite's father, a biscuit manufacturer fallen on hard times. They decide to remarry, for companionship's sake. They are both in their seventies. Emile moves into Marguerite's house, and soon the incompatibilities in their personalities begin to manifest themselves. Emile is working class, unpretentious, has simple tastes, is methodical and practical. Marguerite is middle class, affected, hypochondriac and fussy. Matters come to a head over the pets the two have, Marguerite a parrot and Emile a cat. The cat dies and Emile believes Marguerite has poisoned it. He retaliates by attacking the parrot, who becomes ill and dies. Marguerite has it stuffed and keeps it in the lounge room as a perennial reproach to her husband. Soon the couple devise separate housekeeping arrangements, and communicate only by notes. With considerable mastery Simenon evokes the past details of these two lives through reveries and flashbacks, and in the process evokes a distant way of life with astonishing conviction and realism. Over the entire book Simenon casts a tone of gentle melancholy, of sadness at the ways people cut themselves off from one another. Three years after the book was published Simenon's mother died, and intimations of this may have affected the highly intuitive Simenon while he was writing. Though Emile can make contact with others, and for a while moves in with the earthy, rather wise tavern keeper Nelly, who resembles in many ways his working class former wife Ang&eacute;le, Marguerite is more limited. They both realise that she needs him, and that however poor it may be, they do have a relationship, and that this is better than no contact at all. They continue to exchange notes, Emile continues to write \\"The Cat\\", until one day Marguerite dies. A horrifying tale, and somehow unendurably wise."},{"Title":"The Cat","review":"The Cat is also one of the short psychological Simenon novels. It is a singularly unpleasant book. It tells the story of a couple in their 70s who stopped speaking to each other after killing each other's pets years ago. As difficult as the subject matter it shows Simenon's style to perfection-- short terse sentences, flat and sympathetic treatment of characters. An excellent example of his work, even if the plot means that it will never be one of my personal favorites."},{"Title":"The May flower, and miscellaneous writings","review":"Purchased because I work on geanalogy and our distant relatives are Bullingtons/Billingtons.

Since then it has made up for lost time, and as Stuart Crainer writes, we have all become managers, whether we manage hospitals, schools, funeral parlours, farms or football teams. Management has become &quot;the art and science of our times, and management thinkers have become its high priests, the guru's&quot;.Despite this, there is still no one ultimate truth. Theories mushroom, each one promising more than its predecessor. The growth is fed by aspirant managers &quot;seeking recipes for success and ideas that can distinguish them from the crowd.&quot; Many managers occupy their time &quot;inflicting ill-advised ideas on their organisation.&quot;Yet most organisations are being run the way they were when Drucker began to study them. &quot;We have a lot of new tools&quot; says Drucker&quot;, but not very many ideas.&quot; The resulting cynicism, we learn, has made Dilbert the best selling business book of all time. As, Dilbert himself puts it, &quot;re-engineering was invented by Dr Jonas Salk as a cure for Quality Programmes&quot;.This is not to write off the guru mega-industry. Nor can it relieve us of the pressure to keep abreast of the latest fashion. As Crainer points out in his introduction, &quot;if your son or daughter discovers you have not heard of the latest pop sensation, they are incredulous. ... Managers behave similarly when they discover a colleague, who knows nothing of the latest addition to the management vocabulary.&quot; The only thing worse that slavishly following management theory, is ignoring it completely.In his ultimate business Guru book, Crainer summarises one hundred (fifty in my soft back edition but there seems to be a new edition, in print and available from Amazon.com in 24 hours) of the most significant contributors to the management literature. As befitting a young discipline, he has spread his net appropriately wide.Thus we find academics such as Michael Porter, Philip Kotler, Edgar Schein and Douglas McGregor whose theories are studied in business school. We find executives such as Henry Ford, Alfred Sloan, Harold Geneen, and Thomas Watson Junior who, through practice and theory, put their stamp firmly onto the corporate world. And we find the consultants Marvin Bower, Tom Peters, Bruce Henderson and James Champy, who produce &quot;the best ideas&quot;, while in the corporate equivalent of a research laboratory.Also appropriate is the wide spectrum of belief. Arch conservatives such as Frederick Taylor and Igor Ansoff are included, along with the liberal left such as Peter Senge, and Frons Trompenaars. We find Charles Handy &quot;who has an unerring tendency to state the obvious&quot;, but also with Richard Pascale, who tackles the tension of real life contradictions, head on.Each guru is introduced with a quote, their breakthrough ideas in key words and their most important book. This is followed by three to five pages discussing their contribution and putting it into the context of current thinking. Crainer presents each guru with an appropriate mix of sympathy and scepticism.Crainer has interviewed and worked with many of the worlds top business thinkers, and this is evident in his work. He presents enough to enable the reader to hold his own, then shows us where look should we want to delve deeper.Dilbert, the one great thinker not included, said: &quot;everything I've learnt in my entire life can be boiled down to a dozen bullet points, several of which I have already forgotten&quot;. This book presents the dozen bullet points of the other 50 thinkers who 'made management'. Some of these points are indeed worth remembering."},{"Title":"Ultimate Business Guru Book (Ultimates)","review":"I really enjoyed this book. The summaries of the gurus' ideas are concise, and the biographical details of the gurus interesting and not too long. The book made me want to explore the works of some gurus.

Now I want to read all the other authors because they all are amazing writers. The strength of the writing keeps you interested and quessing who the author is of each short chapter. The characters all weave together as they spend one evening in the hotel. It is fun to look back and see the characters from different points of view in each chapter.

I was sadly let down. While there is no denying the qualities of all the writers showcased, that is not to say that we see their best work here.While the linkages between the various stories are cleverly contrived, the writing is uneven. I found &quot;Room 101 - Benny Does Dublin&quot; far and away the best of the stories.That is not to say that this is a bad book, just that Bolger as editor hasn't quite pulled the concept off with this effort. Nevertheless, worth a look."},{"Title":"Finbar's Hotel: A Novel","review":"What a hoot! Imagine an about-to-be-demolished venerable old Dublin hotel. Imagine hallways with room numbers on the doors. Imagine the interwoven lives of the people spending the night behind those doors.NOW: Imagine that 7 different Irish authors are each assigned a room number and told to write the stories, somehow collaborating so that the stories link loosely together as the characters meet - or don't - in the lobby, the lounge, the bar, the restaurant, whatever. And no credits are assigned to the chapters, i.e. we readers don't know which was written by, say, Roddy Doyle. So besides the book filled with stories, there's the added fun of trying to figure out who wrote what.Terrific."},{"Title":"Finbar's Hotel: A Novel","review":"Basically each story begins with a character checking into a room. We get to observe them for a while and they eventually meet and interact with another character, then a kind of tension starts up. The initial characters don't really grab me with the exception of Maureen in The Test and Johnny in the Night Manager. These two are the stories I liked best. I also liked An Old Flame because it was intriguing, the way it unfolded was well written and it had a good ending. There are little incidents - a glimpse of another guest, an interaction with Simon the porter, or a party in the bar which all the stories refer to which link them together. I suspect these were put in later after the original story was written. It doesn't say which story is by which person, which is incredibly irritating! It meant I couldn't follow up the stories I liked. All in all I'd have to say this was a good 'novelty' book rather than a good collection of short stories I'd return to again and again."},{"Title":"Finbar's Hotel: A Novel","review":"In the tradition (but not awful quality) of the movie Four Rooms, editor Bolger brings together six of Ireland's top authors to each tell the tale of one room and the circumstances which bring its occupant there. He's managed to solicit a nice set of loosely related short stories although I didn't find &quot;Room 102 -- White Lies&quot; or &quot;Room 106 -- An Old Flame&quot; quite as compelling as the others. Once of the nice little twists is that the reader doesn't know which author wrote which story, and not being an expert on those represented, I'd hesitate to hazard any guesses.

The idea of having a number of Ireland's well know modern authors combine to produce a book sounded risky but it works beautifully here.

Note however that each book can perfectly well be read separately. This one analyzes Crusader warfare in Outremer after the Third Crusade and until the Fall of Acre and the end of Outremer. Many of the features presented in Crusader warfare are also present in this book, except that they are amplified. Basically, the author present a clear and readable picture of a tactical and strategic situation that was slowly deteriorating in the long run. The main elements were:- the gross disparity in numbers, with the Franks being entirely outnumbered and reduced to a shrinking coastal trip of territory studded with fortified ports and castles- the Franks growing inability to put significant forces in the field, especially after 1244 where the Kingdom's army, allied to the Syrians, was destroyed once again, just as it had been at Hattin- their growing reliance on fortresses as a result, with what Marshall terms a \\"besieged fortress mentality\\" which included a kind of passivity and retaliations limited to raids- a growing reliance on the Military Orders to defend many of these fortresses, as lay lords did not have the financial means - and often not the will - to continue what increasingly looked like a hopless defense.To demonstrate these features, this book analyzes in-depth the tactics, campaigns, troop types and effectives fielded on both sides. It also shows how fortresses were strengthened and adapted to the increasing limitations of fighting in the field.As C. Marshall makes out very clearly, additional features ensured the worsening of the situation over time. While the Muslims states were initially divided after the death of Saladin, allowing the Christians to more or less hold their own, the landscape changed as Babar, the first of the Mamluk Sultans, came to power in Egypt. Just before, the Christians were busy fighting a civil war between the Imperialists and the lay barons, with the Templars and the Hospitallers taking different sides, of course, whereas for a large part of the century, Genoa, Pise and Venice were also fighting each other in naval wars.Finally, Marshall also analyzes the reasons for the failure of all latter Crusades.A superb, well-written, clear and concise read. A book I have had and read a number of times for almost 20 years. It offers a particularly enlightening explanation of the slow demise of Outremer."},{"Title":"Warfare in the Latin East, 1192-1291 (Cambridge Studies in Medieval Life and Thought: Fourth Series)","review":"Warfare in The Latin East is a fine enough book. It tries to analyse the character of the warfare in the last half of the crusades, and succeeds well enough. However, much as I like it, it does not deal with such matters as the development of strategy and tactics, the tactics for specific battles nor with the underlying nature of warfare. What I miss is the sort of analysis found in &quot;War in The Middle Ages&quot; by Sir Charles Oman, I just guess that sort of books does not get written any longer. I would also like some more detailed maps, both of castles, campaigns and the area in general. I still rate the book as worthy of four stars despite my misgivings for I like it as an elaboration of the basic analysis of war in general. An example from a somewhat atypical theater of operations and a comparison between the &quot;Norman&quot; and &quot;Saracen&quot; way of waging war. Which is also why I miss the more detailed information on tactics and strategy. I also believe that the book could benefit from use of archeological sources if such exist. As a last remark I must state that it is three years since I last read it so I may remember it a bit differently from what it is, is has made an impression on me though, in order for me to remember it.Palle rasmussen Ba.A.

Each piece is accompanied by striking black and white photographs by Emma Dodge Hanson, and the essays themselves are written ina laid-back conversational style that makes it easy to curl up on the couch on a cold winter's day and read the book.Editor Marc Woodworth has done a fine job of presenting these outstanding women as intelligent and wise -- or perhaps it could be said that they didn't need any help from Woodworth to come across that way? Woodworth has given each songwriter a clean slate to talk about themselves and their work, and ech artist shines. The end product is a compendium of &quot;selected wisdom&quot;, if you will, that flows fluidly from the pages. To the reader, it feels as though one were listening to each artist chat about life, over a coffee at the local cafe. Gone are the cliched phrases and anecodtes that all too often mar books about artists in the music industry.The remarkable thing that Woodworth has managed to accomplish is to present these women as human beings, not just as songwriters. While they talk about their craft a great deal, each comes across as being very experienced (or embattled!) in matters of the heart. Very often a given artist chats about her upbringing, how they got into music, and their various influences, topics that I found very interesting. Each artist is very honest about mistakes they have made, not only on a practical level but on a emotional one as well, information that I suspect would be difficult to glean from male singers!Because the book reads like a &quot;book of conversations&quot;, and not a &quot;book of discussions about each artist's individual style&quot;, I found even the writings of artists I don't like to be very interesting. For example, I'm not a huge fan of Mary Chapin Carpenter, but she had some very intelligent things to say. Someone else who I don't recognize writes that &quot;I realized it's okay to feel multiple ways about a certain thing,&quot; a concept that struck me as being very true and very human. The book is full of these little observations about life and human behaviour.Overall, I was very impressed with the content of the book and the way in which it was assembled.

Mr. Woodworth has managed to capture and transform the words of these woman singers/songwriters (Sheryl Crow, Sarah McLachlan, Joan Osborne, Lucinda Williams, Jewel, Suzanne Vega just to name a few) into a dynamic first person narrative that brings you face to face with your favorite artist. The accompanying pictures by Ms. Hanson are stunning. I have yet to see such revealing, sensitive and poignant pictures of these artists published anywhere else. This book is pure energy and art that rivals the vitality of the women it portrays. When I read a good book or am inspired by a song I hear, I react to it physically and emotionally. In this moment of reaction it becomes art. I want to talk to that author/songwriter about their work. I want to discover the impetus behind their thoughts and ideas. Solo takes me to that place. It takes me to a place were stories are layered in astonishing depth. It is no less than an opportunity to sit with your favorite singer/songwriter and hear their ideas, insights, dreams, and fears. You are welcomed into their living spaces to find out what they think about their careers and music.

The amazing thing about books is being immersed into them and while reading SOLO, I felt like I was no longer in my world, but a world with a group of people that I admire and who inspire me. I felt like Sarah or Holly or anyone of those artist's were right beside me, confiding in me.Emma Dodge Hanson and Marc Woodworth chose a very diverse group of women, appealing to every type of music lover. The photos are priceless, conveying each artist's emotions and and the writing is terrific, detailing each woman's life and portraying them both as talented and also human beings...and that's not easy to come by these days. Another thing that I enjoyed was the &quot;trend&quot; of women artists being addressed. It's not a trend,folks, women are just finally the getting recognition they deserve. Women have been around for a long time and SOLO acknowledges that women will be here forever. My opinion? It's about damn time."},{"Title":"Solo: Women Singer-Songwriters in Their Own Words","review":"Throughout the best of times and of the worst, these ladies have been able to make it through the struggles of their every day life. From poverty to addictions, these ladies have been able to over-come the many obstacles of modern day life. They are just like everyone else. This book has informed many people about facts that were not able to be found anywhere else. Marc Woodworth and Emma Dodge Hanson did a marvelous job constructing this novel. Many things have gone untold and now thanks to these two people it will be no more. This book has given many including myself a new prospective and insight on these artists. I learned so much about so many different women, when I come to think of the fact that I only bought this book because of one particular artist: Ani Difranco. She has been my idle since the very start and I find it amazing to have gone by without knowing so many of the facts in this book. Thanks to those two people, I know all there is to know on my favorite artist."},{"Title":"Solo: Women Singer-Songwriters in Their Own Words","review":"The minds who brought you this wonderful collection of women singers which ranges from brilliant, well-respected Joan Osborne to confusingly individual Ani DiFranco should be rewarded for their efforts: buy this book! It's great - what's stopping you anyway? This book is worth considerably more than its asking price!"},{"Title":"Solo: Women Singer-Songwriters in Their Own Words","review":"It was wonderful to be able to read about other women whom I have watched 'appear' with their songs and character. I have longed, since I was a child to be a part of that whole of the artist's realm where I could offer some words from experience, expressing thoughts related to things in life we see and for which we often cannont talk about. So, in being finally the adult to no longer just aspire but to live the dream, now I find the music business very elusive when singing the truthful stuff. This book confirms this elusiveness and strength these women have endured in which I too am living to reach similar goals. The reading revealed traits of character you wouldn't have known were behind the artist. It gave hope to keep striving high. There was a stillness between each artist which allowed for a new chapter. I felt it was a smooth reading that I was sad to come to the end of. Women of the contemporary folk world who are working toward this vision to sharing their music with the world, should read this and get power from their sisters. : ) The photographer is very up close and personal which makes them feel human. Into the future we must cross for another book by Marc."},{"Title":"Solo: Women Singer-Songwriters in Their Own Words","review":"As an American woman artist living in Italy, I need books like SOLO for confirmation. I was moved and inspired by the brilliant statements of the women singers, and by the uncanny way in which Emma Hanson's photographs of them revealed their intelligence and seriousness. The interviews read like one long poem about the struggle and triumph of these uncompromising women. I felt the words of these women were being addressed to me personally. As Dante says, &quot;These words were borne across from them to us-&quot; To which I answer &quot;O lasso, quanti dolci pensier!&quot; My friend and I have been reading and reading the book since the day we received it, but when we read the interview of Ani DiFranco on THAT day we read no further..."},{"Title":"Solo: Women Singer-Songwriters in Their Own Words","review":"Well, I am going to read the book, if I ever get a credit-card...which hopefully there's another option..( or I'll be broke before I get paid....) Anyhow, I'm sure this book is well worth reading..TO me anything by any of these great artist(s) who have inspired me in my darkest hours of frustration.. I will never give up the God given gift(s) thanks to you all!!!! (And hopefully we'll all Jam before New Year's Eve!!!!!) -C"},{"Title":"Solo: Women Singer-Songwriters in Their Own Words","review":"When I listen to my CD's of my favorite artists (who happen to be primarily female), I often wonder what they were thinking when they wrote a certain song, or what happened in their life to make them write a song. This book provided answers to many of my questions. It's fascinating to learn what inspires these creative women and what makes them stand out in a crowd of female musicians. The pictures are truly beautiful, not just glamourous shots of beautiful people, but real pictures of the women. My favorite sections were Shawn Colvin, Jonatha Brooke, Ani DiFranco, and Mary Lou Lord. I've shown this book to everyone I know who has great taste in music."},{"Title":"Solo: Women Singer-Songwriters in Their Own Words","review":"This is a wonderful book for those of us who have enjoyed the talents of some or all of the artists presented in this book, through CD's, concerts, or television appearances, and have wanted to know more about who these women are and how they came to be. In their own words, and not in 10 second soundbites, we hear from musicians like Shawn Colvin, Jewel, Lucy Kaplansky, Lucinda Williams, and many more. Their stories, accompanied by superb photos taken by Emma Dodge Hanson in a collaborative effort with editor Mark Woodworth, are informative, interesting, touching, and amusing. It's a book that can be read one singer/songwriter at a time and returned to, or from cover to cover. The photos seem natural and revealing. I recommend this book to those who are familiar with these women singer/songwriters, and to those who aren't."},{"Title":"Solo: Women Singer-Songwriters in Their Own Words","review":"&quot;Solo&quot; is a refreshing, absorbing read. What makes it so interesting is that all of the excerpts are written by the artists themselves, all brilliant yet human artists whose experiences are lucidly and effectively related throughout the book. As a singer-songwriter myself, it was a pleasure to gather inspiration and encouragement from these women, most of whom have travelled the long and lonely road in search of artistic and spiritual breakthrough. Each entry is very intimate and personal, and I felt like I was having coffee with each artist! The accompanying photographs by Emma Dodge-Hanson are lovely and introspective, showing thoughtful, quiet sides of each dynamic woman that are often ignored in the glossy images of magazines or music videos. I often return to &quot;Solo&quot; to draw out words of wisdom from my favorite artists. I can only hope there will be a companion book to follow! *****"},{"Title":"Solo: Women Singer-Songwriters in Their Own Words","review":"Dear Emma and Marc, Solo is awesome, the images and narrative are both soulful and powerful. As a practicing artist I'm attracted to the imagery in your book. The photographs have a cinematic quality to them, in particular the series of photo's of Holly Palmer. When I look at the images in your book I feel spirit and emotion of the people represented through your imagery. Examples of what I'm referring to are images of Lucinda Williams (pg 290 and 300), Sheryl Crow (pg 273), Roseanne Cash (pg 246), Jewel (pg 224), Shawn Colvin (pg 39), and Sarah (pg 18)... I like the way the narrative and art work weave together like a quilt, your images make me feel good. More on Solo later... Peace, Love, and Understanding, Freddy Ciminelli"},{"Title":"Solo: Women Singer-Songwriters in Their Own Words","review":"This book is not for people looking for a glamorous &quot;inside edition&quot; type of experience. The women in this beautifully-done paperback and affordable edition are real people who have the courage to &quot;follow their bliss&quot; and make a living creatively, thereby giving the world the gift of their talent. The stories they tell are stories of &quot;everywoman&quot; and those of us who happen to be female are lucky to get a double whammy. You poor guys simply get a profound glimpse of the artistic mind at work. The photographs are stunningly done in their simplicity and &quot;realness&quot; (these women look like me!). This book is on my Christmas list for all the women that I know and all the men that matter."},{"Title":"Solo: Women Singer-Songwriters in Their Own Words","review":"I have read and re-read Solo and am so pleased that Marc and Emma have finally done justice to the best of the curent music world. All the women in the book are writers as well as performers and, what the photographs and interviews in Solo portray, is that these women are real people too. I am sick of reading tainted rock-goddess interviews with flashy, floozy photographs to match. The solo text is well written, intelligable and accessible. The photographs are wonderfully human as well as artistic. There is alot of valuable information about women, society and the pressures of life in this book and I hope alot of young people read it. I also hope Marc and Emma continue their partnership and produce many more books of this quality. Well done."},{"Title":"Solo: Women Singer-Songwriters in Their Own Words","review":"hey all you cool cats.... instead of reading this review you should be reading SOLO. it is my favorite book! if you have a favorite artist, one whom you are dying to meet...(and they're in this book) sit down on the couch and read it- and i swear you will feel as if you have been friends with them for years. the photographs are brilliant so its like they are right there in front of you chattin about themselves and their lives... seriously get your hands on this book, and believe me - youll never want to let go"},{"Title":"Solo: Women Singer-Songwriters in Their Own Words","review":"I really felt like I was sitting down with each artist. The one-on-one feel is like no other book I've ever read. Go out, buy this book, you won't regret it. Emma's pictures are simply classic. They each tell a story on their own."},{"Title":"Solo: Women Singer-Songwriters in Their Own Words","review":"I have never read a book quite like this one. Each of the artists that are in the book express their thoughts so individually and powerfully. I was captivated! I could relate to so much of what these women said. It was pure realness. The photographs are just as powerful. They captured the humanity and different aspects of each of these women. While one picture captured thoughtfulness, the next one captured a childlike essence in the artist. I almost felt like I was sitting in a little cafe in Soho, with a bunch of friends talking. This book is a must read!"},{"Title":"Solo: Women Singer-Songwriters in Their Own Words","review":"I am so happy that finally a book has come out about all the great influential female singer/songwriters that we have. And it's actually taken directly from the artists themselves. I definately recommend this book, beings a fan of most of the artists already in the book, the book has turned me on to new artists that I'd never heard of before, but now feel like I've known my whole life! Woohoo!!"},{"Title":"Solo: Women Singer-Songwriters in Their Own Words","review":"Woodworth and Hanson have produced a remarkable documentary of some of the most talented and influential women musicians of our time. This book offers a glimpse into the personal lives of artists that is rarely available from the normal interview process. The photographs complement and validate the written word, the combination of the two works well in presenting these artists."},{"Title":"Solo: Women Singer-Songwriters in Their Own Words","review":"as the authors say it's like sitting down with the artists over a cup of coffee. I picked up a copy in a local coffee-house and a 15 minute break became a 4 hour read! You'll never listen to any music the same again. With so much commercialization of artists that de-personalizes them, this is truly an insight into who they are and why. Wonderful format that gets you in their head. Emma's photograghs are stunning. Each catches something in the artist's personality that jumps off the page. They do for people what Ansel Adams did for trees."},{"Title":"Solo: Women Singer-Songwriters in Their Own Words","review":"At first, I was mezmerized by the amazing pictures through out SOLO. There is an abundance of pictures of some of my favorite musicians. For that reason alone, I bought the book.What has made it one of my favorites is the deeply personal stories interwoven throughout. After reading the well-written, respectful, yet honest interviews in this book. I started at the beginning and read it again.The combination of stunning photos and the fascinating interviews makes this book a must for music fans.While all of my favorites were there, Shawn Colvin, Ani DiFranco, Jonatha Brooke... there were some new names and faces. ALL of the women featured in SOLO were interesting and insightful. I look forward to a follow-up book by Marc Woodworth and Emma Dodge hanson."},{"Title":"Solo: Women Singer-Songwriters in Their Own Words","review":"SOLO is real people telling their stories, sharing their feelings. Each one is human, with hopes and fears. The stories do not come from the hand of a publicist. They are not authorized biographies &quot;as told to. . .&quot; The photos are real, too, not staged for marketing. SOLO is about the creative process, its pain and its satisfaction."},{"Title":"Solo: Women Singer-Songwriters in Their Own Words","review":"SOLO is the most beautiful, artistic, informative book I have read in years. The lessons I learned from these women are lessons for life. From Shawn Colvin's experience getting over an addiction to Joan Osborne describing what it means to be a woman in a male dominated world to Sarah McLachlan speaking about what she does to feed her soul SOLO rocks the foundation of my world!!I am giving it to all my girlfriends, and my mother."},{"Title":"Solo: Women Singer-Songwriters in Their Own Words","review":"Solo:Women Singer-Songwriters in Their Own Words, is an intimate look into the lives and experiences of today's finest female musicians. Unlike other books about rock stars this is not a cheesy interview with repeated questions that you hear all of the time. Each artist speaks uninterrupted and it seems as though you are listening to the artists in person. It is revealing and interesting and for many young female (and male) musicians it is inspiring. The pictures are excellent and expressive adding the perfect touch to this already amazing book. Definitely 5 out of 5 stars! Great work!"},{"Title":"Solo: Women Singer-Songwriters in Their Own Words","review":"ok - so i have already bought - and fallen in love with - this book, so WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR??? seriously BUY THIS BOOK! the chapters are written by your favorite artists with beautiful pictures to bring the pages to life..so , get off your tush, go to the store (or buy thru amazon) this wonderful book.

This book should be read by every woman in America at every age. The stories are personal, enlightening and truly amazing! There is so much to learn from SOLO... I return to it daily."},{"Title":"A Beginner's Guide To Day Trading Online","review":"Thinking I could transfer my 20+ years of quite successful investing experience to a more active trading style, I started online trading about 8 months ago. Reading this book was like reading my own journal of the past 8 months's painful experience! Reading this book before I started may not have prevented me from making those mistakes, but it most likely would have helped me recognize them once made and stopped me from repeating them over and over, piling up ever more losses! Just as she describes, the good news is you do turn a corner to profitable trades once you learn some very basic but important lessons. This book can shorten that time for beginners.Her section on Boot Camp is very good. Her system has rank beginners learning and up and running in 2 weeks what took me about 3-4 months to discover from everyone who would teach me.There's also more than enough technical strategies presented which traders from beginners to more experienced ones can apply and use daily.Her light humorous style makes this easier to read than most trading books without detracting from the serious message. If my sister or a good friend wanted to start trading, this would be the book I'd give them to read first."},{"Title":"A Beginner's Guide To Day Trading Online","review":"It's been over a year and several trading books since I first read this book. Having reflected on it and compared it to much better books, I can honestly say this book gives a poor introduction into the trading world. It does a good job at introducing trading terms and tools, but these are the least important factors beginning traders should know before they start trading. It fails to convey the overwhelming importance of a trader's psychology and strong discipline. Turner's 'you can do it, it's easy' attitude are sure to lose readers money if followed without other guidance. The patterns explained in this book are generalized, but explained in a way as though it's automatic to make money from them.If you look to learn about trading so that you can lose money quickly, buy this book and follow its methods. If you want to take the time to learn the art of trading which includes strict discipline and an unemotional mindset, start learning with Dr. Elder's &quot;Come into My Trading Room&quot; or Mark Douglas' &quot;Trading in the Zone&quot;. These books will teach you how to be successful before you lose a lot of money. I've also read Alan Farley's &quot;The Master Swing Trader&quot;. This is an excellent book for more advanced traders who are willing to take a good amount of time to digest its content. Good Luck."},{"Title":"A Beginner's Guide To Day Trading Online","review":"I received Toni Turner's book last week and have just finished my first reading. Toni has accomplished a great reader friendly introducation to day trading stocks online. I have traded commodity futures for twenty years and am just getting my feet wet with ONLINE stock trading.I earned my M.B.A. and have been a successful investor in stocks for over 20 years. Toni Turner's book gave me a wealth of hard earned information in a format easy to read and understand. The subtle nuances that make a big difference in money earned or lost was handled with good examples, charts and analogies for everyone to understand.One of the outstanding characteristics of Miss Turner's book is the manner in which she makes the difficult task of technical analysis understandable to those who have little or no experience investing. It does not bore you like so many technical books, and therefore, keeps you reading instead of laying it aside.As noted in her book, the differences between time frames in the risk and reward equation of day trading are explained compared to longer term investment instruments.Seems to me the action of imparting understanding is accomplished quite well. I applaud this new book as a welcome addition to any library."},{"Title":"A Beginner's Guide To Day Trading Online","review":"This is an outstanding introductory book for new traders. It starts with an overall picture of the markets, then teaches trading psychology, fundamental chart-reading, and Level II tactics. Traders who day trade (hold stocks for minutes to hours), swing trade (hold stocks days-to-weeks), and those who want to trade their IRA accounts long term, will learn how to make money in the stock market. Best of all, the book is written in a style that everyone can comprehend.Another reviewer mentioned that it is beneficial for authors to have actual trading knowledge -- I totally agree! Toni Turner was one of Pristine.com's first students, and I have personally traded with Toni for over one year. She is not only extremely knowledgeable about the financial markets, but can consistently pull profits from the markets daily on all types of trades! As the title suggests, it is an awesome book to give interested traders a jump start into this exploding trading revolution. Then the traders can add to their ongoing education with many other excellent advanced books."},{"Title":"A Beginner's Guide To Day Trading Online","review":"This is a well written introductory book for those considering the business of Day Trading. It's also an excellent book to add to an existing trader's library. Toni allows for easy absorption of a few popular trading styles, such as &quot;trend trading&quot; and &quot;breakouts&quot;. She also does a fine job of explaining entry and exit points which alone can destroy a trading account if not adhered to.If this is the first or second book you've purchased on Day Trading keep in mind you will need to purchase additional books on this subject matter in order to begin to grasp the different trading techniques. And that goes for any book. I have found that reading numerous books on any given subject allows for consistency of what makes sense. I have a large library of trading concepts. At some point, be it book number 3 or book number 10 you will finally say, aaaaaaaaaaaaah. I get it!I would encourage Toni to consider writing an advanced book on this subject."},{"Title":"A Beginner's Guide To Day Trading Online","review":"Who ever heard of a book on buying and selling stocks that is also a page turner? Full of sound advice, lots of no-no and yes-yes's and all written with a serious jab at your funny bone. Don't get me wrong! This is a first-rate how-to book, and it can teach you how to make sound investments that will put money in your pocket. Toni Turner is an excellent writer who has the skills necessary to appeal to readers from all directions. Now ask yourself: when was the last time you read a book on day trading that was so enlightening and entertaining that you hated to put it down? It's a terrific book by a delightful writer, and a needed addition to the world of Day Trading. Cappy Hall-Rearick President, Southeastern Writers Association, Inc."},{"Title":"A Beginner's Guide To Day Trading Online","review":"In the last 3 years tons of books have been written on stock day trading. A few are great, some are just okay and the rest border on useless. To me, the measure of a book is in the author's ability to communicate to me quality trading strategies in a way that I can understand and implement them in my own trading. I believe Toni Turner's book accomplishes this very effectively.I've been day trading equities full-time for a number of years. If I were a newcomer to the markets today, this book would be at the top of the list of recommendations to myself...(I hope that makes sense).I think the book would be most helpful to beginners and folks who have already been trading for up to a year. The text is heavily grounded in technical analysis and includes many chart examples. Great stuff!"},{"Title":"A Beginner's Guide To Day Trading Online","review":"Toni Turners's book is a must for those who want an honest concise look at what Online Trading is all about. I have had the distinct pleasure to sit alongside Toni for two years and have walked away amazed at the poise and discipline that this professional brings into our trading environment every day. I too agree that much is written on this subject by those who do not have first hand knowlege of our craft and that is exactly why I am pleased to see this book! It comes from an active participant in our profession not an observer nor a &quot;paper tiger.&quot;This book is filled with easy to read techniques and tactics that you will need as well as an honest assessment of the hard work needed as you begin to trade against the best the &quot;Street&quot; has to offer. This book offers a solid, clear , concise plan to start you on road toward self sufficiency and the first step in your growth as traders. This is all then grounded in just some down to earth common sense. This book,although titled for a beginner, can benefit all those who wish to further themselves as professional traders."},{"Title":"A Beginner's Guide To Day Trading Online","review":"Any one that wants to make it as a trader needs more practical information. This book is good but not good enough. A beginner needs a well defined trading plan and not just a general overview of online trading. You have to take into account that a beginner will compete in the same market as the advanced trader does.Many books that are targeted for beginners distract the reader with a lot of jargon instead of helping the new trader to focus on a simple trading plan.Some sites in the internet offer more especialized information. One of those sites is Profitable Stock Market dotcom.You always have to consider that there are no 100% safe trading systems. But still you can make decent profits by following a simple strategy that is able to generate you consistent positive results, while keeping your trading as simple as possible."},{"Title":"A Beginner's Guide To Day Trading Online","review":"This book organizes the complicated world of day trading in such a way that novice traders like myself can easily understand. It covers quite a large spectrum of need-to-knows (from basic to not-so-basic topics) for the beginner and is explained in language that is user-friendly.

She has over a decade of experience as a writer as well as a trader."},{"Title":"A Beginner's Guide To Day Trading Online","review":"I've been trading stocks for nine years and I have found this book very helpful in profiting from the market. I have highlighted all key areas throughout the book and I have index tabs set-up for all areas I am interested in.Her simple approach is important since it is easy to get confused by all the different aspects of the market environment. When applying her techniques it is important to keep everything in perspective and understand that she is primarily advocating trading in bullish uptrends and not in an environment where the trend is not clear."},{"Title":"A Beginner's Guide To Day Trading Online","review":"Please read this book BEFORE you start day trading. There are so many pitfalls to this profession that you must be armed with useful tools before you start doing it. It is much to easy to lose everything gradually or rapidly for the beginner. Don't follow her recommendations at your own peril."},{"Title":"A Beginner's Guide To Day Trading Online","review":"Overall a good book for a beginner, the best thing about this book is that it walks you through the first steps of understanding markets and fundamentals with ease, it's was written in user friendly way, with simple terms and examples.she will show you a few setups and a few indicators along with real stock charts but remember, there is more to it further educating yourself is your best bet, definetly worth the $$ though and I liked her sense of humor a bit.you'll feel like she doesen't spend a lot of time on a few subjects, like the Fibonacci or candlestick setups but hey you get what you paid for and I highly recommend reading another book or maybe 2 with a more focus on technical analysis and charting techniques.Good luck and remember -> the trend is your friend except at the end my friend."},{"Title":"A Beginner's Guide To Day Trading Online","review":"I felt in grade school at times while reading this book, however it was very helpful.

I know that doesn't seem long but in this buisness that can be an eternity. I can't help but wonder how many of the people that I have seen crash and burn, might have made it through those early days if they had read this book. This is a great book for entry level day traders. Turner is a trader who knows how to write about the markets in a clear concise manner, touched with humor. She explains how to trade actively while protecting your capital. Ever new trader should add this book to his or her library!"},{"Title":"A Beginner's Guide To Day Trading Online","review":"This was the first book I used on my journey to mastering the art of day trading. I've realized most of the strategies and techniques outlined in the book. After a rocky start(I began with my share of losses)and 2.5 years later of full time day trading experience, I am finally consistently profitable in the stock market. I've learned the less you trade and the more time spent researching before hand(the candlestick charts are key), the better trader I've become. Toni Turner gives an excellent introduction to candlestick charting in her book. I also recommend reading \\"Japanese Candlestick Charting Techniques\\" by Steve Nison to expand upon the topic."},{"Title":"A Beginner's Guide To Day Trading Online","review":"I just started trading a few months ago, and I started knowing nothing. I limped through and lost a great deal of money. I purchased a great many books, tookexpensive seminars, and then when Amazon started the Prime program where you can borrow one book a month for free I found this little book. I borrowed itand it has changed my ability to trade. It gave me much more information than I had gotten anywhere. else It is well written. It is understandable with a tremendousamount of information that is put together in a way that makes it easy to read and actually enjoyable. Who would have thought that information on the stockmarket could be enjoyable to read. What a concept. This book was written a little while ago, and a small amount of the information isn't totally up to date, butthat did not seem to bother me. I felt that the majority of the information was timeless. While the title speaks of day trading, I think that it is a must read for anyonewho is thinking about trading or investing. I am now reading it for the second time and I am finding even more things that are helpful.

It's mix of philosophy and the mechanics of using technical analysis such as charts, software, and the like while trading, have only whetted my appetite for more knowledge on both subjects.

The author has really done a good job! I have read many other books, but her book is different, and i am glad i read her book!She starts with the basics of trading and explains everything in detail. She also teaches the basics of candlestick charting which I found very interesting! She also explains how to use many other important indicators.And for the price this book sells, it is a STRONG BUY!"},{"Title":"A Beginner's Guide To Day Trading Online","review":"Not being much of a book reader overall, I am VERY skeptical about most books, going in. However, this book has solid information, a minimal amount of fluff and is well written. After thoroughly studying/reading it, I found myself RE-reading a large portion of this book to further review the techniques it outlines. Thats rare! Bottom line, good book. Buy it."},{"Title":"A Beginner's Guide To Day Trading Online","review":"This book helped me get started in daytrading easily and quickly. This book gave actual hands-on experience of what the author has done. I would recommend this book for anyone who is clueless in the world of daytrading."},{"Title":"A Beginner's Guide To Day Trading Online","review":"This book was truly a godsend. Toni listed every mistake I made as a beginner trader and assured me she'd made those mistakes herself. She not only gave me confidence to go out there and start trading, but she also gave me very specific tools to use to determine when to enter a trade. This is literally the best beginning day trading book I've ever read. If you're starting from the beginning, this must be on your reading list."},{"Title":"A Beginner's Guide To Day Trading Online","review":"This is the best daytrading I've seen. It's simple,step by step learning, to the point, and talks about the essentials of daytrading. It helped break me out of the trial and error mode into some real daily profits. I recommend this book to short-term and daytraders."},{"Title":"A Beginner's Guide To Day Trading Online","review":"This is a fine book if you've never, ever traded and you're looking for a pep talk, a pat on the back, a &quot;Hey, you can DO it!&quot; sort of thing. Look upon it as an introduction to the terminology of trading, with a little insight into what indicators are useful. Regular traders will be put-off by the sparse detail, the broad scope, the heavy-handed treatment of the emotions associated with trading, and I found the little life-affirming statements at the end of each chapter absolutely excruciating. I felt embarrassed for the author.The book it simply too broad in its scope to be useful to anyone who knows something about trading. The various chapters cover a lot, but in scant detail. It's an introduction to the world of trading, in general. If you have a fair idea of what you're doing at the moment, read Jea Lu's book on daytrading; leave this one on the shelf."},{"Title":"A Beginner's Guide To Day Trading Online","review":"Precise, easy to follow, a great book for beginners~~"},{"Title":"A Beginner's Guide To Day Trading Online","review":"This book is a well written piece, geared for people who are somewhat intrigued by the idea of trading stocks to make a living. After reading this book you will want to:1) Run away from the day trading idea and never visit it again2) Immediately call your online broker, and start placing your first day trades3) Read more about the idea of day trading in other books, testimonies from the people who are there, etc.In short, this book will wake you up to everything that it takes to be a day trader. If you take options 1 and 2, you probably wouldn't be a good day trader and would be wise to avoid the idea completely. If you think of #3, you will probably wind up a successful trader. Take this book as a first step, and make sure to take many more before you execute your first day trading orders. With that in mind, good luck to all who try day trading!"},{"Title":"A Beginner's Guide To Day Trading Online","review":"The insightful, friendly, witty style makes this book the ideal starting place for new traders.

I guess Miss Turner attended the useless course offered by Pristine Daytrading (which I have attended) and came back running to rewrite their manual!!. Can one use the material and make money? .. NO!. She is not a professional trader (if she trades at all!), and therfore you should not expect a lot from this book."},{"Title":"A Beginner's Guide To Day Trading Online","review":"Toni Turner takes a very complex topic and makes it sound very simple. This is a good, uplifting book for a person who knows nothing about trading and wants to learn. For anyone beyond the most basic level I would recommend something that goes into more detail. This book touches all the basics. And you know that Toni Turner is a brilliant trader...the book reveals only about 1% of all the complexity that is trading..and therefore is very good for a beginer."},{"Title":"A Beginner's Guide To Day Trading Online","review":"Why does he have to use the exclaimation mark &quot;!&quot; every 2 or 3 lines?

Informations are in general and I don't think that worth it to read, unless you want just to be familiar with buying and selling stocks.

If you know about trading, you can tell that Ms. Turner does not trade!.( As a matter of fact I KNOW she is not trading, because she doesn't know how!!!) I wounder if she is the one giving her book 5 star reviews!. That could be a full time job!!"},{"Title":"A Beginner's Guide To Day Trading Online","review":"The lessons of this book can be valuable, but will not make of you a wise investor. I have known people who theoretically knew about mathematics, but most of them knew only a poor few tricks to solve roughly some counts without any sense of the logics subjacent. Sometimes simply there are good luck, and the problem solves well, but when not- when real talent is necessary- the results are disastrous. In extrapolating that, if you belong to that class of professional, no matter if a trader, of lawyer, physician, chemist, etc, etc, this book only will serve you to fall in dire straits because in Stock Market you play for yourself, with your own money and nobody will protect you, who must know and understand at less some basic ideas about politics, economics in general and many other factors that go beyond the managing of the some computer graphics. No book in whole world can teach you common sense nor instinct."},{"Title":"A Beginner's Guide To Day Trading Online","review":"Ms.Turner needs to cut down on her caffene. What starts out as a promising book on day trading quickly devolves into an infantile screaming and bragging session. She peppers practically every sentence with an exclamation mark as if all her words had world shattering implications. Sorry Tony, the only shattering you have done is with our patience. The book is filled with self-promotion and boasting and this wears thin quickly. She is not so much a sucessful day trader as much as a person who knows how to sell books. While her hyper style of teaching may work in a conference setting, it goes over as crude and condesending in print. She is not the end all be all of begining day trading instruction books, as she would like to think, but only a small pebble on the beach of hundreds of get rich quick scheme books. It is unfortunate that I was duped into buying this book by the reviews written here. Don't be suckered, avoid this book and buy one that is more professional and easy to understand."},{"Title":"A Beginner's Guide To Day Trading Online","review":"I was curious to see what this book had to say about day trading after reading some of the glowing reviews on this book and was somewhat let down by the contents of this book. Toni Turner, uses basically the first half of her book as a platform to be a motivational speaker. She talks about not to get discouraged and even delves into some zen-like/mojo philosophy about the process of daytrading. I found the first half of the book difficult reading because she uses many day trading terms in her stories without giving a clear explaination about what the terms mean. Typical examples are references to \\"going long or short\\" on stocks without elaborating on what these terms mean. While she does a fairly good job of bringing personal experience in her writing to explain certain points, the style of her writing is hyper. I had the distinct feeling as if she were yelling at her reading audience. Many of her points could well be established in a more adult manner without all the adrenalin.The second half of the book goes heavily into reading and understanding charts. This part of the book is crammed with graphs and examples to explain how to interpret data. The data are handpicked by her in order to prove certain points, but seems rather counterproductive due to the fact that her examples only occur in perfect circumstances. Instead of relating that these are perfect examples of what could happen, she approaches these occurances as though they were the norm. This is misleading as new traders, such as myself, may get into a lot of trouble thinking that these are hard and fast rules. While there is a lot of information about charts here, much of the information is a little hard to understand because she forgets that she is writing to a beginner's audience. As a result, the explainations get technical and leave the reader wondering what just happened. As an introduction to the mechanisms of day trading, I would say that this is a below average book. The editing needs a lot of work in order to make the data in the book more clear and understandable. While it is obvious that she is very enthusiastic about day trading, I believe that there were too many holes in the production of the book to be truly helpful for a beginner."},{"Title":"A Beginner's Guide To Day Trading Online","review":"Try applying Toni Turner's technical analysis techniques in anything but a bull market, and the probability is that you will be burnt... severely.You should do well out of her techniques, when the markets are going up... but you would do well anyway, without needing to use her techniques.For the price, her book is OK value. But by focussing only on technical analysis (very little on level II), your money would be better spent on a book with a larger repertoire of approaches."},{"Title":"A Beginner's Guide To Day Trading Online","review":"This book lives up to it's title in grand fashion. It is a delightful and eye-opening read for anyone interested in learning about daytrading and swing-trading stocks. The negative reviews have absolutely missed the point entirely. Of course a beginner is not going to read this book, open an account, and start trading profitably. She tells you that right in the book!Perhaps the most valuable insight is the tale of her own experiences, how she lost money for years then managed to break even for another year before finally becoming consistently profitable. The mantra that is stressed over and over again is that of using tight stops, protecting your capital at all times, and developing a rules based decision making process that is in harmony with current market conditions.The tactics she describes are all practical and tradable, and they all work, except, as she puts it, \\"when they don't.\\" This is a very responsibly-written book and new traders who read it and then lose money attempting to daytrade based on ideas they got from it have no leg to stand on if trying to blame the book. I'm here to tell you that there is no such thing as a \\"read this and then start making big money\\" book, period.I consider this work to be a 5-star classic and highly recommend it as a first read for anyone interested in this subject matter. Nice job, Toni.[...]"},{"Title":"A Beginner's Guide To Day Trading Online","review":"The most important thing to say about The Beginner's Guide to Day Trading Online is Ms. Turner's ability to make technical analysis of stocks easily understood. This is a feat difficult for the majority of authors writing today about day trading...and I have read alot of books about this subject.The bottom line to any of these books is do they help make you a better trader. From my personal trading experience, this book helps me trade better. Of the traders I know who are profitable most use alot of the techniques explained in her book, whether they have read it or not."},{"Title":"A Beginner's Guide To Day Trading Online","review":"I love this book, it's a must have.

Toni Turner really wants you to understand each concept, she doesn't use fancy sentences. The only chapter that needs to be less wordy is Chapter 6 where she explains the graphs. The text should be right below the graph instead of a few pages ahead. The Quiz at the end of each chapter are excellent as well as the Center point."},{"Title":"A Beginner's Guide To Day Trading Online","review":"This 286 page book is a bargain for anyone interested in the art of investing in the worlds financial markets. It De-mystifies the art of technical analysis to the point of simplification. The techniques used in Toni Turners book are the same ones used by professional traders. Regardless of your ability this book should be in your personal library."},{"Title":"A Beginner's Guide To Day Trading Online","review":"Toni Turner shows you how it's done, walking you step-by-step through several solid day trading techniques. When you finish reading this book, you will have the basic tools to begin scouting solid day trade set-ups, executing good entries, managing open positions and making the best exits from your trades. I have been studying day trading for a year and a half and trading for four months. I wish I had found this book several months ago!"},{"Title":"A Beginner's Guide To Day Trading Online","review":"This is another attempt of a journalist to take advantage of the booming market of day trading books. When I started trading, four years ago, there were a few books written on this subject. Those books were written by traders!Today, there are so many books to choose from, most of which are written by journalists, day trading firms, or trading schools.The books which are written by traders such as Larry Connors, Jeff Cooper, Linda Raschke, Michael Turner, Larry Williams, etc., are pricy. However, they contain real-life trading experience which this book lacks.My father taught me an important lesson: You get what you pay for. If you are serious about day trading, abvoid this book! I recommend you spend the extra bucks and buy &quot;Hit and Run Trading,&quot; &quot;Street Smarts,&quot; &quot;Day Trading into the Millennium,&quot; and &quot;Long-Term Secrets to Short-Term Trading.&quot; Another excellent book is &quot;Trade Your Way to Financial Freedom&quot; by Van K.

I found her to be warm and intelligent, and her presentation and teaching skills are excellent.I've read both of her books, and I recommend them both.She writes in a direct and interesting manner that makes it easy to learn about the complicated subject of trading. She warns at the beginning of each that trading is difficult and is not for everyone. Even though her books are for beginners, as stated in the titles, the material in her books is substantial and comprehensive.My skills and trading gains definitely have risen since I've read and studied her books, and applied what I've learned to my trades. I hope she writes another one."},{"Title":"A Beginner's Guide To Day Trading Online","review":"This book has more valuable information than all those other books selling for 4 times the price.

Better than anything else I've read on this subject.I first heard about it from a friend, but, as always before I buy a book, I read the Amazon reviews to see what other readers were saying. They were so enthusiastic that I ordered the book and waited three weeks go get it -- the delay, I now assume was caused by its popularity.Ms. Turner's grasp of the complex and often dangerous mode of trading called &quot;Day Trading&quot; is remarkable. It's concise, down to earth, and humorous, as well. Not an easy task to accomplish on any level, but impossible had Ms. Turner not been in the trenches herself and triumphed.Thank you, Toni Turner, for writing a book I can both count on and enjoy -- a book I can proudly recommed to others."},{"Title":"A Beginner's Guide To Day Trading Online","review":"I have read most of the daytrading books on the market and for the money this book has sound advice and uses proven trading techniques.

Even though the book is labeled as a beginner book it can even teach us veteran online traders a thing or two. I have focused on trading penny stocks online since the Internet enables you to make the most money from the low priced stocks now that the commissions are usually under $20. I have combined the information from this book and The Guide For Penny Stock Investing to make a tremendous amount of money. I highly recommend both books."},{"Title":"A Beginner's Guide To Day Trading Online","review":"This book is a definate read for beginning daytraders or investors.

It definitely covers everything you need to know about the art of day trading-I would recommend it to anyone!"},{"Title":"A Beginner's Guide To Day Trading Online","review":"I read this book twice. The second time I highlighted all the useful info , which was a lot, then I wrote the information out in an easy ref fashion for later use. I am very impressed with it. What kills me are some of the prior reviews I've read about it and how they are not true. I've seen people complaining about her &quot;crystal ball&quot; indicators for one but if they had actually read the book they would realize all she is doing is giving you a list of tools that you can use to reduce your risk of loss. The &quot;crystal ball&quot; indicators only apply if all of the &quot;tops down&quot; list is in effect (which she also described well in her book).

I would recommend her book highly and look forward to any future material she produces."},{"Title":"A Beginner's Guide To Day Trading Online","review":"Like the movie Platoon where you don't just watch the movie, but you're sucked out of your chair into the battle scene, Toni's book takes you into the tortured mind of a trader in the midst of battle...feeling the knots in his insides while watching his trade take a nose dive without a sell stop! Much of the book described me and how I made my losses. My only regret is not having read this book BEFORE I went into trading. With this book, I now have a blueprint on how to undo (read: earn back) the mistakes I took early on when I thought I could beat the market by &quot;winging it&quot;. Yes, the book goes beyond being a good literary read. It's a beginner's hand-holding guide on what trading is all about and how to profit from it. The book does what it promises. A minor complaint (publisher's fault and not the author's) is that some charts being discussed are on a different page. It was annoying at best to flip back and forth between the text and the chart."},{"Title":"A Beginner's Guide To Day Trading Online","review":"This book is definitely worth the money if you're looking for an introduction to day trading. Toni Turner gives straightforward practical advice that you can apply to your trades. Her writing style also makes the book well worth the money. She keeps the tone conversational and easy to understand, yet without sacrificing content. One thing I would keep in mind is that day trading requires a significant time investment and is also a risky business. I would recommend her other book, \\"A Beginners Guide to Short Term Trading\\" unless you are ready to spend all of your time watching the market - otherwise you will not be disappointed with this purchase."},{"Title":"A Beginner's Guide To Day Trading Online","review":".....this is the most simple for REAL life .

Then I loaned that book to a friend in exchange for this one. Wow. Turner's book gives you at least ten times as much how to information and she is a clear and likable writer (I'm an English teacher; I notice these things). Being an absolute beginner, it took me a couple of weeks to go through it and now I need to give it back and buy my own copy.

This is a great beginner's book. Worth the money I spent.A short comment: I've been involved in the IT field and use terms like 'server' and 'provider' all the time. Most of us who are familiar with the those two terms know what the terms mean/refer to. The author seemed to mix/confuse these terms several times in the book. It's not a big deal, I just think it is a little misleading for those who are not familiar with these terms and could possibly lower someone's credibility a tiny tiny bit - I've met with an exec of one internet company who didn't know [the difference] when to use the term 'downloading' and 'uploading'.For instance, on page 32 in the 'Hot Tip' the author said &quot;If you use the Internet to trade on, make sure you have a backup Internet Server.&quot; I think she meant Internet [Service] Provider. I wonder how many traders actually run/use 'Internet Servers' and have a backup also.

I dont think it has the right title though because a lot of what is being talked about is more intermediate term trading not day trading. This book almost seems like the author is trying to cover to many bases. It talkes a little bit about everything that everyone already talks about. It supports almost every technical indicator and theory. Even nonesence like fibonnaci ratios and elliot wave. Of course all the charts make it look like these technical indicators work great but in reality when these so called indicators are put to most other charts they dont give accurate signals. This book has a lot of good information and bad information. I would read this book more like a encyclopedia that has all the latest ideas but not as a book to get trading stategies from. It is worth reading just to understand all the strategies that are out there but be carefull in actually trying all this. It presents much information but I dont think all of it is wisdom.

The crucial difference between Wei's father and grandfather is that the former always sings the male roles and the latter always the female.After his grandfather leaves, Wei is forced to see the downside of his father's job and what the opera's fading popularity might mean to his father and his own future. At the end of the story, Wei is able to save the day (or at least the performance), but the reader is left uneasy about Wei's (and his community's) future.Though the author does not belabor the issues, he does drop hints about immigration, prejudice and class differences. While these might be lost on a younger reader, they will provide food for thought (and hopefully discussion) for the slightly older reader."},{"Title":"In the Chat Room with God","review":"Wow -- this is a great book. I would give it more than 5 stars if I could! The characters are believable, and you find yourself truly caring about them as the story progresses.This is a unique book, and it looks cool too.

They will be located in the bible."},{"Title":"Chateau de Chenonceau, Val de Loire (English, French, German, Spanish, Italian and Japanese Edition)","review":"This paper model contains many details true to the actual chateau. It contains a great historical account of the chateau including the previous owners and very detailed pictures. It can be challenging for beginners and even experienced persons because it contains many tiny precision cuts and folds. It also does not have sufficient instructions as to the construction of the castle. Once completed it is very attractive. It is a very nice addition to a collection and I recommend it. Nice job Alain de Bussac and Paul de Boever."},{"Title":"Chateau de Chenonceau, Val de Loire (English, French, German, Spanish, Italian and Japanese Edition)","review":"ChenonceauA famed jewel of the Renaissance, the chateau of Chenonceau is surrounded by two famous gardens, one upstream (designed by Diane de Poitiers), the other is downstream (designed by Catherine de Medicis). It is a fine stone building that belonged to the De Marques family. The residence was designed for court festivities. During the Revolution, the village priest saved the Chenonceau.During the First World War, the gallery of Chenonceau was used as a hospital for soldiers wounded in the trenches. Then, during the Second World War, it helped to lead many to freedom. The demarcation line that cut France in two followed the Cher. The chateau was in the occupied zone, but the end of its gallery was in the free zone.The ground floor of the Chenonceau chateau is centered around a gallery built over the five-arched bridge that crosses the Cher. Designed as a ballroom, it is approximately 60 meters long. The floor of this gallery is covered with enameled tiles, and it leads to the larger rooms, such as the bedrooms of Francois I and Louis XIII, who was the last king to come to the chateau, and to the drawing room.Diane de Poitiers' bedroom has walls covered with splendid tapestries from Flanders. The Green room belonged to her rival, Catherine de Medicis. The kitchens are in the bridge's piers, which made it possible for foodstuffs to be easily delivered by boat. One can reach the first floor by an Italian inspired straight ramp staircase, which is one of the most original innovations of the chateau.The hall, said to be designed by Catherine Briconnet, leads to 4 rooms, including the bedroom of Cesar de Vendome, the legitimate son of Henri IV, and across from this room is the bedroom of Catherine de Medicis, with a print room richly decorated by Italian Renaissance paintings.On the second floor there is a room that reconstitutes the sepulchral decoration of Louise de Lorraine's bedroom. After the death of her husband Henri III, she came to live at Chenonceau. She took a room and had its walls and ceiling painted black. Louise de Lorraine, dressed in white, according to the royal protocol of mourning, spent the last 11 years of her life in this room.Timeline:1513: Thomas Bohier bought a manor from the Middle Ages from the Marques family, and had it destroyed. Since he was often away at war, he let his wife Catherine Briconnet manage the construction of a magnificent square pavilion1547: It was given as a gift to Diane de Poitiers, lover of King Henri II. It was her idea to build a bridge over the Cher connecting the square pavilion to the opposite bank of the river. She also had the parterres laid out in the Italian style by the gardener of Amboise, Pacello da Mercoliano.1559: Catherine de Medicis, widow of Henri II, took over the chateau after having driven away her rival. She asked the architect Philibert Delorme to build a 2 level gallery on Diane's bridge. Bernard Palissy laid out the gardens for her, and she started the construction of the outbuildings.1733: The chateau Chenonceau was purchased by the farmer-general, Dupin. Madame Dupin liked to \\"hold salons\\". Chenonceau once again had its former splendor and became an important pole of literary activity. The tutor of the Dupin boys was a certain Jean-Jacques Rousseau. It was here that he wrote \\"L'Emile\\". Much liked by the villagers, Mme Dupin was able to avoid the pillage and destruction of the chateau during the Revolution.1863: Dame Pelouze bought the chateau and spent 10 years restoring it, keeping the chateau from falling into ruins.The estate has belonged to the Menier family, famous chocolate makers, since 1913."},{"Title":"The Cup of Fury","review":"Sinclair was a friend of Jack London's, and like London he churned out work written in a style that manages to be cloyingly folksy and pretentious at the same time.

Unfortunately it fails to convince anyone because Sinclair is so self-righteous and so boring that he makes cirrhosis of the liver sound preferable to following his advice."},{"Title":"Waking Up in Memphis","review":"If you have ever wanted to read a book that tells you all the cool spots in and around the Memphis area pick this one up.

I've lived in Memphis all 45 years of my life, but it doesn't take that to see a glaring error in this book. There are several pages of photos in the book, inserted between pages 96 and 97.... the pages containing the photos are not numbered. The authors included a photo of what is supposed to be The Pyramid in Memphis.... concert hall, boxing ring, home of the NBA Grizzlies and the U of Memphis Tigers..... what the authors included is a photo of the Rock-n-Roll Hall of Fame Hall of Fame &amp; Museum, which is in CLEVELAND, OHIO, of all places!!!! Granted, that's a pyramid-shaped building, but who are they trying to fool? There's even a sign in front of the building in their photo that says &quot;Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame &amp; Museum&quot;...... and anyone with any sense of popular music knows that museum is in Cleveland, not Memphis. The authors do themselves no favors if they're trying to pass this photo off as the Pyramid in Memphis. If it was an honest mistake, then they need to fire their editor, who's supposed to catch stuff like this, right?I haven't finished the book yet, but so far have found it fun to read and reasonably accurate except for the photo mentioned above.

It is the book to get for anyone just starting out in Java. It gives a very good overview of the basics. Anyone getting this book should not get it thinking it's going to teach them everything there is to know about java, rather any reader of this book should have access to the web, Dua! So that they can refer to the Java 2 documentation found at Sun Microsystems web site. Moreover any reader should consider getting &quot;Java in a Nutshell&quot; to go along with this book. I found some typos but every typo I found in this book has been addressed in the book's own web-site which is given in day 2. I did have a difficult time understanding Java's implementation of Threads (day 10) but after looking at my O'RELLY, and Sun's Documentation, Lemay and Cadenhead's explanation came together quite nicely. After going through this book I feel confident about purchasing more advanced books on Java, in other words I have acquired the taste buds for Java (yum yum good), now it's time to try other more exotic blinds."},{"Title":"Sams Teach Yourself Java 1.2 in 21 Days","review":"If you need a good crash course in Java, then this book is for you.

I have very little programming experience, and found the book overly simplified and lacking useful examples (too much \\"toy\\" code). The title is very misleading too (not really Java 1.2), a third of the book is based on applet code using Java 1.02, and nearly the rest of the book is Java 1.1 code.

My opinion is based on the first &quot;two weeks&quot; in the text. I pretty much discarded the &quot;third week&quot; in the previous edition (2nd edition) as useless and confusing and went for comparison here with first two parts of the book. I have to say that here we have somewhat improved edition - some of poor programming examples and confusing remarks were redone and book is more user friendly to read - that is probably due to Cadenhead who writes the &quot;24 hours&quot; version splendidly. Still the book suffers of &quot;different versions of Java&quot; approach which is less informative and more confusing than it should be. Programming examples are still quite liveless which was the even a bigger problem in previous edition and generally the book suffers of too much talk at the expense of source code and meaningfull examples.

Each time I've decided to learn a new one, the most difficult part has been finding a well-written instructional book. When I recently decided to learn Java, I settled on _Sams Teach Yourself Java 1.2 in 21 Days_ after trying several others from competing publishing houses. The others were useless to me, being overly dense, glossing over major subjects, and so on. This book is nothing like that. It allowed me to understand the Java language well enough to write simple applications after reading the first seven chapters (&quot;Days,&quot; in the book's parlance).The authors write clearly, and they spend enough time on each subject to allow one to gain a real understanding of each piece of the Java language puzzle. The basics of Java programming are covered in the first seven &quot;Days.&quot; Thereafter, readers learn to create web-based applets using color, images, animation, and sound. The final seven days lead the reader into more advanced subjects, such as security, network communication, error handling, and user interface design. That's quite an impressive amount of information for one book, but the authors manage to relate it all without glossing over any aspect.The book also includes a very useful appendix on the Java class libraries, an in-chapter listing of the standard Java color definitions, and more such useful tables and charts. So, the book doesn't become useless after one has learned the language; it remains a solid reference work (although serious Java students will probably want to invest in other, more comprehensive class libarary resources at some point).Whether you plan to use Java for writing applets, applications, or both, this is an excellent starting point. Like the PC Magazine review on the book's cover says, &quot;If you get only one Java book, it should be Sams Teach Yourself Java in 21 Days.&quot;"},{"Title":"Sams Teach Yourself Java 1.2 in 21 Days","review":"This book provides a good explanation with examples of the key concepts of programming Java applets and applications.

However, some behavior and attributes make more sense if stored in the class itself rather than in the object. For example, to create a new instance of a class, you need a method that is defined and available for the class itself....It just gets too convoluted for chapter 2! The explanations are sparse!

(Keep in mind I'm new to GUI and Object-Oriented Programming.)

Of course the description of treatment is out of date, but the treatment varies from year to year and from country to country anyway. Krumme wrote about how to cope with a very ill child, how to treat his or her siblings, how to enjoy life in spite of everything awful that was happening, and how to let the child enjoy it. And all this is timeless. It is best to get a description of treatment from the doctor who is dealing with the child and to read as much as possible about how other people coped with similar situation. And Cynthia Krumme is a very wise, warm guide."},{"Title":"Having Leukemia Isn't So Bad: Of Course It Wouldn't Be My First Choice","review":"This is a well-written, moving narrative about one family's struggle with childhood cancer. The negative review for this book is puzzling, if not simply a plug for another book. It criticizes this one for not covering medical protocols in sufficient depth, which is unfair because the author does not purport to do that. I agree with the previous reviewer. A focus on medical details misses the forest for the trees. Protocols change, and are mostly the province of doctors. Which is not to say one shouldn't pay attention to the medicine and become reasonably educated on treatment options. But understanding the course of treatment is just one aspect of the ordeal, and not the most important when you consider the human beings involved. Hope, attitude, living and enjoying life; such choices are absolutely within the families' control, and they can make all the difference.

All that remains is to dot a few i's and then the great course of knowledge begun by Galileo and brought to perfection by Newton will be complete. You are performing some experiments with a mysterious substance that intrigues you: cathode rays. Your main apparatus is a one meter long vacuum tube, its pressure reduced to one-thousandth of a torr. In your hand you hold a small apparatus at some distance from the tube and which you wave in a slow, desultory fashion. You are not expecting anything, frankly you are feeling a little bored. But you are curious and perhaps the nature of these cathode rays will reveal themselves. Suddenly, you are quite startled to notice a fluorescence on the device you are waving, a detector or small screen covered with barium platinocyanide. The fluorescence is caused by the cathode rays. You are determined to discover the nature of this mysterious substance.Your name is Wilhelm Conrad Roentgen and that fluorescence you have discovered is what the world would soon know as X-rays, a term you invent for your first paper. You quickly learn that these rays have the extraordinary effect of penetrating matter, allowing you to take astonishing photographs of the bones of the hand. Reports of these photos cause a sensation in the world press in January 1896. And when Le Matin publishes a story on X-rays on 13 January, another French scientist, by the name of Henri Becquerel, is stirred to begin his own experiments with rays. Eventually he decides to expose rocks to the sun. His experiments are sidetracked, however, when he accidently photographs a key with the rays given off by a piece of uranium-bearing ore called pitchblende that had never been exposed to the sun. His astonishment causes him to rush across the hall and invite Pierre Curie and a young female student named Marie, who is working in his laboratory, to witness this strange event. They in turn are induced to discover the nature of these strange and powerful rays, now known as radiactivity. Their work is instrumental in Max Planck's explanation of black-body radiation (radiation is discretely emitted in quanta of energy), which catches the eye of Albert Einstein who explains the photoelectric effect in 1905, for which he wins the Nobel prize in 1921.With such a dizzying chain of events, the notion at the end of the 19th Century that Classical Physics was complete was repudiated and a new, much more radical view of nature was inaugurated. Abraham Pais, a physicist who knew many of the actors, author of Subtle is the Lord, the brilliant biography of Einstein, has written one of the finest histories of science I've ever read. It offers an encyclopedic overview of the development of elementary particle physics from 1895 and Roentgen's discovery of X-rays until the discovery of W and Z Bosons in 1983 by Carlo Rubbia and the researchers at CERN: a history from X to Z. It is also a brilliant and engaging portrait of the physicists who profoundly deepened our understanding of matter and physical forces. It is told in chronological order, with scientific depth (including significant equations) and a sure knowledge of every major event and discovery in the nearly one hundred years with which the book is concerned. During that period, the smallest distances explored have shrunk a hundred millionfold. This book will reward those with some knowledge of physics, but can be read selectively, without significant loss of content, by those whose knowledge of science is rudimentary at best.

The experimental and theoretical events leading up to the scientific revolution of the twentieth century are meticulously described here. What is particularly appealing about this history is the presentation of the struggle, the dead-ends, and reluctances in accepting the conceptual paradigm shift necessary from the classical view of reality.Pais also has written exceptional biographies of Albert Einstein, Niels Bohr, and Paul Dirac.\\"Subtle is the Lord - Life and Time of Albert Einstein\\"\\"Niels Bohr's Times, in Physics, Philosophy, and Polity\\"\\"Paul Dirac: The Man and his Work\\""},{"Title":"Inward Bound: Of Matter and Forces in the Physical World","review":"This is a superb history of 20th century of physics written for physicists more than historians.

At other times, it feels more like a diary, journal, or work in progress.One topic I was interested in was the development of the weak force. The book mentions some conferences, equations, and says hundreds or thousands of papers were published. This was about 4 pages. I was hoping more for the story and highlights here. It is one of the four fundamental forces. It does have an interesting history from the study of radioactivity, its role in fusion, the discovery of Z particles, etc.Then, neither as a plus or minus, simply a comment: The book can be highly technical. In general, I wouldn't describe it at all as a book for the general public.For a more general survey and reader, you might look at Emilio Segre or Frank Close's books. Segre gives much of a human account, and Close's short book provides a good summary."},{"Title":"american law and procedure volumes I through XIV","review":"When I was 13 years old, my uncle gave me a set of these books, because he took the course and earned his degree.

He researched various books to present a new look at old history. Where could these mistakes come from? Perhaps it comes from the official history books selected by the Boards of Education. Some from entertainments passed off as history. There is always the need to present old history to &quot;prove&quot; the correctness of current politics. If reading opposing viewpoints educates you, read this entertaining book and become a little wiser.Chapter 1 is on 'Patriotism'. Our national flag was rarely in use until after the War for the Union. Troops used regimental colors or state flags. The Pledge of Allegiance was created in 1892. Shenkman seems to not understand the phrase &quot;our flag was still there&quot; (p.8). The meaning to me is whether Fort McHenry was captured. Using lyrics from a song about drinking and loving would not be objectionable to 19th century military (p.9). Chapter 2 is on 'Religion'. Shenkman corrects the misinformation spread by corporate advertising. The fact that church membership (and the right to vote - p.25) was limited suggests churches operated as a ruling class and limited its membership by choice (p.23). Page 29 tells how Madison and Jefferson refused public prayers. Lincoln was the first president to affirm the usefulness of religion in politics. Lincoln was never baptized and never a member of any church; he used religion as per Machiavelli's advice. Chapter 3 is on 'Work and Play'. Shenkman doesn't note that as workers became wage-earners instead of self-employed in the 19th century, there was a new need for leisure time activities. Almost all entertainment or sports were invented in the Victorian era (p.35). Show business is the true opiate of the people. The work ethic was replaced by the consumer ethic in the 1920s (p.45). Could scrimping and saving ruin the American economy (p.46)?Chapter 4 is on 'Business'. Business has a long history of getting help from the government: special franchises, bounties, grants, immunities, protective tariffs, and land grants. Originally, corporations could not be created unless it performed a public service: canals, railroads, water supplies (p.53). Page 58 gives an example of censored history which made this book necessary. Shenkman identifies Marriner Eccles as the prophet of deficit spending (p.61). Page 63 notes how military spending supports business. The statistic about cotton production &quot;not until fifteen years after&quot; is misleading; 1860 produced a huge crop. The statistic about railroad trackage is also suspect (p.65). &quot;War is the continuation of [business rivalry] through non-diplomatic means&quot; said Clausewitz. The post war period of &quot;laissez faire&quot; resulted in more economic depressions than any time in history. The output of commodities increased at a slower rate than before the Civil War (p.69)!The book concludes with Chapter 12 'So Many Myths'. Page 193 tells of praise for Mayes' book; does this result from advertising and pay-offs to sell books? Could it explain the other myths and legends? As long as they can be sold, stories will be created. Look at TV. Just as America devised its own spelling (&quot;jail&quot; for &quot;gaol&quot;), so too they created new national myths (p.197). Are we that different from other peoples? Myths serve as symbols of cultural unity since the days of Remus and Romulus."},{"Title":"I Love Paul Revere, Whether He Rode or Not","review":"Shenkman seems to be a little too excited to rebute everything and much too eager to base his pronouncements on questionable or no documentation. Healthy scepticism is good, but being just as willing to believe nothing good and only the bad is irresponsible. Often he has a whole page to explain the \\"truth\\" without a single footnote as to where the information is backed up by documentation. Or else the documentation is questionable--one example--in stating that Eli Whitney did not invent the cotton gin he cites a book and an author neither of which comes up on an Amazon or Google search. Shenkman's information on Davey Crockett is downright laughable. Sure he was a blowhard, but his frontiersman and shooting skills are unquestionable and I feel the one source he quotes which says otherwise has to be considered suspect at best. And he did die fighting for his country.His take on Civil War info is obviously biased and slanted. I feel that his superior attitude that freedom is not worth fighting for is the result of naively taking for granted what America is all about. Some of his information is correct, much is questionable, and some is downright wrong. Don't automatically believe any account of history including this one."},{"Title":"I Love Paul Revere, Whether He Rode or Not","review":"As Forrest Gump would say, \\"I Love Paul Revere, Whether He Rode or Not\\" is like a box of chocolates. You just don't know what you're going to get.Author Richard Shenkman has filled this book with bucketfuls of interesting and often surprising historical tidbits. But in reaching for the good stuff he sometimes overreaches, including items that are questionable or just dull.Shenkman is at his best when he picks a specific and well-known historical \\"fact\\" -- and then carefully debunks it. For example: The Pilgrims didn't land at Plymouth Rock, Prohibition wasn't the flop many believe and Betsy Ross did not sew the first American flag.At other times, Shenkman's assumptions about what Americans believe are dubious. He says the anti-slavery radical John Brown really wasn't a hero -- but I never considered him one. He says that \\"it is often thought\\" that Franklin Roosevelt got his inspiration for the New Deal from John Maynard Keynes (and then disproves it). Huh? I've never heard that one.Shenkman even tries to debunk the phrase \\"History repeats itself\\" by showing that historical events always have different circumstances. C'mon. No one thinks the phrase means history repeats itself *exactly*.Don't get me wrong. There's a lot in this book that's thought-provoking, just not all of it. For the most part, Shenkman is fastidious in providing examples to illustrate his points. Curiously, though, he occasionally throws out a debatable statement without any support, as when he says, \\"It is now conceded that the weakness of the politcal parties is disastrous.\\"I'd suggest this book might be best used like a reference book. Keep it on your shelf, and when you're curious about an episode in American history, use the index to see what Shenkman has to say about it. There's a good chance he'll have something to say that surprises you."},{"Title":"I Love Paul Revere, Whether He Rode or Not","review":"Let me start off by saying that I RARELY read books.

What do these crimes have in common? At the end of November Veil, Roger Shepperd, Christian Canadian Mounty, was contemplating a move which he has made when April Operation opens. However, his family has not yet joined him. That is probably just as well since Roger is never home and doesn't get much sleep while trying to solve the afore-mentioned cases. Roger's first big case in New Brunswick is one of the most baffling that he has ever had. As usual, Linda Hall's complicated plot twists keep the reader (and Roger!) guessing until the very end. This is another winning mystery in the RCMP series and it makes the character of Roger even more of a role model an example than before as he handles the explosive topic of abortion."},{"Title":"April Operation (RCMP Series #3)","review":"On the same day that Abortion provider Dr. Douglas Shanahan is shot dead at him home, the young daughter of Emma Knoll, the Shanahan Clinic manager disappears on her way home from school. With no evidence left behind in either case, Sergeant Roger Sheppard of the St. Matthews detachment of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police realized that he is confronted with a premeditated, carefully planned kidnaping and homicide. A group calling themselves the Christian Freedom Life Army claims responsibility for both crimes. But who and where are they? It's a race against time and against odds, but as Roger pursues these Christian renegades, he is reminded that to be truly Christian means seeing people the way Jesus Does. Linda Hall is a polished and accomplished author whose two previous Sergeant Sheppard mysteries, August Gamble (0934998620, ...) and November Veil (093499868X, ...) are also very highly recommended for mystery buffs in general, and those hold a special appreciated for Christian mystery adventure fiction in particular."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (The Earthsea Cycle, Book 1)","review":"I hated this book.

I am an avid Sci-fi/Fantasy reader, having digested everything from Harry Potter to King's Dark Tower series to Clarke's Rama series. I purchased A Wizard of Earthsea with high anticipation, having never read a LeGuin novel.I enjoyed the first 20 pages. Then, somewhere thereafter, I had a hard time reading this book. I kept putting it down. Somewhere around page seventy I found myself unable to continue. Every page became like torture, and I threw in the towel. Here are a few things I disliked about the book:1) Ged. Ged was a cookie cutter character. LeGuin provided us with no description of Ged (physical or otherwise), no motivations at all behind Ged's actions, and no details about his character. LeGuin is positively the worst author I have ever read when it comes to creating enthralling, interesting characters. There was nothing - nothing - given to describe or flesh out Ged at all. He simply was a boy in a town who learned spells and who went to a wizard's school. That is it. That is THE fleshing out of Ged. Don't believe me? Read it yourself.2) The story. The story is non-existent. Through the first 70 pages there is a lot of telling about this place or that, and this mountain or that, but there is very little story at all. The first 20 pages where Ged saved his town were the only interesting parts. The problem with the telling is that it is dull and uninteresting. There is nothing exciting about Earthsea.3) Runes. It seems that LeGuin spent all her time developing an elaborate map and spell system, but couldn't wrap a story around them. The \\"real names/runes\\" thing was interesting for a half a page.Folks, this was the dullest book I've read in a long while. It was like eating cardboard. Really. It was like reading a parts inventory for an automobile.This book was 100% devoid of life. No interesting characters. No interesting story. Devoid of plot. No action. Stale lands. Boring travel. Yada. Yada. Yada. I will not purchase another LeGuin book. How this story got into print is beyond me. I would rather read Tolkien or Rowling writing about their bathroom than read the most acclaimed LeGuin book.Nothing remotely intriguing. LeGuin is unable to tell anything that even remotely resembles a story. This is a world-building book. As a story is is fire-starter."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (The Earthsea Cycle, Book 1)","review":"I saw the TV show made, so I wanted to check out the full story.It was a disappointment, but my wife loved it.

Ranking amongst the best fantasy novels I have read.When I discovered Leguin continued the saga, I couldn't wait to get hold of the other three.What a disappointment it was. It looks like a completely different author. The first was a writer, a storyteller and a good one at that. The second one was a disgruntled feminist with the delusion she has writing abilities.The second three books differ from the first three as a cheap cowboy novel differs from Tolkien.By all means, do read the first three books. They are well worth it. But forget the last three. A phone directory makes more compelling and less biased reading."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (The Earthsea Cycle, Book 1)","review":"'A Wizard of Earthsea' is a book I did not enjoy. It starts out with a young boy named Sparrowhawk who is later named Ged. This is the first part I did not like about it. He is renamed and not even his family knows his name because if somebody knows your name they have complete power over you, Ged was able to defeat the shadow because he knew its name. This made absolutely no sense whatsoever to me. He is then taken away to learn magic from a teacher who is a stranger, who is the one who named him even though, nobody knew the man.Ged was taken away by the man because he had learned magic from his aunt who was sort of strange. He was taught by her to call birds down from the skies. The next part that I didn't like was magic was more of a secret language than special powers. Rather than having to possess any kind of power you just had to say a secret word. I enjoy books with real magic. In this anyone who knew the word could do magic, I think the person should have to have a power.Ged then goes to school for magic where he becomes arrogant and flaunts his power. He is one day trying to raise the dead to prove himself, and ends up raising a shadow. That part I didn't like either, the shadow simply came out of a hole in the air, scratched Ged, and was chased away. I think the action scene could have been a little better, they could have had a huge fight and described the moves rather than a line or two or nothing. Another action scene was with the dragon, which was horrible because he killed them all in the same way, and then persuaded the mother dragon not to kill lots of people. Another part that was not well thought out was, in dragon speak you could not lie. It is impossible to have a language in which you could not say words because they were not true.The only good part was a big action scene of him running from a shadow through the woods. This part was full of suspense and you wanted to find out what happened. Then he finally got away to a castle (that he ran to) and was tricked and had to run from there. Then Le Guinn, the author, made a surprise ending, that the shadow was really the dark side of him. But being as this was a fantasy/ magic/ action book, there should not have been a surprise. Those are the kind of books that have a good side and a bad side (another bad part, Le Guinn didn't make sides she made a one vs. one battle). Usually the book ends in one final win it all or lose it all battle. This ended with him chasing the shadow (which was good) and saying its name. A book like this always ends in a real battle. All in all it was a slow read and I will never read another book in the series I do not recommend the book."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (The Earthsea Cycle, Book 1)","review":"I found Earthsea to be quite a difficult read. There is no real background about Duny who ends up going from age 4 to a thirteen year old in less than two chapters. He also ends up getting his name changed to Ged by the end of the first chapter. It is not clear to me as to why he was not given the proper name at birth. I also found it difficult to take the story seriously as far as Gont being known for wizards and other forms of sorcery, maybe if I had an interest in fantasy, I may be more impressed by the storyline. The story just seems overdone to me. Even though it was written over thirty years ago, it still seems redundant due to all of the books and movies that have similar storylines. The names of the people and places are difficult to pronounce which made me focus more on what I was trying to pronounce and not the story itself. The theme was unclear to me (if there really was one) and the story seemed to just ramble on aimlessly. While reading this book I could not help but compare it to Lord of the Rings or Harry Potter, which I recently finished. Earthsea sounds so much like both stories, only far less of interest. This could have been a far better story had Duny/Ged not appeared to be going around in circles. And the maps that were included in the story did not help me one bit, it just made me glad that there was one less page to read. Le Guin tries to elaborate on details that do not seem to connect at all to Ged's journey throughout the story. It is a wonder that the book is still in print."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (The Earthsea Cycle, Book 1)","review":"A Wizard of EarthSea is one of the first fantasy novels written. She wrote around the same time that J.R.R. Tolkien and Roger Zelazney, founders of the fantasty genre, wrote. This book is written on a lower level of reading as like those found in the young adult/teen section of a library or Barnes and Noble bookstore. Even still, I respect it because it was one of the first fantasy novels, and the modern so-called fantasy novels are really just copies and imitations of what has already been written. This is a series of, I believe, five books. It has some good ideas that could be used in a comprehensive background of magic and its properties. One such idea is that everything has a true name in the Old Speech. This idea is the basis of illusion. If a rock seemingly turns into a diamond, its essence, so to speak, or true name is still a rock. The 'diamond' is an illusion. Overall, this book is entertaining and has a lot of good ideas about magic and heroes, but it is written on a lower level of reading and I wasn't thrilled with the plot. It does have well-done maps and an interesting world in which Sparrowhawk, or his true name/Old Speech name: Ged, travels. It is complete with different cultures and languages. le Guin deserves to be recognized as another founder of fantasty, although I don't believe she is as good as the two stated earlier in the paragraph."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (The Earthsea Cycle, Book 1)","review":"I started this novel with a great deal of anticipation; I had read reviews, and seen this book on many fan lists, so I bought it.Usually, when I start the first book in a fantasy series, I spend many sleepless nights pouring through each sequel until I have finished the series. This is the first time I had no interest in finding out what happened in the subsequent books.The stories and characters were horribly underdeveloped. Neither were built up enough for me to even care about what happened to them. The entire approach to wizardry felt overly simplistic for the fantastic events that were supposedly happening.I haven't been this disappointed with anything since I saw Dungeons and Dragons (what a pile that thing was)."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (The Earthsea Cycle, Book 1)","review":"I was manipulated into reading this book by my seventh grade English teacher (I'm in ninth grade now, so be warned, this review was written by an aliterate high-schooler).As people here have said before, &quot;A Wizard of Earthsea&quot; is a lot like &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot;. It's tedious, slow to start, sexist, incredibly archaic, impersonal, and featuring a stiff (as in, Al Gore stiff) unempathetic lead character. Also, like &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot;, it has some awesome scenes, an original concept, depth, well-written character development, and an awesome ending. Pick it up on a rainy day... it's not a must-read, but read it anyway because some day some English teacher will probably force you to..It's a pretty good book of Tolkien caliber, but very slow to start.

The book may have been special when it was released many decades ago, but it pales when compared to modern works from authors like Patrick Rothfuss and George R.R. Martin. The world around the main character is lifeless, and the ending is a disappointment. Also, the arc of the book is relatively simple and can be summed up as follows: Young wizard makes a bad mistake, young wizard runs from mistake and fails, young wizard defeats mistake by facing it head on. Good lesson, though: Don't run from your fears.The most interesting thing about this book is that it is a foundation upon which many other authors have built improved stories. Additionally, it appears to be the direct inspiration for Rothfuss' \\"naming\\" of things, i.e., that all things have a true name which is hidden and, if spoken by another, allow that thing to be controlled by the speaker."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (The Earthsea Cycle, Book 1)","review":"I really wasn't impressed with this novel. I found it lacking not only in action but also in depth, plot and meaning. I guess I'm just missing something, but to me it seemed like nothing happened, like I wasted a few good hours of my life that I could have spent drooling in front of the TV. I don't know why i kept reading through the third book, probably my misinterpreted view that there is to be a point to novels. Three books of short, shallow sentances that move the plot along at a snail's crawl. She introduces characters and then just forgets about them(Tombs of Atuan?) What was the second book for anyway? To prove he could hunt treasure and lure small girls from their homes?

I didn't even think it was written well..."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (The Earthsea Cycle, Book 1)","review":"It has been at least a decade since I read either LeGuin or Tolkien. LeGuin because I have not had the time; Tolkien because I did not want to be bored out of my wits yet again. But from memory alone, I know that LeGuin's writing is in a word: Fantastic. Her command of English prose is absolute genius. I can still remember the haunting beauty of those words in A Wizard of Earthsea that gave each thing its true name, as if all of us, on this earth, had such a name as well. And I still remember the scene in The Farthest Shore on which the reader casts his eyes: dragons floating in the distant air, reflecting the gold of the sun from their wings, onto the water. That image haunts one's memory, because LeGuin gives us something rare not only in fantasy, but in all of literature -- the shared imagination : so vivid that we cannot help but retain those images in indelible memory. Though I read her novels as a teenager, I also read Shakespeare and Tolstoy, and Joyce and Homer. It strikes me as rather insipid to plug her novels into the genre of juvenile literature while somehow vaunting Tolkien's as for the sophisticated and mature. I really beg to differ. LeGuin's Earthsea is far richer, far more imaginative, far more convincing, and dare I say, just darn more interesting, than the world of Tolkien's pen (I won't say imagination). And that Joyce's Ulysses should be about a young Stephen Dedalus becoming his nation's poet has never caused that novel to be called a book of Bildungsroman. Please! Her novels, if we must be plain, are about the search for self, which is not a meager task accomplished between the ages of 11 and 20 -- but a lifelong endeavor. Earthsea is about discovery, of a new and fantastic, beautiful world, and of oneself, as deep, as turbulent, as entangled and mesmerizing as the realm of her imagination. Is this not what we hope for from any piece of art? Understanding of the world, and understanding of the worlds within.And simply because LeGuin's novels are terse and stylistically written in the meter of lore and legend, does not render it in any way inferior to the prose of Tolkien. In fact, many an intelligent reader would gladly do without the droning repetition and pedantic, overwrought elaborations of Lord of the Rings. Quantity does not equal genius. In fact, the true poet is one who says the most with least words. One only has to read a single Shakespeare play to realize that.So once and for all, let us give Ms. LeGuin her due honor, and stop comparing her to a writer such as Tolkien, who truly is much less than her equal. Ms. LeGuin is by my estimation one of the greatest fantasy novelists, and possibly THE Greatest, ever to have taken up the pen. She writes fantasy not to create a world for its own sake (as might be said of some others), but to bring that world of the imagination into the realm of the possible, the credible, the believable -- so much that we would believe in spite of ourselves, and we only wish we could will this imagined world into being a part of our own."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (The Earthsea Cycle, Book 1)","review":"Perhaps back in the 60s Tolkien fans were ready to devour any new fantasy novel. To my dismay, \\"a high fantasy classic\\" this is not. It certainly is a good template for it: moral lessons, good vs. evil, wizened wizards, and a young wizard on a grand quest. But there's not much more than that. There's too much prose and not enough character insight to uphold the already threadbare plot. The most comprehensive description of Earthsea is in the maps which are nice and all, but this is a book - not an atlas.Too short to be a real novel, it'd do better as a children's book. However, in this case size really doesn't matter. The Last Unicorn by Peter Beagle has the same template but unlike A Wizard of Earthsea, the unicorn's voyage is filled with peril through vivid lands accompanied by a colorful cast of characters in only 200 pages. Even today's current poptart, Harry Potter, has the bumbling Ron, quirky Dumbledore, and slimy Snape. LeGuin's wizards are all Arch-Changer this or Arch-Namer that - who seem ready to die at any moment. Rocks have more personality. The protaganist is Ged. Yep, Ged. Oh and he gets spiteful and thus must redeem himself. Thats all I know. Ogion tries but fails to be a Gandalf. The only moments of life shine through the dialogue and as soon as a glimpse of emotion appears... it vanishes.In spite of these faults, it's not so terrible; There is a sense of history and timelessness to the tale. The moral lessons ring loud and true. \\"That which gives us power to work magic, sets the the limits of that power... it if were not so, the wickedness of the powerful or the folly of the wise would long ago have sought to change what cannot be changed, and Equilibrium would fail.\\"Lines like that make reading this book worth hacking through the bone dry parts. After reading LeGuin's speculative work - The Left Hand of Darkness and the Dispossessed, I found her intelligent & thought provoking but uninspired. So I was prepared for a more personal work through her fantasy in A Wizard of Earthsea.

The Audible publishers took the old cassette recording (!!) from the dark ages of voice recording technology and poured it into a digital file. The cassette breaks are still included in the audio, e.g. \\"This is the end of cassette one. Please eject the cassette and turn it over...\\" Even worse, the narrator, Rob Inglis, stops and draws breath after every group of sentences. He should have moved away from the microphone when he needed to draw breath. It sounds gasping at times. Fairly loud every time. I started to cringe every time I heard him gasping for breath between sentences.As for the story itself, it started off with a bang, as a young boy named Duny, aka Sparrowhawk (but mostly referred to as Ged) learns that he is magical. After he saves the village from invaders by creating dense fog, he becomes apprentice to a wise wizard named Ogion. Ged likes Ogion, but when that benevolent wizard doesn't teach him enough flashy spells to suit his ambitions, he decides to attend a school of wizardry. Once at the special school, he must deal with his constant feelings of inferiority. He was born the poor son of a forger, and many of these boys are upper class and have been studying magic for years. He assumes several of the teachers and the boys (Jasper especially) are mocking him, but I am not so sure they were in every case.Ged's pride cannot swallow the supposed mockery so he decides to prove to them all -- especially Jasper -- that he is the best wizard ever. Not realizing what he is calling up, he casts a dark forbidden spell, calling up a shadowy monster. Because of his actions, some people die, including the school's head wizard, who supposedly banishes the shadow. Several years alter, Ged realizes that his shadow monster is still at large, working evil. He runs from it, until Ogion tells him that he must become the hunter, and chase after it. So he does, and in the process he must grow up fast.The ending was all it should be. An outstanding finale to the first book in the series.An okay story, but I was unsatisfied. It felt like a series of events without any glue to hold them together -- an unemotional telling of events. I felt distanced from Ged, because the author failed to adequately reveal his emotions and thoughts, even though he should have been feeling and thinking a great deal, given the danger and death that surrounded him in some sections. Also, I wanted to get to know some secondary characters. I wanted Ged's relationships with Vetch and Ogion to be more developed. This story was very Ged-centric. In that, it was really the story of a young boy with an inferiority complex and a lot of pride who fights his inner shadows and emerges the victor. Nice.Back to the quality of the Audible file, the narrator was not very skilled, technology faults notwithstanding. He was no Jim Dale."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (The Earthsea Cycle, Book 1)","review":"Before he became a legend, the sorcerer Ged, called Sparrowhawk, was a proud and standoffish young man who conjured a nameless and dangerous shadow--a feat of impressive magic that would haunt him throughout his youth. A Wizard of Earthsea is the truth behind a fable, told in a dry but arcane tone that mimics both parts; unfortunately I had no love for the language, which fulfilled its purpose but also reads as stilted and, for me, mostly served to slow the text. Fortunately it's a slim volume, so even when slowed it never stagnates, and the austerity of language combined with the density of action does have a certain fable-esque quality. It seems strange to say this of Le Guin, but one wishes for more (or any) worthwhile female characters, but Ged is fantastic, flawed but rich with potential, and I can understand why this is a young adult/coming of age classic. Best of all, the ending--while not unpredictable--carries weight: it's strong and satisfying, and rewarded my otherwise ambivalent interest in the book. I expect I wasn't the ideal audience for this, and don't think I'll pick up the rest of the series, but I still recommend it on the basis of the strengths I saw although I wasn't the one to appreciate them, and on the assumptions that others will."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (The Earthsea Cycle, Book 1)","review":"Tight, well-written piece of classic fantasy literature, but the ending was just completely deflating, wasting an entire book's worth of intense build-up."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (The Earthsea Cycle, Book 1)","review":"Ged's amazing potential as a wizard is recognized and he is plucked from a remote village by a master wizard, destined to become one of the greatest wizards of all.And then that terrible human frailty, pride, gets the upper hand, and Ged makes a mistake that seemingly ruins his life.And Ged is off on a quest to restore the world.Le Guin writes with the rhythm of a poet and with the wisdom of a philosopher in this beautiful classic fantasy novel."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (The Earthsea Cycle, Book 1)","review":"This trilogy, of which this book is the first, is every bit as brilliant as the Lord of the Rings, trilogy.

Lovely writing."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (The Earthsea Cycle, Book 1)","review":"Having spent a lot of my time reading non-fiction recently, I wanted to step out of this world and into another. The Wizard of Earthsea was definitely a good choice. The plot travels at a brisk pace and the characters and world are easy to visualize and understand. However, these are not cardboard cut-outs. The characters were some of the most well developed I've read in a fantasy book in a while (coincidentally characters developed a lot like some of the memoir books I've been reading). The world was also superbly realized. It was dynamic; cultures were diverse; the world was interesting. The magic was more intelligently implemented than most. (Personally I felt some of it was too much \\"just go believe me here\\" but that's just me) I unfortunately have a stack of books I want to dive into first, but when I get back to this series I will feel most refreshed."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (The Earthsea Cycle, Book 1)","review":"I think you have to read the first three books of Earthsea as one entity. Each is only about 200 pages long, so if you read all three you'll still be under the average length of one volume of the usual wordy fantasy series.Le Guin's prose is a marvel of compact elegance; she can tell you what you need to know in a few vivid paragraphs where other fantasy writers need pages and pages. \\"A Wizard of Earthsea\\" is perhaps my least favorite of the three books, although it's essential to the development of the story. It's Ged's bildungsroman, in which Le Guin establishes the parameters of her magic universe and Ged learns what he needs to know to become a true wizard.My favorite remains \\"The Tombs of Atuan,\\" the middle novel -- an involving story with an attractive young heroine."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (The Earthsea Cycle, Book 1)","review":"I cannot rave about this book enough. The Earthsea cycle is in the number one spot of my best all time favorite YA fantasy novels.I see there are some 400 people who agree with me."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (The Earthsea Cycle, Book 1)","review":"I never thought that a 144 page story would take me SO LONG TO READ. Yikes. I planned to read the first three books of the Earthsea series for Jawas Read, Too!'s Summer of Series, but once again I fear I will fail at a challenge. Maybe if I'm lucky the Tombs of Atuan review will be up tomorrow. Fingers crossed. There are a few good, sensible excuses for my painfully long reading of A Wizard of Earthsea: I recently got a summer job and my hours have gone up lately, especially weekend hours which is prime reading time for me, and I have taken a few vacations in which reading was impossible. But then there is the fact of this book simply did not want me to read it quickly. It refused to be read for more than 20 minutes at a time. I blame Ged.I have been wanting to read a Le Guin book for many moons now. I have heard from a couple people that she is a classic, and everyone must read her before they die. I did some scouting around, like I normally do when I hear such a thing, to see what she has written and if they sound like my thing. The Earthsea trilogy definately sounded like my thing, along with a few of her other books I might pick up later. I put the series of my To Be Read list, but since there were no copies available at my local libraries, I forgot about them. Then I heard about Jawas' Summer of Series. And I found an omnibus edition of the series on Paperback Swap. The stars were aligned. In my defense, I did only receive the omnibus in the middle of June and this challenge is only for the month of June. So there.Ged was born on the island of Gont, an island known for housing powerful and prominent wizards. Not many from Ged's poor village suspected the great things that he would someday come to do. They couldn't foresee that one day songs would be song of the little ruffian running among the goats. One day, a great wizard living on Gont comes and takes Ged away to live with him. There he tries to show Ged what it means to be a wizard, but he is a slow teacher. Ged soon goes bored, and when he is asked to go to a school for wizards on Roke island, he goes. At the school, he learns tought lessons that shape the rest of his life. He learns one lesson too late and unleashes a dark burden on Earthsea that he must vanquish at once or die trying.A Wizard of Earthsea is told as a folk tale or legend. The reader is told a certain amount at the beginning of the story about how things will end. I really dislike this way of storytelling because I like a certain amount of mystery in my stories. I know that things will more than likely end up happy. And I know that the protagonist will be superfantasticamazing because if there weren't going to end up being a somebody, why write a story about them? No one wants to read a story about a wizard who sits on his couch all day, using magic to change the channels. But I still want to pretend to be surprised when things work out this way. I like the warm and fuzzy feeling I get when the characters defeat the evil and head back home to their family and friends. This didn't happen to me in a Wizard of Earthsea because I had known all along what would happen.Despite the feeling of being spoiled, I thought the story was original and entertaining to read. Ged begins his real studies as a wizard with a patient and mysterious wizard called Ogion. I loved Ogion, obviously. How could you not? He was the typical kindly old wizard who knows more than he cares to tell, but only for the good of those around him. He is conscious of the great power he could yield, but he also knows the consequences of everything he does. The greatest part of the story for me was the trials Ged had to go through to learn that exact lesson of consequences and being at peace with oneself as Ogion was. I appreciated how it wasn't an easy thing for him to learn, but how in learning it would make it him an great and powerful user of magic. Some parts of the story, especially towards the end, were very profound and philosophical when discussing the lessons Ged had learned. I think these parts showed what a fantastic author Ms. Le Guin is.I found Ged to be a complex character, but I did not have much attachment to him. My problem with this was the distance that telling the story as a legend put between the reader and the protagonist. Legends are not too concerned with thoughts and feelings. The story is explained as, \\"Something happens, Ged reacts, reason he reacts is explained.\\" The reasons were more told than shown in my opinion. Not only that, but important building years of Ged's life are simply skipped over. I couldn't feel a connection with Ged even though I did feel he was a great character; it was an odd feeling. I loved how he wasn't an innocent viction when it came to his school boy enemy, Jasper. He was as much to blame, if not more so, in creating an enemy in Jasper. He imagined things that weren't there, or things that could have easily been overlooked, he brought to the forefront of his mind and obsessed over. These obsessions came to a head when the two boys took their growing power too far because they didn't understand the consequences of what they were doing yet.The worldbuilding of Earthsea is elaborately over-the-top, and I ate it up. When I first heard if the name Earthsea, I scoffed at its absurdity. I found myself thinking, \\"Could this author be any more unoriginal? Earth and sea, I wonder where she got those two words from?\\" I now swallow those words. I love that name now. It makes perfect sense when you create a world filled with only with hundreds and thousands of tiny islands. I found myself thinking that an in-depth look at the politics of these islands would be fantastic, and I thoroughly enjoyed the little snippets Le Guin gave us of each island's world. I was also overjoyed with the close up maps that were interspersed within the book; I needed them desperately. The little islands were sometimes hard to find in the big map, and I like to know exactly where I am in the world. Another important part of the Earthsea world are names. Every single thing, from a wave to an insect, has a true name which you must know to control it. Names are sometimes important parts in fantasy novels involving magic; books like Eragon come to mind. A Wizard if Earthsea took this theme to the extreme. A person, if they wanted to control a person, had to work to find out a person's name, because surely a person would guard that secret with everything they had. It was an interesting concept and added another layer to Le Guin's theme that no power comes without working.Rating: 7 out of 10. I agree that A Wizard of Earthsea is a classic in the fantasy genre. I have heard some say it paved the way for Harry Potter, which I can, loosely, see. I had a few problems with the story, the main one being how slow going it was for me. I could read the whole Harry Potter series in less days than it took me to read this one book. I will definately pick up more Le Guin books, and I can already tell you that I enjoy the Tombs of Atuan much more."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (The Earthsea Cycle, Book 1)","review":"This is a classic fantasy, complete with dragons, magic, and of course the proud and gifted wizard-in-training, Ged. Le Guin's style, which appeals to me more the older I become, is simple, spare, yet colorfully descriptive. It's amazing how much she can cram into a mere 182 pages. I lost a copy of this book when I was a teenager, and was very pleased to discover I could purchase a similar copy, with the original cover artwork, on Amazon."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (The Earthsea Cycle, Book 1)","review":"I have nothing much to say, it's just very good book! It makes you think differently maybe see things differently. I don't know about others, but I like this trilogy very much."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (The Earthsea Cycle, Book 1)","review":"Le Guin wrote this book before the 400+ page standard for a 'good' fantasy book came about. This book takes you there -- you could be Ged and isn't that really what fantasy books are all about? This one's on par with The Hobbit, Dune, Ender's Game etc., in my top shelf category. The rest of the 'series' isn't a trilogy in today's meaning, rather looking at Ged later in life. I'm not a huge fan of Le Guin, but this one will read as well 100 years from now as today."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (The Earthsea Cycle, Book 1)","review":"A Wizard of Earthsea not only has a great characters but a great plot as well. Le Guin really spents time on telling about the characters and the scenery and i think it really gives a sense of understanding to the whole thing. The story of a young man growing to be more than he had expected more or less by accident is told throughout the entire earthsea series and this book starts the seires off greatly.

It is telling that she has created a marvelous invention -- despite all promises, even she can't help returning to the scene.It starts off well. A WIZARD OF EARTHSEA is an intense starting point. It describes a harsh realm, where, even with the aid of everpresent magic, life is tough, and survival is eked out. From here, Le Guin launches her fable of Ged, the Sparrowhawk, an intensely talented but brash young man. The consequences of his pride are unleashed in dramatic fashion, and ultimately he must confront the dark forces of life.There is nothing glib, and dark surprises abound. Le Guin moves the story along at a reasonable pace, with a disappointingly (but probably necessarily) compact conclusion. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (The Earthsea Cycle, Book 1)","review":"I first read this book as a teenager, and recently re-read it as an adult. The book has held up wonderfully! The prose is crisp and clear, the story compelling, and the characters interesting. Sparrowhawk/Ged is a wonderful apprentice-hero...he has to learn not only how to be a wizard (hmmm, a school for wizards...sound familiar?), but more importantly, he has to learn how to become a hero. That quest, which is much more important than any of the steps he takes to achieve it, is the true focus of the book. A coming of age stories with magic, dragons and fearsome monsters...what more could you ask for?"},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (The Earthsea Cycle, Book 1)","review":"The series of Earthsea is great! I enjoyed the first book one of my teacher lent me, and now I'm working on the third, having completely enjoyed the second. I love Ursula K.

I recommend you buy this book, but I must warn you, you're going to get hooked on it!"},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (The Earthsea Cycle, Book 1)","review":"Not too many fantasy series really impress me. Of this date,there have only been two: Pullman's His Dark Materials and TolkiensLOTR. This book, and series, come close, but i found them wanting.AWizard of EarthSea has its own appeal, in the style that marks theseries. The story has the air of a saga, and one gets the feeling thatimportant things might happen with Ged. People have called it HighFantasy, which is fine. This book is thoughtful and insightful, butthere a few problems.First of all, although great things seem to bein store for Ged, they are not apparent in this book. The sense ofdestiny that was created in the beginning got lost somewhere along theway, and now Ged drifts along with his sole purpose of exterminating ashadow.The book also has little to hold it together; again we getthe feeling of being adrift. He wanders from town to town, from evilcastle to dragon-infested island to fishing villages. Another problemis the interminable length of the boat rides, which creates nosuspense at all for his confrontation with the shadow; nor does itimpress with its imagery, or its rich complexity. The book franklygets a little dull towards the end. In good fantasy we usually get atleast a glimpse of some overarching conflict. That is absent here,almost completely. I'm not asking for a thriller but a book should nottake too much energy just to stay focused. Finally, the way he defeatsthe shadow has the air of a cheap movie ...The book isn't bad. Theauthor's language is simple yet evocative, and I found myselfcontemplating the book. If the second half of the book had been asgood as the first i would have to give it at least 4 stars. LeGuin'sseries has an air of timelessness about it. I only wish this promisehadn't been largely ignored in the rest of the series."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (The Earthsea Cycle, Book 1)","review":"Before there was Harry Potter, there was Ged, also known as Sparrowhawk. He has the potential to become the greatest wizard of Earthsea, but his youthful arrogance keeps getting him in trouble---and may get him killed. A Wizard of Earthsea is the first in this series by Ursula K. LeGuin.I enjoyed this book even though Le Guin uses less narrative than exposition (more \\"tell\\" than \\"show). It's almost like reading something in the style of the Old Testament. After I thought about it, I decided it was not a bad way to present this story. It would have been too drawn out otherwise."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (The Earthsea Cycle, Book 1)","review":"Way back in the dark ages before the Harry Potter books were published, Ursula K Leguin's Earthsea trilogy was widely agreed to be one of the best fantasy series ever written. Like many others from my generation, I read \\"A Wizard of Earthsea\\" at least ten times. After recently picking up my old copy, I was pleased to find that the book stands up remarkably well from an adult perspective. LeGuin's writing is, as always, top notch. She uses a simple vocabulary and short, straightforward descriptions, and doesn't include very many big slabs of dialogue. Consequently, the book remains short (183 pages) and moves quickly from one event to the next. The ending is quite suspenseful. Actually, the entire book is quite suspenseful, and the brief conflict scenes draw you in and make you feel like you're in the middle of the action.The characters are another of the novel's biggest strengths. The protagonist, Ged, is a young wizard in training. During an attempt to show off his skills, he accidentally unleashes a shadow from the world of the dead and realizes that he must fix his mistake by tracking the shadow down and destroying it. LeGuin doesn't take the sledgehammer approach to characterization; instead, she lets us see Ged's personality and changes through his behavior. Unlike many other fantasy authors, LeGuin doesn't neglect her minor characters, and she develops the relationships between people with great care.The plot of \\"A Wizard of Earthsea\\" is very tight and well organized, with every major confrontation contributing to the overall meaning. A less talented author could easily have taken twice as many pages and not said nearly as much. The system of magic in LeGuin's world is more imaginative than in many other series, and she includes many episodes where Ged employs his magic powers in clever ways. Overall, LeGuin has the one thing that many fantasy authors lack: the ability to have fun. She makes \\"A Wizard of Earthsea\\" enjoyably for both children and adults."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (The Earthsea Cycle, Book 1)","review":"A Wizard of Earthsea was an interesting book. It's about a precocious boy who is born on the island of Gont. He starts out by learning a bit of magic from his aunt, the village witch, but then the mage of his homeland takes him in as a prentice, and names him Ged. Then the mage sends him off to a wizard school on the island of Roke. There, trying to show off, Ged accidentally unleashes a mysterious, shadow beast that follows him (after he leaves the school) wherever he travels. Finally, the assiduous shadow corners him, and he is almost pulled into the unexplainable darkness, but with the help of his friend Vetch, he makes it through and learns the importance of friendship.Ged also masters throughout the story, the art of wizardry, whether it dark or light, and about courage and believing yourself. I liked this book, but because it was written in the sixties it wasn't very humorous, and also I don't think the story was planned out that well. It did have this quality about it, however, that made it seem ancient and mystical when I was reading it, and I liked that. Harry Potter is very different from A Wizard of Earthsea; the styles of writing are completely different and probably the only similarity between the two is that there is magic involved. I have just started the second book of the Earthsea cycle, The Tombs of Atuan, and I'm liking it more than A Wizard of Earthsea so far. Over all it was a pretty good book, and I recommend it to people who are looking for a probably more out of the ordinary book than others they've read."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (The Earthsea Cycle, Book 1)","review":"Le Guin's Earthsea Cycle has found its place among the great fantasy series of the time.

It is written primarily in a historic point of view about a great wizard in his impetuous youth and the trials and tribulations that he has to undergo to find himself. Le Guin switches from time to time to an insider's voice to show the humanity of the main character, but always returns to her place of historian for the land of Earthsea.Ged, his master Ogion, and his friend's sister, Yarrow are drawn well, but most other character lack any depth. Even the book's villain's personality is not filled out enough to make the reader understand Ged's fear of it. The author could have easily painted this character based Ged's imagination more clearly to pull the reader in more.The characters colorlessness is contrasted with the full breadth of detail afforded to the workings of magic and history of the land. If nothing else draws the reader in it is how Le Guin explains the workings of the ancient art and how it affects the world around it."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (The Earthsea Cycle, Book 1)","review":"Ursula Le Guin's Earthsea is one of fantasy fiction's most unique and endearing series. The world she has created is vivid with culture, magic and mythos, the first installment of which is A Wizard of Earthsea. The novel tells the coming-of-age story of Ged who must solve a riddle to find the hero in himself. Throughout his transformation, Le Guin avoids most clich&eacute; fantasy tropes and renders a very refreshing, human story written in simple, flowing prose. Set in a southeast Asian style archipelago of islands, magic, ancient wisdom and dragons decorate the pages as Ged chases a shadow he's foolishly unleashed upon the world. But it is his wits that he must depend on the most to absorb the lessons he learns along the way and develop into a man in the process. Filled with profound dialogue and touching characters, the story is geared towards young people, but undoubtedly adults can find something novel and worthy of note as well. Eschewing Tolkien-esque fantasy, the fundamental ideology of the novel is Daoist in nature, with a dose of Jungian psychoanalysis thrown in for good measure. This book is highly recommended for those who are interested in knowing what a fantasy world influenced by the teachings of Daoism may be like, or, in a much simpler fashion, as a great way of introducing one's children to the world of fantasy literature with a warm message at its heart."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (The Earthsea Cycle, Book 1)","review":"If you haven't read any Ursula Le Guin, you need to put her at the top of your list! She's way up there with Tolkien, and perhaps the only reason she's not as famous is because she came a bit later and, therefore, like everyone else, is in his shadow.Her writing is beautiful -- lyrical and powerful. I love how she makes all of her words count. They are all necessary, there's no fluff or redundancy -- it's simple, natural, alive, and vivid. Her understanding of different people and cultures (her father was an anthropologist and her mother was a psychologist) enhances her ability to create imaginative, creative, and believable characters and worlds. When you step into Earthsea, you feel like you're in a real world with real people. It's deep and engrossing right from the start. And did I mention that the writing is beautiful? This is what fantasy should be like. I wish there was more fantasy like this.This is the original boy-finds-out-he's-a-wizard-and-goes-to-wizard-school story and it's highly enjoyable for both adults and kids.

If you call this a work of classic fantasy meaning it's a great piece of work that set the foundation - like Lord of the Rings - for a lot of other series, you would be right.A Wizard of Earthsea is the first book in the Earthsea series and as all fantasy series should, it begins with a young wizard, Ged, who knows nothing of magic and the ways of being a wizard, other than his innate ability promising him a career as a great wizard. First he lives with a wise mage, and learns much about the simple things in life and magic and that everything has a cost. He soon discovers this when he performs a dark spell from a book he shouldn't have touched. A deadly shadow is summoned and then banished by his teacher, but Ged knows he will be facing it again.Ged then travels to the isle of Roke where he spends years becoming a master wizard. Upon his graduation, he faces the dark shadow once more but is unable to hold against it and flees in terror. As a renowned wizard now, he travels around the islands helping those less fortunate, battling dragons and other monsters. Then again he faces the shadow and barely survives, fleeing once more. He returns to his old master, unsure what to do. The wizened wizard tells him he must face the shadow and in turn face his greatest fear. And so Ged heads out into the deep sea where none have gone before and there faces the shadow and wages a great battle, finally defeating him. The book ends with Ged returning to land with his friend, now a true and accomplished wizard with the thousands of islands of Earthsea before him.What makes LeGuin's fantasy series more meaningful than most is that all the magic performed here comes at a cost, which the main character has to deal with throughout the book. It requires time and energy, afterwards one is tired; to create illusions is much easier than to actually change or create matter. Unlike the world of Harry Potter, here there are rules; not everyone can be a wizard. Along with this is the magical world of Earthsea with the many many islands of different peoples, a lot of which know little of each other. And for a wizard to travel from one island to another is a great adventure. The next book in the series is The Tombs of Atuan.For more book reviews, and other writings, go to www.alexctelander.com"},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (The Earthsea Cycle, Book 1)","review":"Review of Earthsea Trilogy [Written nov 2004]In it's original incarnation (in the 1960's & 70's), this was a trilogy (each book of which is probably short enough to qualify as a 'novella'). The authoress later added 2 more sequels, of which I have only read the first. For me, however, the core of this series is Books 1 & 3. Book 2 was a bit of a dreary and uneventful letdown for me.In any case, the original trilogy is a classic tale of epic fantasy, about how the teenage son of a bronze smith, in an island community of goat herders, discovers his latent talent for magic, has his first brush with dark powers, and then journeys to the fabled school of wizards on the Isle of Roke - where he eventually faces a terrible crisis, and has to rise to the challenge by taking up a great quest.Written in a terse, and fast-to-read style, LeGuin's classic tale also doubles as a parable (morality play) about the great responsibilities that come with power, and the heavy toll that deeds wrought by pride can exact ... and as such, it's a great yarn for both teens and adults alike.I really like this series, and I regularly re-read it every 4 or 5 years.As a final note - this series predates Rowling's \\"Harry Potter\\" series by at least 20 years, and it is only just now that CGI graphics have advanced to the point where classic epic fantasy books like JRRT's Lord of the Rings, and LeGuin's Earthsea novels can at last come to the big screen, to entertain and inspire a new generation of fans. A special made-for-TV mini-series will be coming out on the SciFi channel sometime this coming December."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (The Earthsea Cycle, Book 1)","review":"This book captivated me when I was in middle school, and led me to finish the (then) trilogy. It has become one of my favorite books of all time - despite a regular diet of faster-paced science fiction, etc when I was younger.One of the things that has impressed me more as I re-read it as an adult is that, while this is a story of Ged growing up (somewhat parallel to the Harry Potter series), Ged is not struggling so much with an external evil but with the different parts of himself that he must master. Altogether a valuable lesson for young readers.I also agree with another reviewer about the treatment of women in the early Earthsea books, but that is something the author has rectified in her more recent Earthsea additons (and has done so with the perceptiveness that must stem from her own life changes in the intervening 30 years).My only regret is that recent paperback editions either omit the maps and woodcut illustrations entirely, or reproduce them in a smudged form. My first copy (an Atheneum hardcover from 1968) was a beautiful book.Altogether, I cannot recommend it too highly."}]`),q={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:H},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:x,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(s=>setTimeout(s,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},M={class:"card-container"},C=["disabled"],B={key:0},E={key:1};function W(s,e,n,c,r,i){const m=g("PoemCard");return t(),o("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=a("div",{class:"top-banner"},[a("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[a("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),a("div",M,[(t(!0),o(y,null,p(i.visiblePoems,(h,f)=>(t(),w(m,{key:f,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),i.hasMorePoems?(t(),o("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>i.loadMore&&i.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(t(),o("span",E,"Loading...")):(t(),o("span",B,"See more"))],8,C)):b("",!0)])}const P=u(q,[["render",W],["__scopeId","data-v-0c8836e1"]]),j=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"guide/51.md","filePath":"guide/51.md"}'),F={name:"guide/51.md"},O=Object.assign(F,{setup(s){return(e,n)=>(t(),o("div",null,[v(P)]))}});export{j as __pageData,O as default};
