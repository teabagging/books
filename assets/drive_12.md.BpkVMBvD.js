That beloved volume has been around the world with me, and I still pull it off the shelf and read it at least once a year -- which makes at least 28 readings to date -- and it never grows stale. Pyle's use of archaic language somehow makes the tone more intimate, as if you are really there with him, wryly observing the comings and goings of a strangely innocent if somewhat brawl-happy breed of men. Tom Sawyer would have thrived in Pyle's Sherwood. Charming, lilting, engaging, he makes his characters come alive, and creates a tale adults and children will cherish together -- my young children and my agemate friends laugh aloud with me at yet another retelling of Little John's adventures as a barefoot friar. I drew tears from a college oral interpretation class with Robin's death scene. I fell in love with Robin and his men as a child, and was drawn from that to study history and linguistics. Find an annotated version, tuck up your skirts, and trudge along."},{"Title":"The merry adventures of Robin Hood of great renown, in Nottinghamshire","review":"I loved this book! After seeing the last Robin Hood movie with Russell Crowe I wanted to read the book. I thought Crowe's movie was great but this book is even better. Along with the Robin Hood I really liked the character of Little John. The language in this book is old and hard to follow but the kindle's dictionary helps a lot...it makes it a slow read, though. Read this book and you won't be disappointed!"},{"Title":"The merry adventures of Robin Hood of great renown, in Nottinghamshire","review":"I watched the newest movie of Robin Hood. Superb! This book is not like the movie. I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"The merry adventures of Robin Hood of great renown, in Nottinghamshire","review":"Robin HoodThis book was about Robin Hood's Life. Robin Hood became an outlaw when he killed a Forester. Even though he didn't mean to kill the Forester. So he started a band of outlaws. The outlaws would steal from the rich and give to the poor. The sheriff had always said that he would kill Robin Hood. Robin Hood and his band would be in disguise and trick the sheriff.Robin Hood is the main character he is very competitive. He is tall, blonde hair, and a blonde beard. He doesn't like to kill people, he is nice, friendly, and he can shoot an arrow really well.The first conflict is that the sheriff won't stop trying to kill him. The second conflict is that he is an outlaw. The third conflict is that he can't go anywhere without somebody wanting to kill him.The first conflict is solved because Robin Hood kills the sheriff. The second conflict is solved because he becomes a ranger. The third conflict is solved because he isn't an outlaw anymore.I would recommend this book to people that like fighting books. I wouldn't recommend this book to people who do not like fighting books."},{"Title":"The merry adventures of Robin Hood of great renown, in Nottinghamshire","review":"The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood was a pretty good book. I thought it was very intriguing book with a good bit of action. Howard Pyle shows alot of the great adventures of Robin Hood and his merry band. He inlcudes them all, strong and courageous Little John, brave Will Scarlet, musical Allan a Dale, and sly as a fox, good ol' Friar Tuck. Howard Pyle includes all of the great adventures like the time when Robin Hood ran into Little John at the river. They ended up having a fight to see who could knock the other into the river first. They had to fight on a log that was spread across the river. He also includes Robin Hood winning the golden arrow in Nottingham's archery contest. The time after time that Robin Hood and his men out-smarted the sheriff and his men and the time after time that Robin Hood and his men manipulated those rich people into giving them money and the times that they stole it.I would recommend this book to anyone who first off loves to read, or whoever loves to read about Robin Hood and his Merry Men and anyone who likes action and adventure."},{"Title":"The merry adventures of Robin Hood of great renown, in Nottinghamshire","review":"We have read, watched, and listened to several versions of Robin Hood, as both my sons (7 and 5) are big fans. We have been able to enjoy these stories as a family. The narration speed of this version, however, is so fast that my husband and I can't relax and enjoy it, and my younger son can't understand it. I understand that it's adventure and that the speed of the narrator should reflect this, but this is just too fast. I was quite surprised, as we've listened to a lot of books on tape and have never had this problem before. After listening to only a few minutes I feel as if I'm going to get a headache. The only reason I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 star is that my seven year old listens to it without complaint."},{"Title":"The merry adventures of Robin Hood of great renown, in Nottinghamshire","review":"Picture this, a beautiful crisp green forest and Robin Hood and his band of merry men relaxing under a tall oak tree in Sherwood Forest. This is the image you will get in the book The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood.The main character Robin Hood is an English outlaw that is wanted by the Sheriff of Nottingham. He steals from the good and gives to the needy. This book tells of the many action packed adventures and describes how he escapes the sheriff's clutches.One of the many things that makes me keep turning the page is the amazing action. For example, on page 24 when Robin is locked in an epic battle with his future first hand man. Another example is when Robin sends one of his men to spy on the Sheriff but gets caught and Robin has to make a very daring rescue. Another reason I love this book, is the authors vivid description of how Robin cleverly tricks the tinker out of his warrant. The author also gives a step by step description of all the fights that occur in this book.In addition, this book has extremely detailed illustrations. For instance, on page 24 you can tell that Robin and Little John are both tired and happy. Another example of these beautiful drawings is on page113. You can see that Little John is hurt and jealous.In conclusion, to this book review I want you to know that this book is for people of all ages and any reader will enjoy it! This review by, Max Powers"},{"Title":"Treasures in Heaven (Latino Voices)","review":"Ms. Alcala has created a compelling and informative novel. I was sucked in from page one. It will transport you straight into the tumultuous political climate of late 19th century Mexico under the oppressive rule of Dictator Porfirio Diaz. I think you will appreciate this book for its harsh beauty, its rich characters and its multi -layered story of loss and survival. A book that is this entertaining and at the same time educational is a rare find. I only hope that Ms. Alcala will write another book so that I can learn more about Beto and Estela and all of her other memorable characters. I recommend this book without reservation."},{"Title":"Treasures in Heaven (Latino Voices)","review":"You can't get any better than this: a great story about a woman asserting her independence during the early 1900s in Mexico City--a time of social and political revolutions. To those of you who have read Alcala's earlier works, this is truly a satisfying conclusion to the trilogy. To those who have not read the earlier works, you will only have your interest piqued. Alcala writes with authority about pre-revolutionary Mexico and the tales she spins are unforgettable accounts of strong women who persevere against personal and social challenges. This author's best achievement is the way she dispels the myth of the passive Mexican woman repeatedly in her compelling body of work."},{"Title":"How to Be Rich","review":"This is not a book about how to get rich. As its title implies, it is a book about how to be rich. Accordingly, much of Getty's advice is directed toward the development of a particular state of mind rather than detailing a formula for monetary acquisition. Although Getty earned the basis of his mega-fortune as a wildcatter in the oilfields of California, Texas and Oklahoma, he was a highly-educated man. Following graduation from college in California, he attended Oxford University, earning a graduate degree there. Only after his return from England did he plunge into the enterprise of oil exploration and drilling that paid off so handsomely. Thus, Getty's book is not the one-dimensional tract so commonly written today by lesser intellects. He discusses what it means to be rich -- the attitudes, the appreciation for the cultural heritage of classical music, literature and art (The Getty museum in California, based on his original collections, is one of the largest repositories of fine art in the world today). He discusses how an individual's outlook and attitudes constitute a virtual program for either success or failure. Then he provides the intellectual tools for changing self-limiting habits and developing productive and beneficial ones. He provides practical advice and an expert evaluation of the various forms of investment. In recent years, we have seen sports figures, entertainers and lawsuit winners squander their fortunes. On the other hand, we have seen immigrants like those who escaped Castro's Cuba with nothing but their lives -- their entire life's work stolen by the communist thugs -- only to earn a second fortune in the US. Why is this? Because, having been rich, they knew how to be rich -- they had programmed themselves to be rich. Getty's book goes a long way toward imparting that information to its readers. Once in possession of Getty's guidance, however, the hard work of implementing it still lies ahead, but his book is a literary roadmap to success without peer."},{"Title":"How to Be Rich","review":"Getty brilliantly and boldly shares the attitude, ethics, backbone and independent thinking that was the key to his prosperity. Don't look merely for 'how-to-make-more-money' tips: this book transcends that. If you're looking for honest, direct insight on how to 'be' successful in any business day or age, Getty is the man!"},{"Title":"How to Be Rich","review":"A lot of books tell you how to be rich, but they rarely work. This book is truthful and written by a man who in todays dollars would be richer than Bill Gates and Warren Buffett combined. This is the best book I have ever bought on finance. Getty doesn't cut corners on his advice. Best of all this book makes a lot of sense, and doesn't sugar coat the truth. This is something that cannot be said for many books."},{"Title":"How to Be Rich","review":"J. Paul Getty lays a clear map for guiding yourself to richness. Early on, Getty asserts that being \\"rich\\" is not a number, but truly a state of mind. In his view, there is no magic potion, mantra or affirmation that will garner you more goodies. If you want money, get out and work for it. If you want to be rich you must work for yourself. And once you hire people, even though you bear all responsibility for what happens, encourage your competent employees to think and act as if they are running their own company.Getty got rich because he understood the fundamentals of economics, thanks to his parents. Getty reasoned that the whole point of economic growth is to enhance your own life, as well as the lives of those around you.Wealth and wealth seeking is made to seem loathsome in some altruistic circles. Yet, within the pages of \\"How To Be Rich\\", you find a man who consistently laid his ego aside and sweated alongside oil-workers. As his standard of living rose, so did that standard of living of numerous other people around him.It may appear as if Getty encourages trickle-down economics. Getty worked fast and hard so as to turn any trickle into a gushing spring. If things didn't go his way, Getty maintained a \\"calm\\", and thus more productive demeanor, and found solutions. He admits to his screw-ups and delineates characteristics that promote success. In short, Getty delivers a worthwhile read for any aspiring person."},{"Title":"How to Be Rich","review":"Self-made billionaire Paul Getty was once credited with being the richest man in the world, and here he presents some of his philosophies on life. The book is not titled &quot;how to become rich&quot; since that isn't its focus, and contains Getty's advice about the sort of person you should be, if you are rich or to be rich. Intelligently written, it presents the gritty reality of Getty's accomplishments, and the good and bad sides of being successful in business. Although targeted mainly at the novice in business, it has wide appeal, and in separate chapters also covers Getty's opinions on investing in stocks, real estate, and fine art."},{"Title":"How to Be Rich","review":"This is a great book. Getty is the consumate businessman, but in this book he doesn't discuss the lessons of being rich, he discusses the refinement. The bottom line is that richness is how you act and what your goals are. Everyday is an opportunity to &quot;be rich&quot; take advantage of it."},{"Title":"How to Be Rich","review":"How To Be Rich surprised me in many ways. J. Paul Getty offers a lot of advice to executives rising through the ranks and those looking to. There's plenty of very entertaining historical coverage of Getty's rise to legendary status starting with the first chapter, How I Made My First Billion, along with other first-hand accounts and stories of his colleges from the era interspersed throughout the book. The book's focus is on how \\"to be\\" rich, i.e. the responsibilities thereof, rather than how \\"to become\\" rich. Of course, in Getty's case he simply took the skills he learned from working with his father, went out on his own to drill a few holes in the ground, and started pumping oil. There are also chapters regarding investing on Wall Street, in real estate, and in fine art, the later being a particularly interesting chapter. The chapter Art of Individuality is a must-read for anyone who is utterly depressed by the total lack of creativity in today's corporate cubicle conformist culture."},{"Title":"How to Be Rich","review":"History has not been kind to this man. Perhaps it is because he was interpreted as being a \\"penny pincher\\" or maybe because he was a friend and admirer of Adolf Hitler. Whatever the reason, even though he was at one time the world's richest man, his triumph seems to have faded into the books. This book is one of them.If I had to pick a favorite book written by a successful businessman, this has to be it. Does it tell you how to become a billionaire? No. What it does teach you is how to succeed, not only financially, but as a person.It explores the creation of his own wealth, as well as valuable lessons from the construction of his vast oil empire. Also, it covers the things that are greater than wealth, such as health, charity, and personality. Towards the end, it also becomes a sort of social commentary, on man's degradation of morality and kindess, on the disappearance of art and classical music from the mainstream, and on his general dissatisfaction with similar affairs at that time.It would be difficult to write a thorough review as to why you need to buy this book, because it is so unlike what you have read before. But take my word for it: you will be a better person for reading this book. It may not make you rich, but it will make you wealthy."},{"Title":"How to Be Rich","review":"Instead of buying a book from someone that got rich by writing and selling self-help books, why not reading this classical? Paul Getty got millionarie when he was 26 and in the end of the 1950's he got the title of the \\"richest man in America\\" and then \\"the richest man in the world\\". In this book he presents us many thoughs that are up-to-date even today, almost 40 years after this book was originally written. A must-have if you are a wealth-seeker."},{"Title":"How to Be Rich","review":"This is one of the best books on business and finance I've ever read. As stated before, the book does not tell you how to become rich. It tells you how to be. The impression one gets of Mr. Getty is a highhly intelligent, liberal thinker. He shatters the myth that is so often portrayed; that the rich are selfish, overly conservative people who care nothing for society around them. While this may be true of some, it is not true of all. Mr. Getty discusses a way of being, a philosophy that is both tough and humanistic. He shatters many other myths as well. He points out that becoming wealthy is not a result of knowing things others don't, or cheating innocents, but instead entails hard work, persistance, patience, common sense, and risk. This is a must read for anyone with aspirations of becoming successful in the business world. Well worth the paltry sum it costs."},{"Title":"How to Be Rich","review":"Great autobiography by J.

Ever. No \\"get rich quick\\" nonsense - just a collection of stories and advice on everything from dealing with failures (yes, they will happen), sensible investing, thinking strategically, and treating people properly. The chapter on management should be required reading in EVERY business. As busy a man as he was (yes, shockingly, hard work does play a part), thank God J.P. had both time and inclination enough to commit his thoughts to paper.

Truly enjoyed it. Would like more suggestions for similar books."},{"Title":"How to Be Rich","review":"This book by Getty is a quick read and easy to follow story of how to be successful in America. He uses matter of fact language to tell you how he did it all while teaching the reader. Getty uses his real life stories which make this book a quick and interesting read.

Excellent."},{"Title":"How to Be Rich","review":"This is an outstanding book that simply must be read by anyone wishing to start own or run a business. I found this much more inspirational than Napoleon Hill's books. I believe Getty speaks very frankly in this book and from the heart.

That is the only reason for my 4 stars."},{"Title":"How to Be Rich","review":"I Found a easy way to on how to become rich it worked form me I'm now making 7 figures rich visit [...]"},{"Title":"How to Be Rich","review":"This is definitely one of the best books written about business on the market! There are some great stories about Paul Getty's own experience and also many great examples of how a business should treat it's employees and customers. Anyone wanting to know more about the way to run a business should read this book. Mr. Getty was a brillant man who followed good business principles and he did a great job outlining them here. This will get you into his head and you will leave with a much greater understanding about the man and the way he lived his life. Everyone who reads this will enjoy it and learn a lot about what it takes to be great in business."},{"Title":"How to Be Rich","review":"Sure, it was written fifty years ago, but when the richest man in America shares some knowledge with you, you listen. Mr. Getty is mainly speaking to business people and entrepreneurs, instructing them how to be art collectors, investors and, most importantly to him, individuals. This is as much about the responsibilities he thinks wealthy people have to society as it is about gaining that wealth. And while he admits to being very much a Capitalist, he doesn't understand why many others like him have such disdain for labor. Certainly dated in some ways, it's still an interesting read."},{"Title":"How to Be Rich","review":"J.Paul Getty got to the point quickly and offers timeless insight into a value approached fostered by respect and curiousity for life. His investment and sound advice show a person deeply commited in their pursuit and reflective to a fault in the achievement of any gain. I saw a person who worked very hard and internalized every aspect to make the most possible, which ended up visibly manifest in his legacy and profound success as a business man. A worthwhile and satisfying read to see his inner workings finally applied on a grand scale."},{"Title":"How to Be Rich","review":"This is a must have for anyone building a success library. This book is strung together from several articles that Getty wrote for Playboy. Included are a review of his success in business and what is takes to be rich, his views on morals, and an indictment of what he saw as a deteriorating social structure of intolerance of any voice of dissent against the powers that be.I really enjoyed this book whether it was regarding success principles that are directly talking about business and wealth or the other indirect opinions he shares about the world. He was one-of-a-kind and his work here is really entertaining to read."},{"Title":"How to Be Rich","review":"This book goes beyond the matter of making money written by one of the richest people living at his time. Getty writes that 'richness' is at least as much a matter of character, of philosophy, outlook and attitude, as it is of money. And to be truly rich, regardless of fortune or lack of it, a man must live by his own values.While several chapters are average ... the chapter 'The Art of Individuality' if one of the finest chapters i've ever read. Artists of any profession, but in particular entrepreneurs, will profit from Getty's words on being a non-conformist, dissenter and rebel who is seldom if ever satisfied with the status quo."},{"Title":"How to Be Rich","review":"This book is a business classic. It is realistic, timeless and filled with common sense. This book should be required reading for anyone desiring a career in business."},{"Title":"How to Be Rich","review":"This is a spectacular book about creating the mindset for being wealthy.

Also, if you're an aspiring executive, you should acquaint yourself with Getty's &quot;millionaire mentality&quot; and espouse a &quot;cost-concious&quot; and &quot;profit-minded&quot; business perspective.I strongly recommend this book, especially for aspiring entrepeneurs and business executives. Although reading this book will certainly not make you a wealthy person(that requires hardwork and zealous determination), Getty's &quot;How to Be Rich&quot; will certainly en[rich] your knowledge."},{"Title":"How to Be Rich","review":"J. Paul Getty's honesty was fascinating in my view. He made a fortune (dollarwise) yet was married many times, seeing women as another kind of wine to be enjoyed yet admitting that perhaps he would have been happier in life with perhaps a modest income and only a single mate throughout his lifetime. He distinguishes between a true entrepreneur (like himself) vs others with almost the same God-given talent who do not achieve business goals as effectively as he does. J. Paul Getty was a very thoughtful man who I believe cared, in his own imperfect way, for society and for the people who worked for him. In my view, J. Paul Getty did give back to the community some of the financial rewards he received by serving the community well with a good solid business idea. Thank you J. Paul Getty for your unique insights into the world and the world of business."},{"Title":"How to Be Rich","review":"Mark F. LaMoure, Boise, IDPowerful: Author J. Paul Getty's, \\"How To Be Rich\\" is an exciting book about learning to have a rich mindset to get wealthy. The book is delightful, captivating and easy to read. Its an excellent book I enjoyed reading. Jean Paul Getty (1892-1976) was an oil industrialist. He founded the Getty Oil Company and in 1957 was named the richest living American and also the richest man in the world. At his death in 1976, he was worth more than $2 billion dollars. This ranked Getty next to today's richest Americans, based on inflation.An incredible philanthropist, Getty shares his attitude, principals and dynamic thinking that opened the door to his wealth. I found Getty's book to be one of the most fascinating books I've ever read on building wealth. Getty doesn't cut corners on his generous advice. Best of all, his book makes tremendous sense. Getty is totally open. He doesn't sugar coat his story.How To Be Rich, is a very inspiring book. It is timless, realistic and filled with American common sense of that era (1892-1976). Getty's millionaire mentality was heavily based on being cost-concious and profit-minded from a business perspective. He emphasized that becoming wealthy is a result of hard work, perseverance, endurance, common sense and smart risk. The book is excellently written and causes you to admire J. Paul Getty as a man. I give the book a 5 Gold Star rating.Having visited the J. Paul Getty museum in Malibu, CA and having visited countless museums in western Europe, I can say Getty's museum is by far the #1 most stunning and exceptional museum I've ever seen. The man was a precious gift to the world. And an incredible man. Read his book. You'll be enthralled and impressed. I loved it!"},{"Title":"How to Be Rich","review":"This book was exactly what I thought it was. It was informative and detailed on how Getty lived his life, thought of himself as a businessman and what qualities he thought others should have to succeed in business. Whether your an experienced student of business or just getting started this book is a must for your collection."},{"Title":"How to Be Rich","review":"This book was written quite some time ago and it's easy to see how doing business today has changed. However, putting that aside, the processes J. Paul Getty used can still be used very effectively today. He describes how he and his father started working together, and how his businesses and fortune took off from there. He talks about the importance of staying personally in touch with those who worked for him (he literally worked right next to them) and how it helped those who worked for him make the shift from feeling they were his \\"employees\\" to feeling they had part ownership in the company - giving it their best ideas and collaboration. He speaks of their sharing of thoughts with him, discussions that ensued and the great solutions that were chosen as part of his knowledgeable, \\"smart\\" team, which is quite different from the emails, texting and remote work forces (i.e. offshoring) that are used in business today. The book continues on as Getty's business processes change, but still remain the same. It's worth reading every word. Don't wait to get it."},{"Title":"How to Be Rich","review":"I've read a few books on J Paul Getty now and I'm not sure any of his insights are that valuable. I'm comparing this \\"classic\\" to some other classics like \\" Think and grow rich\\" and \\"Science of Getting Rich\\", there is no comparison. Napoleon Hill and Wallace Wattles are in a league of their own. I know Getty made the money but even compared to Andrew Carnegie (who obviously made his own money) there really isn't any advice that was close to the value of the above mentioned. In summary, he's an interesting man, not always the most \\"conventional\\" way of living, and somewhat a pioneer in his time. He kinda reminds me of Donald Trump. It's a fast read and it can't hurt absorbing some of his insights."},{"Title":"How to Be Rich","review":"J. Paul Getty clears up some of the myths associated with the rich. He underscores the importance of maintaining values and balance while still being driven by goals and a desire to be successful.The insights shared makes the abilty to change one's social stratum seem simple and very much possible while not making it seem unrealistically easy.A good book."},{"Title":"How to Be Rich","review":"this is one of the funniest books i've ever read, and its unreliable narrator, \\"j paul getty\\" is among the late unlamented 20th century's greatest fictional characters. without a trace of irony, getty informs the reader that he started off the humble son of a millionaire but managed to work his way up from those ignominious beginnings to really strike it rich.equal parts miserly calvinist minister and fustian carnival barker, \\"getty\\" pummels the reader with bombastic diatribes dripping with the smug self-satisfaction which will forever be remembered as the calling card of the archetypal american plutocrat. half winston niles rumfoord, half charles kinbote, \\"getty\\" will have the reader in stitches from beginning to end."},{"Title":"How to Be Rich","review":"I did not know at the time, but Jean Paul Getty was at one point the richest man in the world, and has written this book for upcoming executives. He emphasizes the point that what makes and does not make a good executive in business, that independent thinking is crucial to be successful at a business, and what is needed is a calm and rational plan to be a success, rather than the swaggering attitude praised often on Wall Street and others. His writing style is quite readable and enjoyable."},{"Title":"How to Be Rich","review":"this book was written a bit ago now 60s and while mostly written for male readers (just have to look over that part as a sign of the times) but it is extremely relavant and wonderfully helpful to get into the pulse of a very powerful man. my favorite parts were how he de-mystifies his lifestyle- saying it isn't always dreamy and what the drawbacks were to having so much wealth and also how he wished he had figured out how to succeed in marriage as he did with using and appreciating money. i appreciated his humility and his very straightforward style. I also loved the way that he really stresses the importance and the responsibility that wealth holds and how when you get more you are responsible for giving back more and helping more. I am so grateful for him as the trips to both Getty museums were so wonderful and I am so appreciative of all of his passionate extensions of giving back to the arts and the public at large."},{"Title":"How to Be Rich","review":"Good read for someone looking to improve their wealth without having to hit the lotto.

His thoughts, endeavours and experiences can be matched by few.This book is not about how to get rich, but shows how someone who made his fortune the old fashion way think, what he valued, what he was looking for.It was trully inspiring and entertaining. Many of his thoughts and observations I will keep in mind for many years to come.One of my best buys in Amazon."},{"Title":"East Coast Victorians: Castles & Cottages","review":"When I visit a strange town, there's nothing I like better than to wander up and down the streets, checking out the stores and the housing styles. If I happen on a district of Victorians, you can't pry me out with gunpowder--which is why San Francisco is one of my favorite cities. Owning this book is like being able to take a &quot;house walk&quot; any time you care to--even if it's 10 PM and blizzarding. Naversen's gorgeous full-color photographs, each arranged in a double-spread with some history about the house, take us from the Wedding Cake House (an 1826 Federal house in Kennebuk, ME, that was Victorianized in the mid-'50's) and Lyndhurst, a Gothic stonework castle begun in Tarrytown, NY, in 1838, to the Beaux-Arts Burrage Mansion, built in Boston's Back Bay 61 years later. Along the way he touches on all the major styles of Victorian domestic architecture, and presents houses large and small, well-known and obscure, masonry and frame, stark white and joyous Painted Lady. (His photos of the Lesley-Travers Mansion in New Castle, DE, and the Edward King House in Newport, RI, were taken around sunset and make the buildings appear to have dipped in blood, while the 1861 Moses Bulkeley House of Southport, CT, dozes amid lush greenery, the gorgeously and emphatically Pink House of Wellsville, NY, stands like a shout against an overcast sky and foliage just beginning to turn, and the Philadelphia house called Burholme is glorious in bisque against an unbelievably blue sky.) If you love to stare at the best examples of Victorian housing, this book and its companion are for you--but you may want to use a napkin to protect the pages!"},{"Title":"The right to heresy;: Castellio against Calvin","review":"Taking up his pen as a knight a lance, Sebastian Castellio was aware that a purely spiritual attack upon a dictatorship in the panoply of material armour would prove ineffectual, and that he was, therefore, fighting for a lost cause. How could an unarmed man, a solitary, expect to vanquish Calvin, who was backed by thousands of soul-slaves, and equipped with all the powers of the State? A master of the art of organization, Calvin had been able to transform a whole city, a whole State, whose numerous burghers had hitherto been freemen, into a rigidly obedient machine; had been able to extirpate independence, and to lay an embargo on freedom of thought in favour of his own exclusive doctrine.Calvin held sway over the printing presses, the pulpits and the professorial chairs; as wax in his hands were the various authorities, Town Council, university and law-courts, priests and schools, catchpoles and prisons, the written and the spoken and even the secretly whispered word.Sebastian Castellio, the lonely idealist, had in the name of freedom of thought renounced allegiance to Calvin's as to every other spiritual tyranny. He denied that those in the seats of the mighty were entitled to harm anyone because of private opinions. Castellio declared that no earthly power was entitled to exercise authority over a man's conscience. Here was a man who, during one of those periods of collective insanity with which the world is from time to time afflicted, dared to keep his mind immune from popular hallucinations.So perennial is the cowardice of our race that Castellio and his like who defy those in high places need look for few if any supporters. Thus it came to pass that in the decisive hour Sebastian Castellio found no backers.For the very reason that Sebastian Castellio knew from the first that his campaign would be unavailing, and precisely because, knowing this, he unhesitatingly followed the call of conscience, his sacred stubbornness stamps for all time as a hero this \\"unknown soldier\\" in mankind's great war of liberation.Castellio and Calvin were the symbolical expressions of an invisible but irreconcilable conflict. It matters not whether we term the poles of this enduring conflict toleration versus intolerance, freedom versus tutelage, humaneness versus fanaticism, individuality against mechanical uniformity, conscience against violence. In the last analysis these names signify an inward and personal decision as to which counts more for us: mankind or politics, the ethos or the logos, personality or community.Sebastian Castellio, who had at his command no other power than that of moral rectitude, had to pay the full price for his heroism, a price which emptied his energies to the dregs. Castellio's steps were dogged; daily and hourly threatened by fanatics; eavesdroppers listened to his every word; his letters were intercepted; suspicion and base invectives were disseminated.Can we wonder that such a hundred-handed organization could easily get the better of the lonely humanist.We must never cease to remind a world which has eyes only for monuments to conquerors that the true heroes of our race are not those who reach their transitory realms across hecatombs of corpses, but those who, lacking power to resist, succumb to superior force--as Castellio was overpowered by Calvin in his struggle for the freedom of the spirit and for the ultimate establishment of the kingdom of humaneness upon earth."},{"Title":"The right to heresy;: Castellio against Calvin","review":"\\"The first thought of anyone of dictatorial temperament isto suppress or to gag opinions differing from his own.\\"from: The Right to Heresy, How John Calvin Killed a ConscienceI read this book, being amazed & horrified at the same time.This book tells the sad tale about a man who in his zeal to create the \\"kingdom of God\\" on earth, ended up roasting his own brethren-in God's name of course.John Calvin had escaped the Inquisition himself & knew of the atrocities of a religious system gone crazy with power.Yet over time, he resorted to the same tactics as those of the inquisitors.\\"With one leap Calvin outdistanced the Catholic Inquisition...\\"So how & why did he end up being the accuser, persecutor & murderer of the brethren?This book written by Stefan Zweig helps to explain that.Hurling condemnations & commandments from his pulpit, there lacked much love in words & actions. While a terrible pestilence ravaged the city, Calvin& his fellow ministers did not attend to the sick.It seemed he was gifted at hard preaching...talking the talk,but folks began doubting his, walking the walk.His reign of terror culminated with the murder of Miguel Servetus.Why was this man roasted as a human BBQ?...was he a thief, was he a murderer, was he a rapist??What crime could have been so heinous as to be burned alive?The crime: disagreeing theologically & having different ideasthan Master Jehan Calvin. Think: thought crime.\\"Most savagely of all were punished any offenders whose behaviour challengedCalvin's political and spiritual infallibility....\\"During this time of great despotism, Sebastian Castellio was a man who remained true to his own conscience, not allowing Calvin to enslave him with fear. Castellio paid a heavy price for not capitulating to Master Calvin.There are few people in this world, who are courageous enough to speak out against tyrannical abusers. Castellio was a man who did speak out.Many times the champions of history are the people all but remembered by a few.These are the non-conformists, who will not follow in lock step the soul slaves of a dictator. The Castellios of the world are the true heroes of history.In times like these where megalomaniac preachers seem to reign among us,this book should be mandatory reading.Here are some compelling quotes from the book: (spoilers alert!)... Calvin would grasp the reins, would ruthlessly realize his totalitarian ambitions, and thus transform a democratic republic into a theocratic dictatorship......But Calvin was not a man to be satisfied by lukewarm acceptance. He insisted upon unreserved obedience down to the last punctuation mark. It was not enough for him that the doctrine should be formulated, since that might still leave the individual a certain amount of liberty to decide whether and to what extent he would comply. Calvin was not one who would ever tolerate freedom in respect of doctrine or of daily life. There was not to be a jot of give-and-take in religious and spiritual matters; there must be no truce with individual convictions; the Church, as he regarded it, had not merely the right but the duty to impose unquestioning obedience upon all men, to impose it by force, and to punish laodiceanism as savagely as it punished open resistance. .......Dictatorship is unthinkable and untenable without force. Whoever wants to maintain power must have the instruments of power in his hands; he who wants to rule must also have the right of inflicting punishment......These fearsome powers enabled Calvin to annihilate any who ventured to resist. With one bold stroke he took both thunder and lightning into his hands, acquiring unchallengeable supremacy such as the bishop of Geneva had never wielded. For within the Catholic Church there was an endless hierarchy of authorities proceeding from lower to higher and the highest place. Many appeals could be made before the Church definitively decided to expel one of its adherents. Excommunication was a supra-personal act, completely beyond the arbitrary power of an individual. ...He (Calvin) made the terrible threat of excommunication a regular punishment, thus intensifying beyond bounds his personal power.......Thanks to his famous \\"discipline,\\" Calvin's Geneva became what Calvin wanted:joyless, shy, and timid, with no capacity for resisting Master Calvin's will.All dictatorships begin with the attempt to realize an ideal, but an ideal takes form and colour from the persons who endeavour to realize it... and one need merely glance at his countenance to foresee that this doctrine would be harsher, more morose and oppressive, than any previous exegesis of Christianity.... the ascetic is always the most dangerous kind of despot....Discipline and unsympathetic severity are the fundamentals of Calvinist doctrine....He (Calvin) never understood the meaning of a middle course. For him there existed but one course--his own. .... Never would he compromise, being so absolutely convinced of the rightness of Jehan Calvin's standpoint that he simply could not conceive an opponent might believe in the rightness of another cause, ... Yet again and again this man, who suffered from a sort of demoniacal possession by his own self, grew embittered and was genuinely outraged when another person with equal confidence maintained a contrary opinion. Dissent brought on in Calvin a nervous paroxysm. His mental sensibility affected the workings of his body. When he was crossed, his stomach revolted and he vomited bile. The antagonist might offer the most reasonable objections. That mattered nothing to Calvin, who was concerned only with the fact that another ventured to hold different views, and must consequently be regarded as an enemy, not only of Jehan Calvin, but of the world at large, and of God himself.PERSONS who are ruthless in the attempt to suppress the opinions of others are extremely sensitive to contradiction. Thus Calvin regarded it as monstrously unjust when the world at large ventured to discuss Servetus's execution,... With perfect seriousness the man who had just roasted a fellow-man to death, on account of a difference of opinion, demanded sympathy, not for the victim, but for himself....Castellio wrote? \\".... Cruelties and persecutions are the outcome of arrogance, so that a man will not tolerate others' differing in any way from his own views...\\"Castellio knows that persons in authority always endeavour to justify their deeds of violence by appealing to some religious or philosophical ideal... Miguel Servetus had not been burned at Christ's command, but at the command of Jehan Calvin, and this was a disgrace to the whole of Christendom.\\""},{"Title":"The right to heresy;: Castellio against Calvin","review":"Stefan Zweig paints a deep black, but well deserved, portrait of the founder of the theocratic dictatorship in Geneva.For him, Calvin is a tyrant, jealous, monomaniac, intolerant, sectarian, only searching absolute power, the biggest enemy of intelligence, a negativist repressing all sensuality (all pleasure is sin) and a killer in the name of God!Whoever dared to put his doctrine in doubt was putting his life in danger. Voltaire called the sadistic execution of his adversary Michel Servet as a religious murder.Being responsible for the murder of a man, Calvin killed all liberty within the reformist movement.Calvin was also fundamentally a hypocrite and a coward: during the pest, he refused as a priest to serve the inmates of hospitals. He repudiated all his publications wherein he criticized all measures taken by his adversaries when he was not in power, but which he adopted when he took the reins himself.Calvin created in Geneva the first totalitarian State in the name of a utopian idea and with the Bible as the only guide for human conduct; a true \`Bibliocracy' with the Bible interpretation in the hands of a small Consistory. In reality, Calvin's City of God was a regime of denunciations, interdictions and spies.After the murder of Michel Servet, only one man dared to criticize Calvin's creed in the name of liberty of thought, expression and conscience (for Calvinists, liberty of conscience was a diabolic doctrine) : the poor professor of Basle, Castellio.Calvin, fearing all independent thinkers, pursued him everywhere, morally by prohibiting the publication of his works, and physically by suing him in order to put him at the stake.Stefan Zweig paints the deadly battle between Castellio (symbol of liberty, tolerance, humanity and individuality) and Calvin (symbol of authority, intolerance, fanaticism and repression of individuality) with the voice of a public accuser, being deeply indignant of the inhumanity of the regime and his inquisitor. He clearly shows that dictatorship generates violence and that religious and political ideologies degenerate into tyrannies. For him, intolerance is war and tolerance peace.Stefan Zweig wrote a formidable text on eminently important and actual themes.The 20th century has seen many Calvins and Genevas and the 21st begins not under better augurs.We need Castellios today."},{"Title":"The right to heresy;: Castellio against Calvin","review":"I have read this book with an open mind to give a fair assessment of all those involved.As history repeats itself in preceding generations I sometimes find it difficult to have an unbiased take on information such as presented here about John Calvin.In other words, I would like nothing more than to see Calvin vilified, for I myself have always had an opposition to some of his teachings.That said, I believe I have successfully made my way through this book in a nonjudgmental mind set and one of impartial evaluation of men and their actions.Mankind has from the beginning tried and fought to gain the upper hand in some form or another, and this is just one more in the line of dictator type personalities trying the same.What strikes me the most from this book is the idea or question - What would the millions of Calvin adherents do if they knew today?Sadly, I believe most would do like Calvin himself did to his dying breath, in excuses and justifications for his actions, which there are none.Not to be smug or self-righteous, but I have to say I would pack my religious church membership bags as soon as possible and free as many minds as I could in the process All the while praying God would \\"predestine their Exodus\\" pun intended.This book is earth shattering, revolution starting, mind freeing, a must read material for the truth seeking mind.

A great story that children of all ages will love - even this 39 year old kid. Bravo!"},{"Title":"McDuff Goes to School (McDuff Stories)","review":"The five stars are for the book, not the illustrations in this current edition. I love all the McDuff books. I used to have a Westie and so they really captured my attention. I started buying them before my granddaughter was born and started reading them to her very early in her life. She absolutely loves them and asks me to read them to her over and over again. However, I am disappointed in the illustrations in the latest editions of the books (like this one). They are not the same as in the earlier editions yet the illustrator is the same. Why is that? The earlier editions had wonderful illustrations that looked exactly like the Westies, but the newer editions are different. They look very cartoonish. Please bring back the \\"old look\\" and please ask Rosemary Wells to write more books to be illustrated as they used to be. Thanks."},{"Title":"McDuff Goes to School (McDuff Stories)","review":"For some reason I am having problems finding a list that puts the McDuff books in order. I know that \\"McDuff Moves In\\" was the first book in the series, written by Rosemary Wells and illustrated by Susan Jeffers. I thougth that \\"McDuff Goes to School\\" might be the second book in the series because once Fred and Lucy (not Ricky and Ethel) let this cute little white-haired dog into their lives I figured that sending him to obedience school was the logical next step. But \\"McDuff Goes to School\\" was published in 2001 and that puts it after \\"McDuff Comes Home,\\" \\"McDuff and the Baby,\\" and \\"McDuff's New Friend.\\" That involved a bit of on-line research, but the fact that there was a baby in the house was a big clue that this adventure took place after \\"McDuff and the Baby\\" at least. Where \\"McDuff Saves teh Day\\" and \\"McDuff's Wild Romp\\" fit into the chronology is not yet clear to me, but I will work on it.\\"McDuff Goes to School\\" tells what happens when a new family, the De Gaulles, moves from Barkedelphia into the house next door to McDuff at number nine Elm Road. McDuff discovers a new dog, a black Scottish Terrier named Marie-Antoinette has moved in as well, and Lucy and Fred learn that Celeste and Pierre de Gaulle speak French. So when Lucy says, \\"Hello,\\" Celeste responds with \\"Bonjour.\\" Inside the De Gaulle's new home when Marie sits on the sofa Celeste orders her to jump down, lay down, and stay, but she does it all in French. When Lucy and Fred discover that McDuff does not obey command (in English; they do not try French), they decide he has to go to obedience school. Celeste and Marie decide to go to the school too.What is interesting is that because Lucy is too busy with the baby and Fred is too tired from working all day, that neither of them has time to practice with McDuff. So it is Celeste who practices every day with Marie, learning how to heel, sit, stay, and come. On the other side of the fence McDuff is watching the lessons and when he starts obeying the commands, given in French, he gets a liver truffle, just like Marie. Meanwhile, Lucy and Fred are aware that McDuff is not doing well in school and when graduation day comes he does not obey their commands.I really like this illustrated children's story for two reasons. The first is that young readers will see where the story is going and anticipate the ending, which is a good thing because they will be happy they were smart enough to figure it out. The second is that Celeste speaks French throughout the book and although there is a Glossary in the back that explains that \\"assieds-toi\\" means \\"sit\\" and \\"viens\\" means \\"come,\\" there are no direct translations in the main story. However, the meaning of each phrase is clear from what is being said so that kids can make the connections. Beyond that, you have the benefit that if young readers, ages 2-5, can learn the French commands to give a dog to heel, jump and lie down, then they might be interested in learning other foreign words and phrases, whether they are French or something else. The earlier you get kids interested in speaking a foreign language the easier it is for them to pick it up. It is too late for me to do so, but hopefully you can get this book to your beginning reader when it can help them on that particular path."},{"Title":"McDuff Goes to School (McDuff Stories)","review":"Two new elements have been added to the wonderful McDuff books: Marie Antoinette who is a charming French Scottie and the use of French phrases for obedience training.

The first story, &quot;Love Song&quot;, is about a girl who knows only physical violence as a way of expressing her love. The second story, &quot;Jewels of the Seaside&quot;, is about three sisters who fall for the same guy. The third story, &quot;The Signal Goes Blink Blink&quot;, is about a young man who is often ostracized and bullied by his peers. Later, it is discovered that he possesses wondrous healing powers. The last story, &quot;&quot;The Skin of Her Heart&quot;, is about a girl who seems to be trapped in the perpetual routine which is her life.I don't regret buying this book. I found it to be refreshingly different and relaxing, the kind of reading I'd want to do while lounging on a lazy afternoon. Love Song doesn't have swords or sorcery, it's basically good story-telling coupled with lovely and uncluttered art. These stories make you think and feel, with characters who are as real as the next person. The treatment is quite mature, but not in the sense that it'd contain sexual or other explicit stuff. Rather, the maturity pertains to the emotional level these stories convey. There's also a nice sprinkling of light moments and comical situations. It's truly a unique manga experience, which can be likened to reading a novel. I wouldn't recommend it for those who are looking for action and excitement though... this just isn't that kind of manga."},{"Title":"Love Song: 4 Tales","review":"I'll come clean. I'm the translator of this volume, so I couldn't give it a lower rating. (On the other hand, there are manga I've translated which I *wouldn't* give good reviews, but in such a case I'd review anonymously. ^_^ ) While translating for Viz (I only stopped because I became too busy with teaching and had trouble meeting deadlines), I was fortunate to be able introduce several &quot;shoujo manga&quot; (Japanese girls' and women's comics) to the English-speaking world. The first compilation of these, &quot;Four Shojo Stories&quot; is unfortunately out of print (though you may be able to find it on BookFinder.com). Hagio Moto's &quot;A-A'&quot; is a wonderful series of interconnected short stories by the great Hagio Moto, but, being science fiction, it's almost too easy to import. What I had always wanted to do was to translate &quot;real&quot; shoujo manga, which is to say stories of human relationships that don't rely on the trappings of science fiction or fantasy in order to be accepted by English-reading audiences. The title story of this volume is just such a story, and then some. &quot;Love Story&quot; is the crystallization of the white-hot intensity of Nishi's early work. Ths story illustrates, with frightening (yet compelling) realism, the old song lyric: &quot;You always hurt the one you love.&quot; &quot;Jewels of the Seaside&quot; and &quot;The Signal Goes Blink Blink&quot; are tongue-in-cheek fun (and you'll be glad of that, after &quot;Love Song&quot;), but the finale, &quot;The Skin of Her Heart,&quot; is a quiet, moving vignette that is only incidentally science fiction (in a Bradbury-Tiptree-LeGuin vein).

This is the first book I had picked up.My problem with Dr. Cave's book is that its not honest -- its almost silently pro-vaccination. She openly credits vaccines for reduction in diseases while its obvious that that claim is questionable. Also, her 'recommended' list of vaccines is ALMOST every one of them -- except Hep B and Chicken pox. These are the 2 easiest ones to eliminate even by a lay man. you dont need an 'expert' doctor to tell you that. Every thing else she recommends all in a slightly delayed manner (by a few months).If Dr. Cave really want to tell you what your doctor is not, then there should be more statistics on the incidence of these diseases and the real risks of contracting them. For example : Diptheria , every one knows there have been no cases of it for 50 years in the entire western hemisphere and no cases of wild polio for over 2 decades now. That is information that should be included for each disease before recommending the vaccination finally.Also, she has no chapters on immune system function or the real harmful devastating effects vaccines are having on some children.My personal opinion is Dr. Tenpennys books/dvds and Dr. Neustaedters book are far more convincing and useful."},{"Title":"What Your Doctor May Not Tell You About(TM) Children's Vaccinations","review":"I read \\"What Your Doctor May Not Tell...\\" in a flurry of anxiety in the weeks leading up to the first scheduled vaccination.The book is meticulously researched and well organized. Each vaccine has its own chapter that details the disease and the history of the particular vaccine. In addition, each chapter has a summary of existing research on the safety and efficacy of the vaccine. There are also moving vignettes that describe childrens' adverse reactions to vaccines and speculation on the connection of chronic syndromes such as autism to a particular vaccine. Finally, the author provides her opinions and insights regarding the usefulness and safety of each vaccine.What makes this book somewhat problematic is that real dangers (older versions of vaccines and rare adverse reactions to vaccines) are mixed in with speculative dangers. The author connects the upsetting stories of autism-revealed with speculation on the dangers of vaccines. The combination is powerful and scary -- but not actually informative. In the end, I felt manipulated both by the book and by our pediatrician's description of the symptoms of whooping cough.Its hard to make decisions about your child's well being.

The study will also evaluate whether exposure to thimerosal in infancy is related to development of the subclass of autism predominantly associated with regression. As part of the study, researchers will use automated data and registries to identify children with autism (cases) and without autism (controls). In-person examinations, telephone interviews, medical chart reviews, and immunization tracking systems will be used to collect information on vaccine history and other covariates. Recommended by the Institute of Medicine, this VSD study will be the first rigorous, epidemiological study conducted on the issue of thimerosal and autism. Data from this VSD study should provide the best available scientific information on whether a causal association between exposure to thimerosal and the development of autism is possible.This study is in the data collection phase.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Again, I'm no expert but this doesn't look like the summation of a settled matter to me."},{"Title":"What Your Doctor May Not Tell You About(TM) Children's Vaccinations","review":"I bought this and Dr. Sears new book, The Vaccine Book, at the same time. Both books contain similar information, but Dr. Sears is a little more up to date, especially on the thimerisol issue (which is no longer an issue). Both offer similar modified vaccination schedules. Both examine each vaccine, why it is given, disease history, and pros and cons of vaccination. I honestly didn't read this book as in depth since I had read The Vaccine book first. If you are looking for an all out \\"don't vaccinate\\" book, this is not it. But, if you are looking for a book that examines why, with what and alternatives, this book will examine those (although it is not without bias)"},{"Title":"What Your Doctor May Not Tell You About(TM) Children's Vaccinations","review":"This book contains a lot of important information. I was able to justify my fears of vaccinations with my children's doctor and sound like I know what I'm talking about. I really like the alternative vaccination schedule the doctor provides in this book - it is much safer than the schedule that most doctors use. I think all parents should read this book before vaccinating their children."},{"Title":"What Your Doctor May Not Tell You About(TM) Children's Vaccinations","review":"I have the book \\"What your Doctor may not tell you about Children's Vaccinations\\" and it is a wonderful unbiased resource... it gives all the information about pros and cons of each vaccine in detail as well as history of the effectiveness of the vaccination and ingredients, and leaves it to the parent to make an informed decision. I definately recommend it to any parent to just even know about each vaccine they give their children overall... the papers they hand out at the doctors office aren't very informative in general, especially since they have to be written at an average of a second grade reading level. Whether you choose to vaccinate on the goverments schedule, delayed, selectively vax, or opt out all together, it is important to be informed and well versed on your reasoning."},{"Title":"What Your Doctor May Not Tell You About(TM) Children's Vaccinations","review":"Excellent book, easy to read yet packed full of crucial information. The fact that it is written by a doctor increases it's validity.I've read several books on the subject and this is the most comprehensive and complete."},{"Title":"What Your Doctor May Not Tell You About(TM) Children's Vaccinations","review":"I plowed through this book quickly, and found it provided an unantagonistic and straight forward approach to these very controversial topics.There's alot of middle ground between the books Public Health leant me and the information I read on the internet. This book was fantastic at helping me draw my conclusions about if and when to give my son vaccinations.The authors also explain the terms they use and I never felt like I was going to fall asleep, nor did I get frustrated, as information about this topic is usually so difficult and technical.My congratulations go out to these authors and deep thanks to them too."},{"Title":"What Your Doctor May Not Tell You About(TM) Children's Vaccinations","review":"I bought \\"What Your Doctor May Not Tell You About Children's Vaccinations\\" and Dr. Sear's \\"Vaccine Book\\" from Amazon. I was a mom who didn't want to skip vaccinations all together but was very concerned about giving my baby too many chemicals and who knows what else. I had a lot of questions and picked these two books because I thought they'd be the best.I tried to read \\"What Your Doctor May Not Tell You\\" but didn't get too far. It had a hysterical, \\"beware!!\\" tone to it, and I felt like I couldn't necessarily trust the author's perspective. It was very quickly apparent that the book is anti-vaccine. It is the perfect book to convince someone on the fence to skip vaccinations (and scare them to death in the process) and the perfect book to reaffirm the beliefs of someone who already thinks all vaccinations are the greater risk. There are little stories throughout the book of babies and children whose poor, hapless parents thought they were doing the right thing getting their kids vaccinated when actually, the vaccinations caused horrible, frightening things to happen. I put this book away because I didn't want to be scared to death of all the horrible things that could happen (but probably wouldn't); I wanted balanced information that would help me make a good decision.Fortunately, I also had \\"The Vaccine Book.\\" Dr. Sear's \\"Vaccine Book\\" presented the information in an easy-to-read, balanced way that answered my big questions: \\"Which vaccines does my baby really need, and how should I go about this?\\" He told me just how great the risks were, what chemicals were in each vaccine, helped me weigh the cost/benefit of each vaccine, and answered all my big questions. I went into my pediatrician's office prepared, knowing what I wanted. Pediatricians don't have time to answer all your questions if you have a lot of concerns, like I did, and this book is perfect for that. I ended up following Dr. Sear's Alternative Vaccination Schedule where you split up the vaccinations and only do the ones really necessary. For parents who don't want to vaccinate at all, he also includes a schedule that will vaccinate babies and kids for only the most dire diseases. This is the \\"if you avoid all else, at least do these vaccines\\" schedule. And, of course, there is the recommended schedule included, the one with every vaccine and the time frame recommended by the government. Dr. Sears is cautious but optimistic, informative without using scare tactics. I'm so grateful I have this book.So, I definitely recommend \\"The Vaccine Book.\\" It is good for basically all types of parents who care about their kids: the full-steam-ahead, full vaccination parents; the on-the-fence, concerned parents; and the no-thank-you, no-way parents. It provides great information. \\"The Vaccine Book\\" is the only book you'll need to make decisions about how to proceed with vaccinations. Also, Dr. Sears has a great blog he keeps updated about vaccines.Reading this book made me feel confident in Dr. Sears' authority; he felt like a knowledgeable, caring dr. I could trust. I hope this review helps."},{"Title":"What Your Doctor May Not Tell You About(TM) Children's Vaccinations","review":"GREAT BOOK !!This is an outstanding effort that every parent should read.The book is well laid out that offers a lot of information.I am now reading these types of books because of my grandson...He has autism....enough said.I finished another book the other day....It's titled: Mercury: The Winged Messenger...WOW ! Unlike Dr. Cave's book, this book is written by a concerned father who nails this problem right between the eyes. It literally blew me away regarding these vaccines and the political cover ups that surround this wholemess.Both books are a must read for every parent or would be parentand should be required reading for members of our Governmental health care system.I congratulate Dr. Cave on her great work !!5 STARS !!!!!"},{"Title":"What Your Doctor May Not Tell You About(TM) Children's Vaccinations","review":"Dr. Stephanie Cave's book, What Your Doctor May Not Tell You About Children's Vaccinations (Warner Books, 2001), is an attempt to inform non-medically trained people about her suspicions concerning the potential dangers of vaccinations. However, her attempts more often fall short of their intended goal. No doubt, this book will leave questioning parents anxious and worried about the effects of vaccinations. But is this anxiety valid? In order to answer this question, one needs to examine (first) Cave's interpretation of supporting evidence, (second) her logical reasoning and defense, and (third) her methodology for conclusions.Since the writing of this book eight years ago, there have been no less than eight epidemiological studies (one as recently as 2008) that conclusively--as conclusively as the scientific method allows--show no correlation whatsoever between autism and either vaccines or the preservatives used in them. Furthermore, since 2001, thimerosal has been nearly completely removed from childhood vaccines (by a 96%+ reduction). And case studies like the MMR study in Japan--after the cancelation of the MMR vaccine--have successfully and thoroughly disproved any relationship between MMR and autism.What's more, Andrew Wakefield--oft quoted by Case in her book (e.g. p 65)--has been debunked in his research methodology. Some argue that Wakefield has been blackballed by vaccine manufacturers, but the fact remains that Wakefield did not follow the procedures of valid scientific research, despite his claims otherwise. Wakefield claims to hold to traditional scientific methodological research, but then cheated to get the results he sought. Wakefield's findings were based on 12 children--a laughable number considering the vast number of quantitative and qualitative based research case studies, to the contrary.Secondly, there is the issue of Cave's logic and reasoning. Far from subscribing to either a purely deductive or inductive presentation, Cave employs numerous questionable argumentations. She regularly argues the converse fallacy of accident--drawing broad conclusions from the limited number of patients she herself has treated. Ironically, even among those that she had treated (some 600 by her account), there are some who don't respond to the treatment. Her conclusion: they must have been too old. (Ironically, when you create your own system for success or failure, it's easy to explain away exceptions.)Cave also draws several irrelevant conclusions by begging the question. Consider her conclusions in the section \\"Mass Immunizations = More Illnesses\\" where she writes, \\"Are these increases [in a variety of illnesses] just a coincidence or are they partly a result of better diagnostic testing? Or could it be, as many experts and parents believe, that these chronic health problems are the result, at least in part, of continued assaults on the immune system of infants and young children with injections of viruses, bacteria, and various toxic substances?\\" (24; cf 46-47 for another example). These questions are fine to ask, but the mere asking of them is not an answer. In fact, Cave doesn't answer these questions at all--but simply assumes the conclusion that vaccines cause illnesses.Also consider the broad use of abstract terms: \\"many parents\\" or \\"many experts.\\" These no more prove or disprove a particular conclusion (Cave's conclusion being that immunizations cause autism) any more than one saying that \\"many children\\" believe in Santa Claus proves his existence. For that matter, to what experts does Cave refer? And as for parents (I have four young children), when did becoming a parent make one an expert in medicine, or any other discipline for that matter?Cave has no problem making arguments from \\"silent evidence\\" (borrowing a term from Nassim Taleb). Perhaps the most glaring case is her statement that, \\"Not only are there tens of thousands of vaccines adverse events reported--but tens of thousands more not reported\\" (22). If these supposed cases are not reported, how does she know? Answer: she doesn't! This is unfounded reasoning based presumably on statistics and (though Cave doesn't defend her suppositions) a classic Gaussian bell curve.When Cave isn't arguing from fear (argumentum ad baculum) or popular sentiment (argumentum ad populum), and trying to win over unwitting readers through pity (argumentum ad Misericordiam), she draws heavily on the fallacy of false cause. Because she \\"believes\\" that immunizations are bad for children, she doesn't bother to show the relevance of various juxtaposed segments of text. For example, on page 61, she fires off statistics on the increase of autism in various US states in the mid- to late-1990s. In the very next paragraph, she rattles off the number of immunizations that children during that time period were receiving. But she does nothing to show a relationship between the two segments of information--unless the reader accepts the faulty reasoning. This reasoning follows that if someone shows that children had an average of 10 soft drinks per month in the 1990s and then list the increase in autism rates in the same period, then this is conclusive proof that soft drinks cause autism! As such, readers should not accept for a moment the unjustified accounting of data as evidence supporting a particular conclusion when any conclusion can be drawn.Sadly, Cave has little or nothing positive to say about immunizations. She concedes they might, occasionally save lives (like her passing reference to potential dangers of these diseases on page 19; cf, 17). Rather, she casts doubts on medically trained, practicing and published, research specialists (like Paul Offit; pg 36) for presumed \\"conflicts of interest\\" while exalting non-medically trained, politicians who are angry to find one of their grandchildren has autism (aka. Dan Burton who chaired the House Government Reform Committee during the great \\"witch-hunt\\" for the vaccines-cause-autism debates, pg. 31). Apparently in Cave's eyes, having a grandson with autism--as Burton does--doesn't render him biased and with \\"conflicts of interest\\" but holding a patent or working for a particular company does. Again, Cave exalts suspicion where it supports her claims, and dismisses findings (as biased) when they contradict her commitments. This is paramount to philosophic alchemy.Fact: measles has killed hundreds of millions of people throughout history, including nearly 200 million people worldwide in the past 150 years (that's more than half the current population of the US). In 1875, nearly 40,000 Fijians died during one outbreak--nearly a third of the population. Rubella outbreaks plagued the US as recently as 1965, leading to over 11,000 miscarriages and more than 20,000 cases of congenital rubella syndrome. These deaths aren't just numbers. They were real people with real children (born and unborn) who really died or were blinded or otherwise disabled.Consider this reality for a moment, and pit against it the supposition of unfounded claims that Cave makes in her book. When she isn't criticizing the immunization process, Cave is making claims that begin with, \\"I believe... (pgs. 7, 31, 32, 72 , and 80 to name a few). This isn't proof--this is theorization. The fact is--if Cave had factual evidence, she is compelled to present it. But sadly, her evidence is more the raising of suspicion than the demonstration of proofs.Even her wording occasionally reveals the depth of her committing to prove something that science doesn't support. On page 34, Cave writes, \\"In November 1999 the vaccine was pulled from the market because it was linked with ninety-nine reports of a rare bowel obstruction called intussusceptions and at least one death in infants.\\" Does this mean only one person died, and that person was an infant; or does this mean that many people died but only one was an infant? Cave is attempting to provoke the casual reader who is likely to miss the impact of the clunky reference, and render the finding as \\"...death in infants\\" (plural).Cave wants to put parents on the jury (80) to make decisions regarding the cellular impact of vaccines, and risks in not giving them to children; while admitting that scientifically trained researchers don't fully understand the process of such things (23). She is critical of the governments \\"one size fits all\\" approach to vaccines (20-21), but doesn't offer an alternative short of just seeing who gets a disease. She lumps half a dozen diseases in with autism to make a case against vaccines, such as childhood diabetes--which in the vast majority of cases has been proven to be linked to childhood obesity (and the poor diet of many American children). And while she gives nod to the medically trained, practicing research specialists (e.g. Ronald Kennedy, pg 25)--it's her philosophic comrades that get the lion's share of attention: un-credentialed and medically untrained Barbara Loe Fisher, for example (pg 25-26).In conclusion--while science doesn't support the claims purported by Cave in this book, what is tragic is the uncritical manner in which she has presented her information. Poor research and methodology aside, Cave clearly has an agenda. It's not to get to the truth--but to advance her beliefs. At the end of the day, it isn't research of proven methodology, doctors, researchers, or even trained professionals dignified by a respected community committed to the scientific method that Cave leans upon. It's the unnamed mother, quoted as saying (in an oddly medical way), \\"I wouldn't give my child food with MSG; and I certainly wouldn't feed him aluminum, mercury, or formaldehyde, so why would I knowingly have those things injected into his bloodstream?\\" (28)I guess that pretty much settles it... for anybody who want a case of fear mongering (52-53) and pity cases (28, 67, 89). But for those looking for evidence that can be scientifically studied, argued, supported and defended--Cave sadly leaves readers wanting."},{"Title":"What Your Doctor May Not Tell You About(TM) Children's Vaccinations","review":"I appreciate this book because it isn't an anti-vaccine book.

Even though it is about 10 years old now, the information is still timely for the most part. My husband and I don't have kids yet and haven't quite settled on which vaccines our kids will and won't get, but they will be few.I thought Dr. Cave's explanations were concise and ordered, and easy to follow. I believe this is a book I can keep on my shelf as a reference, and I would readily lend it out to friends. If you are reading this review, then you are likely at least taking a second look at vaccines. Please read the book and do your research before letting your child one receive more shot. Also, do NOT default to your doctor. Hear what your Dr. has to say and get a second opinion on your own. There are too many doctors who have their hands tied by insurance and the CDC that they will not truly speak their mind about vaccines or even TELL you that you DO have the right to refuse vaccines for your child. If you let your child get shots, you MUST be informed.Read this book to become informed.__________________UPDATE 4 years (and 2 kids) later:We are a non vaccinating family, and plan to remain that way!As a follow-up to my initial review, I'd still recommend this book if you are JUST starting to reconsider the current vaccination schedule. If you have already read a good bit and made some decisions, this book *might not* add very much and will not get into some of the deeper issues of why someone may choose another route. The book had value for me to get me started on the overwhelming subject of vaccines. For example, we do not vaccinate partially because I am not overly concerned about the illnesses my children could get that are otherwise vaccinated against. This book aided in teaching me about those illnesses and as a result, realizing the diseases/illnesses my children would be potentially exposed to are not death threats (read: I wouldn't want my children to get polio but it's extremely unlikely they would ever be exposed to it with where we live today (ie not Africa); diphtheria used to be a deadly disease (about 20% death rate) but with today's sanitation, it is non existent per the CDC. Etc etc.).On the other hand, another facet to our decision dealt with the idea of the benefit of childhood illnesses and exercising the immune system before adulthood to be more resilient IN adulthood, and leaving the body as God designed it. That, of course, is a personal perspective on health so I wouldn't expect that to come out in an informational book. I'd say the opinions are on the fence more than a book totally for or totally against vaccines - which is good. You need some matter-of-fact information and you as a parent need to discern the right choice for your family. If you're uneasy about vaccines as they are given today and want to start investigating the subject, reading this book is a great place to start."},{"Title":"What Your Doctor May Not Tell You About(TM) Children's Vaccinations","review":"I think this book has a lot of good info for people who don't know much about vaccines or how they work.

In regards to the customer review provided by \\"Andy F\\", I don't even think he read the book.And yes, Andy, there are scientific journals out there prooving that there may be a connection to autism and thimerosal (mercury)Look up April 2004 issue of the Journal Molecular Psychiatry it includes research from Northeastern University pharmacy professor Richard Deth and colleagues from the University of Nebraska, Tufts, and Johns Hopkins University, that there is an apparent link between exposure to certain neurodevelopmental toxins and an increased possibility of developing neurological disorders including autism and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder.Here's the link. www.nupr.neu.edu/2-04/autism.htmlThis is not an anti-vaccine book it is a book to help get parents educated, ask the right questions and if your going to vaccinate, Dr. Cave offers a a recommendation on how to do it safely.When our very own CDC is quoting 1 in 166 kids are now being diagnosed with autism you can't help but want to protect your child and this book is a big help."},{"Title":"What Your Doctor May Not Tell You About(TM) Children's Vaccinations","review":"This is not an anti-vaccine book - it is a book that teaches about vaccinations so that you can make your own choice. And if you do choose to vaccinate, this book will tell you the safest ways to do so.What your pediatrician will not tell you is that there are significant risks for a very small portion of the population that gets vaccinated. That's all well and good for the majority - but what if *YOUR* baby is the one-in-a-million with a reaction? This book gives practical advice on how to reduce the chance of an adverse reaction, as well as discussing some successful ways she has treated vaccine reactions in her own practice.I truly think that every parent should read this book."},{"Title":"What Your Doctor May Not Tell You About(TM) Children's Vaccinations","review":"This is an excellent book which presents a balanced review of all the major vaccination issues. I felt that the book did a good job to avoid the hype and hysteria that often surrounds the issues. It reviews each mandatory vaccination and the history leaving the parent with a good starting point to making an informed, if difficult, decision."},{"Title":"What Your Doctor May Not Tell You About(TM) Children's Vaccinations","review":"Most books concerning vaccines are either very pro or very against. I found this book to be more balanced and honest. She does not try to portray vaccine-preventable diseases as insignificant or not dangerous, however, she is also straightforward about the risks involved with vaccinating, especially with the current recommended schedule. She runs through the history and nature of each disease and each vaccine and supports every statement with ample research. She suggests a modified schedule that she uses in her own practice that we have adopted for our own son. It seems much more sensible. I recommend this book highly to each parent who wants to be more thoroughly informed when choosing to vaccinate or not vaccinate their own child."},{"Title":"What Your Doctor May Not Tell You About(TM) Children's Vaccinations","review":"As many people have noted, this book was published in 2001, which means the bulk of it was probably written prior to 2000. Seven years is a long time, and I hope that Cave will publish a revision soon.Sadly, the book is NOT out of date when it comes to thimerosal. Although the amount of thimerosal has been decreased, it is NOT completely taken out of the vaccines. Another case of the CDC and APA's propaganda misleading parents.What I like about this book is that it is middle of the road. I know I was turned off by many anti-vaccine web sites because of their alarmist claims. I was turned off by many pro-vaccine web sites for the same reason. Cave's book is a great introduction for parents who are just wondering what all the fuss is about. Once you've read this book, you can take a more informed look at other books and web sites. You can also focus your search to include just the vaccines or diseases that worry you the most. This is a great book to get as a gift for a new parent, as it will not immediately turn them off from the ingrained idea that vaccinations are good. You have to start somewhere, and this is a good place to begin!"},{"Title":"What Your Doctor May Not Tell You About(TM) Children's Vaccinations","review":"Parents beware...your doctor very likely won't tell you about the very real risks associated with childhood vaccines. You have to find this information out on your own, and this book is an excellent resource for doing that. It goes into detail about each vaccination, risks AND benefits, and cites sources for all of the information provided. It also offers a suggested delayed vaccine schedule. Suggested reading for all parents in my opinion."},{"Title":"What Your Doctor May Not Tell You About(TM) Children's Vaccinations","review":"As a pediatric occupational therapist treating kids with autism, sensory integration dysfunction, ADHD, and other neurological problems that canot be explained, I found this book to be fastenating, and in line with the current research. Something is causing these disorders and Dr. Cave is very couragous in speaking out for a safer vaccination process. She gives both sides of the story, and her advise to parents on the safest method for vaccinations is easy to understand and very practical.

But here's some proof on how they are hurting our babies."},{"Title":"What Your Doctor May Not Tell You About(TM) Children's Vaccinations","review":"This is the best resource that I've found. It contains unbiased, research based information. Basically, she goes through each vaccine and gives you the history of the disease and the vax. There is also information on who should/shouldn't get certain vaccines and how to best prevent an adverse reaction. I was on the fence about vaxing at all before I read this book. After reading it I felt confident to selectively/delay vaccinate my baby. Ultimately it is your choice, but it helps to have some solid information to help make your decision."},{"Title":"What Your Doctor May Not Tell You About(TM) Children's Vaccinations","review":"Stephanie Cave in her book throws light into various vaccines and risks involved in each.

I believe it's a must read for all parents.[...]"},{"Title":"What Your Doctor May Not Tell You About(TM) Children's Vaccinations","review":"Pretty good book if you are looking for background information regarding vaccines. Unfortunately, this is a fairly old edition, hence much of the information provided is in dire need of an update/revision.

She is more non-biased and just tells things like they are. She will not say NOT to get your child vaccinated but if you do want to get them vaccinated the do it at \\"such and such\\" time. I found it quite easy to understand so that you don't have to be a doctor yourself to comprehend what she is saying. I highly recommend this book for people that are wondering whether vaccines are safe or not."},{"Title":"What Your Doctor May Not Tell You About(TM) Children's Vaccinations","review":"As a parent of small children, the amount of information about vaccines (pro and con) can be overwhelming. This book provided enough information for me to ask our pediatrition educated questions and request reasonable other options / variations to \\"The Schedule\\". I have received tremendous pushback from the docs involved over the years, however I have remained firm in knowing that I am doing what I feel is in my children's best interest. I know the docs believe in the vaccines; I also know that Vioxx (and many other meds) was prescribed with scientific support & all of the medical community's best intentions and that didn't work out so well. This book won't tell you which side is right/wrong, but it provides pertinent information to make it helpful in your decision making process."},{"Title":"What Your Doctor May Not Tell You About(TM) Children's Vaccinations","review":"Dr. Cave's presentation on vaccinations is excellent. While she is not wholly opposed to vaccines, as so many of the \\"quacks\\" out there are, she presents the information as it is: she realizes that most vaccines have serious problems and that some are almost completely pointless. It is wonderful that so many doctors and experts are calling for parental education and higher standards for the vaccine manufacturers and the federal government. This book helps us make educated decisions on which vaccines are best for our children and which ones might cause them harm."},{"Title":"What Your Doctor May Not Tell You About(TM) Children's Vaccinations","review":"I was on the fence when purchasing this book. My daughter, who is now one, had a pretty bad reaction at her 6 month appointment, and I hadn't had her vaccinated since then. This book lays out the pros and cons to both the vaccines as well as the actual viruses, and it left me shocked!I am very anti-vaccinations after reading this book. But what its nice is that allows you to pick and choose your battles. You don't have to dislike all the vaccines. There are many moms I know who have read this book who still selectively vaccinate. The book provides you with the knowledge and info to make your own decisions, and really prepares you for that moment you must stand up to your child's pediatrician. Kudos for a well-written, concise book!"},{"Title":"What Your Doctor May Not Tell You About(TM) Children's Vaccinations","review":"This book is a little out dated. New information and new vaccines are out and being given since this book has been out. Overall, this book is okay.

My son was a perfectly NORMAL, beautiful little boy until he received his MMR vaccine. Within 24 hours he had all the hallmark symptoms of autism.

I don't like when Dr's try and convince people to vaccinate by using scare tactics and I don't like when opponents of vaccinations use scare tactics to prove vaccinations are dangerous. There are dangers with vaccinations, as well as many benefits. Parents need to know about the diseases, the ingredients in vaccines, and they need to make decisions themselves. Repeated examples of the one in 250,000 kids who gets a life threatening illness as either a result of not vaccinating or a result of a vaccination isn't helpful at all. This book is full of the latter, which, in my opinion makes it useless in helping with decision making. Scare tactics are an attempt to make the decision for you, and I want to make my own decisions regarding my children's health. Facts are what are needed."},{"Title":"What Your Doctor May Not Tell You About(TM) Children's Vaccinations","review":"Although I am sure the book HAD great info, I think it is a true shame it wasn't made cleat that the info is old and outdated ...

The information is presented in an easy-to read format which is great for reference. Also, Dr. Cave is a pediatrician - many of the other books out there are written by people with no medical credentials whatsoever. Dr. Cave is not anti-vaccination in all cases, nor is she pro-vaccination. The information she presents encourages parents to be equal partners with their doctor in deciding which vaccinations to give (or not to give) their child and also provides her own recommendations on WHEN to vaccinate, which is alone worth the price of the book. Also supplied are a list of resources to get more information on filing religious exemptions and many other topics. I wish I knew about this book when my first child was born five years ago - I would have done things much differently. I think this book is a must read for all parents."},{"Title":"What Your Doctor May Not Tell You About(TM) Children's Vaccinations","review":"I have read this book with useful information. I did daycare for 10 years. I saw children that were developing perfectly normally and then they had vaccines, had reactions and were NEVER the same. I chose not to vaccinate my 2 children as a result of what I witnessed in my time in daycare. Although the so called experts say that there is no info proving that vaccines cause autism...there is no info proving that vaccines do not cause autism. The truth is we dont kow for sure. Once the damage is done, there is no going back. I personally could never forgive myself if something were to happen to my children as a result of vaccines. It a matter of whether or not the risks outweigh the benefits. I feel its more of a risk to vaccinate then not to."},{"Title":"What Your Doctor May Not Tell You About(TM) Children's Vaccinations","review":"This book is a must for any new parents.

If you are pregnant or a new parent, for the sake of your child, please read and seriously consider this book before consenting to the literally dozens of vaccinations your doctor's office will push on your infant during the first two years.One note: a few other reviews complained that this book \\"falsely\\" states that state laws require children to be vaccinated. While there may be no laws requiring immunization per se, in most places children cannot attend public school, preschool or daycare without proof of the vaccinations. (As a mother and public schoolteacher, I know this from experience. I have had new students taken out of my classroom after administration found they had incomplete vaccination records on file; the students were only allowed in after the vaccinations were complete.)So unless you plan to completely homeschool your child, or pay to send him or her to one of the few private schools that does not require vaccination, the law does present a dilemma for parents with legitimate concerns about vaccines. My concerns about vaccines were brushed away by my son's doctor's office. He got the shots. Now he has autism."},{"Title":"What Your Doctor May Not Tell You About(TM) Children's Vaccinations","review":"This book is on my list of the three books all soon to be parents should be required to read.

It gives your options to the traditional vaccine recommendations that most doctors follow."},{"Title":"What Your Doctor May Not Tell You About(TM) Children's Vaccinations","review":"I think the toughest part in reading books on vaccination is that you can find a book to support ANY conclusion that you have already made. But what about those of us who are (were) genuinely uncertain about what we plan to do with our children? I borrowed this book from a friend when I was pregnant and I highly recommend it as a place to start. Other reviewers are correct -- she is not vehemently anti-vaccination OR pro-vaccination. I appreciated the middle of the road approach, and since I can think for myself, I didn't mind that her recommendations were based on what is required by law in most states to enter school, etc. She mentions the exemptions, but acknowledges that her recommendations are based on if you want to give vaccines, but want to be cautious with it. I only give this book 4 stars because it was published in 2001 and a lot of its info needs to be updated (hint, hint, new edition??), but I still honestly recommend that parents who are looking to start their own quest for answers start here.The vaccines covered include Hep B, DTP/DPaP, Hib, Polio, MMR, Varicella, Hep A, Pneumococcal, Meningococcal, Flu, Lyme Disease, and some brief overviews of Japanese encephalitis, Cholera, and yellow fever (vaccines for world travelers). Cave also includes a history of vaccines, including some failures. Cave's approach shies away from telling parents what to do, but it does give lots of information to think on and form your own conclusions."},{"Title":"What Your Doctor May Not Tell You About(TM) Children's Vaccinations","review":"As pediatrician treating autistic children, some of whom have high levels of metal in their systems, Stephanie Cave, in my opinion, is the expert I most trust. Her book is balanced, and I loved that she layed out an alternative vaccine schedule. I read several other vaccine books on both ends of the spectrum, and this one is the most sensible, balanced, comprehensive and sane, right down the middle. She recognizes the value of certain vaccines, yet also acknowledges risks and concerns about the CDC's agressive vaccine schedule for infants. My only question is whether or not she currently recommends Prevnar. At the time of the writing, she was not recommending it in her practice because it was so new on the market. Other than that, the book was extremely helpful for me in sorting out all the options for my baby."},{"Title":"What Your Doctor May Not Tell You About(TM) Children's Vaccinations","review":"Every time I see a statistic, it seems to go up. Now, 1 in 150 children is diagnosed with Autism. That's incredibly alarming. Vaccines are a suspected factor in this dramatic increase in occurance and so parents should read and otherwise educate themselves as much as possible BEFORE getting their child/children vaccinated. Vaccines are reviewed quite objectively and in easy to understand detail in this informative book. Alternatives to the current suggested vaccine schedule offer parents options that match with their comfort level; it also helps you approach the subject with your pediatrician/family doctor, as it can be a touchy subject for some. This book was written by an MD, so I felt it was a true review of vaccine hazards AND benefits. It was an excellent resource for our family and certainly helped us make decisions regarding vaccinating our child (our first!) I highly recommend this to all parents."},{"Title":"What Your Doctor May Not Tell You About(TM) Children's Vaccinations","review":"I wish I had read this book before my two daughters became injured from vaccines.

As a responsible parent, we need to educate ourselves on healthcare so that we may make informed decisions about our children. There are options, for those who take the time to find out the options. This book is not anti-vaccine. It gave us a road map on how to administer vaccines safely to our second child after our first child was vaccine-damaged (how to spread out the shots, what sorts of supplements we could use to prepare the body for vaccines, how to make sure our vaccines were thimerasol-free, etc). Stephanie Cave and Deborah Mitchell are champions for our kids. My hats off to them for creating an easy read that was highly informative and possibly saved my second child from the same fate that my first child suffered.Tricia Morin"},{"Title":"What Your Doctor May Not Tell You About(TM) Children's Vaccinations","review":"I have heard Dr Caves speak and read the book. She is amazing. She is NOT anti-vaccine, just safe vaccination of ALL children. IF YOU HAVE KIDS - I highly recommend you read this BOOK! (grandkids included)"},{"Title":"What Your Doctor May Not Tell You About(TM) Children's Vaccinations","review":"I read The Vaccine Book, by Dr. Robert Sears, prior to beginning this book. The Vaccine Book gives more updated information about vaccine contents, since there have been many changes, such as minimizing Mercury in vaccines to minute levels or removing it altogether. Thus, as I read this book, I already knew that some of its information is outdated and no longer accurate.Nevertheless, there are still many concerns that I have about vaccinations and Dr. Cave addresses them well in this book. What Your Doctor May Not Tell You About Children's Vaccinations was published 8 years ago, so, since its publication, some positive strides have definitely been taken. If Dr. Cave published a more current version(as is important with any medically related book, since new developments are constant), I would have given that 5 stars.This book is well written and she addresses concerns about how vaccines may be related to things like asthma and learning disabilities, in addition to other more serious consequences. However, this is not an anti-vaccine book.Dr. Cave actually states that she does not advocate dropping vaccines altogether. Instead, she logically discusses concerns and risks of vaccines and of the diseases they are meant to prevent to help parents be better informed ask their doctors good questions so they can work together to make the best decision for their children and families.Two books on the subject, by credible, educated sources may be too much reading, so if I had to only recommend one of these two books, it would be The Vaccine Book by Dr. Sears, but I'm glad to have both because I have really been benefiting from Dr. Cave's knowledge and insights."},{"Title":"What Your Doctor May Not Tell You About(TM) Children's Vaccinations","review":"This is not a review, but rather a response to the last poster inquiring why the autism rate is soaring in spite of the declining thimerosol (mercury derived preservative) amount in vaccines.As a mother of a 4 yo son with autism, I believe that autism is a multi-faceted condition. I don't believe my son's autism was caused by mercury, HOWEVER, I do believe that he may have been vaccine injured; due to the fact that he received the Hepatitis B vaccine when he was less than 24 hours old. It is my belief that in genetically predisposed children, bombarding their immature immune systems with a vaccine is PART of the autism puzzle. Think about it...exposing the immature gastointestinal system to solids before it is ready increases the risk of food allergies...wheat, milk, eggs, nut products, etc...similar analogy.It's not that the vaccines themselves are inherently harmful; but if they are given to a system not ready to adequately handle them, therein lies the problem. The US has the most aggressive vaccination schedule in the WORLD! China has changed their vaccination schedule so as not to vacc any child under the age of two!Just my 2 cents."},{"Title":"What Your Doctor May Not Tell You About(TM) Children's Vaccinations","review":"This book is incredible and should manditory reading for all parents. I did not know that vaccinating a child was an option until the year 2000 when my sister refussed to vaccinate her first daughter. It caused me to really think and I decided to begin research when I became pregnant in 2003. Thanks to this book I did not vaccinte my newborn and was able to make an EDUCATED dicision about this issue, not assume I had to do what the government says. I have gotten a lot of flack for this decision but it is mine to make. Thanks to Stephanie Cave my child will not have to be subject to unresearched \\"testing\\". My child is not a lab rat. Please be advised that I suggest you use a back up method for your childs immune safety, such as Young Living Essential Oil produts. Do not send your child into the world unprotected.

This book provides all of that, and then some. I cannot recommend this book highly enough. It is extremely well laid out and complete with all the facts necessary to make your choices.After reading this book all parents will understand 1) what vaccines are required for your children, and when; 2) what the different vaccines are made of; 3) the efficacy of the vaccines (and for how long they remain effective); 4) the range and rates of reactions to the vaccines; 5) your options related to the timing of the vaccines; 6) precautions that you can take on behalf of your children (including commercially available vaccine alternatives free of controversial additives); 7) an alternative vaccine schedule that Dr. Cave developed based on her experience (that really helped me a lot). Finally, if you choose to be a 'conscientious objector', the author provides information on how to prevent your child being jabbed without your consent.In addition, all of Dr. Cave's research is referenced at the end of each paragraph should you wish to do additional research (I personally found that this was unnecessary however!). I am very relieved to have found this book prior to my daughter's first vaccination - I now feel completely educated on the (sometimes very emotional) topic of vaccinations. Whether you ultimately elect to have your child vaccinated to the extent that is recommended by health departments is up to you - but with this book you will be armed to the gills with the information you need to be confident about making those important decisions. This book is definitely a keeper. Once again, HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!"},{"Title":"What Your Doctor May Not Tell You About(TM) Children's Vaccinations","review":"This book encourages parents &quot;...to be equal partners with doctors in deciding which vaccines their children should get and when they should get them.&quot; The way this book achieves this goal is by offering important medical information in easy to understand terms. &quot;What Your Doctor May Not Tell You...&quot; provides detailed info on the various vaccines currently required/suggested by state and federal governments; reviewing indepth the history of the diseases and related vaccines, ingredients used to make and preserve the vaccines, background studies and recent research available on a variety of the vaccines and also a risk/benefit analysis per vaccination. What this book offers (that your doctor's office may not) is a look at both sides of the vaccination issue and gives YOU a well-rounded resource package so you can best decide when/what vaccines to give your child. Factors that can influence your decision include any known allergies, reactions to previous vaccinations, family history of autoimmune diseases and more. Also a help to parents is a list of precautions parents can take when their children get vaccinated and also a recommended schedule (that differs from the government's) for childhood vaccinations. This alternative vaccination timeline allows you to operate within the guidelines of the government mandate that all children receive a certain number of shots prior to entering school, but attempts to spread out the vaccinations for minimum exposure to risk and negative side effects. Did you know many vaccines used today include ingredients such as mercury, formaldehyde, ethylene glycol (a main ingredient in antifreeze) and more? Would you consume those poisons? Of course not, but vaccine manufacturers (and the CDC and FDA) seem to think it's okay for our kids to receive these poisons ad nauseam. Fortunately, each of today's required vaccinations come with a mercury-free alternative, but many doctors are still using those with mercury and you must request the safer alternative. Research and vaccination injury reporting systems indicate possible and/or obvious links to multiple adverse effects including irreparable diseases and death, but many doctors, educators and government institutions refuse to consider those possibilities, as it may endanger the successful mass-vaccination programs currently employed in this country. Included in this book is a discussion of the possible exemptions available to parents, which may include religious, medical or philosophical, depending upon the state in which you live. If you're not willing to trust this author's approach, there's a list of multiple resources at the end of the book allowing you to do your own research and form your own further educated opinion."},{"Title":"What Your Doctor May Not Tell You About(TM) Children's Vaccinations","review":"After my infant daughter had an immediate physical reaction and a prolonged, 4-week neurological reaction to her routine 4-month vaccinations, I began searching for information about vaccines and safety that would help me determine the best, safest course of action with future vaccines. Searching the internet yielded an enormous amount of information - some of which is very alarmist and frightening and some of which is overly scientific and hard for a non-scientific parent to understand. It is very difficult to find information that is easy to understand, balanced presenting both the pros and the cons, and is comprehensive, facts-based and well-researched. This book is by far the most comprehensive and most useful information contained in a single cover that I have found. An added benefit is that the information is presented in such a way that it is a very compelling read - I read the 1st 100 pages within 3 hours after my amazon box arrived - while tending to a busy, crawling infant!Who Can Benefit from this Book?I believe that this book is a must read for all parents. Given that vaccinations are mandated by law it is very important for parents to understand as much as they can about vaccines. Parents have a responsibility to themselves, their children and our shared community to be informed on these matters. The subject of vaccines and their safety is much too complex for any pediatrician to adequately address with each individual parent that they serve. The most time I've spent with my pediatrician in a single visit is about 15-20 minutes max. The pros, cons, history of vaccines, past study findings, current research, etc., cannot be covered in such a short amount of time. As someone who is a proponent of vaccination programs and who believes strongly in doing what is best for the greater good in terms of public health, I found that the general statement from the medical staff at my pediatrician's office, that vaccines are safe and reactions are very rare, was not sufficient for me. I needed to know more, and thanks to this book now I do.If you are a parent, even if your children have already been vaccinated, you will benefit from the knowledge gained by reading this book."},{"Title":"What Your Doctor May Not Tell You About(TM) Children's Vaccinations","review":"Dr. Stephanie Cave does an outstanding job explaining the ins and outs of the vaccine controversy. As a new parent, I never realized the importance of researching the effects of vaccines until my child suffered a reaction. Every new parent should study this book. The choice to vaccinate your child should be a personal one and should be made only when the parent has thoroughly educated themselves on the subject. Dr. Cave makes that process easier with simple explanations for a complicated medical issue. She also provides a proactive plan for a safer vaccination protocol to guide parents on the best way possible to protect their children from both the diseases the vaccines may prevent and the side effects they may cause. This information has been needed for a long time! Thanks Dr. Cave."},{"Title":"What Your Doctor May Not Tell You About(TM) Children's Vaccinations","review":"This is a good book for parents who want simple facts that are easy to understand. It is a good start to researching the pro's and con's of vaccinations but should not be the end. The book has many good facts, and some opinions. She covers almost all subjects of concern but not all thoroughly. I would definitely recommend this book as a starting place. If you want a book of scientific facts, studies and medical information then you probably want Vaccines: Are They Really Safe and Effective? By Neil Z. Miller. His book is full of scientific facts on BOTH sides, with point and counter point information referencing medical journals, scientific studies and other documented facts. If you choose to read a few books on the subject then be sure to pick up What Your Doctor May Not Tell You About Children's Vaccinations. by Stephanie Cave, but if you only read one get Vaccines: Are They Really Safe and Effective? By Neil Z. Miller."},{"Title":"What Your Doctor May Not Tell You About(TM) Children's Vaccinations","review":"I have been reading much research on immunizations. Most authors sway one direction or the other. Stephanie Cave doesn't promote nor dissuade the reader from the decision. She merely lays out the pros & cons. If you choose not to she tells you how to obtain an exemption in your state. Most importantly she provides detailed information, for those wanting to vaccinate,on how to administer them while reducing risks. This is the first book that I have seen providing a \\"safe\\" vaccination schedule. The schedule does not follow the CDC's recommendations but, gets the job done."},{"Title":"What Your Doctor May Not Tell You About(TM) Children's Vaccinations","review":"Even if you are not a first time parent, read this and/or similar books to become better informed about the benefits vs. risks of various vaccinations. What vaccinations to give your child is probably one of the most important child care decisions you will make yet for the most part we simply trust the mainstream medical views.The book covers each vaccination in terms of what microbe strains the vaccine offers protection against as well as odds of getting the disease vs. potential vaccination risks. The book gives information on how other countries have taken action with regards to potential vaccination risks. The book also provides some information on how to handle not having your child vaccinated if you disagree with the state guidelines/laws for vaccinations. This book offers a good quick overview if time is an issue.On a personal note, I read this book too late. I may never fully understand what caused my child's problems, but it's better to read this or similar literature before something happens than to think you possibly allowed harm to come to your child through ignorance."},{"Title":"What Your Doctor May Not Tell You About(TM) Children's Vaccinations","review":"I am a professor at a school in Indiana, and I checked this book out with the hope of using it in my class. But this book is utterly loaded with error and blatant non-facts. For example, all one has to do is open the book to the first page of chapter 1, and you see the authors informing the readers that vaccines are required by government law. As most anti-vaccine researchers know, this is a blatant non-fact, and there is no such law, and not a single state in the United States has such laws. Rather, it is schools that give the false impression that there is such a law, and schools are used to badger parents into getting vaccines, and they incorrectly state that there is such a law, which there is not. There are numerous other problems with this book also. First of all, it is a pro-vaccine book, recommending that parents merely wait (until after toddlerhood) rather than reject vaccines--as if vaccines might hopefully be somewhat safe enough later on, after toddlerhood. This book plainly does not properly address the severity of what vaccines do to people before, during, and after toddlerhood (through adulthood and old age). And regardless of age, this book overlooks the fact that vaccines are filled with poisons harmful or lethal to anyone, and which have been verified to cause all sorts of ailments and diseases--anything from early onset Alzheimer's to eczema to allergies to numerous auto-immune disorders to diabetes to cancer, and that is just the very beginning of what vaccines do. Reading this book gives the impression that vaccines may work, could be safe, do not necessarily cause epidemics rather than eliminate them, and that they are not seriously dangerous for kids after toddlerhood. All one needs to do is research the data that other doctors, such as Viera Schreibner, have uncovered from the professional journals, to see that this is simply incorrect. Parents should be very careful whether they want to trust this book, rather than a different one. I recommend the scientific research by Tenpenny, and her book, titled: VACCINES."},{"Title":"What Your Doctor May Not Tell You About(TM) Children's Vaccinations","review":"This is a must read for parents today! Dr. Cave gives an insightful, informative look at the history of childhood immunizations and offers an alternative schedule for those who wish to be careful about the administration of vaccines to their children. Her suggested schedule is easy to follow and makes so much sense! There is too much information available that proves certain children are at risk for adverse reactions - why not play it safe? Our children's lifetime of well-being is not worth the risk of vacinating out of convenience or simply \\"I didn't know there was a risk.\\" As a parent whose child suffered developmental language delays after the round of 15-month shots, I can say it is absolutely worth it to be careful!"},{"Title":"What Your Doctor May Not Tell You About(TM) Children's Vaccinations","review":"This book gives a complete evaluation (pros and cons) of the list of required children's vaccinations used in most states. The book provides enough information on each vaccine that you can decide whether or not you want to decline any of them. Note: It was published in 1996 so there have been a few changes since then - but it is a great starting place and provides contact info for relevant organizations.The best part is....It provides a suggested/recomended vaccine schedule that the author/doctor uses with her own patients. This schedule differs from the one used by most pediatricians and takes into account a variety of factors. The recommended schedule includes every required vaccine in case you decide to do them all. This is great for parents who aren't interested in waiving vaccines but still want to ensure that their child has the greatest chance of responding well to those vaccines without incident.Overall, this book is a great educational tool for new parents because it enables parents to advocate for individualized (rather than routine) care of their child/children."},{"Title":"What Your Doctor May Not Tell You About(TM) Children's Vaccinations","review":"This book contains some valuable information about vaccines, although it gets tiresome reading all of the \\"maybes,\\" \\"possiblys,\\" and \\"could bes.\\"My biggest criticism of the book, however, is that in making a strong and repeated point about the danger of the MMR vaccine, it relies heavily upon research by a doctor whose MMR-autism report has been thoroughly discredited. Dr. Andrew Wakefield's scary report in 1998 suggesting a link between MMR and autism and recommending that children space out those three vaccines is no longer considered good science even by those who initially supported it. Indeed, 10 of the 12 doctors who signed the Wakefield report (Wakefield was the 13th) have now retracted their support of the report's conclusions.Dr. Wakefield began a hearing in March, 2008, on charges of misconduct for the manner in which he conducted the research for his report, and there is a great deal of controversy surrounding him for alleged conflicts of interest and inappriorate research methods. For example, prior to publishing his report, Dr. Wakefield had sought a patent for a competing measles vaccine, one that presumably would be of much greater value in a marketplace that sought to separate the MMR vaccine into three shots.Dr. Cave's book was published before any of this came to light, so I suppose the most efficient way to criticize this book is simply to say that it is outdated as to some of its most potent claims. Frankly, this makes me wonder what other scientific claims made in the book are outdated. Seven years is a long time in the world of science, and it would be ideal to see an updated version of this book."},{"Title":"What Your Doctor May Not Tell You About(TM) Children's Vaccinations","review":"I thought this book was great because it doesn't say \\"don't vaccinate at all\\", and it doesn't say \\"you should give your child all of these vaccinations\\". Instead she gives the whole story on each vaccine and the risks involved. I have not read other books on the topic, but I thought this one was perfect for me to make educated decisions about my children's healthcare."},{"Title":"What Your Doctor May Not Tell You About(TM) Children's Vaccinations","review":"I gave it four stars instead of 5 because the info is outdated. The book is great but needs to be updated-errors changed and re-released. The author gives a suggested alternate vaccination schedule to follow which is what I chose to do for my child.Mercury may not still be in vaccines in an amount like they used to be but other chemicals are. I would suggest that the author include these things. Such examples are; MSG and formaldahyde. She touches on Aluminum but doesn't mention that vaccines are made in the tissues of other animals like Monkey Kidney tissue. She doesn't explore the problem of this DNA and RNA of these animals sitting dormat in the human body until they are ready to reap havock on our immune system."},{"Title":"What Your Doctor May Not Tell You About(TM) Children's Vaccinations","review":"I think this is the best of the vaccine reference books for average people. It isn't as alarmist as some of them, and gives good advice on increasing the safety of the vaccines you may choose to use for your children. I've bought multiple copies for new mothers. I've found it very helpful."},{"Title":"What Your Doctor May Not Tell You About(TM) Children's Vaccinations","review":"I found this book to be informative because it gave 2 sides to the story. The fact that the it was written by an MD I feel gives additional credibility to the book. If you are looking for alternatives to the traditional \\"medical model\\" of vaccine administration, I feel this is great book to read."},{"Title":"What Your Doctor May Not Tell You About(TM) Children's Vaccinations","review":"I agree with previous reviewer, in that this book misleads concerned parents in many ways. For example, the book would have you believe that the law MAKES you submit your children to vaccination. At least in California the law is fairly friendly in opting-out of vaccinations for your children, and other states vary in degree (a few are fairly intolerant/militant about vaccinations).Also, Cave's book follows the Vaccination Industry's propaganda that attributes the 75%-95% drop in infections, that preceded vaccinations, to vaccination programs (the same programs that feed this 100 billion dollar industry). This drop occurred during the 50 years prior to the various vaccinations being introduced. We can thank sanitation, refrigeration, and nutrition for that 75%-95% drop, and not the vaccine industry as Dr. Cave does!The previous reviewer recommends, and I agree, that Dr Sherri J. Tenpenny's book \\"Vaccines: The Risks, The Benefits, The Choices\\" is outstanding for an accurate reference manual for concerned parents that enables parents to make informed decisions based on accurate information. Depending on your decision, Dr. Tenpenny does an excellent job of guiding you through what you can do and why (even what you can do if, in the future, you're forced into submitting to a vaccination).Also, Dr. Russel Blaylock has an excellent Vaccine chapter in his \\"Health and Nutrition Secrets\\" book. Also a great book."},{"Title":"What Your Doctor May Not Tell You About(TM) Children's Vaccinations","review":"There are five cases of diptheria per year in the US.There are 600 hundred cases of mumps in the US each year.Polio has been eradicated in the Western Hemisphere.There are 300 cases of hib each year.last year there were 40 cases of Measles in the US.300 cases of rubella. And of those cases 25 cases were passed on by pregnant women.There are 200 million people in the United States.These are some of the facts you will learn from Dr. Cave's book. And if you are open to the research it might even jump start you to read more of the books on these topics. In all fairness, I read several of the 'left of center' books which go much further in discussing the hideous reactions associated with vaccines. So, where Dr. Cave didn't speak up, I already had the knowledge in my head. But still she at least does talk about a lot of the reactions and many issues around them which is a breath of fresh air in comparison to many doctors out there who just say, \\"Just Do it....There's nothing wrong with Vaccines.\\" If you've got one of those doctor's then by all means get this book. Start somewhere."},{"Title":"What Your Doctor May Not Tell You About(TM) Children's Vaccinations","review":"This book is fine if you need a medical opinion but it does not go far enough reporting on the hazards of vaccination. Also, the author advocates selective MMR (individual measles, mumps and rubella shots) but this option does not exist. Therefore, many parents are still left wondering what to do. This is why I recommend the book, Vaccines: Are They Really Safe and Effective? It is very compelling and does not pander to the medical community. Instead, the author presents numerous studies that I have not seen published in other vaccine books."},{"Title":"What Your Doctor May Not Tell You About(TM) Children's Vaccinations","review":"Just wanted to put my vote in the five-star column - I think this book is very valuable and should be read by anyone with children (or anyone that has a body of their own, for that matter). Dr. Cave goes into a lot of detail about the background of vaccinations and explains how they may have links to autism, auto-immune disorders and other prevelant disorders of the 20th and 21st Centuries. If nothing else you may just think twice about loading a newborn down with things his not-yet-developed immune system can handle and trying to plan it out better and/or not use formulas with mercury in them.

This book clearly explains the pro's and con's of each vaccine, the purpose of each vaccine, recommends a schedule/timeline for administering them, and remains objective throughout. I really appreciated the fact that this was NOT an opinionated book full of \\"you should do this,\\" and \\"you should not do that\\" kinds of statements.I did, however, find it a bit basic, and as much as I appreciated and used the information presented in this book, I still did extra research online.

It cites Dr Wakefield's research as an authority on vaccine research, well we all know what happened there, and finally it includes under vaccines of the future many vaccines that are currently part of the schedule.

Three childhood friends are prompted by unusual events to flee familiar grounds and try an over-the-pond holiday at a most unusual bed &amp; breakfast &quot;near the top of the list&quot; - truly in a class by itself. There are really five main stories (three generations) running at the same time, yet they are clearly delineated. Richard Peck seems to really understand the dynamics of women's friendships. The flashbacks to wartime London are fascinating, and obviously well researched. The characters are well developed, from the &quot;seen-it-all&quot; and rather magical Mrs. Smith-Porter (with a slightly shady background behind her upright faade) to the individual charms of Les, Julia &amp; Margo and the utterly-lacking-in-charm Kimberly. The Bed &amp; Breakfast was a thank you from a former lover, and through treasure hunts in the London markets, Ms. Smith Porter has furnished it with lovely, priceless antiques and a certain joie de vivre. Concisely and beautifully written, the story evolves simply through circumstances that are quite amazing. Mr. Peck gives the readers a flavor of London past and present together with glimpses of foolish lives, marriages gone bad, lives gone lonesome -- and then tosses in a bit of enchantment to show how things can fade into adventure and novelty."},{"Title":"London Holiday","review":"Three middle-aged women have a holiday in London; they've been friends since sharing a Midwestern childhood and are now all variously dissatisfied with their lives.

Richard Peck is particularly good at combining descriptions of intriguing homes and interiors with portraits of 40- something women at turning points in their lives. I am originally from St.Louis and planning a second trip to London. His strong sense of place - New York,St.Louis, and London- conveyed life in those cities in the late nineties without using tourist stereotypes.

Throughout the book, I kept having a sense of deja vu, as if I'd encountered similar scenes, or characters, or plot lines before. The most memorable and original character was the British landlady, Mrs. Smith-Porter, and chapter 1, devoted entirely to her, is by far the best chapter in the book.Which illustrates a second major flaw: the uneven quality of its writing. How can the same person who wrote this silly description of love/lust - &quot;She felt dams breaking gently throughout her regions&quot; - also have written this insight into vacationing - &quot;People often broke under the strain of traveling for pleasure&quot;?Unlike &quot;Yaya Sisterhood&quot; and its ilk, this book takes a much gentler and less intense approach to the main characters' troubles. The reader will find London tea, handsome titled Englishmen, country gardens, double decker buses and faded antiques to water down the nasty childhood memories or present emotional crises. Like a finger sandwich or a piece of angel food cake, &quot;London Holiday&quot; is sweet and pleasant enough - but hardly filling."},{"Title":"London Holiday","review":"Peck's novel is wonderful read for nice rainy day next to the crackling wood fireplace.

Richard is a guy and he's writing about \\"women's night out\\" taking place in London. It turns to romance. I'm a guy, so I had to stretch to give it 4 stars. But ladies, you will like it more and maybe even call it a 5.Three old friends, each needing a break from life, head to London for an upscale summer holiday in an upscale Bed & Breakfast. First you have to get to know the three ladies, and their occupations, and their families, and their situations. Several beginning chapters covers this. That just about causes you to set the book aside. But then, bang, Margo is shot, and Les and Julia are full-speed-ahead for the trio's London reunion--supposedly for the sake of Margo's recuperation.But four are at the door when Mrs. Smith-Porter lets in the newly arriving borders of her B&B.; She is a character herself, and points her guests toward their desires. The book's story perks up once they are in London. Then comes the introduction of men. There is the husband turned gay, a doctor, an antique dealer, the daughter turned pregnant, marriage histories to contend with, an accident, and...well, there is a lot packed into a relative short stay in London. Almost too much to be considered in the realm of convincing possibility but certainly not predictable in the end.Perhaps this book is just meant for the ladies.

Relax, put down that terribly deep, intellectual book you are slogging through and secretly hate, and pick up London Holiday. You deserve a break!"},{"Title":"London Holiday","review":"Friendship, loyalty, and new beginnings. That's what London Holiday by Richard Peck is all about. It's also about being a charmingly upbeat tale amidst today's morass of painful confessionals and doomsday prognostications - how welcome!An Edgar Allen Poe Award-winner and author of 20 some novels for young readers, Mr. Peck shifts gracefully between genres with this, his fourth adult novel, as he focuses on three childhood friends, now middle-aged women, who travel to London for a stay at that city's most famous bed-and-breakfast created and run by the daunting Mrs. Smith-Porter who has learned that &quot;people come halfway round the world to talk mainly of themselves and home.&quot;The women have distanced themselves from their Missouri girlhood. Despite the heroic, sometimes unwelcome efforts of Les, now a St. Louis do-gooder, time and miles have caused their friendship to fray at the edges. When one of the trio, Margo, a teacher who has been recently divorced and is coping with an irascible teenage daughter, is the victim of a classroom shooting, Les determines to reunite the three for a restorative stay in England. Unhappily married and an inveterate, hovering organizer, Les convinces the third member of the triumverate Julia, a New York City based interior designer still smarting from the AIDS related death of her mentor and partner, that this is the tonic Margo needs.Once the threesome crosses the Atlantic they encounter a cast of wonderful British characters, including Mrs. Dowdel, &quot;the char of earlier times, down to the hat she never took off, the fag stuck to her lower lip, and the unchanging apron.&quot;London Holiday also proves to be an entertaining armchair travelogue as the trio takes tea in the orangery of Kensington Palace, visit the Ritz, and Julia explores the enormous tent city that is Bermondsey Market where she meets an attractive, single furniture dealer.All of the women have weathered disappointments and little suspect the gladsome life-changing opportunities they will find in London. There is romance, challenge and self-fulfillment awaiting each of them in this feel-good cheery tale.Mr. Peck's stylish story offers not only pleasant diversion but a vicarious boost, and an urge to cheer, &quot;Go, girls!&quot;- Gail Cooke"},{"Title":"London Holiday","review":"This is the perfect book for a drizzly Saturday afternoon. I haven't read romances in years and I have no idea why I picked this up. The author follows three childhood friends on a therapeutic two week trip to London, more or less accidentally accompanied by one daughter, where all four are booked into tiny, charming bed and breakfast operated by Mrs. Smith-Porter. Through flashbacks we learn the women's histories and compromises they made with their lives. The women are believable and engaging. Their landlady is the best of the characters. She appears to be a perfect lady with amazing taste in decor--and she is entirely self made, is not at all what she appears and deserves a book of her own.There are faults,of course: Mrs. Smith Porter is so singular a catalyst for everything else that she is nearly supernatural, which I find a flaw--but a flaw I happily ignored the first time I read the book. It is a romance so nearly everything is neatly tied up. There is a secret aristocrat and a totally unnecessary ghost, both of which are supposed to remind you that you are in England, after all. I thought the book was well enough realized to not need these devices. The final solution for one character (Margo) seems a bit muddled, but I sailed right past in the first reading. Most of the men in the book are heavily flawed, or darn near perfect, which keeps this book light (and a bit more fun).Offsetting this quibbles, the writing is very well done-enough shading in the characters to keep them earth bound, more than a touch of satire in a perfectly politically correct ex-husband, lovely descriptions of the hotel and its furnishings, a couple of off hand references to history (Regency England, the Duchess of Windsor and even a mistress of King Charles I, I think it was)that give the book a little more grounding. Our heroines are mostly sensible and mostly realistic. If you simply want to enjoy a nice London Holiday, and take off your critical reading glasses, then make some tea, let the rain fall and lose yourself for an afternoon."},{"Title":"London Holiday","review":"Remember the old &quot;Calgon, take me away&quot; commercial? Well this is the book that the woman in the tub should have been reading. A light read, a fun fantasy, a holiday in itself. The author gets points for characterization; the landlady was fascinating and one of the husbands was so irritating that I wanted to smack him! Not to worry, there's a happy ending. A pleasant break from reality."},{"Title":"London Holiday","review":"The interior dialog of the four feminist Missouri heroines (Women's Room style) is in a slight Midwestern drawl, while the landlady's is in a British accent that does not ring true. The romping plot lures the reader over these linguistic bumps, and there is planty of irony and apparent parody to keep the reader amused. A ghost reassures us that the book is a complete fantasy, despite the earth-bound and grungy fates of the heroines hitherto. This is great (if somewhat irritating) entertainment."},{"Title":"London Holiday","review":"A VERY COMFORTABLE BOOK, YOU'LL END UP LIKING THESE PEOPLE.

Although it is best enjoyed by older children, my little two and a half year old daughter loves to hear it. I cry a little every time I read it. It is about a mother's journey through pregancy and the seasonal changes of the earth she experiences as she patiently waits to meet her new baby. The book speaks of the gravity and wonder of pregnancy like no other that I know of. It can't help but inspire love and intimacy between parents and children. The art is beautiful and stirring. Why this book is not better known is surely a mystery."},{"Title":"One More Time, Mama","review":"This book moves slowly along and is sometimes a labor, but my daughters never stirred nor lost interest. I would have to say that Alexander captured so perfectly the beauty and slow moving passage of time of pregnancy.

Previously it was necessary to have on hand several books, each covering one or at most two of these topics. While the primary audience for The Dog is undergraduate students in animal sciences programs and other students in professional programs, the book readily serves a broader audience of breeders, trainers, kennel operators, humane society personnel, and veterinarians, and it is entirely accessible to the general dog-owning public. Separate sections on the benefits and responsibilities of dog ownership and factors to consider in selecting a dog make the volume particularly valuable for shelter personnel, adoption counselors, and anyone considering acquiring a dog.Case combines academic credentials as a specialist in companion animal nutrition (her previous book is Canine and Feline Nutrition: A Resource for Companion Animal Professionals, 1995) with training and long experience as a behaviorist, dog trainer, and college educator. Not surprisingly, the chapters on nutrition are thorough yet concise, offering important information otherwise unavailable to the non-specialist interested in the nutritional needs of dogs and in industry practices of dog food formulation and production. The sections on behavior provide cogent explanations of developmental stages, communication signals, social interaction, the principles of learning, and training techniques, as well as an excellent overview of behavior problems. Case's balanced and incisive discussion of the dominance model of social interaction (and its misuses) is particularly welcome.At $34.95, the volume is priced between a college textbook (many of which now cost twice this price) and a trade book. In fact, we can be grateful to the Iowa State University Press for keeping the cost of this excellent volume within reach of the general public. Separate works on canine behavior, nutrition, and health would easily exceed the cost of this publication. The Dog is hardcover, beautifully illustrated with line drawings, and includes an extensive bibliography of recommended readings, a glossary, and an index. Volunteer adoption counselors at the Champaign County (IL) Humane Society are highly encouraged to read The Dog to expand their knowledge of topics frequently raised in the course of counseling adopters. A companion volume on cats is reportedly in the works, and we at CCHS eagerly await its publication. --Mary Stuart (Mary Stuart is a former member of the CCHS Board of Directors and has taught adoption counseling to shelter staff and volunteers for the past 10 years.)"},{"Title":"The Dog: Its Behaviour, Nutrition and Health","review":"I have no problems with this book.

The auther HAS DONE IT AGAIN!!!! Its impossible to get DETAILED information about Eastern bloc aircraft but this book changes that. Well written in a very balanced format with many evidence to prove what is often stated as an opinionated statements about Soviet aircrafts. The A-50, I was surprised to know was quite inadequate when it comes to comparison with Western AWACS counterpart. And I love the detail info about very little known Soviet Awacs like the Yak-44 which was a very promising AWAC for the Soviet Navy. REgarless, its a great book and with each book Im buying from Jeff, Im becoming more a hard core fan of his books. Amazon, keep up the good work!"},{"Title":"Man's Moral Nature: an Essay","review":"Bucke has an uncanny way of stating things so that, plain and simple, it just makes sense. As it is in essay form, it is broken up into short sections that make it much more digestible. The combination of these two aspects of presentation makes it not only an easy read, but also an enjoyable read -- it is extremely hard to put down once you pick it up. However, the reader must understand that this text is over a century old. Much of the science that Bucke uses as evidence for his theories is mostly accurate, but not as precise as by today's standards. Because of this, some of his arguments need to be reworked into a modern framework. Another effect of it being so old is that the sentential structure is not what today's reader is accustomed to. Long-winded sentences that backtrack on themselves over and over with prepositions and antecedents make it a grammatical labyrinth to navigate, but once one unwinds the logic and examines it, they find that his manner is not at all convoluted, but rather precise almost to a fault. I highly recommend this book to everyone regardless of age (given of course the intellectual capacity to understand it), creed, gender, or occupation. I especially recommend this book to any students of philosophy, psychology, or religion, whether that study take place at a university or in the privacy of one's own home. Anyone who seeks answers to questions such as \\"Where do feelings come from?\\" or \\"Is there an objective morality?\\" will find that reading Man's Moral Nature an exceptionally stimulating as well as life changing endeavor."},{"Title":"Open Door to Spanish: A Conversation Course for Beginners, Book 1 (2nd Edition)","review":"This book was the textbook for a continuing education course in Spanish that I was in.

The fact is that the ancient alchemists/spagyrists usually didn't have all that equipment, and it's probably smart to at least start off with simpler items before you invest a thousand dollars in this stuff. I think he would have done the art more justice if he had given lower-cost alternatives to the equipment in this book. Get this book, and supplement your reading with lots of material from Adam McLean's website, various alchemy forums and the Philosophers of Nature books if you have the money. Also question what all of them have to say, and compare, because all of them have their quirks."},{"Title":"The Practical Handbook of Plant Alchemy: An Herbalist's Guide to Preparing Medicinal Essences, Tinctures, and Elixirs","review":"Junius' Practical Handbook of Plant Alchemy is one of the finest and most complete books on working with plants from an alchemical perspective (or spagyrics) available today. It is filled with information and experiments that will take years if not lifetimes to exhaust. Extensive instructions take you through the process of making tinctures, plant stones, elixirs, the plant magistry of Paracelsus, and the Lesser or Minor Circulation for the preperation of elixirs. All of the work can be done with a few pieces of easily obtained laboratory equipment that can be used with inexpensive electric or gas heating sources. It is a book you will want two copies of - one for your bookshelf and the second for your laboratory. Required reading - and doing - for anyone serious about undertaking an alchemical journey."},{"Title":"The Practical Handbook of Plant Alchemy: An Herbalist's Guide to Preparing Medicinal Essences, Tinctures, and Elixirs","review":"Originally published in Italian in 1985, this classic work deals with the spyragic process, by which, through separation, purification and recombination, a spyragist (parachemist, or alchemist, take your pick) enhances and amplifies the essential and intrinsic effects of an herb. While incorporating quite a bit of ayurvedic philosophy, it's still a text firmly rooted in Western alchemical techniques and practice, and walks the aspiring student through the spyragic process, step by step, along with herbal planetary correspondence tables which go quite a bit beyond the over-simplified Cabbalistic correspondences of the current New Age stream of thought.The equipment specified for practice is, indeed, bona fide scientific apparati, which causes some concern on the part of other readers as to the expense. However, Dr. Junius was indeed a scientist, and head of research at various labs and technical institutes, and therefore chose to rely on precise, quality apparati. While there may be some applications of the spyragic processes detailed within that could be performed \\"on the cheap\\", by and large the higher the quality, precision and applicability of the instrument, the better the resultant spyragic. I would highly recommend that any aspiring spyragist (or alchemist) do a brief web search for discount laboratory equipment suppliers. There is an abundance out there, and for a few hundred dollars the enhanced results are definitely worth it."},{"Title":"The Practical Handbook of Plant Alchemy: An Herbalist's Guide to Preparing Medicinal Essences, Tinctures, and Elixirs","review":"With the rise of serious interest in alternative medicine andthe western occult, there is a need for a good, relativelyclear introduction to practical alchemy.

I found his writing reasonably clear and helpful in starting the work. He shows us what to do. After discussing the extraction of Philosophical Principles from plants, Junius generously shows us line drawings of assembled laboratory glassware that will accomplish the extraction task. He also opens the door to how the old alchemists thought about this part of the Great Work.Perhaps the most remarkable idea in the book is on page 34, where he says, an \\"acceptable analogy would depict the correspondence between proton (Sulfur), electron (mercury), and neutron (Salt)\\". The three Philosophical Principles - Sulfur, Mercury, and Salt - are of immeasurable importance to the alchemist, but is he telling us they are really the three major subatomic particles? I don't think the professor is sending us scrabbling to learn Feynman Diagrams, but all chemical substances are, at the most fundamental level, defined by their atomic structures. We are invited to compare the interactions of the subatomic with the development of medical essences, tinctures, and elixirs.Unlike most of the alchemists worth reading, Professor Junius is \\"Generous\\" - willing to tell us exactly what he means most of the time - and not one to write only in obtuse allegory. We learn things from Professor Junius, but the work does not have all the answers. Along the way we learn new questions that are yet unanswered. The book is a true handbook in that there are many tables, definitions of symbols, and both line drawings of traditional and modern laboratory equipment. I would recommend Junius to both the new-comer and the experienced practitioner."},{"Title":"The Practical Handbook of Plant Alchemy: An Herbalist's Guide to Preparing Medicinal Essences, Tinctures, and Elixirs","review":"This book systematically presents both the theory and philosophy of spagyrics and the corporeal application of said philosophy in an accesible proletarian manner, perfectly fit for the lay-seeker who isn't attuned to the sometimes involute terminology that attends dated alchemical manscripts. There are countless exserts from spagyric texts from such illustrious illumined exponents as Johannes Isaac Hallandus, Paracelsus, Basilius Valentinus (and more) which are generally followed by a delicatessen recapitulation by Manfred M. Junius, who breaks it down into manageable simple terms. Don't despair, for those tyros going into this book not knowing a lick of the ideas and axioms of the alchemical work will most unequivocally come out transmuted into knowledgable cognoscente of the natural science of Khem.

It discusses in plain language the ethical dilemmas we are all confronted by in our daily practice. I particularly appreciated the explanation of a client's vulnerability while in an altered state such as hypnosis or the deep relaxation produced by massage. The author also addresses the vulnerability of the therapist when faced with a client's issues that hook into the therapist's issues, creating a very murky situation indeed. The author assists us to provide appropriate loving care to our clients without violating boundaries."},{"Title":"Ethics of Caring: Honoring the Web of Life in Our Professional Healing Relationships","review":"Too often, ethical questions are considered dreary subjects best left to a committee. This book helps us see ethics as integrally related to how we do our work, and to our own personal growth. It also embraces a wide spectrum of consciousness, in a systematic way. It is particularly remarkable for its emphasis on non-ordinary states of consciousness, and how to handle these intense experiences when they occur in our work with clients (whether deliberately induced or occurring spontaneously). The Ethics of Caring will be especially valuable for trainee caregivers, supervisors, clients looking for the appropriate therapist, and any professionals who finds themselves, as we all do from time to time, out of our depth."},{"Title":"Ethics of Caring: Honoring the Web of Life in Our Professional Healing Relationships","review":"This book was required reading for my while I was studying to attain my Reiki Master's certificate.

I understand why my teacher has her students study this book because of the depth of some of the issues are addressed in such a clear fashion that there can be no question as to how to handle them. It even covered things that I would have never thought of and explained our role explicitly.

Nah it is just a sucky plot line."},{"Title":"Backshot","review":"This is a fast moving futuristic Marine Force Recon tale where poor politics puts people in positions that they shouldn't be in. We have corrupt political people trying to take down minor planetary heads of state for some reason (we're never really told why, all we know is that the head of the Intelligence section believes that Atlas if unified may try to take control of it's sector but not real proof is given). Fortunately the writers moved from their poor political piece to their strong suite, the military (for those not familiar both writers have a good military background). In this case, their foil is a Force Recon platoon that goes to find out if the Cucumber Patch is set up for military operations and if the leader needs to be killed.Rating wise, this is a 3.5 star book. It's fun and fast, but there's to much that isn't believable. First that the Force Recon troops are so much better than the regular Army troops. Will our Force Recon troops are very good at what they do, our Army also has some units that are very good at doing what they do. Having said that, all things remaining equal, the same should be true. Second, when the Force Recon troops hit the Cucumber Patch they're wearing their chameleon suites to enable them to blend into the background and not be seen. However since they have a nice big firefight with the local troops, the local troops should be able to figure out that they're not fighting troops from their world since the uniforms and weapons don't match anything from the other governments. Very poor job Mr.'s Sherman and Cragg. The final telling part is when the writers tell us that the Force Recon troops didn't do a decontamination prior to landing when the local authorities always require it. This is critical since it totally shows that the big government wasn't really concerned on hiding that they'd been there. Given that, why send in the Marines on a stealth mission.... Enough said. It's light, it's fun, since I said 3.5 stars and Amazon says only whole stars, I'll round it up because I was in the mood for a light fun book. That having been said, it could have just as easily been a 3 star book (maybe lower) if I wasn't in the mood for a light fun book."},{"Title":"Backshot","review":"I've read all the StarFIST novels, and enjoyed them very much. Although the members of the FIST are tough, ruthless, and brutal, in each novel they have fought on the right side, doing the right thing, overcome impossible odds, and made the universe a better place. So I was excited to see a new series set in the same universe. I picked the book up immediately.To my great dismay I discovered that this novel is about pretty much the opposite of everything I love about the StarFIST novels. There is courage, combat and gunfire, but it occurs in seemingly willful ignorance, at the behest of evil people, without examination, and with those we're intended to identify with kept constantly in the dark and seemingly unconcerned about the fact. It adds up to the most unsatisfying novel that I've read in a long time.In another novel the end would bring a smile to your face and frustration to your heart at having to wait for the next installment. Well there's no such frustration this time for this reader.Perhaps Mr. Sherman and Mr. Cragg are trying to accurately depict what happens in a Maring Force Recon unit. Perhaps they're trying to examine the realities and gray areas of war. Perhaps they're tired of glorifying combat and want to illustrate the torturous decisions that sometimes have to be made in the field, or the consequences of political machinations. I don't care. I want nothing to do with it.I don't read military science fiction in order to read about what's going on in the world right now. The world is depressing enough without it encroaching into my reading!I understand the writers' urge to tackle new material, to hit the military novel from a new angle. But this? This book angered and frustrated me so badly that I've thrown it in the garbage.This is one fan who is majorly disappointed in the choices two of his favorite authors have made in writing this novel.I am so angry. I went looking for their Web sites so I could write them angry email, to no avail. So here I am at 2:30 in the morning, venting my anger publically.The \\"heroes\\" of this novel blindly obey orders, they kill innocent people out of hand for expediency while explaining how \\"sorry\\" they are, they gleefully engage in cold-blooded murder and profess to eagerness towards the act, they subsequently indulge their sexual lust after completing that murder, and there is virtually no redeeming value to any of the people involved in these atrocities. Casual regret after the fact is not an excuse or justification that I am prepared to accept.I'll never read another book in this series, and I now have second thoughts about future entries in the StarFIST series as well."},{"Title":"Backshot","review":"I thought that this spinoff was not bad. It was a good read and brought in more politics and the moral complexities that occur within the Special Operations Community.I love the StarFist series and will continue to eagerly await the books, I may read the next book in this series.Again, a decent book but not up to par with the Starfist or even the Demontech series."},{"Title":"Backshot","review":"A brief suggestion: the techno-thriller parts of this book were presented much, much better in Tom Clancy's A Clear And Present Danger. John Ringo's A Hymn Before Battle had much better characters. Read, or re-read those books and avoid this stinker!Starting a new series, or a spin-off, the reader expects an entertaining story and interesting characters. After finishing the book they would want to read the sequel. Unfortunately this book fails on both counts: the story is a dreary parade of mistakes/errors AND the characters are shallow stereotypes.The Marines of Force Recon are the Good Guys, but are given only brief snapshots as the plot line wanders aimlessly. The characters given most coverage are the two Marines serving as a covert assassination team: Sergeant Gossner and Lance Corporal Bella Dawn. Gossner is a faceless cypher that is scared of the psycopathic Bella Dawn -- the only female sniper in the Marines, infamous for having castrated a drunk fellow Marine who groped her in a bar, and who is repeatedly described as having the eyes of death. Charming! Just the sort of character I want to follow the career of.... NOT!The plot, in BRIEF: evil head of intelligence agency wants to keep the farming planet Atlas disorganized. The heroic, cigar-smoking, family-loving General Lavager has a heavily-defended secret facility, the Cabbage Patch. The Marines are sent to raid it -- if it looks like it has Weapons of Mass Destruction they are to blow it up and signal the snipers to assassinate the heroic, cigar-smoking, family-loving General Lavager. They fight, he gets assassinated, and when the samples are analyzed they are: Super-Fertilizer. The whole mission was a mistake. But that is not depressing enough for the authors: they ghoulishly add that the Marines have accidentally brought an evil strain of soil bacteria on their shoes -- they have introduced, by accident, a biological weapon that will destroy the planetary economy which is based on agriculture.To quote a Dickens' character: Bah! Humbug!"},{"Title":"Backshot","review":"I have come to eagerly await the publication of each Starfist book, so I couldn't wait to read this spin-off series.Wow. I was so incredibly disappointed. The story plods, then bounces about and then rights itself only to plod again. Unlike the standard Starfist series, there is no cohesion of plot, the characters are unlikeable and two-dimensional and (as mentioned elsewhere) I found myself rooting AGAINST the protagonists.It was a genuine struggle to finish the book. I will not be reading anymore of this series and will desperately hope that the regular Starfist series maintains a higher level of quality."},{"Title":"Backshot","review":"I just recently got into the StaFist universe after discovering them at the local bookstore. I have obtained and read all the books in the serie's and they all are well written, fast paced, and fun reads.Backshot is a a great read, because your start right off in a mission with the Marine Force Recon helping the Confed Army. Your introduced immediatly to what their all about, what they do, how they do it, and how well they do it.This opening scene really sets the rest of the book up, your immediatly at home with the 4th Force recon and cant wait to turn the page and meet the rest of them as the story unfolds.New weapons, new craft, new worlds, new well developed characters, thrown into a multi-threaded mission of the highest security nature!! The story moves along as two teams from 4th Force Recon beset upon the Agricutural World of Atlas. You meet the President of the most powerful Nation State on this world, Jorge Lavager.The two teams of Marine Force Recon go about their missions in the fast past nature of the other Starfist books. Never a dull moment as they move toward achieving their separate objectives, and the authors treat you to some new twists and turns they hadnt done in the other books in the series.From the \\"Queen of Killers: Bella Dwan, to LT Tevedas and his team, to President Lavager, and the Central Intelligence Organization's vile, agenda driven, leaders, the story moves along, grabs ya by the collar and just wont let go.This is a welcome addition to the StarFist Universe and highly reccomended.Be Well,Trang"},{"Title":"Backshot","review":"I was really looking forward to this book coming out. Now I read it and thought I should have saved my money. This book is not written well at all. It is very choppy with several different shifts in area and they do not transition well at all. Also has much needless brutality. If the Force Recon Marines are so good at not being seen and are so skillfull why all the extra bodies around? This story line could have a lot of promise but if the rest of the line is written like this save your money."},{"Title":"Backshot","review":"Ok, some of you guys don't seem to take well to violence and gore. But the assumptions that are made here, are outright ridiculous! \\"... if they are so well at stalking around undiscovered, why all the useless corpses?\\" (or something like that).Ever had the thought, that no matter how stealthily you move, some sensor in this hyper-modern world could give you away? Even a keen set of eyes seeing a bush move that should not would be sufficient. And believe it or not: such types of missions belong to the mission spectrum of military units (political assasination, raids on research facilities that are percieved as a threat). We were trained at that, though of course nobody ever called the child by it's real name. Give it a thought!That aside I did not think that the book was so bad. In fact it was written quite realistic, more so than the previous books. The descriptions of gear and living circumstances of people were more detailed than ever. And I don't see much difference between scene shifts of Clancy and those two.All in all, a good book to enjoy, but if you are older then 13 and can't take some violence, hands off!"},{"Title":"Backshot","review":"While Sherman none of Shermans books that I have read could be noted for complex or overly shprising plots, this one reaches a new low. It starts with a survey of all the political charcters being introduced by way of annoying gluttous epicurean metaphors and just goes down hill. From there it is a pretty strightforward unfolding of what is described on the back cover."},{"Title":"Backshot","review":"I have to agree with many of the prior reviewers. I liked this book in some ways more than Starfist because it seemed more attuned to the real world. But the casual manner in which offhand murder is portrayed at all levels was too cavalier for me.As an aside, where are all the non-Americans in the Confederation? Have they all moved off Earth? Because they don't seem to inhabit the military, the government or the civil service. This is another element of the larger Starfist series which has long irked me and only compounded my irritation with this book.The authors could create a multi-layered complex world dealing with issues surrounding the integration of multiple cultures into a galactic military. What we have are thoughtless killers and stereotyped 20th Century Americans in space."},{"Title":"Backshot","review":"This book is well written and well thought out. While it doesn't immediately grab hold of the reader, the plot and characters are so well depicted that readers will find it hard to put down. This book shows that sometimes bad people have influence over good people and immoral events are the result of that. The plot brings to light that while it would be nice to live in an idealistic world, reality and human nature just won't allow for the existance of that world."},{"Title":"Backshot","review":"Some of the previous reviewers really got their knickers into a twist over this book. It's not the best Sherman & Cragg have put out, but it is a decent start for a new spinoff.I was not pleased to see good troops used for bad purposes, either, but it happens in the real world, too. It's most especially possible to use good troops for bad purposes if the troops and the missions are clandestine. That's why political oversight is such a good idea, in the real world.In this book the Force Recon unit is actually believable, if you are aware of the training and the capabilities of such units in real history. Although I would tend to think that Starfist Force Recon seems closer to SEAL or Delta Force in how it's being used, and how it seems to be trained. It also, unfortunately, seems to be well-versed in Spetsnaz tactics and techniques. Soviet Spetsnaz were trained to take lives and torture if necessary in order to fulfil their mission -- although borderline psychopaths, such as Bella Dawn, were weeded out of even Spetsnaz units.In a later book, it would be nice to see Force Recon find out how they had been misused in the case in the book, and then deal effectively and secretly with the jerks in the government who pulled the dirty stunts.I enjoyed this book, although I would have preferred it if the assassins had not succeeded.A couple of the previous reviewers had real problems with the strong woman types portrayed in the book. Mostly negatively. I have a book called \\"The Most Evil Women in History\\" and it is a hard read due to the horrible things some of these women did (ancient and modern) --- but Bella Dawn would not be the first woman to scare a grown man cold."},{"Title":"Backshot","review":"Backshot (2005) is the first military SF novel in the StarFIST: Force Recon series. Second Platoon, Fourth Force Recon Company, Fourth Fleet Marines, is tasked with the penetration of enemy positions to perform special missions. Recon platoons are smaller than initial strike force platoons, consisting of two sections, each with four squads with four men each. The Force Recon units are also equipped differently, having chameleon suits that provide virtual invisibility.In this novel, Sergeant Jak Daly and his squad are sent to the 104th Mobile Infantry Division, Confederation Army, on Silvasia to find and fix the headquarters of the Silvasian Liberation Army. The 104th had been seeking this headquarters for seven months, without success.The SLA is maneuvering within deep forest, but the Navy does not have any warships or sensors overhead to locate the enemy. Army recon units can locate the enemy, but always have to break contact or be defeated in place while the rest of the 104th is deploying to their position. By the time the main force arrives, the SLA headquarters has moved elsewhere.The commanding general calls for help from the marines. Although he doesn't expect the marines to be any more successful than his own troops, their failure will take some heat off his shoulders. He is totally surprised when the marine recon squad successfully completes its mission.In this story, after the return of Sergeant Daly and his troopers, the Second Platoon is tasked with an Ultra Secret Eyes Only operation by presidential special order. Something unusual is happening in the Union of Margelan on Atlas. The Central Intelligence Organization has reported signs of a secret weapons project being conducted at the \\"Cabbage Patch\\" facility and suggests an assassination of the President of the Union of Margelan.Later, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff recommends the drop of a full corps on the site. President Cynthia Chang-Sturdevant soon discards that suggestion with a little assistance from General Anders Aguinaldo, Chief of Staff of the Marine Corps, who had been involved in the disastrous Diamunde operation. The President decides to send in the marines-- i.e., the Second Platoon -- in a covert sneak and peek with a sniper backup plan.This story depicts J. Murchison Adams, CIO Director, as an aristocratic buffoon with a patrician attitude and a self-serving agenda. He promotes sycophants into the higher CIO ranks and demotes or retires dedicated professionals -- such as Anya Smiler -- from critical positions. He isn't interested in the truth, but in the power that well manipulated information can bring him.In contrast, President Jorge Liberec Lavager -- target in this assassination plan -- comes across as an honorable man. A former general who has raised the Union of Margelan to political prominence on Atlas, Lavager is concerned with the well being of the citizens of his nation as well as the future of his daughter. He has enemies, both within his own nation and among the other countries on the planet, especially South Solanum, but he is fairly patient until his troops and citizens begin dying.Like the original StarFIST series, this novel conveys some sense of the political processes that generate the orders for these troops. It tells of maneuvering among higher levels of the Confederation and particularly examines the degeneration of the Confederation CIO under a series of selfish and maladroit directors. It emphasizes the adverse effects of this incompetency upon the armed forces.Recommended for Sherman & Cragg fans and for anyone else who enjoys tales of corrupt officials, political maneuvering and special operations.-Arthur W. Jordin"},{"Title":"Backshot","review":"This is the first spinoff of the StarFIST series. Instead of involving FIST marines, it involves Recon marines. They are called into to investigate reports that an independent planet is developing a super weapon. If the claims are true, they are to destroy the development program and assassinate the leader of the planet. The problem is that the reports have been submitted by political hacks pursuing their own agenda. They are not above fabricating evidence to achieve that agenda. The result is tragedy.The story itself is well written and exciting. It deals with people who are good, people who are bad, people who are amoral, people who are idealists, people who are innocent and people who are guilty as sin. In short, take away the gee-whiz factor and background and it deals with people like we have in every day and age. That is always the best basis for a story.While this one was a bit depressing, I still wait to see what happens in the next instalment."},{"Title":"Backshot","review":"The book is a good read, though it does seem to lack some of the quality of the main StarFist series."},{"Title":"Backshot","review":"I have enjoyed all the \\"Starfist\\" books to this point. I don't know what the authors were thinking when they put \\"Force Recon\\" together, but it was frankly a flop. Maybe someone needed a paycheck or the publisher was pushing for something new. Whichever, this was a poor example of what the authors are capable of. Coming from a family of Marines and with friends still in the Corps, some currently deployed with real Force Recon units, I found this book less than pleasing. Maybe the next installment will be better."},{"Title":"Backshot","review":"i really liked the starfist series when it first started. but in this new book the marines are used to kill the leader of a memeber world of the confederation based on flimsey intelligence. for a government that has a secret prison planet where people are held with out trial or recoure called darkside. where a marine kills a helpless conferderaton citizen because the little he saw may expose the confederation's secret op against one of its own memeber worlds. i like stories to be more white than black maybe that's my sense of whats right, i just found this to be to dark for my tastes."},{"Title":"Backshot","review":"I hate to right a review like this one. I think that the original StarFIST series is top-notch. Too bad that this spin-off ain't.*sigh* Well, here goes:This story provides a few glimpses of the 'ole StarFIST magic.....but only fading glimpses.First off, I don't find the idea of a troop of Force Recon Marines all living in mortal fear of an \\"elfin-faced\\" woman to be believable. It's likely that some editor or other told the writers to include a 'strong woman' in their storyline. After all, the original StarFIST series is pretty much male-dominated. As is the combat military in the real world -- but hey: we've got a politically correct agenda to push here, don't 'cha know.........?We are told over and over again about Bella Dawn's (what a name) deadly eyes -- and about how terrifying those eyes are to all of the men. Well, you know the old saying: \\"If looks could kill.........\\"The female Confederation President comes across as a true disciple of Machiavelli. She exercises nearly absolute power without heart. Not as someone to be admired on *any* level. If she's supposed to be another example of the 'strong woman' archetype of the future: then I for one would rather remain mired in the politically-incorrect past.The third 'strong woman' that this novel holds up for our admiration is a professional cloak-and-dagger assassin. She gleefully cuts throats with razorblades for fun & thrills.You know -- I suppose that we are all supposed to conclude that being a \\"strong woman\\" entails being a violent psychopath of one sort or another.The only truly admirable character in this sad book is General Lavager. And he gets assassinated by Ms. Deadly Eyes. Just lovely.In one scene, a Force Recon Marine first apologizes to an innocent civilian truck driver, and then brutally murders him in cold blood. The Marine walks off saying \\"I really hated to do that to him.........\\" Later on, that same Marine is rewarded for his exemplary service to the Corps by being shipped off to officer training school.Another thing: it seems that the characters in these stories are constantly being threatened by their government with exile to Darkside (wherever that is) if they don't behave themselves. Sort of reminiscent of threatening children with the bogey man if they don't shut up and stay quiet.I dunno.....it sounds like the 'ol Confederation government is rotting from the head down like a fish does.Guys -- a word of advice. Take it for what it's worth to you: &lt;u>cater to your audience in these books&lt;/u>. Don't bow to the politically correct fads of this particular moment in history. The type of guys who are interested in reading books like the StarFIST series don't want to be force-fed with amoral post-modern meanderings. Let the politically correct anti-military crowd entertain their own kind. No matter what some snooty editor tells you that you ought to do.This type of tripe simply serves to offend your fan base."},{"Title":"Backshot","review":"I've read and enjoyed all the StarFIST novels. This is one of them in name only. It starts like a typical Starfist novel and even ties in some references to Charlie Bass and high level politicians but there the similarity ends.I never did figure out what the author's point was except perhaps to rake in some quick cash. The men of the FIST are hard working, hard fighting Marines who trace an honorable history back to the US Marines of the 19th & 20th century. These \\"Force Recon\\" marines are a ruthless bunch of screw-ups who could trace their ancestry back to the Waffen SS.Rather than root for them I soon found myself rooting for the opposition. They invade a fellow member of the confederation, screw-up their primary assignment, fail to get the info they were sent for, kill allied soldiers and airmen, murder helpless civilian prisoners, and assinate the leader of a confederation allied state.Someone should remind the authors that Recon is about getting accurate, timely, information. It's not about blowing things up.I really wasted my money on this book, I definitely won't be the first lemming off the cliff the next time these authors have something to peddle."},{"Title":"Backshot","review":"Actually, the book ticked me off.

The reason that it's so funny is because Steve, Goldie, and Hiccup say and do. 101 ways to Bug your Parents follows the journey of the young Steve \\"Sneeze\\" Wyatt as he desperately tries to get to the Invention Convention.This book isn't directly about bugging your parents so if readers are just looking for a list of ways to annoy their parents this wouldn't be the book for them and it will be a waste of time and money. This book is about a boy named Steve \\"Sneeze\\" Wyatt, who wants to become an inventor and gets invited to this invention convention, he needs $250 to get there. So he gets an idea. What if he sells a list of 101 ways to bug your parents? In addition to writing the list he also gets a side job of working at a golf place called Gadabout Golf. He fixes up the windmill and all the extra cool golf course stuff.When Steve brings in the \\"Nice Alarm\\" to school he tries it out on his best friend, Hiccup. Supposedly it wakes you up nicely with a pat on the shoulder but instead it karate chops Hiccup in the nose. Hiccup comes up and says My Nose but Wardlaw spelled it \\"By Dose,\\" because if you hold your nose and talk it sounds funny but different.

He loved to make inventions. He was assigned a project in summer school. It was to write a book. First he was going to write a biography about his favorite inventor. Then his friend HICCUP, the hypochondriac, said &quot;Why not write a book you can SELL to get money for the INVENTION CONVENTION?&quot; So, they thought of a title that the students would want to buy. When they start to write and sell the book, all the funny things start to happen.This book has a lot fun situations and many funny characters.

I couldn't get enough of it! The book features a tale of a young boy who will do anything to make his dream come true when his parents enable him to do it, but what he isn't aware of is that there are consiquinces: big consiquinces.I personally find this book a kind of adventure with a purpose. A big that kids can laugh at and relate to the main character's problems. The book for me, was a combination of adventure, as they ventured into different places with different purposes complete with different results, as well as a silly buisness tale, as the main character with his friend set up a foolproof way to test out his bugging skills on his parents while avoiding them becoming suspicious or irritated with his tests on them, and to sell books at school, trying to be unnoticed! These are a bit of. Spoilers, as warned in the title, but these are only the highlights. You still have the questions to ask: how does all this fit together? What are the details? What's the reason of all this? Just remember, these are just highlights of the story.At the end of the book, there areas a actual list of 101 one ways to bug your parents. (parents beware :). But it is just something that adds the fun up to the book. Hopefully children won't actually do it.Overall this is a fantastic and fun little book, in which I woudld highly suggest.

In his latest Holmes pastiche, John Hall takes this situation up again about a year after the events of \\"Scandal.\\" Irene Norton says she needs to consult Holmes, but vanishes on the way to 221B Baker Street. Apparently kidnapped and left to die, Norton is rescued by Holmes and Watson... but her account of the new situation that threatens the King and herself is highly unsatisfactory and probably pretty close to an outright lie. Instead of refusing to take the case, as Conan Doyle's consulting detective always did when faced with a client who refused to explain the real situation, Holmes and Watson wind up in Bohemia in what is pretty certain to be a wild-goose chase, and both Holmes and Watson bumble in some pretty inexplicable ways, with Watson coming perilously close to being a comical sidekick more than once. The quest to recover the famous letters and photo supposedly stolen from Irene Norton succeeds with ridiculous ease, considering the planless, gormless, painfully unintelligent approaches adopted by Holmes. And then the fact that Mrs. Norton lied suddenly assumes deadly importance.With the situation treated rather lightly by the author throughout, it was a jarring and unwelcome twist for this elderly and jaded reader when the adventure ended with the very abrupt deaths of five characters (two offstage), over only two pages, with one of the deceased certainly an innocent bystander!Not one of Hall's better efforts, this goes on the bottom of the stack with TRAVELS OF SHERLOCK HOLMES. It gets three stars only because of the fine period writing style in which the improbable adventure is recounted."},{"Title":"The God Project","review":"Even though this is not horror in the true sense of the word, The God Project holds the distinction of being the first book of its kind that I ever read. If you asked me how and why I became a horror fan, I would point to this novel and credit it with introducing me to the genre I have come to love above all others. Rereading The God Project now, the story still retains a lot of the qualities that gave birth to my fascination with dark fiction all those years ago. This was Saul's sixth published novel, and its medical science fiction theme seems original and well-developed here; later Saul novels built upon a similar plot structure have always seemed rather derivative and thus less compelling in comparison. The medical science Saul builds into this story seems rather impressive and believable, especially given that not too many writers were playing with DNA and genetic manipulation back in 1982. The medical science Saul describes may be utter baloney, but he makes it sound realistic and possible, and that is what makes this book succeed as well as it does.The basic story is not too complicated. Sally Montgomery refuses to believe that her perfectly healthy little girl's death is due to SIDS. Determined to find out what really killed her baby, she braves the disbelief and worry of her husband and mother to dig into what might have happened. Meanwhile, Lucy Corliss' son Randy mysteriously disappears. As a number of distraught parents of children either missing or dead come together, hints of a terrible conspiracy begin to emerge. All of the children have been secretly studied by a mysterious entity called CHILD, and Sally uses her computer knowledge to dig up some troubling data from the kids' medical files. Suspicion turns on the doctor who delivered all of the children in question, and the action and suspense builds steadily throughout the novel. The reader gets a good idea about what is going on well before the main characters figure everything out, but Saul makes sure the ending is not anticlimactic. There are several twists at the end, one of them masterfully disguised and thus unexpected.I believe this is one of John Saul's very best novels, but my inability to know the answer to a few questions in my mind keeps me from giving it a perfect rating. There was one element to the story that seemed important and quite fishy, but the story never went down the road I was looking for in that regard. The epilogue, while compelling, is a little rushed, and that is another tiny flaw that I take into account in designating my personal rating. Still, Saul caught be quite off-guard with one gotcha event toward the end, which really impressed me. Just like the children involved in the God Project, this novel is almost perfect. Anyone wanting to read Saul for the first time would do well to select this novel as his/her means of introduction."},{"Title":"The God Project","review":"If you like edge-of-your-seat thrillers, then this is thebook for you! I've read almost all of John Saul's books, butthis is the one that will haunt me forever! It's beenprobably 10 years since I first read it and I still getchills. Hardly any book has ever made me afraid to movewhen I'm finished, not to mention sleeping with the lighton! This one did!"},{"Title":"The God Project","review":"You either love John Saul's work or you hate it. The God Project has an incredible plot. Really, it's a brilliant, and original idea. The problem is that Saul's writing is a heavy as lead. His characters never really come to life and his female characters are just jokes. The pace is snail slow and I was even bored for a couple of chapters. The 3 stars are strictly for the sake of the plot."},{"Title":"The God Project","review":"This is one of Saul's first departures from his tried and true small town ghost story formula, and it works on all levels. This page turner is as fresh in its ideas today as when it was first written. Saul shows he is a master of suspense in this excellent novel. While Saul can be hit or miss with his novels, this one is a direct hit."},{"Title":"The God Project","review":"My mom borrowed this book from a friend (my mom never reads horror!) and when she visited for the weekend, she was busy reading it so she can finish it to loan it to me! I haven't read John Saul since high school (you don't need to know how many years ago that was!). My husband, again, was flabberghasted that I haven't read this one, so I picked it up and read it in a day and a half. WOW!This is creepy and it's a book that you can't put down since you want to know what happens next. I was up pretty late reading it ~~ I just had to know if my suspicions were correct (some of them were and some of them were so far off that I was surprised!). It's well-written and even though it was written over 20 years ago, the plot still remains current.Sally Montgomery refuses to believe her perfectly healthy baby girl died of SIDS and set off to find out the answers. She joins the ranks of another young mom whose son had disappeared. Together they found out something so horrorifying that it just didn't seem real ~~ but it was real and it was affecting the children in their town and in their families. They believed that there is a conspiracy going on but no one else believes them till it was too late.And it definitely will give you chills on your spines as Saul writes so plausibly here. It just preys on your worst nightmare ~~ and it's definitely a suspenseful read! It's a perfect read for anytime of the year, especially in the dog days of summer!8-14-05"},{"Title":"The God Project","review":"John Saul's writing is 100% compelling, and he creates some characters who you can really care about and some that your absolutely despise.One extreme difficulty I have though is the downbeat feeling that it's the evil that has control all along. A second extreme difficulty is the emphasis on children in so many of his books.However, if you start reading this book, chances are you'll finish it, even though you might not want to. This one deals with every parent's nightmare, the loss of a child, and the author does a great job at digging into the guilt feelings of all involved in such an event. And then comes the feeling of something wrong, too many coincidences as the bereaved mother's son exhibits strange abilities to heal, and also when his best friend, a strange boy with no other friends, mysteriously disappears.This is skillful writing, but readers should be aware that this is strong stuff and that bad things to happen to good people, especially in John Saul's novels."},{"Title":"The God Project","review":"I read this book back when I was about twelve years old. It has remained my all time favorite. I am just now purchasing it again so I can see if it was as good as I remember!"},{"Title":"The God Project","review":"THE GOD PROJECT is my first novel by John Saul, and I enjoyed it. I thought this novel had a very interesting plot involving genetic experimentation, that was way ahead of its time (this novel was originally written in the early 1980s). This book also had some great twists and turns toward the end, including a rather shocking ending that I did not expect. I read this novel in a few sittings.On the downside, I thought the characters in THE GOD PROJECT were kind of bland and cardboard. They never came alive for me, which is a problem that I have with much horror fiction. Also, certain characters are introduced in this novel and then seem to disappear; their fates are never resolved to the satisfaction of the reader.This book is also somewhat derivative of a Stephen King novel named FIRESTARTER, which came out a few years before this one. Saul has sometimes been accused of copying King's plots, and I think there is some merit to this accusation, based on what I have read here.In the end, THE GOD PROJECT is worth reading if you have a strong interest in horror fiction. Saul writes in a very straightforward, fast-paced style. I think this novel would probably have its strongest appeal among younger readers, since it is very easy to read. I wouldn't put Saul in the same category as Dean Koontz or Stephen King, but I think this novel is a good entertainment.I know many people who consider THE GOD PROJECT to be one of Saul's best novels, so perhaps this is a good starting point for someone who is new to his work."},{"Title":"The God Project","review":"I've read almost everything by John Saul that's available. Though this is one of his earlier books, I only recently found it. In usual Saul style, children are pivotal to the plot; it could be regarded as another government conspiracy novel, but it does have a style of it's own. It's short, and it's interesting from the first page...and the ending is quite satisfying. Not Saul's best, but still very good."},{"Title":"The God Project","review":"Okai. I am a huge John Saul fan and after reading a number of his books, I always favored Second Child, the first book I ever read by him, the most. And then, this book came along and REALLY had me deciding which one I liked better. It was fabulous! Most of John Saul's books are of released evil or multiple personalities or something of that nature. This one was not. The God Project was more like something that, after much research and some very intellegent (not to mention psychologically damaged) scientists and doctors can get together and &quot;toy&quot; with peoples' DNA and so forth...affecting future off spring, causing them to become....basically, super human. It was quite the chiller and I could not put it down. I was up all night reading and I could not put the book down until I had finished.

I don't want to compare him with Steven King because there is a unique differnce between his writing and Mr. Kings."},{"Title":"The God Project","review":"I DEDICATE THIS REVIEW TO YOU,THE READER..........Nigel..This story is another good page turner by a great writer.John Saul is a very consistent writer,more often than not,and he never fails to put a good idea to good use.(But this story falls short in alot of ways)I wonder why some of his books aren't made into movies.I guess it's because he is just not lucky.But I wouldn't be surprised if in the future some of his books are made into movies.In a way I don't think they should,simply because the movies which are made from books tend to spoil the story....When I first started reading this story a couple of days ago I found it interesting and anticipated alot of suspense and surprises to come.But I did get a surprise,though,it was not good as I anticipated it to be.At the beginning I would have rated it to be five stars,by the time I was in the middle,four stars,and after seeing the ending,three stars.The reason that I \\"Penalise\\" this books so much is simply because John Saul is one of the best writers out there and he never ceases to put a good idea to use.But in this book he shows how terrible and twisted he can disappoint us.But I am still giving him three stars for his attempt,and,well,because I am a fan.Most of the reviews on this page are well written,so I would save myself the trouble and not go into too much detail.The plot is sort of simple,or so it seems,but once you get engulfed in this story and things get elaborate,you get really confused.There are alot of things that are vaguely written and a couple of twists to keep the story going.Before I give you a summary of the plot,let me examine,briefly,the downfalls of this book:1)It is good of the author to use medical terms in this story,but he over does it.He uses words that alot of people wouldn't understand.He confuses us to the point that we would have to read a Medical book to understand what is going on.I mean,he could use medical words,but not to this extent where it is meaningless to the reader.He uses words like\\"introns\\",\\"extrons\\",just to name a few.Unless you understand some of these terms you would find somethings difficult to understand in this book.2)The second downfall in this book is that a couple other points are left hanging.For example there is a character called \\"Louse\\" in the story,who plays an important role,then suddenly,for no apparent reason,she is not mentioned again.3)The third downfall is that the writer tries to apparently save paper by crashing together everything in this story,it would,in my opinion,have been better for the story to be more lengthy,so as to explain the story more thorough.(There is one more fault I find in the story,which I would mention in the end).For now,let me examine the good things about the story.1)it shows how powerful a mother's love is,even to her dead child.2)It shows how science can be put to good use and bad use.3)Although the writer uses alot of scientific words which are hard to understand,the good thing is that he didn't make most of them up.He apparently did some research and used \\"real\\" medical words.4)It shows how disasters can bring together people.5)It also shows how we can die at anytime and how valuable life is....There are a couple of other imortant things about this book which I can't remember right now,but they are truly worth the troublesome read!Now,the plot,as briefly as I can:There is a particular hormone in the body which encourages the body to heal quickly after injury.But unfortunately not all of us have this hormone because the genes which are responsible for the hormone is not in our bodies.But it can be inserted into our bodies even before birth,by using the our mother's eggs and doing a couple of medical procedures.It is not totally sure how this hormone works,only,it is known that it helps you to heal quickly,I mean really quickly.And it also,as we see at the end of the book,it makes us nearly \\"immortal\\".There is an orgainsation know as \\"CHILD\\" which is a sort of cover up for a group of scientists who are studying this hormone and doing alot of illegal stuff with it,including kidnapping children,studying them.(The book does not say specifically whether the scientists planted the genes in these children or whether they inhereted it from their parents.The book sort of contradicts itself in certain parts when it comes to this.And it is not clear on this point.For this reason I have to give it three stars.Because no knowing something so important in a story tends to \\"kill\\" the plot and take away our good anticipation for a good ending)Another thing is known about this hormone, and that is that girls with it do not live past two years ....boys live alot longer...although it says ten years in the story,we see in the epilogue that two boys are past thirteen!So here goes the main plot:A woman loses here baby daughter,Julie.The doctor says that it is SIDS.But this woman,Sally,believes that her daughter did not die that way and there is some other explanation for her daughter's death.Then,a divorced couple loses their son.Some say he was kidnapped,others,he ran away.So,both mothers came together to find out what is going on.They soon discover other people who had similiar problems.With their baby daughters dying and their sons running away/kidnapped.After a while in the story a shocking secret emerges...And that secret is:All of these women saw the same gynocologist about contraception.(IUD).And soon after they were pregnant,after inserting this IUD.Some of them were also told that they were allergic to the pill.So,by force,they had to take the IUD.So,you see,none of these women wanted children,but they had them \\"accidently\\".Soon after they find out the truth about the above,they were trying to stop the bad guys from studying their children like lab rats,then the dying started to happen.Everybody was caught up in a terror beyond our imagination...Because the children of some of these women possessed this rare hormone,and they began to get out of control.Their mind began to become \\"warlike\\".And soon in the story we realize that \\"CHILD\\"(The orgainsation studying the children),was studying the children for Military purposes.Because with a unique ability to heal,such children(when fully grown),would be unstoppable in the battle field!The story may sound interesting,and interesting it is,but also disappointing...John Saul starts a fire and he fails to add fuel to it!There are a couple other fine points about this story,but I haven't got time to go into them all.I just covered the main ones..I hope you make the best of it...enjoy.........This review was written by Nigel"},{"Title":"The God Project","review":"Just like to say this book is titled &quot;All Fall Down&quot; in

It's my second favorite by this particular author(&quot;Creature&quot; is my fave). The book itself is much like all of Saul's previous works(close knit family gets into trouble within a small, close knit town), however, this one seems to jump out at the reader, mainly becuase of the advances in DNA technology in the recent years. The entire book is about the DNA reconstructuring of humans in the womb, and I personally feel that this isn't too far off in the real world.

I really think this novel was ahead of it's time w/ genetic experimentation & all the computer stuff.I wouldn't call it a typical horror (no super natural).

Saul takes you on a journey through a seemingly normal small town introducing you to a place ideal to raise young children, or so it seems. But beneath this pleasant village's facade lurks a dreadful secret. The book races along pulling the reader on an adventure into a vast conspiracy involving the innocent children.

Have you every read a book that you hated so much you felt good about skipping pages in it just for self-preservation? This was that book.

As a fan of all that is good and meaningful in horror novels (and in the genre as a whole) I cannot understand the world's obsession with the works of John Saul. His books read as though a group of disgruntled youths from a catholic school got together and attempted to piece together a novel, each writing one chapter without reading what the others had written. And yet his books succeed again and again. I cannot understand the reasons for this. I picked up this novel expecting the worst, and was not dissappointed. This book contains the elements readers can expect from any John Saul novel: compelling characters whose lives are systematically ruined by evil; plot twists that continue until halfway through the novel and then are dropped without any further explaination; frequent pseudo-intellectual references to religion (always involving children) that have nothing to do with the plot; and a frustrating, depressing ending that leaves many unanswered questions.A lot of people like John Saul, like I said. I don't know why. But I will say this, his books compel me to read them, even if they always end up frustrating me. I think this is because he is excellent at coming up with compelling ideas and a great premise that makes people want to read his books, but in the end, he just can't seem to carry his excellent ideas through to the end of the novel. I was unforgivably sarcastic when I first wrote this review, and so I'm changing it now. I just don't want anyone being horribly disappointed with this book, because it's got a very interesting premise, interesting characters, a solid plot up until about halfway through the novel, and then several twists that go nowhere and a depressing ending. The message of all his novels seems to be that it's hopeless to resist evil, you'll lose anyway, so sit back and watch it ruin the character's lives. I find this message insulting; I find pretty much all of John Saul's work insulting, but I will admit that he keeps me hooked throughout the book. It's like watching a car wreck-you know you shouldn't, but you feel so compelled... People won't agree with me, I know. And I respect you if you like John Saul, even though I don't agree with you. Everyone has a right to his or her opinion. I'm just trying to catch the people who WON'T like John Saul before they read a disappointing book. Fair enough?"},{"Title":"The God Project","review":"\\"The God Project\\" is an interesting and imaginative story in its genre; however, the low rating is for the Kindle edition. One's reading is jarred by the constant typographical errors (about one or two every three pages). If all the John Saul Kindle editions are like this one, forget it. For the price they're asking, one would expect a \\"cleaner\\" read."},{"Title":"The God Project","review":"In the quiet town of Eastbury, Mass, an infant girl dies in her crib - suddenly and with no explanation other than SIDS. A young boy who lives next door disappears shortly thereafter. Their parents search for answers, finding that their children have been unknowing participants of an undisclosed medical study. As they dig to uncover the truth, the surviving children come to realize that there is something very different about them.Sounds promising, right? It is. Unfortunately...There are 2 problems with \\"Project\\".The first is that the book isn't all that shocking. The mystery at the heart of the story - what \\"project\\" is actually going - just doesn't sound all that scary. Before we even reach that point, we've already been prepped for the idea that our epic unfolds in a world of evil scientists carrying out inhumane research which is too important to set aside. It's not a horrible reality to imagine for the story because the book is too thin, its characters too flat and its landscape too uncluttered to resemble any that we identify with our real world. John Saul's Boston looks like a facile facsimile of the real thing created only to be populated by his horrible conspiracy.Next - have you ever read a book so pedestrian that - regardless what the story was - you found it virtually impossible to avoid skimming? \\"The God Project\\" is just such a book - in fact you may have easily read about it before and just forgotten about it. Written in the early 1980's (and very dated by its reliance on computers), \\"Project\\" is likely not a book that today's readers would appreciate - it's probably not a book that readers would ever have appreciated as much as tolerated. Basic characters, uninvolving dialog and a dearth of tension barely keep you from skipping lines. Worse, since neither the characters nor the plotting are enough to solve the mystery underlying the plot, the author has to basically give away the mystery to the plot, shoring it up with the very time-worn plot mechanics done to death in other books (military, amoral corporations, unethical doctors, etc). The story has no flesh, never gives you the feeling that it could be occurring in a world such as our own, and therefore has no power to unsettle you - let alone scare you."},{"Title":"The God Project","review":"This is the first John Saul book I have read and if it is typical it will likely be the last. In most any good novel of this genre (many of the works of Preston and Child for example) there is one or perhaps two incongruities, things that just don't hang together. This novel is repleat with them. The reader is expected to suspend any knowledge of computer systems and software: A doctor wiping out scads of data from a central system in a few minutes. Anyone heard of off-site backups? A remote computer system undoubtedly with read-only access wiping out scads more data. Again, anyone heard of backups?The reader is expected to suspend any knowledge of bio-physics or even physics in general: An enzyme that can repair bodily tissue faster than gelignite ignited gasoline can burn it. Or that once completely suffocated, the person's brain starved of oxygen for many many minutes, circulatory system thereby shut down, this super enzyme finds its way throughout the body (without a circulatory system) and repairs everything all on its own. This is just incredible. It would be fine if we were told it all comes from some supernatural source, then maybe we could suspend the laws of physics, but normal metabolic activity. Sorry, too much to swallow.A car is blown up with no signs of the explosive device or accelerant. An entire estate is blown up/burned down but no seems to notice.Kids are invulnerable to any kind of harm, but doctors & parents around the country just never notice their kid spontaneously regenerating tissues in seconds. It goes on and on. Trying to read this book is a constant battle with the common-sense believable parts of your brain."},{"Title":"The God Project","review":"I picked-up this book for my daughter. It's required reading for honors English. I have to admit I was a bit biased before I even opened the book because I expected literature to be assigned, especially for an honors class. However, since the synopsis read Stephen King-ish I decided to give it a try.The first several chapters hooked me and I was compelled (how I hate this overused word) to read more. However, I quickly lost interest as the only emotion most of the characters felt was disdain...his brows furrowed deeply...the timbre of his voice changed...his voice rose dangerously...Sally was a mess and the author mulled over her same emotions over and over again. Maybe I'm impatient, mulling over emotions seems to be a common theme in a lot of books.I have to agree with some of the comments about the science and technology references. I don't know when the book was written, but as an IT professional I got a big kick out of the \\"cathode ray tube\\" reference. Also, as a Biologist (got the degree, but haven't worked in the field for ages), the mutations with a chemical gel seemed way off, but again, it is fiction.I hated the way Saul painted a scene, gets to the good part, and then jumps to another scene. I suppose the intent was to compel (here we go again!) the reader to read more. After a while it got quite annoying. I have to admit the end was not exactly what I expected, but it was not a shocker either. SPOLIER --->The least expected person being the villain is not new.&lt;---Overall the book read well, but really was not a mind blower. Being a New York Times bestseller was definitely surprising.

The problem with shining light on the truth is that many people can not handle the truth. The author is correct in describing the internal revenue code as being overly complicated, unfair and a tool used by politicians to engage in social restructuring. Entrenched politicians and other beneficiaries of the public dole are rightfully threatened by the information contained in Gross' book.Gross points out that virtually every tax is unjustifiable and he's right on the money. While Gross argues for trashing the current tax code and implementing a National Sales Tax I would have liked to read the author's view on dumping the tax code and replacing it with a voluntary contribution plan: a plan where participants donate what ever amount they desire to the Federal government. This voluntary donation system works for the non-profit sector there's no reason it wouldn't work for the government sector. Of course this suggestion flies against the established orthodoxy and there are many entrenched parties, benefitting greatly from the current status quo, who don't want to see their &quot;doxy&quot; threatened.Gross advocates dumping all federal, state and local income taxes to be replaced by a national sales tax. Bravo!!While nothing gets people more upset than having their hard earned income extorted from them in the form of taxes nothing gets the bureaucrats and beneficiaries of the current tax system more rankled than suggesting that their cash-cow be slaughtered. Its time to realize that one group's golden hen is another's hungry shark. It is time to take the country's &quot;income confiscating beast&quot; to the abattoir.Martin Gross has penned a masterpiece. It is a &quot;must-read&quot; book which should be placed next to Thomas Paine's &quot;Common Sense&quot;. Two thumbs up and a 5 star rating."},{"Title":"The Tax Racket: Government Extortion From A to Z","review":"A real eye opener into how messed up our current tax code is.

The more I read it, the more concerned and upset I get about where America is heading.As Gross so clearly points out, we have taxes EVERYWHERE.

Yes, of course it is. Yet, is Mr. Gross's book fair and equitable in its judgements? Of course it is not!Mr. Gross points to virtually every tax as unjustifiable but rarely points to the government services which these taxes purchase, such as education, the environment, labor protection and health and retirement services. Mr. Gross even argues against the Earned Income Tax Credit, which helps working class families live above poverty. He even argues for a worse tax system than the one we currently have: the National Sales Tax, which would be regressive and, thus, tax the earnings of a working class household at a lower rate than an affluent household.Of course, once again, our tax system is too complicated and unfair. Yet, the answer lies with a progressive income tax with as few deductions for the affluent as possible, not with a tax system, which Gross favors, which taxes the wealthy at a lower rate.Mr. Gross offers no real solutions in his work, only complaints. For those who want a simplistic view of our tax system with simplistic answers, this book is for you!"},{"Title":"Final Cut Express For Dummies","review":"If you're the typical Mac enthusiast, you've dabbled in all the i-Apps, including iMovie. If you're like me, you've outgrown iMovie for many of your video projects. If you're also like me, you haven't got the kind of cash to splurge on Final Cut Pro, which costs as much as one arm, one leg, and some spare skin from the other leg. Final Cut Express fills the gap, allowing the video editor who works exclusively with the DV format a way to afford a powerful editing program.The book being reviewed here, lest I forget and go off into Apple rapture, is Final Cut Express for Dummies. This book is a fine example of the For Dummies series of books from Wiley Publishing, Inc. Author Helmut Kobler is a well-known author on the subject of Final Cut Pro.The For Dummies series of books is usually the way to go when learning a new application, in my opinion. This book is no exception. It's simply written, and well laced with a practical writing style that works well when mired in the complexities of a software application like Final Cut Express. The humor is not as prevalent as in other For Dummies books, but that's well compensated for in the straightforward way the information is presented. I definitely feel that I could use Final Cut Express to edit and output my next training or wedding video.The book progresses in orderly and clearly written fashion, from importing, capturing and organizing your video media to editing basics and some more advanced techniques. Of special note is the nice way he discusses audio techniques within Final Cut Express. The first noticeable thing about any amateur video is the inadequate sound, and the author takes a fair amount of space helping you get the best audio tracks from your raw audio media.Another great section is the ten tips for becoming a better editor, and the ten tips for making your editing easier. Nothing is worse than reading the Final Cut manuals, but not having any practical experience to using them in a real world way. These two sections go a long way toward helping the novice editor get a leg up on real-world application of the techniques that can be used in Final Cut Express."},{"Title":"Highgrove: An Experiment in Organic Gardening and Farming","review":"HRH The Prince of Wales' position in life presents him with opportunities to speak and be listened to. Similarly, his name on the cover of this book, and the beautiful color photos that illustrate it, may get many readers to give it an initial browse. But what they'll find inside is much different than the guided tour of a garden they may be expecting (for that, they should check out HRH'sThe Garden at Highgrove2000). Instead, it's a manifesto of sorts -- a defiant defense of an organic approach to agriculture that is a polite but unmistakable challenge to agribusiness orthodoxy.The parts of this book I found most interesting were the first and last chapters, the parts penned by the Prince himself. They give a bit of his personal history with the Highgrove estate, his goals in converting from traditional to organic farming, and some of what he encountered after doing so. The last chapter, particularly, also lays out some of the lessons he's learned so far (circa 1993, of course) and how he believes it applies to the larger questions confronting agriculture in the UK.The earlier chapters in Mr. Clover's section are also interesting, focusing as they do on The Prince's decision to purchase Highgrove and some of his early steps in \\"going organic.\\" The latter chapters, unfortunately, become more and more weighted with questions of politics and policy, as he argues the economic and environmental benefits of organic farming. These chapters remind the reader how incredibly interventionist both the British government and the European Union are in matters that, in this country, are regarded as far more private. The restrictions on farmland use, especially, struck me as remarkably onerous. If that's what \\"Rio\\" and related international accords (still more Kyoto) bring in their wake, Americans should read and ponder these chapters very carefully before we assent to them ourselves.The Prince's chapters, especially, reminded me a lot of American agriculture writer Gene Logsdon, author ofLiving at Nature's Pace: Farming and the American Dreamamong other works. I hope, in fact, that HRH has read some of Mr. Logsdon's titles -- I think he'll find much in there to admire, and much to think about.On a stylistic level, I enjoy reading The Prince's prose -- I did inA Vision of Britain: A Personal View of Architectureand did so again here. His is an entertaining and very personal pen, articulate, reasonable, self-effacing, and not afraid to take a counter-cultural stand. I was disappointed to see that some of The Prince's recommendations also veered into the government-interventionist, but to that degree at least I suppose he is a product of his society and era.On the whole, this book may not convince large-scale farmers to abandon traditional agribusiness and convert to organic approaches, but I suspect that was not the authors' intent. If, however, it succeeds (or succeeded) in getting consumers and/or casual gardeners or farmers to think a bit more about where their food comes from and how it was produced, I would imagine the authors consider it a success. All that, and an entertaining, informative read too."},{"Title":"Zora Neale Hurston's Their Eyes Were Watching God: A Casebook (Casebooks in Contemporary Fiction)","review":"I first read Zora Neale Hurston's novel \\"Their Eyes were Watching God\\" (1937) several years ago for a book club and recently reread the work for another book group devoted to Black literature. The novel has become one of my favorites. For readers of this review who may be unfamiliar with the novel, \\"Their Eyes are Watching God\\" tells the story of a young woman, Janie Crawford, and her three marriages. Janie, a fair-complectioned African American woman with long, straight hair is raised by her grandmother in Georgia. At the age of 16, Janie has a sexual awakening, and her grandmother feels she must marry her off. The Grandmother arranges a marriage with a stuffy, elderly widower, Logan Killicks whom Janie cannot love. She leaves Killicks and without getting a divorce marries a man named Jodie Starks, enterprising and ambitious. Starks takes her to the famous African American town of Eatonville, Florida where he becomes prosperous. Although Starks and Janie are materially comfortable, Starks is chauvanistic, possessive, and mean spirited. The marriage is unhappy. When Starks dies, following brutally angry words between the couple, Janie marries again. Her third husband, Tea Cake, is much younger than Janie and owns little more than his guitar. The couple move to the Everglades, the \\"muck\\" where they work together in the fields and play and are erotically happy until a hurricane and a flood which results in Tea Cake's death. Janie returns to Eatonville and recounts her story to Pheobe, an old friend.After its initial publication in 1937, the book received little attention until its rediscovery by readers, including many with feminist orientations, in the late 1960s. The book has now become part of America's literary canon. In rereading and rethinking the book, (and it reviewing it here and on Amazon/UK) I realized how enigmatic this novel is and how it is susceptible to many different readings. One question, of course, is the relationship between what Hurston wrote and current varieties of feminism. There are many other interesting questions about the book, including Hurston's attitude towards traditional African American southern rural communities as as opposed to African American migration northward for jobs, education, and entrance into the middle class. There is an ever-present issue of sexuality and men and women. The book is about the growth of an individual and the nature of her relationship to the community. It is interesting to ask what the source is for the universal appeal of \\"Their Eyes were Watching God\\" when the story is set almost entirely among the group of rural Southern African Americans. There are ambiguities in the book about what Janie learns from her experience and about the extent to which she finds herself and her own voice. And while the book is beautifully written, the narration shifts voices from first to third person in a way that is seemingly inconsistent with Janie recounting her story to a friend.I love this book and wanted to explore some of the critical responses to the questions I had about it. Thus I read this \\"casebook\\" on \\"Their Eyes were Watching God\\" published in 2000 and edited by Cheryl Wall, a distinguished scholar who has edited the two Library of America volumes of Hurston's writings.Zora Neale Hurston : Novels and Stories : Jonah's Gourd Vine / Their Eyes Were Watching God / Moses, Man of the Mountain / Seraph on the Suwanee / Selected Stories (Library of America);Zora Neale Hurston : Folklore, Memoirs, and Other Writings : Mules and Men, Tell My Horse, Dust Tracks on a Road, Selected Articles (The Library of America, 75)The book consists of a valuable overview of Hurston's writing by Wall followed by a short autobiographical sketch of Hurston's and seven essays by as many scholars offering varying readings of and approaches to Hurston's text. Wall describes the essays as among the most thoughtful, widely-recognized academic studies of the book.The essays are fascinating to read and offer a variety of approaches. The authors have read the book closely, and the essays point out many details of the story that are important and easy to overlook, even after several readings. At times, some of the essays become overly pedantic and full of literary, post-modernist jargon. They still repaid the effort it took to read them. The overriding theme of the book is the structure of the novel and Hurston's unusual narrative form. Other issues are discussed as a function of the form of the work. A good deal of attention is paid to the nature of Janie's personal quest, the extent to which she succeeds, and about whether the result is a matter of finding one's voice or understanding one's experiences.The central essay in this collection is by Henry Louis Gates: \\"Zora Neale Hurston and the Speakerly Text\\". This is a lengthy, detailed study which examines Hurston's work and narrative by placing it in a continuum of other African American writers, including Frederick Douglass, Paul Laurence Dunbar, Sterling Brown, James Weldon Johnson, Jean Toomer, Richard Wright and Ralph Ellison. The essay includes a painstakingly detailed analysis of Hurston's text to show how it captures something both of an individual and a communal voice. Gates writes (p. 75)\\"The narrative voice Hurston created, and her legacy to Afro-American fiction is a lyrical and disembodied yet individual voice, from which emerges a singular longing and utterance, a transcendent, ultimately racial self, extending far beyond the merely individual. Hurston realized a resonant and authentic narrative voice that echoes and aspires to the status of the impersonality, anonymity, and authority of the black vernacular tradition, a nameless, selfless tradition, at once collective and compelling, true somehow to the unwritten text of a common blackness. For Hurston, the search for a telling form of language, indeed the search for a black literary language itself, defines the search for the self.\\"Gate's learned essay makes this volume worth reading; and the companion essays can be viewed as variations upon it. Of the remaining essays, I will comment on those I found most interesting. Mary Helen Washington's, \\"I love the way Janie Crawford Left her Husband\\" shows the author taking a second, more critical look at Janie and her achievement in attaining a sense of self and independence than Washington did in first encountering the book. In \\"The Politics of Fiction:Anthropology, and the Folk\\", Hazel Canby critcizes the novel and the stature it has attained by returning to the cricism of the book offered by African American male authors when the novel first was published. These authors found the book a retreat into stereotypes which failed to address the problems African Americans faced from racism and from life in the city. Carla Kaplan's essay \\"The erotics of talk: that oldest human longing\\" finds ambiguity in the sexual orientation of the novel, and of Janie's relationship to Pheobe, and a tension in the book between writing and experience.Most readers will find other approaches to the novel besides those presented in this volume. I found this volume helpful to my reading. As with any criticism, it does not substitute from the reader's engagement with the text for himself or herself. This book will be of obvious use to college students writing a paper on Hurston. It will also be valuable for those readers who are interested in broadening their understanding of this wonderful novel.Robin Friedman"},{"Title":"Superimmunity","review":"This book is packed with remarkable information, questionnaires, exercises and plentiful advice aimed at analyzing our own weeknesses and directing the healing energy within us toward the strengthening of our bodies and our souls.

And the loquacious writing style of the era makes it a little dated...However, this is a wonderful and powerful and profoundly inspiring book. Keep in mind, this book was written decades before spiritual, prayer-based healing was even a glimmer in the eyes of Deepak Chopra, Wayne Dyer and Larry Dossey.My favorite parts are the first-hand accounts from soldiers who have told about the times that their prayers were answered very specifically, quickly and sometimes miraculously.Great quotable quotes, too, such as page 343 where an airman talks about his life in the war. He tells the story of praying to God for specific physical needs, such as an overcoat for the cold weather. Within minutes, a friend asks him if he has any need for a nice overcoat. He writes, \\"My needs were supplied and no one was deprived!\\" This was at a war hospital in 1945 when such provisions were few and far between.On page 345, another soldier captured by the enemy tells the story of being lined up to be *shot* and how his prayers effected a change of heart from his executioners.Near the end of the book on page 409 is the story of a group of soldiers suffering from dehydration. They sat down to pray (individually) and in a moment, an artillery shell fell near the soldiers and injured no one, but opened up a hole in the ground from which water gushed! The soldiers recounted how they openly praised God.My #1 favorite part is where a chaplain talks about working with soldiers who suffer from addictions and his realization that all addictions are, at their root, merely a desire for love that has lost its way. That single statement alone has remained with me for many, many years."},{"Title":"Charles Dickens' Complete Works","review":"You can get a lot of the individual Dickens novels for free on Kindle, but if you want to have some of the lesser known books, this is an affordable option.

Interesting to encounter Dickens' idioms, which are mostly anachronistic but occasionally startlingly modern. Dickens' characters are flat and static, and his women in Pickwick are uniformly silly cardboard cutouts, but in other ways his writing is still a joy. The kindle edition is fine, notwithstanding the occasional editing error, but for the illustrations being too small to see properly.

But at 99 cents for the Complete Works of Dickens, how could it not be a worthwhile purchase?

Well organized and edited, every word The English Language's greatest author has written can be yours for under a buck. Extra material includes biographies, plays and stories written by others but based on his characters.... this is a book case worth of material.My only complaint is one I wish the Kindle Software Geeks would work out : This collection is so huge that an entire Dickens Novel (typically 800-900 pages hardcover) only represents 2-3% of the Download, so the reader has no idea where he is in the progress of the novel without flipping back and forth to the table of contents. It would be better if this collection could revert to the individual books once it is in the Kindle or if the Kindle's owner could label his own \\"first and last page\\" and then the Kindle could track the progress between those two points."},{"Title":"Charles Dickens' Complete Works","review":"When it says complete, it really means it. There were many things contained in this book that were new to me, along with the expected classics.

This is an exceptional work perfectly suited to the Kindle."},{"Title":"Charles Dickens' Complete Works","review":"This Delphi edition is a five star quality product, but the amount of supplemental material (in addition to the actual works by Dickens himself) sure eats up a lot of Kindle memory (about 50 MB). I want to read Dickens as well as Wilkie Collins, Thackeray, Scott, Trollope, Gaskell, Austen, the Brontes, and a great many more of these wonderful Delphi collections. And I want their complete works handily accessible on my Kindle, not archived. But these super-sized, mega-sets eat up a lot of Kindle memory, such that I have begun to begrudge the inclusion of so much that is not actually by the author.I do fully appreciate that this set DOES include so very much actually BY Dickens, and I ultimately purchased it intending to replace my previously purchased Dickens set. I quickly discovered, however, that the Delphi edition used more than twice as much Kindle memory as my previous set, and that much of this was expended on material not by Dickens which I could easily live without. I reluctantly returned it for a refund.The lesson I learned (or, more precisely, \\"re-learned\\") was that quantitatively larger is not necessarily qualitatively better. I am now quite content with my previous Dickens set which, sadly, I cannot recommend to you because it is no longer available. That being the case, since this Delphi edition DOES offer quality (as well as sheer quantity, Kindle memory utilization notwithstanding) this IS the best Dickens collection available at the present time. And priced at only $.99, it is a tremendous bargain.ADDENDUM: Since I wrote the above, the price has since risen."},{"Title":"Charles Dickens' Complete Works","review":"Who could fault, A Tale of Two Cities, The Pickwick Papers, David Copperfield, Oliver Twist, Nicholas Nickleby, Great Expectations, or A Christmas Carol?Not I, most assuredly.

Actually, all my Kindles since I own several and my husband own a couple too. I love having all Dickens' stuff to read. I can skip from short stories to books and read the Christmas stuff at Christmas time and then go back to whatever I was reading before. Everything looks nice and is easy to read and the table of contents works great. If you like Dickens you will really appreciate this collection. Dickens was hilarious at times and the short stories aren't much talked about but they are nice too."},{"Title":"Charles Dickens' Complete Works","review":"The Delphi edition of Dickens illustrates that when you get it right, e-books are invaluable. If you're a Dickens fan, this is a feast. Everything of Dickens that you ever wanted to read and probably some that you didn't is here. The Forster biography is one of the surprises that's included. This biography by one of Dickens' friends is worth the cost of the set. It's often difficult to find and expensive when you do. The illustrations are also a bonus, bringing additional life to the novels. This is one edition of Dickens that won't just have \\"shelf\\" life is my library. The Delphi edition is a delight for Dickens' fans and it will surely gain some new ones as well. Couldn't ask for more.

The inclusion of the illustrations is key to any Dickens reprint or collection, and this one has them all. I also have enjoyed reading the critical reviews by Dicken's contemporaries - not everyone was a fan.

I have read several of his novels, and I assumed they are all contained in this book. However, I had been unable to find them, since there is no list of them in the contents. There is one for his short stories and his plays; but none for his novellas, collaborative works, his plays, his non-fiction, the adaptations, criticisms or biographies--although clicking the GO TO button tells me they are all there. After much difficulty, however, I finally discovered where the book's table of contents was: It is right after the cover. I would have found it sooner, but at least on my PaperWhite Kindle you cannot click on the cover unless your search originates there! The only way I found was to GO TO the Beginning, then BACK UP several pages until--voila! We come to the table of contents! Why I can't just GO TO the table of contents is beyond me. Anyway, the content gets a 5, the access TO it gets a 1, so it averages out to a 3. Too bad!"},{"Title":"Charles Dickens' Complete Works","review":"Having all Dickens's works available, some to read for the first time, others to re-read is indeed a luxury especially for such a tiny outlay. Having just finished &#34;Edwin Drood&#34; with its interesting ending I have been reminded of the scope of the author's imagination and the dedication of others to his work. Perhaps it is mean of me to mention that most of the illustrations were placed laterally on the pages which requires turning the Kindle to view them.

I have browsed through all of it and now I have started to go through Dicken's works in chronological order. I don't see a method to do that within the works but I printed a list.

The contents are grouped as follows: The Novels, The Christmas Novellas, The Short Stories, The Christmas Short Stories, The Short Story Collections, The Collaborative Works, The Plays, The Poetry, and The Non-Fiction.I reached the active Table of Contents by going to Cover and then paging forward. All the titles have links. \\"Sketches By Boz\\" also has a link to each chapter, showing both a Roman numeral and the chapter's name. While I have not read everything, the edition appears to be well-formatted for the Kindle. The font is very nice, much nicer than the one in the edition I bought several months ago (which I just removed from my device). I love the wonderful, old illustrations in this collection, which are liberally sprinkled throughout; there are also some photos, such as one of Dickens' home, and some pictures of historical material, such as one at the beginning of The Pickwick Papers showing \\"A full original set of the 19 of 20 Parts, now highly prized as collectors' items.\\" I was delighted to keep coming across such surprises as I looked through the edition.

Italicized words are indicated by all-caps. Some few illustrations by Phiz & Co. are included, but don't get excited: resolution is poor. But one goes to hardcopy for illustrations, and since Kindle users are mainly keen on ease of reading (and searching, highlighting, note-taking), this seems to me the best of the complete Dickens offerings."},{"Title":"Charles Dickens' Complete Works","review":"There are definitely other good Dickens works collections for the Kindle. For example, I had bought the excellent collection from MobileReference before my Kindle even arrived. Where this Delphi collection excels, however, is in its completeness and in its somewhat more pleasing formatting (use of fonts and white space). The illustrations in this particular collection are a bonus, too. Another nice touch is the inclusion of photographs of places Dickens lived at different times during his life, photos of the covers of first editions and the serials in which the novels were first published, etc. I also like the brief introduction to each novel (it helps me decide whether I'm interested in reading some of the more obscure novels I've never read). These nice touches almost make this ebook take on the character of a handheld Dickens museum, in addition to a comprehensive collection of his works. Dickens is my favorite author, so I decided this wonderful collection was a \\"must have,\\" especially at $2.99! I've since bought Delphi collections for a few of my other favorite authors. I highly recommend them.It's also worth mentioning that Delphi has excellent customer service, if you contact them. One of the collections I bought recently had some minor formatting issues, and they sent me a corrected file by e-mail within about two or three days. I was very impressed and hope Delphi will be around to serve Kindle classics lovers for a long, long time."},{"Title":"Charles Dickens' Complete Works","review":"I wish every e-book is this well compiled. Tables of contents for the whole collection and every book, every book accompanied by an introduction and nice, classic looking illustrations. Pages are well laid-out. You don't always get this for books you buy at Amazon - e.g. James Michener's Caravan, costs 8 bucks, yet no table of contents, no pictures, no nothing. Once you start, you just continue linearly to the end, as you do with the old tape recorder (minus Fast Forward). I guess from now on I will pay attention to Delphi Classics."},{"Title":"Charles Dickens' Complete Works","review":"I think the reason there haven't been more reviews is a combination of most if not all of these titles can be obtained for free elsewhere, and the comprehensive list makes it mostly self explanatory. That's what this edition has. As someone said, there may have been a large number of grammar errors, as with the free versions, to some extent understandable, but I really don't see much of anything glaring now. What it really boils down to then I think is does the cost make it worthwhile?For only $3 (currently at least), you get all of his works, small yet visible illustrations, and the one click on the table of contents in a single file makes it all quite convenient. There is also some additional biographies at the end, as well as some commentary by Dickens that is probably difficult to find. If you're a Dickens fanatic, this is undoubtably worthwhile to avoid hunting down the free versions, which in my experience have a plethora of grammar errors and clunky format by comparison."},{"Title":"Charles Dickens' Complete Works","review":"This collection is so good as to be almost beyond words, and you get the original pics as well!

Impressive response from the publisher to make a nice product!Sorry, but this product does not deserve a 5-star rating. It is impressive the amount of material contained herein and some of the illustrations may be appealing. However, there are glaring misspelling, grammar, and formatting errors. Do you want a ton of material from this author all in one place for a low price with some nice illustrations? Then get this Delphi version.

In my view he is exceptional because I have merely ventured into about less than half his works, and I regard that as commendable.In summary, if you have Charles Dickens as a member of your heratige and family, the complete works in Kindle format is literally wonderful.

Can't recommend it enough.Charles Dickens writes in a style of capturing life on a daily basis. He studied people in various circumstances and gives a believable account of their reaction to events.

(Telling flaw in his argument: He feels the need to tell us that some of his friends are gay. Ok. But I bet he doesn't like to listen to their stories.)All polemics aside, I found this book fascinating. Its basic premise is that we can come to know more about perennial forms of desire by seeing how they are reflected, over and over, in imaginary works of art. It draws common themes from more than 3000 years of storytelling. As for Batman and Robin, they are fictional characters of course, so who knows if they are straight or gay. But as any half-decent reader or movie-goer knows, the meaning of a story will always depend upon the specific buttons it pushes in the person reading or viewing the work.For many of us, Batman and Robin certainly remind us of a certain kind of gay relationship, even if their homosexual behavior is not as explicit as Zeus and Ganymede's was. And that daddy/boy thing is not the only kind of homosexuality, as Dr. Lingiardi, a Jungian analyst, clearly points out.If any of this interests you, then read the book."},{"Title":"Men in Love : Male Homosexualities from Ganymede to Batman","review":"as a gay man navigating the worlds of both heart and mind i was very intrigued by the books title and subject matter. the book is written like a research paper on male homosexuality, which was unexpected but none the less very compelling. the detail accounts of historical figures, and mythical both are very intriguing and thought provoking. at times the data presented does drone on and you find your mind wondering, but then any comprehensive study can have this tendency. overall i found this book to be informative, intriguing and even uplifting.have and will recommend to others."},{"Title":"Men in Love : Male Homosexualities from Ganymede to Batman","review":"Very difficult to digest; not the topic, but the style of writing.

The action centers around the Gallery Umberto I in downtown Naples, a great,, glass-topped Victorian arcade where in the various run-down bars and darkened trattorias everything is for sale, from cigarettes to liquor and women. Though the setting is squalid, the transformation worked upon the main character by his location and his relationship with a local woman forced to sell her body because of the collapsed economy is both absorbing and moving. This book is much more than a \\"war novel,\\" it is a great piece of lyrical literature well-worth searching out. If you like Joseph Heller's \\"Catch-22\\" or Gore Vidal's World War II novel, \\"Williwaw,\\" or Kurt Vonnegutt's \\"Farehneheit 451,\\" try \\"The Gallery,\\" it is more lyrical (something in the style of Tennessee Williams) than any of those (good as they are).Unfortunately Burns' next book, \\"Lucifer with a Book,\\" was one of the most talked about novels of 1947 - because it dealt with the naughty goings-on at an all boys' prep school - not something America could handle in 1947. Burns was savagely attacked by the same critics who had praised him as a war novelist. Burns left for Europe and quickly drank himself to death, never taking his place along the Mailers, Vidals, Bellows and Capotes of his generation as he deserved. The detached, independant reader will find \\"The Gallery\\" a wonderful, surprise read."},{"Title":"The Gallery (F2071)","review":"The Galleria Umberto is an arcade of shops and caf&eacute;s at the center of Naples, Italy. In 1944, after the Allies had taken control of the country, everyone managed to make his or her way to this galleria: the Neapolitans to watch and to take advantage of the Americans; the Americans to get drunk, to find a trick or to think.In \\"The Gallery,\\" the narrator takes us on a tour of the galleria, showing us the sights, sounds and people who frequent the area. Each of the 9 stories gives the reader a glimpse in to the social and sexual practices of the American GI in 1944: from a censorship office run by an egomaniac to an Italian girl finding love in an America officer's club to a gay bar. These portraits are linked by the narrator's own experiences from Casablanca to Naples and his realization of what love and the war mean to him.This novel might be considered semi-autobiographical as John Horne Burns served during World War II and undoubtedly drew inspiration from his surroudings. For example, the portrait titled \\"The Leaf\\" takes place in a censorship office; Burns also served in a censorship office while in Italy. It is a wonderful book to read. My only gripe is that many of the characters speak Italian or French, and what they say is not translated. Perhaps this works to show what it may have been like for the American soldiers, most of whom went to Italy and the rest of Europe not knowing the languages. I would like to have known what was being said, though. (This last part may only reflect the copy I was reading. There may be translations in other copies.)"},{"Title":"The Gallery (F2071)","review":"This book is simply amazing and fabulous! I couldn't put it down. Literally Burns takes you right to occupied Italy in 1944 where allied soldiers are stationed in Naples (there are a few other settings such as Casablanca and North Africa.It revolves around an arcade or galleria. Here allied soldiers and Italians interact in illicit bars, brothels, cafeterias, and other establishments meant to cater to allied personnel. It tells a humorous and darker picture of the allied occupation. Burns is not afraid to call out what he thought were allied injustices throughout the novels. Rumors go around in literary circles that these short stories were actually Burns experiences as a G.I. but I digress.There's an international cast of military men and women as well as native Italians that revolves around their experiences in the Galleria. The narrator serves as the main character.SPOILER ALERT: These are my two favorite stories!My two favorite stories in the Galley were Momma and Queen Penicillin. These two stories were notable because of their frank, compassionate, and rather open portrayal of homosexuality.In Momma we're taken to an illicit gay bar where gay and lesbian servicemen and women gather to gossip and relax at risk to their own careers and freedom. If you read \\"Coming Out Under Fire\\" by Allan Berube and you'll understand the dangers of being gay and lesbian during World War II posed.Queen Penicillin was by far my favorite! It is really a short love story (although the romance is secondary to the overall plot). In it tells of a young GI noncom who falls in love with a prostitute and dates her only to contract Syphilis which results in his female companion fleeing north leaving him behind.The poor man is hospitalized in one of the infamous VD wards of allied field hospitals. Segregated and under guard by MP's the poor GI must learn to cope through invasive and humiliating medical procedures including getting an antibiotic shot every three hours for an entire week!The only one to pity on him is an effeminate homosexual medic; a fellow NCO who visits him tri-hourly to administer his shot. Towards the end of the story main character admits to feeling severely depressed and heartbroken to this medic who takes pity on him and reveals his love for him (once again at severe risk to his career). He manages to convince his fellow NCO that women hold nothing for him and that they have a future together as boyfriends. They arrange to meet for their first date when the main character is discharged from the ward. It was adorable! Although at the same time he gets roped into a black market Penicillin smuggling ring.This book is well worth the read. Shame it was Burns' only success."},{"Title":"The Gallery (F2071)","review":"Published in 1948, this novel provides an interesting view of life in wartime. Burns divides the book into 9 portraits and 8 promenades. Although not exclusively set in Naples, it is the Galleria Umberto which binds seemingly disparate characters together. The portraits each look at the life of 9 very different characters in August 1944 in Casablanca, Algiers and Naples. Five of the characters are American Servicemen, another portrait is of two American clergymen: a Catholic Priest and a Baptist Chaplain, and the other 3 of women: Louella, an American 40 year old Red Cross volunteer, Momma a Florentine woman who manages a gay bar in the Galleria Umberto and Guilia, a 19 year old intelligent young Neopolitan girl. Interspersed between these portraits, Burns uses a first person narrative of an American GI to comment in a more factual way the events of the time and the day to day activity. It is in these promenades that Burns highlights the distinct differences between the Americans and the Italians. Burns seventh promenade is especially revealing as he expresses some contempt for Americans' spirituality. \\"Our propaganda did everything but tell us Americans the truth: that we had most of the riches of the world but very little of its soul.\\" The two portraits I found most interesting were Guilia and the Momma as Burns explored the views of the Italians as they tried to survive the early occupation of the Allied Forces. An interesting and informative novel of war through the eyes of 10 characters."},{"Title":"The Gallery (F2071)","review":"The definitive appraisal of Horne Burns must be that written by the magnificent and irreplaceable Brigid Brophy, herself taken from this life (in her case by MS) long before her time - the Recording Angel sometimes makes some strange decisions about mortality. Brophy's essay on Horne Burns is available in the volume \\"Reads\\", most recently re-published as a (UK) parperback in 1989. Brophy's volume also will remind you of the greatness of Jean Genet and Ronald Firbank, in whose company Horne Burns emphatically belongs. \\"The Gallery\\" is brilliant. As Brophy puts it, \\" The ultimate irony at the end of all the perspectives of Horne Burns's imaginative world is a kind of bisexuality not between homo- and hetero-sexuality but between sexuality at large and death\\". It cannot be emphasized too strongly - Horne Burns is essential reading..."},{"Title":"The Gallery (F2071)","review":"First off, this is NOT a novel. It ia a series of vignettes or \\"Promenades\\" as the author styles them, related only by the fact that they occur in Allied-occupied Naples during WWII. Most of the vignettes involve alter egos of Burns himself. From the onset of the first vignette, where the GI has the shakes so bad that he drops the first three glasses of vermouth before he can manage to gulp the fourth down and start to control his tremulousness, there is no mistaking the fact that Burns himself is the basis for most of the main characters.No problem with this. Autobiographical fiction can be wonderful stuff. But this book just doesn't cut it, because the vignettes are so blasted BORING. Prime example,\\"The Leaf\\", where the reader plods on through over 50 pages and nothing happens save for the recounting of the petty tribulations of the mail censorship office. The one exception is a story where something tragic does occcur between two American clergy, one a Baptist one a Catholic. If all the stories were as psychologically acute as this one and as masterfully told, I would be giving this book 5 blazing stars. But they're not.Essentially, Burns mines the old Henry James theme of Americans losing their sense of exceptionalism in Europe. I kept being reminded of James's The Ambassadors in slapdash form.I think the only type of person who can probably fully appreciate this book are those, like William Zinsser, who wrote the intro to my copy of the book, who were there at the same place, same time and for whom it is \\"their\\" WWII.Otherwise, it makes for crashing dull reading."},{"Title":"Swinging the Machine: Modernity, Technology, and African American Culture Between the World Wars","review":"This book weaves together several important and somewhat familiar stories in a startlingly new and brilliant way. We know that music and dance exploded in powerful new forms in the 1930s. And we know the &quot;streamlined&quot; and &quot;futuristic&quot; themes of techno-optimism dominated other cultural expressions in the 1930s. And we know there was a current of &quot;techno-anxiety&quot; that expressed itself in everything from Chaplin films to the Frankfurt School. But Joel Dinerstein has shown that these phenomena intimately informed each other. We will never view early-20th century American culture the same way after this book. Buy it. Read it. Assign it to your students. It should win many major awards."},{"Title":"Swinging the Machine: Modernity, Technology, and African American Culture Between the World Wars","review":"Fabulous book. Dinerstein ties together architecture, tap dancing, West African drummers, the lindy hop, John Henry and Fred Astaire in this exploration of what he calls the \\"techno-dialogic\\" embedded in big band/swing music. He argues that African American artists put the industrial rhythms of the era in popular music. In this analysis, dancing to the big band wasn't just about entertainment, it was about using one's body to keep pace with the machine. Until you've read Dinerstein and considered how dance/movement/sound contribute to cultural change, you haven't understood American modernity."},{"Title":"The Lord's prayer (An Alice in bibleland storybook)","review":"&quot;The Lord's Prayer&quot; is a great book for children to learn to understand why people pray, how to pray, and what can happen when you pray.

Freak has his own dictionary. One of the main characters is Freak. Freak thinks he is always slaying dragons. This is unbelievable because he could never do something like that. Freak pretends he is going on journeys everytime he goes outside. This is also unbelievable because I don't think that a normal person would do that. This book showed me what it is like to be disabled. Freak makes Max think that he is getting a new body. Freak could't keep up with everybody else so Max put him on his shoulders when they went on quests together. Freak also choked on chop suey and had to be taken to the hospital.

First of all Max and Freak went to the tenements to return Loretta Lee's purse that they found in the sewer and then Loretta Lee calls Freak a \\"retard\\" which I think is out of line for an adult to say to a child. I also think that it is offensive to people that are like Freak. A couple days before that Killer Kane was in jail because he murdered his wife and then that night he broke out of jail then he broke into Max's house and kidnapped Max. Then Killer Kane took Max to the tenements. But in the book they call them the \\"New Testaments\\" and I am catholic and in catholic religion the New Testament is the Christian Bible and I find that offensive to my religion. This book is not just bad it is offensive. So anyways, a little bit later in the book Killer Kane ties up Max in a basement that is about to crash down. Then Loretta comes to try to save Max but then KIller Kane comes up behind her and chokes her almost to death.

This book is about two young boys, Max and Freak, who are neighbors. They meet each other and become friends at once. Together, they explore many strange, almost disturbing, fantasy worlds where they slay dragons and save princesses and all that junk. Freak then has to go to the hospital because his legs stop working and he has some problem with them. In my opinion that is my favorite part of this book, even though it sound cruel and almost evil, it's my favorite part because to me it shows the author did not care what the readers thought and put it in anyway.The main characters in this book are Maxwell Kane (sometimes called kicker or Maxi-Pad), Kevin (aka Freak), Grim (Max's grandfather), Gram (Max's grandmother), and Fair Gwen (Kevin's mom). Max is a very disturbed student in school with an odd imagination. He has many problems and he can't seem to cope with his life. I'm surprised he isn't suicidal because he seems to fit the description of a suicidal description. Both him and Kevin are very childish and very much alike except that Kevin has a brain to fill in his head and Max isn't a scrawny kid with leg braces. In my opinion, both Max and Freak need a psychiatrist. Grim and Gram are Max's parents, well actually his grandparent because his mom and dad are both either in jail or dead. Grim and Gram both raised Max and I don't think they did a very good job at it. Finally the fair Gwen is a caring mother who is beautiful , and Max apparently has a very, in my opinion, childish \\"crush\\" on her. I feel her part in this story is very insignificant because he rarely mentions her until the end when Freak dies. Rodman Philbrick should have spent more time developing these characters and I don't get a good sense of \\"who\\" they are.Do I recommend this book? NO! NO! NO! I can't really explain my hate for this book but I am not the only person who does hate this book so I am not alone. My class in sixth grade had to read this as a class projects and EVERYONE hated it. So that's something to think of before you decide to read this book. At times I felt like falling asleep and I found myself smashing my head against a desk because this book is so horrible. Some people who read this may think I'm just an insane kid but I really don't what a bunch of strangers think of me. I would describe this book as being bad, deficient, boring, stupid, appalling, horrible, and dreadful. This book is a fictional book and I think it should be banned from every continent in the entire world. i give this book a final rating of 0 out of 10 stars. Rodman Philbrick needs to get his writing going and stop writing such boring and childish book. Well, that's just one guys opinion..."},{"Title":"Freak The Mighty","review":"I'll start off by saying that Freak the Mighty is a horrible book. It has little plot. The whole book is basically a collection of short, very uninteresting events described from the eyes of a learning disabled 8th grader, Maxwell Kane, who has a passion for the word \\"butthead.\\" Max's dad is in prison for murder. There is also a boy named Kevin who has disabilities that keep him from growing any taller than two feet and walking. He has dreams of becoming a robot someday. Kevin is referred to as \\"Freak,\\" throughout the story. Freak rides around on Max's shoulders and together, they call themselves \\"Freak the mighty.\\" It is all very boring. Anyway, they pretend they are knights of King Arthur's round table and go around completing small and seemingly dangerous (but really not) adventures that they refer to as quests. Some of their \\"quests,\\" include walking to the hospital where Freak hopes to be fitted with his robot body someday, sneaking out of their houses at night to look for treasure in a drain, and Freak riding around on Max's shoulders in school. There are few, if any, interesting segments of the story. One of these includes a segment where Max has a scary incident with his father. Throughout the story, the history of both the boys' disrupted families is intermingled with their unexciting adventures that they share. In conclusion, Freak the Mighty is a boring, plotless, pointless book about two disabled 8th graders who go on uneventful adventures, I'm sorry, \\"quests\\". One of them hopes to become a robot someday. The other, well, he feels that he doesn't have a future. There are few, if any, bright spots to this story that is filled with bore and stupidity. So I highly recommend this book to everyone (under the age of 8)."},{"Title":"Freak The Mighty","review":"I have not even received this book yet and I can't get a hold of anyone who can tell me where it's at!!

It was so easy to follow and it made you never want to stop reading. Each chapter left you with so much suspense you just had to keep going. This book kept you so entertained with Kevin's King Arthur tales that you could actually picture them in your head. It felt like you were there. Max and Kevin were meant to be friends. They put their different lives together and ended up forming one of their own. It also taught me not to judge people by the outside but by what's in the inside. I would give this book 5 stars. I can't wait to read Max the Mighty. I'm sure it will be even more thrilling."},{"Title":"Freak The Mighty","review":"I think Freak the Mighty is a never-ending tale of adventures. I recently read the book \\"Just Ella\\" and nothing, I mean nothing can compare to that book, but Freak the Mighty was close. I thought it was hard to read out loud because of all the slang, run-ons, and other ways that the author used to write the story. I think that this book was funny when Max was walking to the hospital and an old man was mowing his lawn in his pajamas. Trust me you'll love this book! That's why I rate this book with four stars"},{"Title":"Freak The Mighty","review":"I really liked Freak the Mighty is because it was easy to understand. It sounded as though a 7th grader wrote it. I&#65533;m am hoping to be able to read Max the Mighty. My favorite part was when they found the purse and met Loretta &amp; Iggy. I really like Kevin because he got Max and him out of trouble. Max reminds me of my cousin David. I was really disturbed of what Kenny Kane did to Max&#65533;s Mom. This is a good book."},{"Title":"Freak The Mighty","review":"I think the book was okay because it was the type of book that you could learn about something. The character that I like was Tony D becuse the author made it seem like he was the cool person on the block. This book has taught me that you should live your life to the very end becuse you never will know until you go. The book can teel you alot about friendship and hope and that is why this book gets three stars. Some parts in the book I didn't like because it was either I didn't get it or I was shocked to hear it or read it. But overall this book was good and I would read it again. Just because I had to read it in class doesn't mean I wouldn't read anywhere else."},{"Title":"Freak The Mighty","review":"I like Freak the Mighty because; I got into the story and never wanted to stop reading it. It had a great story line. As a 12- year-old, books normally do not interest me, but with Freak the Mighty I actually got into it. It is about this little boy who is smart but crippled. His name is Kevin although everyone calls him Freak. Freak has a good friend named Maxwell. Everyone calls him Max. While Kevin is small and short, Max is just the opposite. Max is a Learning Disabled child. For most of his educational life, he was in a special school. Max is also very tall and large like his dad. Max and Freak go on adventures together. They call themselves Freak the Mighty. When they go on these adventures, they pretend they are in a n enchanted forest with dragons and that they need to cross moats. Pure fantasy right? Well, they also come across some adventures that they will never forget."},{"Title":"Freak The Mighty","review":"Freak the MightyI really liked Freak because he was smart and funny. I guess you would call that a smarteleck. He was also bossy. I thought he was funny because he always told Max what to do. I also liked the part when Max and Freak go on the adventure to get the treasure or purse. I also liked how they had to go in the sewer to get it. I also like when they return the purse to the owner, and the owner's end up knowing Max's dad."},{"Title":"Freak The Mighty","review":"My book review is called Freak the Mighty.

Philbricks two main characters in the book are Max and Kevin who are two special education children with different disabilities. The two boys dont have very many friends because they are rejected by most other kids. They become best freinds when they move near one another. Max is in Jr. High and an eighth grader who was forced to live with his grandparents. he has lots of common sense but when it comes to being book smart he is behind in that subject. When he was younger his father was convicted of murder. Before they told this I was wondering where was his parents because usually they are not in their childrens lives in stories like these. The other boy is Kevin who is a thirteen year old genius. He was born with a birth defect that keeps him the size of a small child. He is the boy named \\"Freak\\" in Freak the Mighty. The two boys put together can easily be called an opposite couple. The two form a friendship that is stronger than any other, it can be said that it is inseperable. All in all it was a good book that teaches you many lessons. One was that it doesn't matter what is on the outside but what is on the inside. I would recommend this to seventh grade and hight because kids of a younger age might not get some of the lessons. It is an eye opener book."},{"Title":"Freak The Mighty","review":"Freak the mighty is about a little kid who is disabled and he can't do anythging for himseldf and he meets this guy who is really big and is also an oiutcast.

Freak the Mighty tells a story about two boys, Freak and Max, who start life out not liking each other and then become the best of friends. Max is an extremely large kid who is not very smart, and Freak is a tiny kid who is extremely smart One day Freak decides he is sick of being small and wants to become big. Freak decides he is going to go to a lab at the hospital to get a bunch of tests for the size of his body so that they could fix the parts to fit his body. Freak is also aware of the risks he is taking. He is risking death or serious injuries.I found Freak the Mighty to be very funny, but found the end very sad. one part that was funny was when Freak and Max are going to go on a treasure hunt and need to wear black; Max doesn't have any black things and Freak gives him his mother's night gown. There were also a lot of quotes I liked in this book. For example I like where Max says, \\"I'm sure it will hurt.\\" Freak says, \\"So what, pain is just a state of mind. You can think your way out of anything, even pain.\\" I really liked this book and I would encourage anybody from ten and over to read it."},{"Title":"Freak The Mighty","review":"On a school day we had our regular 8th grade schedule and right after social studies class we went on to reading class, so then in reading class I decided to get a book from the class library , for class. Then I was a cover of a book named freak the mighty which called my attention so of course I checked out a book from the library and now that I finished the book here is my review.The authors name is Rodman Philbrick the book was published in 1993 but the modern version is more modern looking and doesn't look like a book from \`93'. I would recommend this book from grades 6th to 8th grade because it's a chapter book and also because of its storyline. The book is mainly about this kid who is all bored up in this neighborhood named max and then this little crippled kid who uses crutches' moves in across the street named Kevin aka freak moves across the street from max then it turned out that max and Kevin were old buddies from pre-k, then later on they talk and became best buds and concurred adventures like when freak rescued his friend max from his father who recently got out of jail and he only used a water gun to save his best bud. But yet sadly freak dies, but I'll let you guys figure out how he died. So yes I did really enjoy this book because it talks all about friendship and what a real friend is but yet one thing that I didn't like was that it was usually off topic instead of the author focusing only on one topic it was just all over the place. So I rate this book 4 stars out of 5 stars because of the authors off topic."},{"Title":"Freak The Mighty","review":"it was really good! it was so good that i cried at the end and trust me i dont cry very easily during a book or a movie!ps im a mix of max and freak im freaks size and maxs brain while my best friend is maxs size and freaks brain!"},{"Title":"Freak The Mighty","review":"\\"Nani gigantum humeris insidentes.\\" \\"A dwarf standing on the shoulders of a giant may see farther than a giant himself.\\"Well-written, climatic tale of two young outcasts, one freakishly tall (Kevin), the other suffering from Morquio's Syndrome (Max). Ironically, though committed to personal and intellectual growth, Max's body stagnates at toddler-size. As learning-disabled Kevin lifts Max to his shoulders, the two begin to adapt a similar worldview.Paralleling the tale of King Arthur and his knights of the round table, the two boys fight local evildoers and overcome forces much larger than seems plausible for two young boys.ALA Best Book for Young Adults & ALA Recommended Book for Reluctant Young Adult Readers"},{"Title":"Freak The Mighty","review":"Freak the Mighty is a very powerful book that teaches us all a lot of good lessons. The book is about friends named Kevin and Max who are also known as Freak the Mighty. These main characters are different from each other, but they still are very close friends. That is one main thing that I really liked about the book. It did a great job of showing the reader that friends come in all different sizes, intelligences, shapes or colors. What really matters in a friend is their personality and how they treat you and other people. Freak (Kevin) was very smart and sickly and Max (Mighty) was slow and huge, but they both saw past how different they were and became very close and amazing friends.I also liked how Max was not bad like his father. This shows that you can chose whoever you want to be even if your family is bad or you have a lot of issues in your life. A good quote that shows how your past can hurt who you are is \\"it's more than just the way Maxwell resembles him, Grim says that night in the kitchen, the boy is like him, we'd better watch out, you never know what he might do while we're sleeping.\\" (Page 3-4, paragraphs 5 and 1) But, then Max's grandmother really explains that our past or our family situation can't make us who we are when she says \\"And Gram right away shushes him and says don't ever say that, again, because little pictures have big ears.\\" (Page 4 paragraph 1)You can really choose your own path. I liked how Freak wasn't afraid of being who he was; he wasn't scared of talking smart. Freak wasn't afraid of anything and he kept trying to play even though he was very sick. He didn't let his sickness stop get in his way. Freak taught me that you should keep moving on even if you have disabilities.What I also liked about the book was that the words weren't that long or complicated. The chapters weren't that long; they were only about five to seven pages. This book is good for all ages, from younger children to older teens. It was a fast and easy book to read and I think anyone can relate to the characters. The book was not fake or unreal, so anyone can learn a lot from it. On pages 39-40, there is a quote that I really liked that shows how fun and witty the book is and how anyone can enjoy it. The quote says \\"We're Freak the Mighty, that's who we are we're nine feet tall, in case you hadn't noticed.\\" I would recommend anyone to read this book especially kids my age from 10 and up."},{"Title":"Freak The Mighty","review":"This is very good book for early middle schoolers. It teaches many life lessons, and it examines what it means to be different. It also desribes the power of friendship."},{"Title":"Freak The Mighty","review":"Max is an insecure, stupid giant of a boy with a murdered mother and a father in prison. He lives with his grandparents in the room in the basement. Thinking his too stupid to do anything, he spends most of his time down there, until he meets Kevin. Kevin is a four foot tall twelve year old genius, who spends most of his time memorizing dictionaries and building robots. Kevin is too small and Max is too stupid, but together they become Freak the Mighty, the unstoppable force.I was a little hesitant about starting this book. I think it was the title that threw me off. Freak the Mighty? What does that even mean? Also, the back of the book doesn't do it justice. But, on one of those many times I have skimmed over my bookshelf looking for something to read, I chose Freak the Mighty. I went into it very negatively, but I was instantly absorbed by the tone. I could easily picture a bumbling teenager writing it. The tone was very realistic, but that's not to say that the writing was bad. The grammar wasn't bad, and the sentence structure was good. I think it was the vocabulary. It was very simple and to the point, making it obvious that this boy either didn't know or couldn't spell more sophisticated words than good, cool, numb.This book was a great example of why you shouldn't judge a book by it's cover. Although I had very low expectations going into Freak the Mighty, I strongly suggest you read it."},{"Title":"Freak The Mighty","review":"I read this book for an education class and loved it! My 7th grade sister read it too. She wasn't excited about reading at first, but quickly decided she liked the book."},{"Title":"Freak The Mighty","review":"Conventional writing wisdom is that the first few lines of a story should grab the reader. Consider this opening paragraph:\\"I never had a brain until Freak came along and let me borrow his for a while, and that's the truth, the whole truth. The unvanquished truth, is how Freak would say it, and for a long time it was him who did the talking. Except I had a way of saying things with my fists and my feet even before we became Freak the Mighty, slaying dragons and fools and walking high above the world.\\"From there, Rodman Philbrick, the author, leads readers through a story of two boys who individually confront traumatic pasts as well as struggle day-to-day with their disabilities. Maxwell is a huge 7th grader who is diagnosed with a learning disability; his father killed his mother and is prematurely released on parole. Kevin is a genius dwarf with Morquio Syndrome; his father also abandoned him and his battle is against time and the limitations of his diseased body. Together they become an inseparable team.With Kevin riding high on his shoulders, Maxwell learns he not only can \\"slay dragons,\\" but defeat town bullies and overcome his fears about his father and school. Kevin finds an invaluable friend who loves and respects him.Philbrick weaves their stories together masterfully. I love the voices of the two characters, the layers of meaning, and how Philbrick brings us a story about friendship and acceptance, as well as about death and healing.

It is written by Rodman Philbrick. Freak the Mighty is a fiction novel. I really enjoyed reading this book, mainly because it was about two characters that I really thought were hilarious. This story receives four stars from me!This novel is about a very undersized, very intelligent crippled youngster. His name is Freak and he is a rather clever and humorous individual. Freak also has a friend name Max also known as \\"Mighty\\" in the book. Max is the exact opposite of Freak. He is a king sized individual and he is not a very bright character.Max doesn't have a regular family, unlike other kids his age, which is part of the reason he is set apart from others. Max's Dad is in jail and his mother's life was cut short a couple of years back. Now he lives with his grandparents (Grim and Gram). Mighty on the other hand has a regular family, yet chose to set him self apart. He stays in his room in the basement all day and never comes out, only for school.Max had moved to a different house recently and as he looked over to see his new neighbors moving into his old house, he saw a handicapped scrimpy looking boy playing with a little plane. It turned out to be Freak. Max and Freak became stupendous friends.Since Max was so oversized and Freak was so undersized they made a superior pair! Freak was so small he would get trampled by his fellow peers at school and around crowded areas but that all changed when Max showed up. Freak would sit up on Max's shoulders. Since Max was doing Freak a favor Max would show him some kindness back by sticking up for him when he got picked on.Together they would have the best times. They would hang out every day and they would fight crime. They would stand up for other folks because they knew how it felt to be picked on. They weren't always doing all good. They got into hot water a couple of times!My favorite character in this novel was Freak. He was an outcast before Max came, but when became friends I really saw the real side of him. He is a very ridiculous person and that's what makes him so hilarious. It also amazed me how intelligent he is.I think that this book would be great for all kids/students in middle school. This book has ideal word selection for middle schoolers. I would recommend this book to all teens and pre-teens. I absolutely adored this book and I think you would too!By Jason Stutts"},{"Title":"Freak The Mighty","review":"My book is called Freak the Mighty, written by Rodman Philbrick. This is a fiction novel, which I loved, mostly because it is fiction. This story receives five stars from me because of its great, eager to lead you on, feeling in the story.It is a story about a small, smart crippled kid, named Freak and a titanic, not so smart kid, named Max (nickname Mighty). Freak and Mighty have seen one another in peer school. Max\`s (Mighty) dad is in jail and his mom has passed away. He lives with his grandparents(Grim and Gram). Mighty stays in his room in the basement all day and comes out only for school. One day, while he is watching people move into his old house across the street, he sees a small,crippled boy playing with a flying plane. He remembered that this boy had light blonde hair from peer school and realized it was Freak. The plane got stuck in the tree and Max went to go lift up Freak to get the plane, but Freak was scared and ran inside saying, \\" I don't need help.\\" Max left to go back inside. The next day at school, Mighty went for extra help to read and his tutor was Freak. Everyday after school, they stayed to help Max with his reading. They became great friends. Freak would sit on Max's shoulders and they became one called Freak the Mighty. Together, they would fight crime and do good deeds.In my opinion, I think this book would be great for ages eleven and up.

The Mighty is a great book of inspiration and friendship."},{"Title":"Freak The Mighty","review":"Freak the Mighty was a really good book. I focused on it more then I normally do on book. In order for me to like a book I have to be interested in it. I wished they'd made a 2nd book, maybe it would be just about Max. I do not know though, I doubt it. Even though I would have liked a second book, this book is probably much better!"},{"Title":"Freak The Mighty","review":"Don't judge a book by it's cover is the message that comes through in this wonderful book for all ages. I highly recommend it - but be sure you have a box of kleenex nearby!"},{"Title":"Freak The Mighty","review":"We purchased this book for summer reading of the CRL for our son's age group. I read it before he did so I could ask him questions about or he could ask me questions. It turned out to be a book I did not want to put down. It was an easy read for the age group, but the message was well written, genuine and very emotional. I was also pleased to find the book had been made into a movie as well, which we purchased and enjoyed. The movie is called The Mighty. Not quite as good as the book, but an enjoyable family movie.I would recommend this book to anyone who has a child in the 10-14 year old range."},{"Title":"Freak The Mighty","review":"I read the book Freak The Mighty in my 6th grade reading class. I absolutely adored it. Kids in my classes hated books. But when our teacher would say would you like to read, everyone cheered. Freak The Mighty is a very touching book. I'm not going to give too much away, but I'll tell you a little about this 5-Star story...Ok, Maxwell Kane lives with his Grim and Gram (his grandparents). Max is incredibly big and looks exactly like his dad (Killer Kane). Max is in L.D (learning disabelity). This doesn't help him with his social life. Down the street the boy who was in Max's preschool class moves in with his beautiful mom \\"The Fair Gwen\\". After preschool, nobody saw him. He was known as \\"Freak\\". His real name is Kevin. Freak is an 8th grader now who has a disabelity and only looks like he is 4 years old. Max and Freak become best friends and are known as \\"Freak The Mighty\\". They go on quests together. Freak is Max's first real friend. When Killer Kane is up for parole, mischief begins. And then the worst part happens. When someone passes away, it seems like all hope is lost. But everything actually is ok. This story if funny, but it makes you really think.I really enjoyed the book and movie \\"Freak The Mighty\\". I hope and think you will too. I'm looking forward to reading \\"Max The Mighty\\"."},{"Title":"Freak The Mighty","review":"This was a book that I stumbled upon and I could not put it down.

In the story there are many miserable and sad moments, but also its mainly happy and cheerful moments.The story's main character is Max and is fixed upon how a teenager can get along with a little kid he had met for the first time in daycare, and how they solve problems of many kinds.

Freak, a little boy who has a growing issue moves next door to Mighty, a very tall and big kid. Freak has a growing problem meaning the insides of his body grow but his height doesn't grow at all, making it hard for him to walk around. These 2 boys call themselves Freak the Mighty because Freak rides on Mighty's shoulders and they pretend and imagine all sorts of things.I really enjoyed this book because it had me wanting to keep reading and was usually interesting. It shows how a big strong kid can get along with a weak short kid and have fun together. Both of the characters have different personalities making the book more exciting. Although I really enjoyed Freak The Mighty it also had some things I didn't like as much. Mighty, who has a father in jail for killing his mother, comes back and takes Mighty with him to run away. During the 2 chapters this took place I found myself not being very interested because of the little amount going on. Some parts of the book seemed slow-paced like when Freak and Mighty met one another. Someone who is into sad but adventurous books would enjoy Freak The Mighty, but someone who gets very connected and into books they read would have a hard time with the sad parts in this book. A message I think this book points out is that it doesn't matter how someone looks. It is about how someone is on the inside and not the out side. Rodman Philbrick has a unique style of writing. When the story is boring, he spices up the story by putting a sad event in making it more exciting. I recommend Freak The Mighty."},{"Title":"Freak The Mighty","review":"Freak The MightyBy Rodman PhilbrickReviewed by Kyle GehnrichIn the novel Freak the Mighty by Rodman Philbrick, Max and Kevin are two totally opposite people. But as they say, opposites attract. This book starts by telling you about Max. Max is a huge kid but as dumb as a rock. He has problems in school, kids are scared of his height, his dads in jail, and his mom is dead. You don't find out why his mom is dead and his dad in jail towards the end. Anyway Max lives with his grandparents and he pretty much locks himself away from the world by living in his basement.Kevin on the other hand is an extremely small kid because of his medical problems. Kevin is only 3 ft. tall, but he thinks like a genius. He can memorize every single word in the dictionary and can tell you everything about anything.They became great friends and went on many adventures. With Kevin on top of Max's shoulders they are unstoppable, they are Freak the Mighty. It seemed like nothing could go wrong for them. They were wrong. They let Max's dad out of jail as long as he stayed away from Max. A warning wasn't going to stop him from getting his son though. Max knows he can be in trouble. Unfortunately for you, I'm not going to tell you what happens to Max and his dad, or Kevin.I wasn't sure I was going to like the book the first time I picked it up. After I started reading it I couldn't put it down. I love how the author wrote it. Rodman Philbrick gave away the right amount of information at a time. Freak the Mighty is definitely one of my favorite books. Hopefully you will decide to read it too."},{"Title":"Freak The Mighty","review":"Maxwell and freak had lots of cool stuff happen to them, not always being good. this would be a good book for you if you like adventure thrill and comdy I hope you have fun reading Freak the Mighty!"},{"Title":"Freak The Mighty","review":"I reccomend people to read \\"Freak The Mighty\\" .

Brisk, pacing, and a little humor to carry us along.\\" Is what Booklist says about the exciting, suspenseful book Freak the Mighty. A book about a boy with Morqiou Syndrome and his over grown friend and their adventures slaying dragons, saving fair maidens and much, much more that has to do with mid-evil times. Though the book surly keeps you on your toes it also is a sad story of a boy that cannot do much for him-self, so having his new giant friend around was almost lifesaving for him. In my opinion, Freak the Mighty was not only written very well, the concept of the story was very interesting. It didn't take long for me to get into the story, which doesn't happen with most books.While reading the book I felt like I was really there and I could see what was happening. With every chapter it got harder and harder to put the book down and I could also feel the suspense more and more with every sentence. As things happened and more problems came about I realized that I wanted to keep reading just to see what happened next. Freak, the boy with Morquio Syndrome was so amazing with how much he knew and how much he actually could do regardless of his size. Max, the over sized boy, seemed to be the most laid back character in the book but he would have to be my favorite character. He reminded me a lot of myself in the idea that he had a lot of trouble with people and in school with his work because he was different and the fear of being laughed at and just being so different that it really took a toll on his learning.I liked everything about the book, the way it was set up and written, the characters and their personalities, and how everyone kind of tied together but didn't really know it. The author Rodman Philbrick, is very talented and had a very great idea with this book. He really brought out the meaning and ideas of the book through his writing which is what I think is what makes the book so hard to put down. From reading this book I learned a lot about Morquio Syndrome, which I never really knew anything about before I read the book. It taught me about how no matter what everyone is different and you need to just accept them for who they are and if we don't get to know each other instead of judging each other we are going to miss out on what could be a really great friend.The ending of the book is a surprise in one way and kind of predicted in another. In other words it was great unlike the endings of most books. I did have a few questions about the book like what is the exact reason Kevin dies and what could have been going through Max's mind that made him bust glass with his fist at the hospital. Other then that, I would recommend this book to everyone I know and I would love to read other books by Rodman Philbrick and see the movie The Mighty. In conclusion, Booklist wasn't lying when they made their comments on Freak the Mighty."},{"Title":"Freak The Mighty","review":"Freak the Mighty is an exciting and thrilling book. It involves two characters Max and Freak. Max is learning disabled and Freak has a growing disorder (meaning that he is very short). Together they call themselves, \\"Freak the Mighty.\\"Max's mom died when he was very little. Max's dad is in prison for the charge of killing someone. He is known as, \\"Killer Kane.\\" Now Max lives with his grandparents. Freak (Kevin), lives with his mother Gwen next door to Max. They spend time with each other every day going on adventures and sticking up for each other in bad situations. At school and other places, Freak rides on Max's back. Now that they are the best of friends, the kids don't make fun of Max as much anymore (except for Tony D.).Since Freak has a growing disorder, he is excited that he is going to get his new bionic body. Max is kind of worried, but Freak is determined that it is going to work.I won't spoil the rest of the book for you. You have to find out for yourself!"},{"Title":"Freak The Mighty","review":"Freak the mighty was touching and I really liked it. this book had a mixure of comedy and sorrow, but overall it is the best book I've read all this year. on a scale from 1-10, I'de give this book an 11 with three thumbs up!"},{"Title":"Freak The Mighty","review":"What happens when two handicapped children, one physically handicapped yet mentally endowed and one mentically handicapped yet physically endowed, become friends in a society where they are rejected? The answer is tales of adventure beyond one's wildest imagination. Freak, the dwarf genius, has the vocabulary of a doctorate linguist (this book provides a glossary in the back)and because of this he has no friends. Max, the slow yet Lenny-from-Of-Mice-and Men sized boy, is overly protected by his grandparents and is mocked at school for his handicap. They become neighbors and find they have more in common than meets the eye, such as family members who have former bonds. They get themselves involved in several impossible-to-solve adventures and from this learn that the most important things in life are love and companionship. Funny at times, tragic in moments, Freak the Mighty, by Rodman Philbrick, is one of the best recent books for high elementary and middle school students. A page-turner, excellent use of cliffhangers at the end of each chapter, this book should be read by any older child or young adolescent who feels smarter or slower, larger or smaller, different from his/her peers."},{"Title":"Freak The Mighty","review":"What a great story about 2 teenagers helping each other through a very difficult time. Funny, dramatic, thought-provoking, and wonderful! Also see the great movie of it, \\"The Mighty,\\" with Sharon Stone and Kieran Culkin. Super!"},{"Title":"Freak The Mighty","review":"In Freak the Mighty, two of the main characters are very different. One is extremely tall (7 feet tall) and not smart at all (Max Kane), and the other is really short (2 feet) and extremely smart (Kevin). Kevin is like a walking dictionary. He even carries a little dictionary with him. He loves King Arthur. Kevin takes Max on quest every day. \\"Slaying dragons and fools and walking high above the world.\\" That's what they do. Max carries Freak (Kevin) on his shoulder when they walk around. Some times they get into a little bit of trouble like picking fights with gangs. The good thing is they always get out of it even if they're stuck in a pond. This is a very good book. I would suggest it to anyone. I loved it the book is so detailed. When you read this book you feel like you are really there with them. You feel kike you're actually going on the quest with them. Like it's you doing all the stuff, not them. \\"Slaying dragons and fools and walking high above the world."},{"Title":"Freak The Mighty","review":"After spending only 2 hours reading this book, all i can say is WOW! This book is a real &quot;page turner&quot; and u may say it makes you burnin fer lernin. The author expresses the feelings of each character in great deal, and the best part is, the dialect and the narrative of the story is extremely easy to read and understand. It goes exactly how the average kid may be telling a friend about a story or thinking it in their minds. If you are hesitant on buying this book because you are worried you wont like it, think again cuz u definitely do NOT want to miss out on this one! I have read tons of books and this one turns out to be a real classic. Sure u can say Stephen Kings The Stand and The Shining were also excellent books, but this book is unique and one of a kind. It is a must get!"},{"Title":"Freak The Mighty","review":"I decided to read Freak the Mighty by Rodman Philbrick. Freak the Mighty chronicles the adventures of two boys in the eighth grade. The main character is Max, a strong kid who is diagnosed as \\"learning disabled\\" in school. The other main character is Kevin, or Freak. Kevin suffers from Morquio syndrome, which leaves him physically crippled. However, Kevin is incredibly smart. I thought this book did a terrific job at including the main characters in society. For example, together the boys get to do everything that any other child would get to do. The best example of this was when the boys go to see the fireworks. However, while they are there they are bullied by a boy named Tony D. Together, the boys escape the bully and they enjoy the fireworks as Max hoists Kevin up on his shoulders. Another example of the main characters inclusion comes from their school setting. At the start of the school year Kevin's mom asks that the two boys be in the same class. Her reasoning for this request is so that Max can help Kevin get around during the day. This is important because both of the boys are in a \\"regular\\" classroom. In fact, you could argue that Max is the one benefiting from inclusion because Kevin is in an advanced class. Throughout the book it becomes clear that Kevin's smarts rub off on Max, as Kevin encourages Max to do things like think and read. In the end Max is left to cope with Kevin's death. Max accomplishes this through telling the story of their adventures.Overall, I thought that this was a good book. I would definitely consider using it in my classroom. I would consider using it because as a Secondary Education teacher I could teach grades 7-12. I would especially use this book if I were teaching grades 7-8 because that is the age range of the main characters. I also like this book because it really shows off the special abilities of each boy, for example Kevin's smarts and Max's kind heart. I would think about using this book as an extra credit opportunity, and have the students write a short paper about how they think the two main characters helped each other throughout the book. I think this book does a great job of making students with disabilities feel like they belong in everyday society. I had a good time reading this book, and highly recommend it for use in seventh or eighth grade classes."},{"Title":"Freak The Mighty","review":"Freak the Mighty is a young adult novel that includes two protagonists that both have a type of disability. Max Kane is the son a of a convicted murderer who develops self-esteem issues and learning disabilities. He becomes best friends with a boy named Kevin, who like Max is also disabled. Kevin has Morquio Syndrome and resulting from it, he is plagued with physical disabilities, and he must use braces and crutches to move around. While both their disabilities are completely different; Max being labeled with learning and emotional disabilities and Kevin being labeled with a physical/Orthopedic/Other Health Impairment. Kevin and Max see themselves as normal boys trying to make the best of their middle-school days. Kevin or \\"Freak\\" as he's better known makes up for what Max lacks in terms of intelligence. On the other hand Max is a big guy who is very intimidating, but that's all he has going for him; until Kevin comes along and teaches him to read and write. Kevin basically acts as Max's brain. This book shows that kids with disabilities are just normal people too. Their lives are so much harder compared to those who don't have a disability. I would use this book in the classroom to show to students that you shouldn't let something like a disability hold you back from finding friendship, happiness, etc. Max and Kevin were seen as freaks by the rest of their peers and society, but they didn't see it that way. They worked together on their \\"quests\\" by focusing on their strengths and combining them ultimately form \\"Freak the Mighty\\". With Kevin's outstanding intellect and Max's uncanny physical strength, they feel as if almost nothing can stop them when they're together. However, when Kevin ultimately succumbs to his disorder and dies, it leaves Max weak and to the perils of depression. However, Max keeps Kevin in his heart and mind and remembers all the things he taught him and this leads him to believe in himself and have a positive outlook."},{"Title":"Freak The Mighty","review":"If you have not yet read this book, read it.

Even though we are not in the same situations as Kevin and Max, we still go throuh many of the challenges such as not feeling popular in front of our friends, or losing someone we really love.

The book is unclear what his specific disability is, however it is clear that he struggles with reading and he has attended the \\"LD class\\" for many years. There is a boy across the street that just moved in named Kevin that has a physical disability, but he is very intelligent. He is the same age that Max is. These two boys become great friends, and together they call themselves \\"Freak the Mighty.\\" Throughout the book the boys help each other with their disabilities and they help each other through many different struggles. Max puts Kevin on his shoulders a lot so that he can see and get from place to place. Kevin helps Max with his school work, and Max is eventually put into the regular education class full time. \\"Freak the Mighty\\" have a lot of exciting adventures together, and they help each other through many struggles.This book does a great job of explaining the challenges that students with disabilities can face. The students are put down and called names in this book by people in society and in school because of their disabilities. This is something that many students with disabilities do face. It is written from the point of view of Max, and it shows that he knows and understands a lot more than people give him credit for, even though he can't read very well. Even though this book shows how the students are put down, it does a great job of showing that this is wrong. I think this is a book that many students, those with disabilities as well as those without disabilities, can relate to.I feel that this book can be used in my classroom in a couple of different ways. I am a seventh grade learning support teacher. I think that this would be a great read-aloud book to use in my classroom as well as a great book for students to read. It is a very exciting and entertaining book that is hard to put down. I think the students would love to hear this book. The book is written in first person. It is an entertaining book to read. After the students have read or heard the book, I would then have the students compare their experiences in school to the characters' experiences in school. The boys in this book have a very exciting eighth grade year. It also shows how many students with reading disabilities and physical disabilities can be put down. I don't necessarily agree with how these students are treated in the book however I feel it does a great job of showing how disrespectful that can be. We can then have a discussion of what we can do as a school to make the environment better for all students."},{"Title":"Freak The Mighty","review":"I could not put this book down. I bought it for its description on Scholastic.com's teacher website and bought a whole class set for my 6th graders, sight unseen. I loved it. I started reading it and couldn't put it down. Maxwell has learning disabilities, Kevin has a terminal disease (that Maxwell doesn't know about) but is a genius. They create a special friendship based on mutual need.Spoiler alert:There are some scenes that parents of younger kids might get upset by. Maxwell is kidnapped by his father that has skipped parole, there are some scenes of attempted murder. Death and danger are themes in the book. This is not stopping me from using it with my 6th grade class, but other teachers may want to know about the thematic material in the book before using it in class. I do not think it is appropriate for elementary aged students."},{"Title":"Freak The Mighty","review":"Seems like all the required reading in my son's class is from the early 90s but nonetheless this is a good read and really shows the values friends van be."},{"Title":"Freak The Mighty","review":"This book is great for middle school and high school readers.

They quickly become friends and start to enjoy life.This book could have been written a little better.In the book they refer to a certain part of town as \\"The Testaments\\". I find this offensive due to my beliefs. I also didn't like that the book skipped around a lot. I would have liked more detail. Along with a little more action. Finally I say that there be more in the book, since it is a very short book.I gave this book three starts because of what I thought of it. To recap, the book was very short, I find some parts offensive, and there is a lot of skipping around. I would not recommend this book to a friend.

The item and the USB number are the same ."},{"Title":"Freak The Mighty","review":"Rodman Philbrick's ability to write interesting literature that appeals to young readers (especially teens) comes in handy with \\"Freak the Mighty.\\" This rather poignant and affecting novel follows the unlikely \\"Odd Couple\\"-like friendship between Max--who lives with his grandparents, and is an enourmous eighth grader on the slow side, yet has plenty of common sense, surrounded by his father's reputation as a convicted killer--and Kevin, dubbed \\"Freak\\"--a 13 year old genius plagued with a birth defect that keeps him the size of a six year old.Aside from being physically contradictory, Kevin's book smarts and well-read brilliancy seem the exact opposite of Max's poor grammar and lack of motivation. But almost phenomically, in a karma-like manner, the two become instant companions.Their \\"quests\\" in the \\"yonder\\" of the nighborhoods reveal some rather interesting characters. Speaking of which, Philbrick explores the qualities our narrator Max, and his buddy Kevin, without missing a detail.Being thirteen when I read this book, my thoughts allthroughout reading \\"Freak the Mighty\\" were, \\"How can some old guy know how WE talk, how WE think?\\" I was shocked at myself for crying when I had finished the final chapter.Together, Max and Kevin become \\"Freak the Mighty\\" with their un-cliched friendship and dependance upon one another.Philbrick's novel is wonderfully humanistic; there's just something so reassuring in the human race about the thought of the giant Max walking with the enthusiastic three-and-a-half foot Kevin hoisted onto his shoulders.Young readers will fall in love with \\"Freak the Mighty\\" for its realistic portrayal of a teenager, while adults will undoubtedly savor its humane touch."},{"Title":"Freak The Mighty","review":"This book has a wonderful plot.Here are the 2 characters that make the book so good: Maxwell Cane {Kicker},the main character with a heart of gold and Kevin{Freak},a boy whose has the body of a 5 year old but, has the mind of a genius and the insides of a nomal 13 year old {which cause trouble}. They are not the most likely pair but together they are Freak the Mighty with the right combination of brains (Freak) and brawn (Max). The pair go on many exciting adventures including a trip to Loretta and Iggy Lee's house. Iggy is the leader of the panheads, a motorcycle gang feared by everyone. Loretta is Iggy's girlfriend. Iggy and Loretta know the dreadful Kenny Kane who is in jail for strangling Max's mother (which explains why he lives with his grandparents). If I tell you any more I will spoil the book for you. But I will give you one hint. Kenny Kane is back. This is a exquisite book. My teacher read it out loud and my whole six grade class roared at the funny parts and really wanted a different ending. I think Max is someone to relate to and recommend this book highly to all kids who love reading and a great story. Be sure to check out the back of the book for Freak's dictionary."},{"Title":"Freak The Mighty","review":"Thirteen year old Max Kane has a major problem with self-esteem. But who wouldn't, given what he's been through?His mother is dead, murdered years before by his father, who is now serving time in prison. Max lives with his grandparents in a basement room, rarely emerging from his &quot;down under&quot; world because he thinks he's too huge and too stupid to function.When Kevin moves next door, though, Max's life begins to change. Kevin, also thirteen, has the body of a young child but the brain of a grownup. The two become friends and allies, combining their strengths and uniting as &quot;Freak the Mighty.&quot; Max has the muscle power, while Kevin has the imagination (and teaches Max to unlock his own). The two embark upon various hilarious and suspenseful adventures, culminating in a kidnapping and a daring rescue.The best part of the book, besides the terrific story of a friendship, is the writing style. Narrated by Max, the story reads like an eighth grade boy's monologue -- conversational, funny, and instantly appealing.This book is a real treasure."},{"Title":"Freak The Mighty","review":"Who's that big kid? And who is his tag along? This iswhat one might think if you first saw the two maincharacters in Freak the Mighty by Rodman Philbrick.Combined, these two become a marvelous team and takeon many challenges. Maxwell, the large boy, and Kevin,the smaller of the two, are both different fromeveryone else and from each other, yet they canunderstand each other like no one else can. Freak theMighty explores the concept of overcomingdifferences and using your imagination to go placesyou have never been. The author takes you for a walkin someone's shoes filled with many emotions, yetleaves you satisfied with the ending.The story is set in a small town city where you cannothide much from anyone. Maxwell, Freak, is considerslow by other people's standards until Kevin movesnext door. The author does a nice job of developingthe characters in a way that the reader becomesattached and is curious to read on. Maxwell helpsfreak learn how to do more than what he actually cando. Kevin is smart and gives Maxwell and the readermany things to think about. \\"Remembering is just aninvention of the mind\\" (Philback 141,) Kevin says toMaxwell one afternoon.The plot is filled with many twists and turns. Oneday they are taking a calm quest to the hospital whereKevin goes and the next they are running for theirlives from the bullies. These turns help add to theemotions and feelings that a reader feels. It is hardto predict what is going to happen from one section tothe next. There are many different conflicts thatkeep it interesting and exciting. The conflict isoften hidden amongst the fun the two boys are havingtogether, which makes for a less harsh read. At otherpoints the conflict is illuminated by traumatizing andscary events. One such time when the conflicted isilluminated is when they are returning a purse over inthe not so good area of town and it turns ugly.If you like Of Mice and Men, by John Steinbeck, Ibelieve that you will like this book as well. In bothof these books, there is an unconditional friendship,no matter how different the two sets of friends arefrom each other. This book is geared to the youngadult age range. It is a book that can be dealt withat different levels. One person may not get the samething out of it as another, but they will still havesomething to take from it.I would recommend this book because of its lessons itteaches and the way it is presented. The lessons arebrought out through example and help the reader tounderstand what is going on. I also enjoyed theadventure Kevin and Maxwell discovered. I was amazedat how the two different kinds of people could find acommon ground and almost become one person. Theydevelop a relationship that is different, yet one tobe envious of.Freak the Mighty by Rodman Philbrick is a book thatyou should add to your list. Maybe you will learnsomething or maybe you will just admire the book forwhat it is worth. Read with an open mind and your mindmight be opened to a new vision of how you look atpeople."},{"Title":"Freak The Mighty","review":"This book is about a boy who is considered extremely large and dumb. He becomes best friends with a boy who is considered extremely small and smart. The large boy is named Mighty, and the small boy is named Freak.There are two main problems in this story. The first is that since Freak is so small, he is dying because his internal organs are outgrowing the rest of his body. The other is that Mighty had previously witnessed his father murder his mother, and very soon his father will be getting out of jail.This is a really groovy book because it is a &quot;page turner.&quot; The author gives such a clear, descriptive image of each character that you can almost taste their personalities in your mouth. Freak is so smart, he even writes his own dictionary.It had a sad ending, but that doesn't change how much I loved the book. I recommend you read this awesome book and if you don't, you're missing out on a good memory."},{"Title":"Freak The Mighty","review":"My daughter's English teacher suggested this book for the seventh grade students. I was very curious and as usual tried to peek into my daughter's books claiming that I wanted to help; after reading the first chapter, I was completely hooked.As marvelous as the messages of this novel was, I was thrilled to see my child engage with the story as much as I did. \\"Freak the mighty\\" is a tale of friendship and acceptance between two friends Kevin and Max. The story is very profound but told in a very simple way that will captivate young readers, and pose many questions about the meaning of life, the finality of death, the value of true friendship and survival.No review will be as good as reading the novel."},{"Title":"Freak The Mighty","review":"Freak the Mighty is a great book about courage and friendship.

It has been a struggle to get him to read anything other than the covers to the next PS3 gangster/ mafia blue ray game.I purchased this book on a lark that maybe he might read something about an odd friendship, seeing as he is forever dragging home misfit types to befriend. When the book arrived he saw it and his face lit up,while yelping \\"this is the book I told you about\\", my heart sank thinking I had wasted my money, he had already read it.Promptly he took the book upstairs to his room and didn't put it down until it was finished. It has got to be interesting and well written. Best of all it actually proved to be more powerful and captivating to a fifteen year old than a PS3 game.Now my son has asked me if there are anymore books by the same author, smiling I answered \\"of course my boy of course\\""},{"Title":"Freak The Mighty","review":"I never thought i'd become interested in something by readong only a little about it. Rodman Philbrick's Freak The Mighty sparked an interest in a disease that i have never heard about before, Morquio Syndrome. Rodamn Philbrick takes us through a young crippled by's sophisticated mind and his big, not-so-smart friend's life. The story is told by Max, a kid who has been plagued by the criminal past of his father. He is constantly poked fun at for his size and his lack of book smarts, but he takes us through the adventures of Freak The Mighty as if we were there, or at least wishing to be. His friendship with Freak is unforgetable. The two boys never give up on each other and they are constantly looking after one another in whatever way they can.Freak's amusing, sarcastic comments are what kept me interested in this story. He subtly pokes fun of Max's stupidity throughout the book, but he's not rude about it. Freak does it in a way like two best friends would, wven though Max can never figure out what Freak is saying. The companionship between the two characters is much like real life in the sense that the bigger one takes care of the small one and the smaller one teaches the bigger one. There's a lot more to the story that just a crippled kid and a stupid kid; and the minds on both boys are there to take us through it.Max lives at home with Gram and Grim, his grandparents. His father is in jail for killing his wife. Max finds it hard to consider his father a killer, but he doesn't attempt to think otherwise. He is constantly trying not to think about that night his mother was killed, a night of which he has only vague memories of. Gram is a sweet, old women who doesn't quite understand Max, but she remains sweet to him. Grim is the typical \\"grouchy\\" man. His grouchiness, however, brings a certain humor to the story and helped me to get a better feel for life at Max's house.Freak, who is Max's next door neighbor, lives only with his mother. He calls her \\"The Fair Gwen.\\" The Fair Gwen struggles to keep her curious, brilliant, and unfortunately crippled son under control. He tends to want to go out on his own and discover the world, but she can't always be there to assist him along the way. However, Max is there to take Freak wherever he wants to go whenever he wants. THat's where the name \\"Freak The Mighty\\" comes from. Freak decided to blend his and Max's best known qualities together to from the greatest realistic hero we've ever known.In the story there is a bully around town who everyone calls Blade because he went to juvy for stabbing someone. Max is three times his size, yet he's scared to death of him. Freak pushes Max to stand up for himself and they go through some pretty interesting things because of Blade. Blade is a typical everyday bully until Freak The Mighty defeats him. Suddenly he becomes a little jerk who's not so scary after all.Throughout the course of the book there are several interesting characters, one of which is Max's father. WHen Max's father comes out of prison, he takes Max through a whole different set of adventures. When it is least expected, Freak saves the day. I'll leave it to the reader to find out how.The most important theme is about loyalty to friends. Max never doubts Freak and never lets him down. Freak never doubts Mac and always has the greatest confidence in his performance. This story sparks great anticipation in the reader, you never know what's next, or how the boys will handle what is presented to them. The two boys are constantly in their own world, learning new things, going new places and doing things they'd never be able to do without each other.I enjoyed this book very much because it helped me to see things a bit differently in my life. It also helped me to realize that in a fit world, everyone has some unique difference about them. Some of us know what that unique difference is, and others need someone else to help them see that difference. If you want to see what happens to Max, Freak, Blade, Grim, Gram, The Fair Gwen and everyone esle who has a story to tell in Freak The Mighty, you'll have to read the book!"},{"Title":"Freak The Mighty","review":"Freak the Mighty is about a large boy named Max. Max does not have many friends until he meets Freak, a very small but very smart boy. Together they go on many adventures.Max is taken away on Christmas Eve by his father, Killer Kane, who is on paroll. His father takes him to an old house to stay for the time being. First a woman named Loretta tries to rescue him but is strangled by his father. It is Freak who comes to the rescue, pretending to be weilding a squirt gun loaded with acid. Freak shoots Killer Kane with the \\"acid\\" which is nothing more than water and some other liquid. The two escape from house to find the police waiting for them and arresting Max's father.Freak the Mighty is a book that does a fine job of accurately depicting life. Max's bullying and lack of enthusiasm are relevent to a good deal of kids today. Meeting Freak and sharing a friendship shows a happier side of life. This book made me think about how lucky I am to have such good friends. It also shows how precious those friends are."},{"Title":"Freak The Mighty","review":"I had to read the book, \\"Freak The Mighty,\\" for my PACT class. At first, the book looked boring and stupid.

The book is about this GIGANTIC kid named Max who is clumsy, and is in an LD class, (Learning Disabled Class) so, he isn't very bright.(Max also lives with his granparents because his mother is dead and his father is in jail.) One day, he meets this kid named Kevin (Who Max calls Freak) who moved into the duplex down the street from Max's house. During the book, the two team up to cause all sorts of stuff. But, the part that I really remember is at the end. I'm not gonna give away the ending but I'll just say that it had me crying...."},{"Title":"Freak The Mighty","review":"Freak the Mighty is an endearing story of the relationship between Max and Freak. Max, with his oversized body and below average intelligence, is a perfect companion for Kevin, the dwarf-sized genius. Philbrick does a terrific job making sure that the two come across as real people with their own personalities, rather than the stereotypical \\"oddballs\\". This book is perfect for the middle school grades because the themes of courage and acceptance are important to this age group. Students will be swept away into the fantastically detailed adventures that Freak invents in their typical suburban neighborhood. The only concern I would have about using this book as a teaching tool is there are serious issues of murder, death, and grief that might make parents uneasy. Nevertheless, if the teacher handles it with honesty and compassion, this book would be a wonderful opportunity for students to discuss their feelings on these difficult issues."},{"Title":"Freak The Mighty","review":"Freak the Mighty is an awsome book. It has a bunch of humorous and sad scenes. The part of it that I especially liked was when Max had the squirt gun full of soap, vinegar, and curry powder and he made Killer Kane think his eyes were burning up. Freak the Mighty has a really cool dictionary that Freak wrote. If I were to rank the book, I would give it four stars because it is very tradedous but adventourous. If you like action books, then this is the book for you. Freak the Mighty is one of the best books I have ever read, so I encourage you to read it."},{"Title":"Freak The Mighty","review":"Maxwell is a large boy who just doesn't fit in. He doesn't have any friends... he is socially awkward... he has a difficult time in school... and he has a well known family history-- and not a good one.Poor Max has it rough.One day he meets a young boy named Kevin... or as many people call him, The Freak. Kevin is living with a disability caused by a condition he has had since birth. Kevin is tiny and has to walk with metal crutches. He is not what society would deem \\"Normal\\". But one thing is for sure he is very intelligent!When Max and Kevin meet they become fast friends and are instantly transformed into... \\"Freak the Mighty\\".Transported by Kevin's intellect, boldness and imagination the two boys face many wild adventures and trials. The story is full of many great twists and turns... it is far from a dull book.The book becomes very rewarding and touching as you read it.

A strange phrase to us, but to Maxwell (Max) Kane and his new friend, Kevin, it is a proper name.You see, Kevin has a disease. His outsides haven't grown much at all, but his insides are up to speed with the other eighth graders. But Max, well, he's seven feet tall and no telling how big his insides are.During a fieworks display, tiny Kevin couldn't see, so Max put him on his shoulders.Now, in their eyes, they are one peson, Freak the Mighty. Freak the Mighty has many adventures, some dangerous. My favorite part is one where Freak the Mighty parades around the classroom, chanting his name. If you would like to know the heart warming ending and the life-changing event in Maxwell's life, you'll just have to read the book.I liked it pretty much, but it seemed more for guys because the book is from Maxwell's point of view. But I enjoyed it anyway, and you will too."},{"Title":"Freak The Mighty","review":"In your school, did you ever notice the kid that always used to get made fun of? That's what it was like for Max and Kevin before they became best of friends. Author, Rodman Philbrick, shows us what it's like to be different. Kevin, the 12-year-old genius, has a birth defect called Morquio Syndrome that prevents growth. Max, however, has his own problems too: learning disabled, living in a slightly rough neighborhood, and having to be looked at as \\"Killer Kane's\\" son a.k.a. his father who is in prison for life for killing his mother. But when Kevin and Max become \\"Freak the Mighty\\", the adventure begins.With Freak sitting on top of Max's shoulders, together as a team, with Freak's brains and Max's long legs, they outsmart Tony D., the neighborhood rebel, return a stolen purse to a damsel in distress and go on more of Freak's crazy missions.But things weren't always so happy for Max and Freak. When Killer Kane escapes from parole to kidnap his son on Christmas, who he hasn't seen in years, things really start to get heated. Being tied to the waist of Killer Kane to breaking into a woman's house, to hide from the cops, Grim and Gram, Max's grandparents, which of whom he lives with, begin a police search. Freak finally rescues and helps his best friend by tricking Killer Kane into believing that he cannot see. Once Killer Kane is in jail for life, Max has to start to look out for his best friend. A surprising ending will keep you reading.This is a wonderful story over imperfection and happiness. It's a mixture of everything that should be in a book. I definitely loved the book and I'd read it again any day. It has a positive aura that you will feel about yourself.

The two main characters Max and Kevin aka Freak were very advengerous. They both liked going on adventures. Really Freak was happy about all the adventures probably since he did not have to walk.

He and his gang would like to cause trouble everywhere. Max's dad, Kenny Kane was a killer. Everyone called him Killer Kane. Freak's dad was a magician and when he heard the magic words birth defect he vanished. When Freak was born he had this disease that like every 300 kids would get.

Kevin and Maxwell are in a position that some children are in. As far as my opinion on how I think Kevin handled his disease is that I'm strongly impressed on how confidentialy he did every thing with potential. I think that Maxwell is a strong person inside, but did 't know how to express it on the outside. I'm almost sure that towards the middle end part of the story, Maxwell showed that expression.

The two main characters are Max and Freak. In the book Max and Freak get teased. Max has a learning disability and is a giant. Freak has a physical disability and is a genius."},{"Title":"Freak The Mighty","review":"Rodman Philbrick's Freak the Mighty is a compelling story of friendship in a time of despair and fate. It has very firm characters and a steady pace.This book is very adventurous and full of creativity. While reading the book, I felt sympathetic toward Freak. He can hardly walk and only has a short time to live. I did not feel as much for Max, because he could change his status. When I finished the book, I also felt sad for Gwen when Freak died. I developed compassion toward people with Morquio Syndrome and other types of disordersMy favorite character in this book is Freak. Even though he has an incurable disorder, he lives life to the fullest and appreciates what little time he has left. My least favorite character is Max's dad. He is selfish and only wants to use Max to make money.My favorite part of the book is when Max and Freak go on an imaginative quest to hospital. The part of the book I disliked was the character of Max's father. I didn't like when he was paroled and kidnapped Max. The story is a spectacular piece of literature filled with brilliant characters who overcome the pains of life. From reading this book I learned the difficulties that people with Morquio Syndrome have to go through in order to feel normal and accepted. I think the ending of the book was brief and not very descriptive, but truthfully saddening.One thing I would like to know about this story is if Max has any other relatives or not. I would also like to know when the story took place. I highly recommend this book to anyone who likes reading. I would also read other books written by Rodman Philbrick.Even though Max mourns his mother's death and fears his father's return, he befriends Kevin, a boy genius only a third his size, who is diagnosed with the incurable Morquio Syndrome. Finally, I think it is very brave and thoughtful of Max to make friends with Freak and together become Freak the Mighty."},{"Title":"Freak The Mighty","review":"ITS A VERYY WELL WRITTEN BOOK THAT OPENS YOUR EYES TO THE WORLD OVER AND OVER AGAIN ITS AMAZING A MUST READ NO A MUST BUY I TELL YOU ITS AMAZING!!BY NICK YOUNG !!PEACE OUT!!"},{"Title":"Freak The Mighty","review":"I read this book in 2 days (hey I had to stop and go to work!).

Their relationship is one of strength, both mentally and physically. They accept each other as they are and strive to bring out the best in each other.

There's this kid called Max Kain, he's big and kind of . . . not all there. He's also the son of a murderer (nicknamed \\"Killer Kain\\"). He meets this other kid, (nicknamed \\"Freak\\") during the summer. Freak is a crippled boy whose body was too small. However, he's very intelligent and is into King Arthur stories. Anyway, they meet up and go on \\"quests\\". They meet 2 people, Old Frumpy Lady and Old Frumpy Guy and they also meet some gangsters 2 times, the second time almost kills them. Later on in the story, Killer Kain escapes from jail and tries to get Max. However, someone helps him and he manages to escape.The characters . . . hmmmm, I think I'll list the major primary characters and then the secondary characters. The primary characters are: Max, Freak, Old Frumpy Lady, and Killer Kain. The secondary characters are: Max's Grandparents, Old Frumpy Guy, Freak's Mom, and The Gangsters. Freak and Old Frumpy Lady probably had the best character development, where as the other primary and secondary characters seem less original and are boring because of this. Everyone except Freak, Max, and Old Frumpy Lady are pretty much static through the story. Read the book to find out how Old Frumpy Lady and Freak change, while Max gained a new friendship, gained more courage, and was granted more intellect.Overall, the characters seemed to be developed okay in some case and it had it's twists, but that doesn't make up for other places where it was too predictable and the story didn't really interest me as an individual. I know several others who thought the book was terrible and have blocked most of it out of their minds. The story held so little interest, that the ending filled me to the brim with pure, 100% glee (because one of the characters dies)."},{"Title":"Freak The Mighty","review":"Freak the mighty is a kind of boring book where a big mentally challenged person and a midget nerd make friends.They make friends and become a team.My favorite partwas Christmas Eve but the rest of the book wasn't that good , but that is just my opinion."},{"Title":"Freak The Mighty","review":"I didnt really like this book it was really boring.

The second tape had faulty ribbon tape and did not work at all. It was a waste of a purchase, of money, and now I have to purchase ANOTHER set of tapes again."},{"Title":"Freak The Mighty","review":"This story is told from the point of view of Max, a soon to be eighth-grader who lives with his grandparents. His mother was murdered when he was young, and his father is in prison for the crime. Max is huge for his age, and many people, including his grandparents, are a little afraid of him because of his size and because he looks a lot like his father so he may have inherited his father's violent tendencies. Nothing could be further from Max's mind. He is quiet and doesn't have much confidence, especially in his own intelligence.Over the summer, a boy and his mother move into Max's neighborhood. The boy, Kevin, called Freak, is also going into eighth grade and is almost the exact opposite of Max. He has a type of dwarfism, so his head is normal size but his body doesn't grow. He is tiny and walks with the aid of canes or a walker. He is also brilliant and not afraid to flaunt his intelligence. He and Max become friends, with Max as the brawn and Freak as the brains. Because he is so light and it is easier to get him around that way, Max takes to carrying Freak on his shoulders. Together they call themselves Freak the Mighty.Max and Kevin have adventures all summer. Freak has Max carry him all over town, telling him stories of medieval knights and quests. Everything seems to be an adventure, but the real adventure happens when Max's father is released from prison and comes to get Max. When they start eighth grade together, Max is placed in Freak's classes so they can stay together and help each other out. With Freak's help, Max's self-confidence grows, and throughout the book his grandparents begin to see him as a decent person, rather than just his brutal father's son.Although this was a touching story of friendship, the characters acted much younger than eighth grade. I thought it was unrealistic to think that no other students would give Max and Freak a hard time for their close friendship, the way they traveled, and their preoccupation with pretend-play."},{"Title":"Freak The Mighty","review":"My students found this book funny, thoughtful, and inspring.My 6th &amp; 8th graders cheered for Freak the Mighty and many of them related to the two main characters.

Like when Max asks what a word means he gets him a diconary and makes him look it up.thatis why I like this book."},{"Title":"Freak The Mighty","review":"I think that &quot;Freak the Mighty&quot; is a fantastic book. It has a wonderful sense of humor. I really like the character Kevin(Freak) bacause he's smart, funny, adventurous, and loving. He is everything you could ever want in a friend. I can usually figure a book out by the eighth chapter if it has eight chapters, and not like to finish it. But &quot;Freak the Mighty&quot; was different, every chapter was a cliff hanger and I just didnt like to put it down. I thought this book was funny in many, many ways. The character of Kevin reminded me of myself because I love adventures. The thing that really disturbed me the most was how people picked on Freak for the way he looked.&quot;Freak the Mighty&quot; taught me a valuble lesson, is that friendship can accomplish anything. I like W.R.Philbrick's tyle of writing. I love adventurous books, such as this one. This book is appropriate for the ages 10 &amp; up. This book definatly deserves five stars."},{"Title":"Freak The Mighty","review":"The characters in this book all play a important role. There once was this two 12 year old boys who became bestfriends. Their names were Kevin(known as Freak)and Maxwell(known as Max).They did just about anything together. Living in castles, to slaying dragons. They had many adventures together in their minds. Fair Gwen, Grim,and Gram were all the gardians of them. You see, long time ago something happened between Max's mother and father to make them not be apart of his life at that moment of his life. Further along in this book it will unleash all the questions you would have while you are reading this book. I would recommend this book to 6,7,and 8 graders to read and enjoy. So go and find out the lives of Kevin, and Max."},{"Title":"Freak The Mighty","review":"Freak the Mighty is about two boys that are very different but in a way very much the same. Max is an overly large boy who thinks he has a learning disorder. Kevin (Freak) is a big brain attcahed to a small body. In this book, these two get to be reacquainted from pre-school when kevin moves back to his old house. Max and Kevin start to become friends during the summer. They would go on &quot;quests&quot;, as Kevin would call them. They would walk down the street with Kevin on Max's shoulders as the brain and Max would be the rest of the body that took them places. Together they made a team that nobody understood except for them. I liked Freak the Mighty because of the relationship Max and Kevin had. They were the best of friends. It was their relationship that made the book as good as it was. In parts of the book you see how close their friendship got them threw tough times. This book is also good because it shows people who have disabilities act like they don't. It lets you see that the disabled have friends and live normal lives just like everybody else. I like how Max and Kevin help each other out during the book. This book also gives out a great message. It's that even people who different may turn out to be the best friend youve ever had. I would reccommend this book to anyone."},{"Title":"Freak The Mighty","review":"My class and I really enjoyed reading the book Freak The Mighty. This book was really intersting and very entertaining. I thought it was a very good book because the author made it very funny.

It was a good book though. I think it was great how Max and Kevin playedplayed off each others weaknesses to make up for what they didn't have or needed. It was good how they helped each other.I liked the book though because it was funny. It also showed that no matter how diffrent to people are, you can get along. It showed that even people who are diffrent need friends. I liked how diffrent Max and Kevin were, but became best friends.it also shows that oppisites do attract."},{"Title":"Freak The Mighty","review":"I think Freak The Mighty is a great example of o children's book by the chiidren. Rodman Philbrick is a great example for young writters all over the world. Freak The Mighty was the best book i've read since Holes. I think that it has a very surprising ending. Anybody who reads this book i guarentee that you WILL be surprised.I really liked this book.I think that it is very hard for kids to find a good book and this book is a jackpot. Although the start could have been a little better because it kind of makes you want to not read it anymore. When I see freak the Mighty I think of a story with alot of filling and crust like a pie. With a hearty plot like a Thanksgiving dinner.

I think that this book is appropriate for kids between the ages of 11-14. Kevin, one of the characters in this book who was also known as &quot;Freak&quot;, was very inspiring. Kevin would always take Max on adventures throughout the neighborhood. Max, who was also a major character in this book was also very inspiring. He would always be there for Kevin to lend &quot;Freak&quot; a hand. This is why I think Kevin and Max are the two best people for Freak the Mighty."},{"Title":"Freak The Mighty","review":"My class and I really enjoyed reading the book Freak The Mighty.

I have never read a novel so exciting and full of pleasant and unpleasant experiences. You would never have guessed the ending. Even though I don't prefer sad stories, this one brought a great point around. When Max gets taken hostage by his so-called father, \\"Killer Kane\\" I thought he was never going to return. Then Freak saves the day by finding them in a broken down building. This book is excellent proof that two is better than one, and I highly recommend it to any reader!!!!!!"},{"Title":"Freak The Mighty","review":"I chose this book, because it is an exciting book with two very different characters, who you would think wouldn't get along, or become the best of friends. They go on all sorts of adventures, sticking together through thick and thin. Freak is a short person with a wheelchair, who knows the whole dictionary, and is fascinated with the Middle Ages. Max, on the other hand, is learning disabled, has an especially hard time reading, and beat up on kids before he met Freak.It was so good I couldn't put it down. Some of the scenes in the book are fun and exciting, others are sad, or frightening. You really get into the characters, and don't want anything to happen to them. I've read other Rodman Philbrick books, and none of them have been bad so far. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes a fast, thrilling book, which keeps you on the edge of your seat.

The ending was unexpected and it was the only part of the entire book that I didn't like. The midget Freak I liked he was interesting and always had a lot of fun. I thought that he would have been a great writer. Max's dad really scared me in some parts of the book not even some parts more than some parts.

Freak (Kevin), a dwarf, and Max, extremely tall, are at once an unlikely and yet perfect match.

We do however, cheer their resilience and strength."},{"Title":"Freak The Mighty","review":"Some love this book, some pan it. I loved it.

The author of the book is Rodman Philbrick. It's a 160 page book and only 25 chapters. All the characters in Freak the Mighty were great but the one that I liked the most was Freak. Freak was a little boy who kids laughed at; but actually he was really cool because he invented stuff like a pyramid that opens up and there's a present inside. Freak helps this big kid named Kevin by letting him know where to go. Freak goes on adventures with Kevin like looking for treasure and all kinds of adventurous stuff. I also liked the book because it added detail and explained things about stuff. To me it was interesting that they talked about Kevin's dad named killer kain getting out of jail. That's what got me exited. I really wanted to know what Kevin's dad wanted to do with Kevin. Did he really want to kill Kevin and his family or did he just want to visit him in strange ways.

It is a very compelling fiction book. \\"I never had a brain until Freak came along.\\" This is what Max thought until he met Freak. Freak was a young boy that was the same age as Max. He had a tiny body and a very large brain. Unlike Freak, Max was just the opposite; Max was like a giant. His classmates always called him names like stupid, dumb, and slow. Max's problem was that his body was growing faster then his mind. With this problem there were a lot of people that were afraid of hi m. Also since people were afraid of him Max learned to be alone. That was until he met Freak. Together this pair was unstoppable. Until something terrible happened. Max got taken away by his father and was unable to see Freak.

These two kids are very different. Maxwell is tall and mentally slow. Kevin, or as Maxwell calls him Freak has a birth defect and uses Maxwell's shoulders for transportation. Unlike Maxwell he is extremely smart. The two kids meet and become \\"Freak the Mighty.\\" Using Maxwell as the body and Kevin as the brain they are almost invincible. Maxwell and Kevin are doing what they usually do; going on adventures and traveling around the neighborhood. Then one night as Maxwell goes to bed he can feel the cold coming into his room. He thinks it is the wind but it is a person breathing. Then a cold hand clamps around his mouth. To find out who the person is, try reading the book. Before you do, read some comments we made to decide if this is a book for you.The book was pretty good. It was pretty dull at the beginning because one thing that we noticed was that the plot did not develop until the middle of the story. The main event that included Maxwell's father is not even mentioned until the middle of the book.Overall we give this book a three and a half star rating. If you are a person that likes action I wouldn't recommend this book for you. The only action is for two or three pages and to get there you have to read through an inactive beginning. If you do read this book, I hope you enjoy it.By: Michael and Evan"},{"Title":"Freak The Mighty","review":"This book was a great adventure about two boys who had difficulties and together worked them out in a special way. They, together, were a great team. We, first meet Max. Max is a boy of about 12 years of age. Max has learning difficulties and is in a learning disabled class. Kevin or Freak is about the same age as Max. Kevin is crippled and has to use crutches to get around all the time. When they meet they quickly become friends.My favorite adventure in this book is when Max and Kevin are in a park on the 4th of July and Kevin is naming the chemicals in the fireworks before they have to escape from Tony D. and his gang. They end up jumping into a millpond with Kevin on Max's shoulders, of course. This book has a sad ending but its worth reading."},{"Title":"Freak The Mighty","review":"This book is about a young boy named max that doesn't have any friends until Freak came along. Freak is a big kid that is really nice when someone needs a friend. During the whole book Max always stands up for Freak when he is in trouble and Freak always stands up when Max is in trouble. Later in the book they got to be really good freinds and they called themselves Freak The Mighty. My favorite part of the book was when Freak really came to Max's rescue, I would say. What I mean is Max was a nobody an had no friend until he met Freak.I would recommend this book because it is about two kids that never knew eachother and always got made fun of. Until one day Max met someone that he would never guess to meet. Freak who became best friends with him. So if you want to read and find out how to make good friends, read the fabulous book called Freak The Mighty."},{"Title":"Freak The Mighty","review":"Rodman Philbrick has an intrusting way to appeal to young readers. In his book called Freak the Mighty there is an odd relationship between a giant 8th grader who has some kind of learning disability and another genius kid who has a birth defect that leaves him with a six year olds body.The giant is named Max Kane. He is 13 years old and a horrible past behind him. His father strangled his mother when he was a little boy and he remembers watching his dad doing it. Now he is living with his grandparents, grand and grim, the parents of his mother. Freak is also a 13 year old boy. He has a problem that he was born with. His insides are growing but his outsides are not. Even with that he is still a genius with a really big brain. He lives with his mother, the Fair Gwen. With a freak on the top of the brainless giant's shoulders this was the beginning of the legend \\"Freak the Mighty\\".The two boys have many wonderful adventures, slaying dragons and fighting robbers. But one time they get in a real pickle. It takes the brains of a little mastermind and the help of a tough kid to get them through it. Once the two boys got together no one could stop \\"Freak the Mighty\\".Freak the Mighty a novel Rodman Philbrick created turned a light on in my heart and almost put a in my eye. The tragic way this book ended was very sad but it was still one of the greatest books I have ever read."},{"Title":"Freak The Mighty","review":"This is the most excellent book I have read, ever.

Even though there are other books that are good, this book tops it all. Go Freak the Mighty!!"},{"Title":"Freak The Mighty","review":"Freak the mighty is an interesting book written in the perspective of an 8th grade boy, Max Kane. Maxwell is a boy with a troubled past. He lives with his grandparents, Grim and Gram, when his mother was murdered and his father was accused and put in jail. Max is a slow learner, and teachers pass him along instead of trying to help him. One day a boy his age moves a few houses away and almost immediately they were inseparable. Kevin Avery (Freak) is a young boy with a serious birth defect, Morquio's syndrome, which means that his insides are growing normally, while his body's structure is not. Freak convinces Max that he is going to receive a bionic body in a few short months and they have been working on it for years. Kevin is extremely intelligent and when he is atop Max's enormous shoulders, Freak the Mighty is unbeatable. Freak demands Max and him go on journeys to save fair maidens, slay dragons, and anything else freak can conjure up in his imagination. When Max's father is up for parole everyone is on edge, and for good reason. Max was forced from his bed in the \`down under' and flees in fear of his father harming Grim and Gram. It was Freak who was able to rescue Max with a sly plan, and some curry powder.Freak has a seizure and was rushed to the emergency room. After a few weeks Max treks miles to visit Freak in the hospital where he bumps into Freaks distraught mother, \\"Fair Gwen of Air\\". Freak never leaves the Hospital, he dies and Max goes wild looking for him. Eventually what happened to Freak is explained and Max returns to his old ways and keeps to himself at all times.If I were to use this book in a Middle School classroom, most likely a 6th grade classroom, I would pair it along with an assignment where as a class we create our own dictionary like Freak gave to Max for Christmas before he died. We can also watch the movie upon completion of the book to discuss the differences between them (and it would also be a nice treat for the students)"},{"Title":"Freak The Mighty","review":"Freak the mighty, is an amazing book.It has Character, Excitment, and adventure. A book you can't miss reading. My first opinion about Freak the mighty would be that its more likely for people 13 and up, But really anyone can get this book. The Reason that you could have trouble is that some points in the book wouldn't be for young viewers, or some parts that they can't understand. For an Example 'my father, who had married his dear departed daughter and produced, eek eek,' That may not be good wording for younger viewers or behavior they would understand. I first Did not, and I did not think I would. But I'm lucky, to have a mom and dad together, or a healthy person, with no kind of sickness. My second opinion would be that its a book for adventure and who wouldn't want to have fun? This is a kind of book when you start, you can't stop. You have to keep going, it just gets more interesting. But at points the book can also be sad. My favorite quote in the book would be 'Don't mess with me man, maybe i got a laser cannon hidden inside these leg braces.' Cracks Me up everytime. This book is an amazing book. You Just can't miss out on.

Max, the slow yet man sized boy, is overly protected by his grandparents and is mocked at school for his handicap. Max is a very angry and confused eigth grade boy. One summer Max becomes friends with Kevin (Freak) who has a syndrome which prevents his body from growing properly.They accept each other as they are and strive to bring out the best in each other. They get themselves involved in several impossible-to-solve adventures and from this learn that the most important things in life are love and companionship.This story is one of loneliness, anger, sadness, joy, defiance, a willingness not to accept life as is or the limitations placed on oneself by society.A page-turner, this book should be read by any older child or young adolescent who feels smarter or slower, larger or smaller, different from his/her peers."},{"Title":"Freak The Mighty","review":"I bought this book for my fourth grader because his teacher suggested challenging him more with longer chapter books. I should have looked at it a bit more closely to be sure that it was the right reading level for him.He finished the book and when he took the online test for it (for his class), he scored only 6 out of 10. I knew that he read it because he said he was sad at the end (I won't tell why). He said he liked the book, so I decided to read it to find out why he did badly on the test.I loved the book. I totally enjoyed the way that it was written in the vernacular of a 12 year old boy. But what I liked about it was probably what gave my son some problems. Since it was written as a 12 year old would speak, and since one of the characters is basically a genius, the vocabulary was too much for him.As a parent, I think this book is perfect for 5th or 6th grade students. I loved the characters, especially the minor characters, like the grandparents. The book is real; it deals with issues that kids face, so it kept my son's interest, even if he didn't understand all of the words.This is great young reader material."},{"Title":"Freak The Mighty","review":"There are not many novels that can be done as a novel study for a squirmy, ADD class of preteens. Not many books will hold their attention from page 1 to the end. Very few novels will have a class on the edge of their seats, and even fewer will be able to offer students from all socioeconomic levels some character with which they can identify.Freak the Mighty is one of those very few.This novel was introduced to me by a mentor teacher on my campus. This dear lady is an unsung hero and a second mother to me. Even though I adore her, I was skeptical as to whether or not this book was really as good for the kids as she claimed. I didn't give her enough credit.Freak and Max are best friends who are total opposites: Freak is smart, Max isn't; Freak is small, Max is huge. They are both societal outcasts. They both have secrets. Their struggles and their friendship appeal to almost every kind of student. This novel is perfect for reluctant readers, and perfect for classroom discussion. Really, it is at its best when used in the classroom (it is mentioned in Trelease'sThe Read-Aloud Handbook: Sixth Edition (Read-Aloud Handbook)).What is so genius about this work is that Philbrick writes it in Max's ego-centric voice, so students can easily identify with it, but Philbrick uses the experiences of Freak the Mighty to refocus that ego-centrism into broadening the reader's frame of reference without the reader knowing it. The novel is simply beautiful: a fast-paced, well-knit read that belongs (and already is) in the modern cannon of literature. Highly, highly recommended."},{"Title":"Freak The Mighty","review":"Max and Kevin were complete opposites. Max; \\"the oversized teen, who had often been labeled as dumb\\". Kevin or -Freak- rather, had a disease that stopped his outsides from growing, but aloud his insides to grow normally. Kevin was also extremely bright and seemed to have the brain of Einstein. One summer day, Freak moves in down the street form Max, and soon they became inseparable friends. With Kevin on Max's shoulder they become \\"Freak the Mighty\\". Kevin being the brains, and Max the protection and transportation. Unfortunately however, Max's father who had been in prison for killing his wife was released. He kidnapped Max from the cozy down-under (the basement of his grandparent's house) and was from then on, on the run. Will Max escape from the clutches of his father...\\"Killer Kane\\"?Will Freak's disease end up killing him?In my opinion, the author's main message was to say how important friendship is. Both Max, and Kevin were loyal friends, and that's how true friends should be. Good friends help each other in times of need, and give each other hope. If I were to rate this book, I would give it 5 stars. This book has the perfect twist of friendship, sadness, hope, and even humor, which gives it a very satisfying plot. If you read this book and enjoy it, I recommend you read Max The Mighty, the sequel to Freak The Mighty, which has the same spark, if not, better, spark."},{"Title":"Freak The Mighty","review":"Well hi I am a boy from the united state of America Dominican and.

So this is why the freak the mighty likes this book.Thank you for reading this section."},{"Title":"Freak The Mighty","review":"Freak the might is a wonderful book for young readers. The author of this book is Rodman Philbrick. I personally like this book! It is about a two thirteen year old boys who have a bit of trouble of fitting in with the crowd. This alone brought together as Freak the Mighty. They were best friends, and they were knights of King Arthur, so freak believed. They fought evil and helped fair maidens. Now freak had a curtain disease, which made him have a body the size of a six year old. His body would not grow but his inner organs would. So this created a problem for him. Some called him crippled others retarded. But he was very smart, he taught Max how to read and encouraged him to write and use his brain for once. What I liked about these two characters was that they had a great friendship. I liked how freak had a sense of humor. Also that he knew that life shouldn't be spent been bored, depressed, and feeling bad about your self. He knew a lot about and he was not afraid to share it with Max, or anyone else for that matter. That is why I like freak a lot. This book encouraged me to be who I am, to live life well, and to be open minded."},{"Title":"Freak The Mighty","review":"The book was very touching because Max is a very shy, UN confidence and he thinks that he doesn't have a brain. But then Freak came and gave him confidence if you could read that book I would read it if I were you. Because it will kind of give you a idea of the type of person that Max is and the type of life he life's and you can feel how he feels about the way the kids treat him. Something I liked about the book is that the characters were weird because of the names and that Freak has a very good imagination and he can make you be in the time when the people fought the dragons and he can even make you be like one of the characters by the way he reads the story to you."},{"Title":"Freak The Mighty","review":"I got this book for Christmas from my sister and I loved it. There were some things in the characters' pasts that really made it more enjoyable. Also, the style was a great first person type of thing. It was really like he was a kid and not an adult writing it. The ending was very moving. Even though it was fiction it felt like it really could or did happen."},{"Title":"Freak The Mighty","review":"I think Freak the Mighty is a really good book. I can relate to it because I've had a friend that has died. Everyone that reads this book will learn something from it. Max and Freak are people from totally different worlds that finally make a friendship. They act like nothing can break them apart."},{"Title":"Freak The Mighty","review":"For an independent reading project, I read Freak the Mighty with several classmates. For the next 2 weeks, I found myself inthralled in one of the best books I have ever read. Rodman Philbrick has demonstrated a natural talent for grabbing the reader's attention in every last word. This book had a nice, informal tone, good characters, good plot, good ethics, and an unforgettable ending that kept me shocked long after I had turned the last page. Definately a book worth reading."},{"Title":"Freak The Mighty","review":"I didn't really like Freak The Mighty. I would have to rate it a two. I actually thought that the storyline wasn't that bad, with the idea of Freak &amp; Max complementing each other's weaknesses and all. But, the storyline &amp; characters were also just a little too weird for me. I would have liked it if Freak &amp; Max could have gone separate ways."},{"Title":"Freak The Mighty","review":"The book I read was 'Freak The Mighty' and the book was a very good book for all ages.Maxwell and Kevin are the main characters.Maxwell Kane is a big,dumb,slow,gaint ,at least that's what kid's thought at his school.Kevin as problems to.Kevin is small ,very smart,and he is slow like Max.Kevin is disabled in a few ways.One of Kevin's probles is a small.Kevin's body is getting to small for his inner body peaces.this book is very good until the ending.Read the book you will like it I promise."},{"Title":"Freak The Mighty","review":"Oh man, this book was AWESOME.

This is a wonderful book for boys, the level of honesty is sometimes hurtful but necessary for the story to be so touching. This is my 4th purchase for a 4th nephew/friend!"},{"Title":"Freak The Mighty","review":"Freak The Mighty is a wonderful novel that brings much catharsis to the readers. Max, a oversized giant with a tiny brain, tells about the story, from his point of view, of how he and a little boy named Kevin became the ultimate duo: &quot;Freak The Mighty, slaying dragons and fools and walking high above the world.&quot; Kevin, otherwise known as Freak, is the brains of the outfit but certainly not the size. He is a tiny, midget kid with a birth defect and a huge brain. Together they can accomplish any task, avoid any problem, and can be invincible if they want. Both characters are extremely unique and the author wanted to express that. The novel deals with issues of friendship and many of lifes problems. I strongly reccomend this book."},{"Title":"Freak The Mighty","review":"This is an awsome book about an enormouse eigth grade boy named Max Kane. Born in the shadow of his father's horrible actions, he never had any friends. But things change when Kevin, a genious of the same age moves in down the street. The boys meet when Kevin, who was born with a birth defect, gets his toy called an ornithopter, described by Kevin as an experimental aircfat propelled by flapping wings, gets stuck in a tree. Max, with his enormous size pulls the toy out of the tree. The boys become quick friends and go on adventures they call &quot;quests&quot;. Whether it be hiking to the local hospital or fishing a womans purse out of the sewer, you'll never see one without the other. The fun all changes when the terrible father of Max returns and kidnaps Max. This is a great book and I would reccomend this book to anyone!"},{"Title":"Freak The Mighty","review":"I think freak the mighty was one of the best books ever, it was funny and sad. Freak is a small kid thats body on the inside is growing faster than on the outside, and max is this dumb, tall kid that has no idea what he is talking about. so read this book and see what interesting trouble they get into."},{"Title":"Freak The Mighty","review":"It was a pretty goood book. The movie is way better though! I recomend it to any kid! Very good! You learn to grown attached to Kevin (freak) and you kind of become his friend."},{"Title":"Freak The Mighty","review":"\\"Maxi pad, Maxi pad, ask him quick about his dad.\\" Let's just say that life for Maxwell Kane was not easy. He was taller than anyone his age, not to mention he was practically brainless, until, of course, Kevin (or Freak) came along. This book is a heartwarming tale of the hardships of growing up as an outcast and a friendship that will last a lifetime, even though that lifetime is considerably shorter than that of a normal person. When I read this book, I felt every feeling there is available to feel. I felt love, joy, fear, and even sadness at every turn of a page. The story of Freak the Mighty is an inspiration to all kids growing up, and adults, too, especially since the young boy, Freak, has Morquio Syndrome. He was my favorite character because no matter how badly things were going, how down his situation looked, he always looked up. Instead of sulking in his own tear- jerking story, he fell into storybooks and went on quests with his best friend, Max, past castles, through motes, to lands far, far away in his imagination. There isn't one thing I dislike about this book because if you take out even the smallest detail, it takes away a part of the book, without that part, it wouldn't be so extraordinary.I would like to thank Rodman Philbrick, the author of Freak the Mighty, for writing such an amazing book. The story of Freak and Max will stay with me for the rest of my life. Everyone can relate in some way to a character in this book. To write a story like that, you've got to have something special in you, and that is something that I wish, everyone wishes, they could have. So, thank you, Rodman Philbrick.When reading Freak the Mighty, I learned that the people we consider \\"different\\" are not so different. Freak and Max looked different than everyone, but they went through the same things we do and even more than that because their peers ridicule them for being who they are. I also learned that not all good books have happy endings. This book may not have had a fairy tale ending, but if it did, it wouldn't be stuck in my heart or my mind the way it is now. The ending was reality, plain and simple.On a scale of one to ten, this book is definitely a nine or ten. I recommend this book to anyone who likes a book that won't let you put it down. Even if you're not a huge reader, you should read this book. It's an easy read and I swear you won't regret it, or forget it, for that matter. I would like for everyone to join me in reading other books by Rodman Philbrick. If they are as fantastic as Freak the Mighty, I solemnly swear that I will read every single one.\\"Killer Kane, Killer Kane, had a kid who got no brain,\\" and that's life for Maxwell Kane."},{"Title":"Freak The Mighty","review":"Freak The Mighty is a book about two boys who go on many adventures together.

They run into a lake at a carnival, which is all muddy and goopy, and Freak and Max get stuck in it and the same happens with Blade and his gang.

Once you start reading it you don't want to put it down. The narrator (Max) makes you feel like you are there. It is about these two little boys, Max who is very tall for his age and not so bright, and Kevin (also known as Freak) who is very small for his age but very smart. They live across the street from each other. They become best friends and do everything together. Freak always takes Max on quests to places in their town. Freak makes these places interesting because he has a wide imagination. Any reader knows that an imagination is the best part about a book. Freak and Max go throw many difficult but incredible adventures together and they always keep you interested. Therefore if you like a great book I recommend Freak The Mighty it is a wonderful book and you know you want to know more about these curios little boys and there imaginative quest."},{"Title":"Freak The Mighty","review":"You are my knight!

I would encourage all the children to read this book."},{"Title":"Freak The Mighty","review":"This is a book for the tender-hearted. Love, adventure, you name it. This is a great coming-of-age story; and if you like symbolism it's for you. There aren't many stories out there as touching as this. I cannot say enough of the exquisite plot and the masterful themes. While the book is in no way challenging to read, it is challenging to look deep inside the characters. The author paints us such a picture, we have trouble understanding. I think seeing these two boys in this raw form is hard for most to understand. Their emotions become your emotions, their tribulations, yours. That is too intense for some. And if it is, you can just take the book for face value. But I must say, trying to pick apart the symbolism is a wild ride that you are sure to enjoy!"},{"Title":"Freak The Mighty","review":"I thought that &quot;Freak the Mighty&quot; was a great book.

I enjoyd it very much. It teaches you that you can be friends with anybody no matter how different you are."},{"Title":"Freak The Mighty","review":"When I first began reading Freak the Mighty I really wasn't as interested in it as much as I was when I finished. Freak and Max are both two totally different boys with many differences. Freak (Kevin) is a short genius kid while on the other hand Max is a big and tall dumb kid. It doesn't take them very long to realize they can use their differences, combine them and they have something very special. For example: Freak is physically handicapped and can not walk; Max is amazingly larger than Freak and is able to carry Freak on his shoulders. Max is a LD child; Freaks a genius. I would defiantly recommend this book to kids from the ages of 11-13. This book makes a lot of good points for even situations we face all the time. Freak doesn't look at situations as they really are. As you will find out Freaks living in a fantasy world and allows Max to enter it. Freak the Mighty has made an effect on my classmates and me. This book shows great friendship and it also shows how some people really have feeling and a good side to them."},{"Title":"Freak The Mighty","review":"Freak the Mighty was about how Max who is a very large child and has a learning disability went to preschool with Kevin (Freak) who is very smart but shorter than a yardstick because he has a growing disability. They move away from each other and about eight years later they become neighbors, best friends, and Freak the Mighty. They go on treasure hunts, adventures, and Freak even discovers a way of helping Max get over his learning disability.I really liked Freak the Might because it is a very realistic book. I definitely do not think it is strange that Max and Freak are friends. I actually think that it would be comforting to have a friend that had a disability, like you. I also liked this book because it was very sad towards the end. I really like sad books because most of them let me know how fortunate I am to have the things that I have. For instance, this book let me know how fortunate I am to not have any major disabilities.I thought this book was very entertaining because Max and Freak were always going on adventures and secret missions. This was also one of those books that makes a very clear picture in your mind. It is almost like you are actually seeing this take place. Freak the Mighty is a book that you never want to set it down because you want to know what happens next. For instance, one night I stayed up until 11:00 reading it. This was a very good book and I would encourage anyone who has a chance to read it, take it!"},{"Title":"Freak The Mighty","review":"I liked the book because its interesting when Freak (Kevin) and Max go on journeys together. You could say that they are best friends. Freak gets his name because he has braces on his legs. He's like this boy genius and Max...well...he's not the smartest person in the world! He's a large framed ordinary kid and Freak is this small 4-foot genius.I don't like the book because it's just boring in the very beginning and then it in the middle it starts to get a little interesting. But the end is the best part. That's where all the action is. But even though it has a lot of action, it's sad. But you'll have to read the book to figure out what I'm talking about."},{"Title":"Freak The Mighty","review":"I think Freak The Mighty was a great book. At first it was boring. The end was the best of the book. I really would like to read Max The Mighty. I predict that Max is going to be smart and wise like Freak was. I really liked how the couple got along. I relate to the friends Freak and Max was. Me and my friend have a great relationship. I hpoe this book comes out with other sequals."},{"Title":"Freak The Mighty","review":"Sarah's Spiffy ReviewI love the book Freak the Mighty because it was both sad and exciting.This book was easy to read because all books that I like are so easy to read. Freak the Mighty is a book I would recommend to thousands of readers that just don't like to read. I would rate this book a 5 star book.My favorite character was Loretta because she was so funny flirting with everyone and wearing flashy dresses. The character Kevin reminds me of my grandma because they act just alike. My class enjoyed reading this book because it was a really interesting book. This book taught me that no matter what size you are you can still have a lot of fun and excitement.I suggest you go to the library right now and check it out. I hope u have fun reading.Sarah"},{"Title":"Freak The Mighty","review":"I would give Freak the Mighty a 4 star rating, becuase it had a lot of feelings, and it wasn't boring. It always had something fun to read going on. I really liked the charcter of Kevin, because even thought he knew he was handicapped he still made the best of his life. Something disturbing about the book, was that Max's Dad, could be mean and cruel to his own son after he just got out of jail. This book taught me that friends and family are so important, and you should always get the most out of life, because you never know when something bad will happen. I would recomend this book to people of all ages. I think everyone would it. Freak the Mighty was a really good book."},{"Title":"Freak The Mighty","review":"Max and Freak, 2 people combined to 1, what a great topic. These guys go all around town going on adventures like saving princesses and slaying dragons. This is a great book because it teaches friendship and what it means to have a best friend. Through all their differences you would think they would not be as good a friends like they are. So if you want a great book to read then this is the book you, watch out there are many unsuspecting events!!!!"},{"Title":"Freak The Mighty","review":"This book shows grreat friendship, and adventurous action, this book shows how the smallest person can come on top, and be so brave. For two special ed peopleto get along so well,and help eack other out, they are unstoppable to the world. Shows love fo others and how they care. A comical , drama, and sad story of the life of Maxwell and Freak, and what trouble they can get into. Also shows how mean people can turn out nice and how people can lie to you and try to hurt you.

It was a very inspiring story. I like the way the author made it seem like he was Max. Freak and Max have a relationship that cannot be explained. Sometimes I felt bad for Max, but with Freak, I knew that Max was O.K. I really liked the character of Gram because she was always trying to make Max feel better on the inside. I also liked Freak because he pushed Max to his hardest do to good in school, and to read and write. He really built up Max' s confidence. I would recommend this book to anybody that likes stories about tough times and a good strong friendship."},{"Title":"Freak The Mighty","review":"I would give Freak the Mighty a star rating of 4, because it had a lot of feelings. Such as sadness happeness,and being confused and mad. There was always simething happening, so the book was not boring. The end was my favorite part of the book, becuase you could pisture everything that was happening in your mind. Freak the Mighty was a great book, and I would highyly recammean it to everyone, no matter was age they are."},{"Title":"Freak The Mighty","review":"I am currently studying to be an english teacher, and came across this book while doing an independent project for my literature class. I thought it was a very spirited novel that made me smile and cry, at the same time. There are so many themes in this novel, and more than one lesson to be learned. It is a great book to use in the classroom, and Max's character is identifiable with the loners of the school or the kids who tend to be less outgoing and less noticed. The way a child's disability is dealt with is also a good lesson for students, and of course the issue of dealing with a friend's death is present in this novel as well. It is hard for students to understand why kids their age have terminal illnesses and this book helps them to prepare for that in some way, as well as helping them to overcome their fears and unanswered questions concerning death. There is so much to be said about this work of literature but I do not have the space to say it. I think everyone should read it, especially english teachers so that they can teach it in their classes. I can only hope the movie is half as enjoyable!"},{"Title":"Freak The Mighty","review":"what first prompted me to pick up this book was a movie preview i saw. it looked amazing and my mother mentioned to me that it was based on a book. i spent the better part of my weekend searching for that book. my local library didn't have it, and a few of the book stores i visited didn't have it either. when i finally found the book two towns over i bought it without even looking it over i was so confident that it was worth my time and money. when i got home i read it, all at one sitting. and when i was done, i read it again. i recomend this book for anyone, i've passed it on to my best friend, and he's passed it on to his."},{"Title":"Freak The Mighty","review":"Freak the Mighty is a wonderful book to read.Max and Freak are awsome.I recomend it to any body who likes book.It makes you cry,laugh,and smile."},{"Title":"Freak The Mighty","review":"when max kane who is a &quot;retard&quot; meets the 2 foot tall kevin down the street he is about to meet his new best freind. kevin and max will experiance the fun of a lifetime. the fun never seems to end untill death meets kevin."},{"Title":"Freak The Mighty","review":"Freak the Mighty is about two 8th graders.

This story has a little fun for everyone!!!! I enjoyed this book alot and and I think you will also, if you read it."},{"Title":"Freak The Mighty","review":"&quot;Freak the Mighty&quot; is a work of genius by Rodman Philbrick. One cannot say enough about this text.Not only are the characters so well developed that you really feel what they're going through, but it's written in a way that transcends time. It's not often that I read a book and then feel like gushing on and on about it, but this one really made the cut. Mr. Philbrick, if your reading this, I'd like to say Thank-You, from the bottom of my heart for writing such a poignant portrayal of two friends who really know what it means to love despite differences."},{"Title":"Freak The Mighty","review":"The character of Max Kane has to be one of the most original literary characters ever created. I read the book years ago in school, and when I heard they were making a movie version of it, I was worried how they were going to translate the character to the screen. But I have to say, Elden Henson- the actor who plays Max in &quot;The Mighty&quot;- delivers the best performance I've seen from any actor year. The movie is really good, too. It made me go back and read the book all over again. Anybody who liked &quot;Freak the Mighty&quot; should read the excellent new sequel &quot;Max the Mighty.&quot; Also, consider getting the audiobook version of &quot;Freak the Mighty,&quot; read wonderfully by Elden Henson."},{"Title":"Freak The Mighty","review":"This novel captured my heart with its realistic portrayal of two friends who are so different both physically and mentally, yet so alike in their need to have a friend. The book raises some pertinent issues that make us think... mortality, adults who are despicable and dishonest, disease, divorce, prison, learning disabilities, etc. It's meaty without being stuffy! I teach 7th grade L.A., and I was wondering if anyone had created any lesson plans/teaching guides for this super novel. I'd like to look at what others have done. Thanks in advance."},{"Title":"Freak The Mighty","review":"I'm a secondary education pre-student teaching student of English education SUNY Oneonta. I read this book in a quick sitting from cover to cover. By the time I turned the last page, I had tears in my eyes. This book is an excellent read for all ages. It's message and story line appeal to any age. If you ever pick this book up, I would bet that you don't stop reading it until you reach the back cover."},{"Title":"Freak The Mighty","review":"This would have been a beautiful book, heartwarming and sad and able to conjure real emotion. Notice the \\"would have\\". This book is probably one of the most unrealistic I have read, surpassing those containing unicorns. That takes effort, and moreover, it takes the consistent reliability of the adult eye to turn away when viewing something it doesn't like.In this book, two boys, equally maligned by their society, get together and, miraculously, their town joins in a metaphorical circle to hold hands and sing songs about peace and love. As a nerdy little girl in an area not entirely tolerant of a nerdy little anything, I so wish that what happened in this book would happen in real life, but it doesn't. What happens in real life is the other kids gather in a circle not to sing songs, but to pelt you with spitballs. Teacher may rant and rave about how fabulous this book is, but that once again shows the selective blindness of the collective adult consciousness. The story was cute, and sweet, and deep, just like my English teacher claimed, but I think the author would have been able to improve it had he had contact with children since his long-lost youth. Kids are cruel, kids are vicious, and a story about two kids who are not facing the crapsack world we live in would have hit far closer to home than this one about two kids in an idealistic society which apparently didn't notice any of the gay undertones.I recommend this for kids who would like an escape from the pure suckiness of their own world. I do not recommend this for adults, because this will just fuel their need to believe this story mirrors life. What I do recommend for adults is that they get over themselves and look at what IS going on, and maybe even do the slightest bit to help fix it."},{"Title":"Freak The Mighty","review":"Some people have problems like diseases. These problems sometimes hold people back but not Freak and Max. In the book Freak the Mighty by Rodman Philbrick Freak has this problem which means he will grow in the inside but not the outside but with this problem he becomes Freak the mighty. When he becomes Freak the mighty he rides on the shoulders of Maxwell Kane who is the main character in this book.Max always puts himself down and he is really self-deprecating and has only a little confidence in him self. When Freak comes along he helps max by helping him to gain confidence in himself and he teaches him to read.The reason they became friends was because they didn't have any other friends and when Freak made this flying mechanical bird called an ornithopter (which means a machine shaped like an aircraft that is held aloft and propelled by wing movements) it got stuck in a tree and max helped Freak by getting it down and they sort of bonded.Freak really helped Max to understand him self.Rodman Philbrick shows that if you have a friend you can get through a lot in life that you couldn't alone."},{"Title":"Freak The Mighty","review":"ok first things first i have seen a few posts saying that all of a sudden Kevin cant walk anymore... what are you thinking!!! this kid was like that since he was born...BIRTH DEFECT... another thing why do yall think its so boring really what book has a excellent introduction a climax that is unbelievably awesome and the coolest resolution ever...

It might be best to use this as a read aloud in 5th or 6th grade, but it would be fine for independent reading beyond that. Although the text itself is easy to read and understand, the concepts will be more powerful if they are discussed.

Freak the Mighty, by Rodman Philbrick, is an extremely entertaining book. It is about two young boys named Freak (kevin is his real name) and Max, who are brought together by an interesting event. After they meet they become good friends and have many adventures together. Freak loves the knights of old, he knows everything about them. On their adventures he pretends that they are knights and slay dragons and save damsels from distress. They have a lot of fun until one day Freak eats some American chop suey too fast and has to go to the hospital. After that their adventures start to slow. Finally in the end, it is so very sad what happens to the two friends. I won't tell the ending, but Freak has a disease that is fatal to his health.

Max is an extermely big and not very smart kid and his nieghbor Kevin wich is 2 feet tall who is so smart his has his own dictionary. They become bset friends and go through a lot thing together. Max's father breaks out of jail after being put there for killing his wife. Kevin has a seizure he is taken to a hospital for a serious surgery.

It was about a not so bright 7 foot tall Max and then his new extremely intelligent 2 foot tall neighbor named Kevin. Kevin has a birth defect that makes him grow on the inside but not on the outside. He can only walk with the help of his braces and crutches. They became friends instantly going on adventures with each other almost everyday. They became an unstoppable team and nothing could get in their path not even a bully named Tony D. Whenever Kevin gets on Max's back they become Freak the Mighty, Kevin being the brains and Max being the legs.

The one reason people in my class liked it was because Max always called himself and other people butthead. The on thing that bothered me was that Max' s dad was a killer.

I give Freak the Mighty a five star rating."},{"Title":"Freak The Mighty","review":"I really like the charather of Loretta Lee because she eats pizza all the time.

Out of all the thousands of books I've read, Freak the Mighty is my top favorite. I really thought it was funny when they called Max,&quot;Maxi Pad&quot;, I thought that was one of the funniest parts in the story. But I didn't like the fact they were making fun of him by that name, It was very cruel.I would definitly recommend this book for someone else to read because it's a very enjoyable to read, and most of it is funny. It was also touching too. This book taught me a lot. It taught me how to love myself more, how to be more sincere of myself, how to feel comfortable about myself and not ashamed, and also how to be more concerned about myself. I thought the author's style of writing was, funny, interesting, creative, unique, and outstanding. I really liked it. I wish I could meet the author of this book so I can tell him how much I enjoyed his writing. Because my words can't express the way I feel. This book was definitly appropriate for my age group because it had a lot of words in it that I had never heard of before. So you could learn more good words to say and how to say them. I think the author should have had more mysteries in it. I also think he could of ended it more positive than he did. FREAK THE MIGHTY WAS THE BEST BOOK I EVER READ.

This story is about the life of a normal boy named Maxwell. You see, he has a normal life that is until Freak comes along. Freak is not a normal person. He is a very short individual who is like a sci-fi geek. Maxwell feels sorry for Freak so he walks over to Freak and starts to spend time with him, and that is when all the chaos starts to unfold. There were many adventures in Freak the Mighty, and not all of them were fun in games adventures. One of the first adventures that Freak and Max had was... the dictionary. Yes, I said the dictionary. Freak talks real smart like a dictionary so Maxwell is taken to Freak's house to look at words in the dictionary. Max figured out that all the words highlighted in red in the dictionary were words that Freak already knew. The second adventure they had was a trust game. Max didn't completely trust Freak so one day Freak climbed upon Max's shoulders and covered Max's eyes while Max rode has bike. Freak gave directions to Max while driving. Freak did not let Max crash so Max started to grow a trust bond. The next adventure the two kids has was searching for treasure. Only thing is, the treasure turned out to be an old purse with no money in it. They were both disappointed because they were searching for treasure until 12 a.m. The last adventure they had together was Killer Kane. Now, you may think that Killer Kane is a prisoner, and you're correct, but he got out of prison and is Max's dad! Everybody thought that Killer Kane killed someone, when he really didn't. And one night Killer Kane came to Max's house and dragged him out of the house and started spending time with Max. Max was scared but then realized that his dad was innocent.

But on Christmas Eve Max is abducted by his father and tied up and held against his will. Will Freak rescue Max from this threatening fate? Will Max be able to put his father behind bars because Max witnessed what he really did? Can Freak overcome his illness? Freak The mighty is a moving and adventurous story of those who are challenged in life but complete tasks of the impossible. I highly recommend this book because of its great story line, Morals and attention to detail. It's a memorable story about friendship."},{"Title":"Freak The Mighty","review":"Kevin is smart, creative and handicapped. Max is big and has some difficulty learning. Together they become Freak the Mighty and solve all of their problems - well, almost all of their problems. This is an especially poignant book that will appeal to kids who feel left out and alone. Freak's dictionary of terms in the back of the book is hilarious. This should be a must-read for every teenager."},{"Title":"Freak The Mighty","review":"Freak the Mighty by Rodman Philbrick is a nice, funny and sad book with a little action. It's about two teenager boys. One boy has a growing problem and the other one thinks he has no brain. One day they meet and become friends and help each other and have many adventures together. I think it was funny that when Max was in day care he invented the game of kick-boxing, kick-knees, kick-faces, kick-teachers and kick-the-other-little-day-care-critters. Another part that I liked is when Max was kidnapped by his father and then Freak went to save him with a squirt gun. I think it was a great book."},{"Title":"Freak The Mighty","review":"The story is from the point of view of Max, an eighth grader who is huge for his age. He lives with his grandmother and grandfather (Gram and Grim) because his mom was suspected to be murdered by his father. Max has low self esteem and low confidence of his own knowledge.Over the summer, A boy named Kevin (nicknamed Freak) moves into Max's neighborhood. Freak has a form of dwarfism and needs a cane and leg braces to walk. Max and Freak quickly become friends and spend lots of time doing medieval quests.The climax of the story begins when Max's Father Steals Max from Grim and Gram.....This is an interesting book that has many twists to keep you flipping the pages and teaches has many life lessons. My only complaint was that the book was too short. I recommend this book to all preteens and teens to learn about friendship and expand your imagination."},{"Title":"Freak The Mighty","review":"Freak the mightyWell freak the mighty is a 5 star book in my opinion.

I would recommend this book to people who love to read or is in 5th graders and on because some of the words are harder then usual. The reason my classmates enjoyed this book was that some parts were very funny and some were very sad. The one thing that disturbed me very much was when the grandparents kept him in the down under(basement). So his dad got him and ran away. This book taught me that you always have a friend somewhere. I thought the author's style of writing in the book was maybe his life was like that or someone he knew had that kind of a life.

His name is Kevin although everyone calls him Freak. Freak has a good friend named Maxwell. Everyone calls him Max. While, Kevin is smart and short, Max is just the opposite. Max is a Learning Disabled child. For most of his educational life he was in a special school. Max is also a very tall, large child like his dad. Max and Freak go on adventures together.

Max is a learing disabled and extremely large boy. During the summer of eighth grade, Max and Kevin meet and unite as Freak the Mighty.

This book was recommended to me, and I would absolutely recommend that you read it."},{"Title":"Freak The Mighty","review":"Alex Borring12/01/04Freak the MightyBy: Rodman PhilbrickISBN # 0-439-28606-9\\"I never had a brain until Freak came along....\\" The book is about a boy named Max Kane. There is a boy named Kevin whose nickname is \\"Freak\\". Freak has a disease that makes his body stay the same, but his brain still grows so Freak might not live for very long. Freak is very smart too. He has this dictionary that he reads constantly so he knows what every word means. Max lives with his \\"Grim and Gram\\", which are nicknames for his grandparents. His mom died when he was little. His dad is a murderer and his nickname is \\"Killer Kane.\\" At first in the beginning of the book Freak tells Max that he is doing to die. So Max and Freak didn't get off to a great start. During the course of the book Max and Freak begin a friendship. They go on tons of adventures together. Then one day Freak asks Max if he can tell him a secret so Freak tells Max that he is going to get a new body, like a robot body. So the book goes on from there and there is a lot of suspense. The genre of the book is fiction. Also if you wanted to know it is called Freak The Mighty because when Max put Freak on his shoulders Freak called themselves Freak the MightyI liked this book because it left you in suspense all the time. It also teaches you not to judge a book by its cover. I would definitely recommend this book to kids of ages from 5th to 8th grade. People who would like this would be people who love suspense and very good books. This book was a page-turner because it tells you so much info at the end of the chapter so it makes you have to keep reading. It was hard to concentrate on other things in class because you keep reading and reading and reading. Mostly every chapter ended in a cliff-hanger like this one, \\"I run out in the street and start waving my arms and jumping up and down so they'll know where to stop, and I keep running back in the house to check on things, but the Fair Gwen says there's nothing we can do except wait.\\" This is a really good book so I think that everyone should read this book if they get a chance."},{"Title":"Freak The Mighty","review":"Freak The MightyIn the book Freak the Mighty Freak is little and has a disease.

I have already read it three times in a row. Definitely a keeper! Freak the Mighty has everything from humor, knights in shining armor, to sadness and friendship. Love that book!"},{"Title":"Freak The Mighty","review":"If you are looking for a weird, funny, daring, and exciting book, this is the one for you. Oh! Also, this has a big thing about friendship in it.This book tells about a boy named Maxwell Kane(Max) who is about seven feet tall. Also a boy named Kevin (Freak) who is a very smart thirteen year old, but had a gene dissorder so is about three feet tall. Anyway, this book tells how they befriend each other and go on many \\"adventures\\". These \\"adventures\\" are not real, but Max and Freak still have a good time on each one. Throughout the whole book, one adventure stands out. It is so important that if it did not happen, the last four chapters of the book, would not of happened.I liked this book soooooooooooooooooo much that I would recemend it to anyone. It is so good that there are no bad parts in it. There is one sad part, but it is not till the very end so I think you should read the book anyway!\\"Freak the Mighy!\\" he shouts, \\"Freak the Mighty strikes again!\\""},{"Title":"Freak The Mighty","review":"\\" Run, run, run, into the H2O.\\"\\" Huh?\\"\\" Into the water dummy.\\"\\" I'm stuck, I'm also sinking.\\"\\" Their running. Here comes the cops.\\"\\" Good because I'm up to my knees.\\"\\" Thank you, sir.\\"The book, Freak the Mighty, is a good book of friendship and good family. I also think that Rodman Philbrick did a good job describing the characters.Freak, Kevin, was made fun of a lot. At school he was stared at a lot. He was not mad or sad that the kids were staring at him because he was used to it. They were making fun of him because of his disability.Max's grandparents are very nice. They took him in after his mom died. His grim and gram didn't like his dad and refer to him as \\"him\\"(you will find out why when you read this book).Max's grandparents are also embarrassed because of his height and because he looks just like his father. That is way he has to live in the down under(the basement). His grim made the home down in the basement.The part of the book that was unbelievable was what happened at the end. Our teacher was almost crying and he has read the book many times. If you like sad and funny books you should read this book.I think the reason they named this book Freak the Mighty is because if you saw Kevin you would think he was a freak to. If you saw Max you would think he was mighty too. At school you can not separate them and Kevin makes up Freak the Mighty.Max is a very good friend to Kevin. Max even carried Kevin every where they went and they went a lot of places. Max would get tired but he never gave up. After have a great friend like Kevin Max should have not had to go though with that, but Kevin know it would happen someday. Just because of Kevin's disabled he was stared at a lot, but most of the time he was smarter than the rest. Max calls his grandparents grim and gram, are very nice for taking in Max. Max's grandparents don't like his dad. Max and Kevin are very good friends and Max should have not had to go though that."},{"Title":"Freak The Mighty","review":"Big awkward Max, whose looks reminded everyone of his father, Killer Kane, tells his story of a very special relationship with his little buddy, Kevin (Freak). Max is a very angry and confused eighth grade boy. One summer Max becomes reacquainted with Kevin, a boy he had met in preschool many years ago, who has a syndrome which prevents his body from growing properly. Their relationship is one of strength, both mentally and physically. They accept each other as they are and strive to bring out the best in each other. This story is one of loneliness, anger, sadness, joy, defiance, daring and a willingness not to accept life as is or the limitations placed on oneself by society. I would highly recommend this book for Middle School students."},{"Title":"Freak The Mighty","review":"This just might be my favorite book ever. I usually like more realistic stories, but even though the actions Max and Kevin take aren't always completely believable, their friendship and thoughts definitely are, and it still keeps you wanting to read on. Philbrick makes Max and Kevin seem like such wonderful people you really wish you could meet them when the book ends. Kevin particularly is a smart character who actually has a sense of humor and is not too geeky perfect, which is something you don't see as much as you should. That brings me to another good point about this book- even though it has parts with a lot of action and a very sad ending, there ARE funny parts, which make it a big relief from your average depressing YA novel. If you like this, I also recommend the movie,which is a little bit hard to find, but excellent if you can get your hands on it."},{"Title":"Freak The Mighty","review":"What a Fantastic Book. Shows the true bond of friendship and teaches you a lesson about being different. This moving story touches your heart with a way I never thought was possible."},{"Title":"Freak The Mighty","review":"Freak the Mighty was an awesome book! But the part that I hated was when Freak dies. But I still liked it. I borrowed it from the library and I liked it so much I went out and baut it!"},{"Title":"Freak The Mighty","review":"Most books for children/young adults I've read (at 13) are either horror stories or romance. The characters are unbelievable, the plots are strange. But Freak the Mighty had the best dialogue of any book I've ever read, easy-to-believe situations, and true-to-life character reactions and emotions. I loved it, my parents and teachers think it's appropriate reading material, and I recommend it to ANYONE who wants a short but wonderful read!"},{"Title":"Freak The Mighty","review":"I enjoyed the book, Freak the Mighty which was written by Rodman Philbrick, even though I really do not like to read. It was not the most exciting book I have ever read, but it was okay. The book was about a boy named Freak living in a community where another boy moved in. The two boys did not get along at first, but as the book progressed, they started to get along and be good friends. If you like books that are short, yet drawn out, then this is the book for you. The characters do such funny things that it keeps you wanting to read. YUou can tell the author took his time in writing this book. In conclusion, have fun and good reading."},{"Title":"Freak The Mighty","review":"The ages for this book says 9-12. Don't be fooled. I'd say 9-Infinity. I'm 14 and I cherish this book. I have a huge movie poster of the movie based on this book, &quot;The Mighty&quot;. It's signed by the author, too. Everyone who comes into my room gives it a weird look.But, really, this book is a magical tale of a deep friendship between two boys. Max is an oversized boy who lives with his grandparents after his father killed his mother. Max isn't very smart. &quot;I never had a brain until Freak came along&quot; he claims. When his peers see him, they chant, &quot;Killer Kane Killer Kane had a kid who has no brain&quot;, in reference to his father, &quot;Killer Kane&quot;. Then, one day, he notices someone moving into the house next door to him. The woman has a boy Max's age who is small and with a health problem. He calls himself Freak. Freak loves everything to do with the Middle Ages. Soon, Max and Freak become one person, Freak the Mighty, and are fighting knights and dragons in a far-off lands in their imaginations. But then they're faced with the very real problems of Max's father, and Freak's illness.Read this book, then buy the movie! Both are exceptional!"},{"Title":"Freak The Mighty","review":"I really enjoyed Freak the Mighty (...). It really touched my classmates and I. Some of us were actually crying tears. But I liked the beginning and the end, I just didn't like the last part of the story. I really thought it was funny when they were calling Max, \\"Maxi Pad\\", but I didn't like the fact that they were making fun of him by that name. I Think it's just cruel. I would definitly recommend this book for someone else to read because it's really an enjoyable book to read, it has a lot of funny parts in it. But it's also touching too. This book taught me a lot. It taught me how to love myself more, how to be more sincere of myself, how to feel comfortable about myself and not to be ashamed of who I am, and it also taught me to be more concered about myself. I thought the auther's style of writing was very creating, funny, unique, interesting, and outstanding. I wish I could meet the author of this so I can tell him how amazed I was of his writing. My words can't even explain how I feel about this story. This book was definitly appropriate for my age group because it has different words in it that you've probably never heard of. And it teaches you to be more of person than you probably are to people and yourself. I think the author should have had more mysteries in it than he did. He also should have ended more positive. FREAK THE MIGHTY IS THE BEST BOOK EVER TO READ. I CAN HARDLY WAIT TO READ MAX THE MIGHTY BECAUSE I KNOW IT'LL BE AS GOOD AS FREAK THE MIGHTY. PEACE OUT YA!!"},{"Title":"Freak The Mighty","review":"I am going to talk about why I liked Freak the Mighty! There were many reasons I liked it. At first when I started I was confused. I really like the character of Freak because he always had something to do or say. I would recommend this book to people who like adventures and the doctors. The one reason people in my class liked it was because Max always called himself and other people butthead. The on thing that bothered me was that Max' s dad was a killer. I thought the author should've added more detail in the last two chapters. I think I may just read it again @ home."},{"Title":"Freak The Mighty","review":"The book, Freak The Mighty was pretty good. I liked it because Freak (Kevin) was always making up some kind of journey. Max was always hanging out with Freak. You could say that they were best friends.Freak is called that particular name because he has braces on his legs, and everyone thinks he's retarded or something. But really he's a boy genius! He knows everything there is to know about...well...almost everything! He even says words that his teacher don't know! On the other hand, there's Max. Not the smartest person in the world! Basically, Freak talks like he's some sort of scientist or something and Max has no idea what he's talking about! So of course, Freak has to explain to him almost every word he says.I don't like the book because the beginning is not all that interesting. It's basically at the end where all the action is, but other than that, it was pretty ok!"},{"Title":"Freak The Mighty","review":"I thought that Freak the Mighy, the story was a very interesting and better than all the books i have ever read in my life and it was also sad.

Max and freak were both seventh graders.Maxwell was a very big boy and wasn't very attractive, he wasn't very smart ether.On the other hand freak was a genius,his favorite book was the dictionary, but the sad part was that he was crippled. Freak lived with his mother and Maxwell lived with his grandparents which was also known as Grim and Gram.Maxwells dad was in prison everybody know him and hated him , he was called \\"Killer Kane\\". He killed Maxwells mom, so that's why he lives with his grandparents. Maxs needed Freaks brain and Freak needed Maxwells body so they both needed something from someone.

This book is about two boys who are very much opposites but become best friends. Freak has a genius brain and is very intelligent, though he is handicapped. He befriends a boy named Max, who, is unusually tall and large. Together, they go on adventures, which will be found out when you read this amazing book by Rodman Philbrick, who by the way, is a great author. He describes the adventures, stories, characters, and the way they feel in the book so well, that the reader thinks they are real. I recommend this book to 7th-9th graders. If you choose to read this book you will be amazed by what you will find hidden inside the pages."},{"Title":"Freak The Mighty","review":"I have read many good novels in my life but this has got to be on of the most exciting and fulfilling book ever.

I would give this novel a 6-star rating if I could."},{"Title":"Freak The Mighty","review":"I read Freak the Mighty aloud to my class of struggling 9th grade readers, while they read along in their copies. The book held their attention, and it was easy for these students to make connections to their own lives. I used this brief text to model how good readers read books- thinking about ways Max and Kevin's experiences mirror stuggles we all have in finding ways to fit in and find true friends. They loved this book, and as a culminating activity we watched the film The Mighty and compared/contrasted it to the novel. I would highly recommend this book as an entry-level novel for struggling adolescent readers."},{"Title":"Freak The Mighty","review":"Freak the Mighty, by Rodman Philbrick, was an interesting book with some of the best cliff hangers I have read in my life.

The characters in the story are interesting,colorful, and larger than life. Kevin, \\"Freak,\\" has miquirio's disease whick means his organs grow faster than his body, which means he eventually collapses and dies.

I understand that even though somebody mihty look wierd or be kind of dumb they still can be your friend. Max is this tall kid that is not the brighties kid around. Max lives with grandma and grandpa he don't really live in the cousies place beacause he lives in their basement. Kevin is this short kid who lives next door to Max and Kevin is this very shot kid. At the begining of the book Max and Kevin were enemies. The author solved the problem by making Max and Kevin become best friends. Since Kevin was so short and Max was so tall Max use to ride Kevin on his sholders and Kevin was like the brain and Max is like a giant. This is a good book because at the begining two friends that did not know they were friends became friends and they became friends and they atteched like glue. I would recommend this book to somebody who like adventure books."},{"Title":"Freak The Mighty","review":"Hey, if you never read this book you should take my advice on how great this book is.The conflict was that Max did not know the answers to a large amount of questions and a kid named Kevin helped Max with the questions. I rated this book 4 out of 5 stars because it is not the best book I have ever read. This book relates to my life because I feel that I don't know the answers to a lot of question and I need somebody to help me with the questions. My favorite part from this book is when they are running from the police.My favorite line from the book is when Kevin yelled at the doctor and said\\"I am never going ti the doctor again\\". I would recommend this book to anybody from the age of 12 to 15 because you have to be older to understand this book."},{"Title":"Freak The Mighty","review":"\\"I came back. Like I promised.\\" This quote truly outlines the suspense and action in the novel Freak the Mighty. In my opinion, it was one of the greatest novels that I have ever read. I loved the book and it was amazing. This is the first book that I have read from Rodman Philbrick. It will surely not be my last. I loved the suspense and drama throughout the novel. I thought that the saddest part in the book was when Kevin died because Max had to endure his death. I thought that it was scary when Max's dad came back to kidnap him. Although it was scary, that is when I truly started to get interested in reading the novel even more.If I had the choice to recommend the book to a friend of mine, I would definitely consider it because of it's climactic scenes and sad themes combined to keep it a well-balanced novel. Freak the Mighty is now in my top list for greatest action drama novels that I have ever read and I think that I would want friends of mine to read the book in their free time so they enjoy it.Some of the parts in the book that I did not like, however, were the school scenes. Some of them, I understood somewhat, and others, not at all. The hardest scene for me to understand was when they started prancing around the room and chanting. It just did not seem to fit the rest of the scene. It went from a schoolboy theme to a superman theme in just a few sentences and that was just a bit fast for me.Overall, Freak the Mighty was great and I would probably give it an honest rating of about eight out of ten. Rodman Philbrick has an amazing style of writing so I will surely read more of his books in the future."},{"Title":"Freak The Mighty","review":"\\"I never had a brain until Freak came along and let me borrow his for a while, and that's the truth, the whole truth...\\". \\"Together they were Freak the Mighty\\". Freak the Mighty is a wonderful book. It is book with a lot of imagination and it really gets you in the adventure. Once you start reading it you won't want to stop. You book will wonder what is going to happen next. Freak the mighty are a really entertaining story. Kevin or should I say Freak is a kid with a gigantic brain who knows almost everything. Freak is small for his age. He has read and memorized the dictionary. Max is very big for his age but he is learning disabled; kids say he has no brain. They sing to him: \\"Killer Kane, Killer Kane, had a kid who got no brain\\". Killer Kane is his dad his real name is Kenny Kane.

The book Freak the Mighty showed me what it is like to be a kid with problems. Like on page 86, Freak is choking on American chop suey. It must be very scary to be a kid who knows he is going die soon. On page 99, Max's dad is taking him from Grim and Gram. Max must have been scared to be taken from his home. The setting helps make Freak the Mighty exciting. One example is on page 87, when Freak is at school and he goes to the hospital because he's choking. Another is on page 146, when Freak is having a birthday in his home and he has a seizure. The theme and the setting make the book interesting. I would recomend this book to any young reader. It makes you wonder what is next. I wonder what happens to Max in the sequel."},{"Title":"Freak The Mighty","review":"I loved the book."},{"Title":"Freak The Mighty","review":"This book just blew my mind away.

Freak the Mighty was a book about friendship. Max Kane never had a brain or a friend until Freak showed up. The book message is this. People who have learning disabillities can over come them if some one cares about them and can help guide them. Freak cared enough to help guide Max into learning and school. Max cared about Kevin and helping him particeapate in life and letting him do things that he only dreamed about when Max wasn't in his life.

I hate to give it up now as my copy isn't in such great shape!! I am very pleased. Thank You so much!I love all the books written by Doris Miles Disney. Who Rides A Tiger is mesmerizing. It kept me guessing and trying to figure everything out from the beginning to the end.This is definitely a \\"can't put it down book\\". Actually, it is one of my very favorite books of all time. And I have always been an avid reader. Try it yourself-you'll be just asfascinated as I was. It is set in the mid 1940's but actually is about things which transpired between 1860's to 1940's. An excellent read!!"},{"Title":"Who Rides a Tiger","review":"Haven't read this one yet, but here's the back cover.When it came to snubbing poor relations, wealthy old Aunt Harriet could have written the book--and did. When she finally died, all she left them was her lifelong diary, in 14 formidable volumes. Grandniece Susan sentenced herself to read every paragraph. Somewhere in this infernal journal she hoped to find a key that would provide entry to Harriet's will.She learned of 2 ruined romances--one accidentally deleted, the other deliberatley erased. She followed the diarist's painful passage from blithe young girl to bitter old woman. What was in the lines saddened Susan. What was between them terrifed her. She had a powerful inkling that Harriet's history had been penned, not in ink, but in blood--and that this diary would have dire results!"},{"Title":"The Pacific Ocean (Oceans)","review":"Informative look at the Pacific Ocean.

I will be sure to order this book because I think as many copies should be sold as possible!!"},{"Title":"A Crazy Occupation: Eyewitness to the Intifada","review":"This is an amazing read. Jamie Tarabay brings home what it's like to live in a war zone in a way few other reporters have in recent memory. The combination of personal details and experiences, along with touching and poignant descriptions of the tragedy of war make this book unique in its class.Refreshingly, the reporting is unbiased and fair, unlike most of the mass media reporting we all see on TV every night. Rather than focusing on good guys and bad guys, Jamie shows us that all sides in the Middle East conflict are made up of people who are very similar in so many ways, who all have fear, and anger, and who all bleed alike and die alike.After reading this book, not only will you have come to know and understand the crisis in the Middle East much more completely, but you will also have come to know and understand the working of a young, innocent and apparently fearless reporter putting her life on the line every day for the sake of the assignment. It's easy to become a big fan of this author very quickly, and one can only hope that she will follow up this work with a similar one based on her recent reporting from Iraq. Pulitzer-worthy."},{"Title":"A Crazy Occupation: Eyewitness to the Intifada","review":"Jamie Tarabay tells it as it is without the blandness commonly associated with autobiographies. You relive her experiences with her vivid descriptions of events and her desire to provide an objective an assessment as possible of the troubles around her. She takes you through the highs and lows of life as a reporter in a region many of us never understand. I learnt so much more about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict after reading this book. She explains it in a way that's uncomplicated and makes sense. And her adventures sound like fun, even if ducking bullets by hiding behind a car or hitching a ride with militia is a bit crazy. It's a very good read and I strongly recommend it."},{"Title":"A Crazy Occupation: Eyewitness to the Intifada","review":"Ever wonder what type of person, let alone a woman, wants to live in a war-torn area like Iraq so we can hear on the radio what's going on there? Jamie Tarabay epitomizes an incredibly brave group of people crucial to an open society like ours - reporters who put their lives at risk to inform us about the real conditions and people caught up in such grim circumstances. Jamie's clear-eyed descriptions of her real-time education in the complexities of the Middle East and the intractable Palestine-Israel conflict give the reader a more balanced appreciation of the underlying human and religious issues. I was hoping to learn more about what motivates sophisticated women (and men) reporters like Jamie and Christiane Amanpour to do this type of work. Jamie's book title promises to do this, but ultimately spends more time analyzing the other type of occupation involved. I'm very relieved to hear Jamie reporting for NPR from Baghdad in the New Year - I can continue to root for and care about her now that I know better who she is. Thank you and well done, Jamie!"},{"Title":"Paris and the Surrealists","review":"This book is an interesting experiment, partly a Surrealist documentary, it brings chance into the fairly predictable realm of history/autobiography. George Melly missed the Paris heydey, but did manage to meet and get to know various figures associated with the Surrealists. Moreover, Melly learned the history of Surrealism, and attempts to weave this history into a meaningful journey - much like the random journeys down the back-alleys such as the Surrealists enjoyed. Yet, the narrative itself is only partially worthwhile. If Melly was perhaps a larger figure in the history at hand, his story would gain in importance. As it stands, however, his tale remains one man's description of his brush with fame. The story is interesting only as a way of contextualizing the history.The other \\"half\\" of the book revolves the black and white photographs contributed by Michael Woods. These images show a Paris relatively unchanged from the Surrealist era. That is, one sees objects and images similar to what Breton, et. al, may have seen, and, occasionally, one glimpses places and structures that are indeed what the Surrealists saw. Again, these images are an interesting way of contextualizing the history.What is interesting about the book, however, is the way that the images and writing interacts. There is a deliberate attempt to juxtapose the two, yet there remains an element of chance in the success of these attempts. At times one has a Joycean epiphany, at others one is left to try and decide how these disparate objects intersect, if they intersect at all.As an addition to a library on Surrealism, Surrealists, or 20th century Paris, this book may be worthwhile. I would not recommend it, however, as a primary source for understanding the movement of or the people involved in Parisian Surrealism."},{"Title":"The New Management of Engineering","review":"The work starts out with a history of engineering management and then moves on toward what is and can go wrong with the management process. It emphasizes the roles of engineers from entry level, on to senior level and then to management where management gets little training in that skill, yet is asked to manage nonetheless.Among many tasks managers should mentor and train junior managers and because of many pressures, i.e., time to market, downsizing, etc. there is little time allowed for this activity. Engineers often do not get the benefits of their senior colleagues. This management weakness falls on all forms of engineering from design to manufacturing.The work advises that managers should understand what is working and what is not and to develop the new tools to better run an engineering department."},{"Title":"Runaway teen (A Signal book)","review":"I loved this book...but NOT for its realism, that's for sure. It's put forward as a warts-and-all, true to life account of what happens when a girl runs away from home (in this case, a basically loving home because of the SEEMING oversight of her birthday), but it's soft &amp; gentle to the point of fairy tale. The dialog is unrealistic, especially that of the &quot;bad guys,&quot; and the ending partially defies logic. BUT. I loved the dated-ness of the book, its good intentions, and the believable kindness of some of the characters. Enjoyed the accounts of a young girl staying at a hostel of sorts without friends or money, and the descriptions of her dreary assembly line job. The subtle romantic angle was sweet and compelling. Worth a read, definitely...just don't see it as the Gospel of the times."},{"Title":"HeartLove: Wedding and Love Poems (English and English Edition)","review":"This book shows once again the type of emotions that Haki R.

At best, this is a \\"Greatest Hits\\" record--though that said, it's a bit like buying Bob Dylan's Greatest Hits. It's good in that it touches every portion of his career, but since Duncan worked so fiercely in the poetics of the series and the idea of \\"the book of poetry,\\" ultimately it leaves the reader wanting."},{"Title":"Selected poems (The Pocket poets series)","review":"While a bit disappointing and limited (as all \\"Selected Poems\\" will be), this volume succeeds as an introduction to Robert Duncan's impressive body of work. Particularly of interest are the excerpts from early volumes (pre- \\"The Opening of the Field\\" and presumably out of print) which evidence Duncan's evolution. Along with Jack Spicer and Robin Blaser, Robert Duncan revolutionized American poetry during the Berkeley renaissance; their triumvirate of influence, more so than any combination of Beat writers, defined homosexual poetics in the twentieth century. The addition of Kenneth Rexroth and Weldon Kees to the list of great Californian poets of that period makes a good case for it being the most underrated generation of American poets. Sadly, unlike the other four, Duncan has never had a \\"Collected Poems\\" assembled for him. Let's hope that someday soon, that will be rectified."},{"Title":"Selected poems (The Pocket poets series)","review":"\\"How will we sing the Lord's song in a strange land?\\" cries the Psalmist.

The course ran weekly for 2 hours during an entire academic year and it was expensive. This would seem to have parochial interest only; it didn't. When Thomas O'Connor held forth, the large lecture hall was filled.Doctor O'Connor is an inspired lecturer. The facts flowed orderly, abundantly and quite effortlessly into my spiral bounds. This was a refreshing experience that I have not so often encountered [and I have had lots of experience].My interest in Boston began as a volunteer guide for Boston By Foot. It soon became clear that Boston has stories, legends, myths and scandals at every curb stone. The city is a walkable historical delight for those in the know.The colonial and maritime importance of Boston can not be overemphasized. Its growth and declines informed and mirrored our national history.My class notes from Harvard take up two invaluable notebooks. I refer to them often for my tours and lectures.THIS BOOK IS THOSE NOTES!"},{"Title":"A History of the Marranos","review":"This book provides a very accurate history of this dark chapter of European/Christian history. Obviously, there have been updates since this book has been published; still it remains relevant and actual."},{"Title":"A History of the Marranos","review":"Cecil Roth's History of Marranos...was the first book that I read about that concerned my family's background. As I mentioned before in other reviews, The Sefaradim are always chronicled by Tudescos (Askenazim). To put it lightly, they are at best insensitive and at worst condecending towards our history and worse towards our future. I wish that this wasn't the case but history shows that we have been cast in the worst light by our Nothern Jewish brethern. The History of the Sefaradim is complex, rich in duality, and historical romanticism. The irony of being chronicled by Tudescos, is that they romantize about the riches of our Spanish Golden Era and the injustices of the our inquisition. They use this as propaganda to show the greatness of Jewish history (Tudesco inclusivity) and the sufferning complex of the Jewish soul. Yet in \\"their\\" halacha there is strong contention against our brethern (Tudesco exclusivity) returning from their Jewish exile, within the ranks of Christianity. The very same thing happened in 17th Century Amsterdam i.e., The Tudesco's condecending view of Sefaradim returning from Christian Iberia, as if they were Jews to be doubted, as if it was their fault that our parents had a choice in forced convercion? That is why as sefaradim we must question every historical account and halacha emminating from our Tudesco brethern, including Roth's skewd account. In Amsterdam their was a Sefardic tradition to not buy Casher meat from their butchers, they could not be trusted. In our days when a Jewish soul wants to come back to Their rightful religion and look for help within the Askenazi realm, they are rejected and forced to be rebaptized( that is what it ends up being) as Jews. This hummiliation is gross and has no basis that is found in the Tora, both written or oral. Yet they, the Tudescos, have placed it upon themselves to rewrite Talmudic halacha to suit their needs. In this book we find Roth saying that the Sefaradim have accepted the moniker Marrano as a \\"badge of honor\\", and that the anusim (forced converts) descendent of Sefaradim are no longer with us and dissapered from this Earth. This is pure hyperbole of the worst kind, The desendents of the Sefaradim are here right now. Amonay (G-D) has not abanded us nor forgotten us, perhaps Amonay has protected us to this day so that we can not be doubly tainted by the Tudesco mess of Secular Zionism and their weird religion.As a historical chronical, Roth's, History of the Marranos, is somewhat factual and somewhat skewed. I hardly recommend it, because Roth can never be our spokesperson. He is a good writter and witty at times, but he also is blind as a bat when it comes to the Sephardic phenomena. Therefore, read it with a grain of salt."},{"Title":"A History of the Marranos","review":"I received my book promptly and in good order."},{"Title":"Not the End of the World","review":"The more I think about Not the End of the World, the more the book seems to mean to me. Generally, the progress works the other way around. It says a lot about Atkinson as a writer how powerfully the book manages to keep a hold on my mind.Atkinson creates a layered confection of characters both real and mythic. They live in a time just bordering the apocalypse. The world in which they live is often shallow and full of troubles, but is beautiful in contrast to the great pit of nothing waiting past the implied boundary. It is not an uplifting book, and when I finished it I was left with a feeling of bleakness. This is time out of time, and it is more frightening than hopeful.While I do not expect a book to give up its secrets too easily, it did sometimes feel as though Atkinson were being deliberately obscure. Several of the stories had the feel of letters that you find in the street, or a conversation half heard around the corner. She was not generous with the doors into to the developing project of the book. As a reader, there were times when I would have appreciated just a wee bit more transparency.This is the first Atkinson that I have read. It will not be the last."},{"Title":"Not the End of the World","review":"I'm willing to bet that Kate Atkinson didn't color inside the lines when she was a little girl. She's a born subversive, and her charming, alarming, crazy quilt fiction catches the reader off-balance. &quot;Normal&quot; categories get messed with: Realism morphs without warning into fantasy; past, present and future are melded and skewed; people are never quite what they seem. These qualities shone in her first and most brilliant book, BEHIND THE SCENES AT THE MUSEUM (the Whitbread Book of the Year in 1995), as well as in two other novels (HUMAN CROQUET and EMOTIONALLY WEIRD), and they are equally evident in NOT THE END OF THE WORLD, a collection of 12 stories.The narratives are neither clearly connected nor totally distinct (Atkinson doesn't do anything conventionally). Occasionally she recycles characters: The sullen adolescents whom she evokes with absolutely perfect pitch in &quot;Dissonance&quot; reappear, a few years older but still obnoxious, in &quot;Wedding Favors.&quot; More frequently, though, a featured player in one story becomes a peripheral character in another; members of the Zane family, a large American clan, thread their way in and out of several tales, as do a self-absorbed celebrity mom and a nanny who is a worthy successor to Mary Poppins. Detecting these links is wonderfully diverting for the reader --- kind of like a Chinese puzzle --- and it also has the effect of unifying the collection. Atkinson's people all seem to inhabit more or less the same eccentric universe, which is Scotland (she lives in Edinburgh) and at the same time another place: more mysterious, less nameable.Usually I prefer my &quot;magical&quot; and my &quot;realism&quot; well separated, like carrots and peas on a dinner plate. But Atkinson is so adept and her narrative voice so persuasive that after a while I began to enjoy the sudden shifts from ordinary life to fairy tale, from anxiety to horror, from a bad day to the end of the world. Perhaps her inspiration here is the cult show Buffy the Vampire Slayer (to which the characters in several stories are hopelessly addicted), an odd hybrid of teen TV fare and spookier, more complex life-and-death drama. Take &quot;Temporal Anomaly,&quot; wherein a lawyer named Marianne has an unusual out-of-body experience, or the amazing consequences when a woman without a boyfriend adopts a stray in &quot;The Cat Lover.&quot; Often, the realistic side of her stories involves broken families and deserted children. In &quot;Tunnel of Fish,&quot; &quot;Sheer Big Waste of Love&quot; and &quot;Unseen Translation,&quot; we encounter three small, wise, almost painfully controlled boys who are among Atkinson's most touching inventions.What I didn't like was the epigraphs that precede each story. They're wildly eclectic, ranging from Buffy to Emily Dickinson to classical sources (including untranslated Greek!), but does the book really need another layer of possible meaning? They struck me as irritating rather than enlightening, like program notes that over-explain instead of letting the work speak for itself. And because some are highly esoteric, they give the mistaken impression that you must have a daunting level of scholarship in order to gain entry to the book.The stories in NOT THE END OF THE WORLD are, in fact, completely accessible --- with the exception of the first and the last, &quot;Charlene and Trudi Go Shopping&quot; and &quot;Pleasureland,&quot; intentional bookends for the collection. On one level, these two tales are simply a big fat ironic play on the title phrase, since what's happening is that the world (as we know it) is ending: weather anomalies and epidemics and warfare and no more radio or TV or food, zoo animals running riot and museums left unpoliced so &quot;people wandered in and took the artifacts and used them to improve their interior d&eacute;cor.&quot;The Charlene and Trudi stories (in both cases, they are the sole characters) are a weird cross between high-literary minimalism and a high-end shopping list, itemizing everything from tea to perfume to fabric. Atkinson seems to be pointing out how little &quot;stuff&quot; matters when it comes to the apocalypse, while at the same time glorying in the sheer sound and texture of words and objects. She also jams in a great many references to themes and people mentioned in the rest of the book, as if Charlene and Trudi's dying days (and dying world) contain and transcend everything else. None of this really works --- and it is particularly discouraging to encounter it right off the bat (I almost threw the book across the room). My advice: Skip Charlene and Trudi until you've read everything else.NOT THE END OF THE WORLD is a grand ride, but I don't think it is Atkinson's best. Too many of the stories, despite their obvious virtuosity, wind up getting by on the author's sarcastic, fantastic riffs and juicy language. She could (dangerously, for her own development) be typecast as wacky rather than deep. I hope she writes another novel next --- preferably about a small boy with profound dignity and a well-concealed longing for love.--- Reviewed by Kathy Weissman"},{"Title":"Not the End of the World","review":"Not the End of the World is an anthology of loosely related pieces. These stories all drift around the common theme of the End of the World. Whether it is on a global scale, or simply changing one's path through life, these World Ending events are never addressed directly. Like so many people, the characters in &quot;Not the End of the World,&quot; rarely meet their fate directly. Then again, events that often appear to be the End of the World are not really the end of the world at all.In keeping with the theme of not facing an event directly, what is most intriguing about these pieces is not the central plot, but rather the peripheral occurrences. For example, in the first piece &quot;Charlene and Trudi Go Shopping,&quot; the plot is summed up by the first sentence, &quot;'I want,' Charlene said to Trudi, 'to buy my mother a birthday present.'&quot; In the end, Charlene finds a present; however, that is not what is fascinating about the story. What is fascinating are the details in the periphery hinting that the end of the world is nigh. It is a world where men see how drunk they can get before the curfew, bombs explode in the distance and the city runs out of diesel and gin. But these details do not directly relate to the selection of a birthday present.In the subsequent pieces, the intriguing peripheral aspects come in the form of defining a larger picture. How are these vignettes related? On the surface, these pieces are related through the relationships between the characters of each story. There is though a deeper relationship, just waiting for reader to tease it out.Despite the lack of a emphasis on plot, this collection is continuously fascinating. What &quot;Not the End of the World,&quot; has to say about life is not something that can be easily expressed. Like any good magician, Kate Atkinson does not reveal how she performs her tricks."},{"Title":"Not the End of the World","review":"It wasn't until I read the reviews here about \\"Not the End of the World\\" that I \\"got\\" what Kate Atkinson was trying to do. I went back and re-read the book with an eye toward the myths and the wrapping together of several characters across different stories. To be honest, even the second time around I was not that impressed with the stories. Yes, Kate Atkinson has a unique voice, one I loved in \\"Behind the Scenes at the Museum\\". Here, though, I felt like there was an inside conceit that was inaccessible to the reader. It's been a while since I took Latin, so it would've been nice to have the quotes translated. Atkinson teases us with characters that I would've liked to have seen more developed. It was difficult to muster up sympathy for the characters. Overall, if you are a fan of Atkinson's writing I'd say buy this. If you are approaching Atkinson for the first time, you are better starting with \\"Behind the Scenes at the Museum.\\""},{"Title":"Not the End of the World","review":"A thoroughly fabulous collection of short stories, the book opens with the very intriguing, ironic tale of two women who seem to be carrying on life as usual while in the middle of apocalyptic chaos. The rest of the stories in the book similarly are a mix of the completely mundane and usual and the mythical and extraordinary. Like the Greek myths updated for our time. On one hand the stories are about single mothers, college students, divorcees, troubled teens, hookers, orphans, nannies, office workers, best friends, and hapless husbands. But on the other they are stories of Eos, Artemis, Selene, mermaids, Nereids, Ra, Hades, and Helios. Kate Atkinson magically weaves these themes together in such a way that you are never bored and can never pinpoint the separation of fantasy from reality."},{"Title":"Not the End of the World","review":"I'm not normally a short story fan, preferring something \\"meatier\\", but I gobbled up this collection like a treat. I've re-discovered Kate Atkinson with her last two wonderful \\"mystery\\" novels, \\"Case Histories\\" and \\"One Good Turn\\" and am now going back to her earlier work. This collection is sharp, surprising, very witty, intelligent and thought-provoking."},{"Title":"Not the End of the World","review":"If you are a PBS aficionado (fellow nerd) and adore the hunky Scottish P.I., Jackson Brodie, you are undoubtedly acquainted with Kate Atkinson.

Because of the inability to grow food in Killibol's soil, society is structured around protein producing tanks. As a result of the rigid system of food production (i.e. power), life on Killibol is insular and unchanging. Stagnation.Earth, on the other hand is populated by the people of Rheatt. An artistic, relatively peaceable drug taking bunch. In contrast, the Moon -- which over millions of years has spiraled closer and closer to earth -- is the home of the sadistic and brutal empire-coveting Rotrox who descend in space craft to frequently pillage and indiscriminately kill the Rheattites.Despite the science fiction backdrop, Bayley's work is really an extended gangster movie/dime novel homage. This kind of makes sense since Killibol's cities are ruled by strongmen who no longer have access to food tanks resort to petty crime in the Basement. This amalgamation is actually quite original...Enter, Klein our gangster main character and his brilliantly manipulative friend and master, Becmath. In an attempt to procure a food tank run they run afoul of the police and other more powerful food tank strongmen and in a motorized tank gunship (queue scenes from the horrendous 1977 sci-fi film Damnation Alley) flee the city.Scientific research has been replaced by alchemy (a theme Bayley uses heavily in Star Winds). Klein and Becmath take prisoner an alchemist whose books tell of a portal to Earth (the origin of Killibol's inhabitants). The gun ship plunges through the portal and arrives on Earth. Soon, the evil Rotrox invade from the Moon and Klein and Becmath become their allies and teach them how to effectively enslave people.*spoilers*Eventually, our completely unlikeable, occasionally brutal, and unintelligent \\"hero\\" sees the light.Bayley's work builds upon a fascinating backdrop -- that is, Killibol and it's termite cities and their protein tanks. Likewise, having a main character who is on the whole a worthless flunky content to let his boss kill and sleep with the various women he falls is a daring move.However, on the whole the novel comes of as trite and succumbs to endlessly banal set-piece battle scenes to fill up space. Low and behold, I discovered that Bayley expanded an unpublished short story for the first half of the novel -- i.e., the worthwhile part. Bayley still has not figured out how to pace a novel. While good ideas abound (alchemy as the science of a stagnate future, protein tank based society, etc), the characters are unlikable and almost as brutal as the Rotrox.Only pick up the work for it's cover and the first half.......As a reader, I wanted to personally toss the main character in a protein tank.NOT because he was a bad person but because he was COMPLETELY boring bad person...."},{"Title":"Empire of Two Worlds","review":"As with everything this man wrote, the number of ideas per page is enough reason to buy this book, even if the plot was rubbish. But the plot is not rubbish. It's engaging, fast-paced, and (as always with Bayley) profound.A handful of gangsters fleeing one of many self-contained cities on the otherwise lifeless planet of Killibol (colonized by humans in the mist-shrouded past through a 'gateway' based on an all-but-forgetten alchemical technology) would have considered themselves doomed to starvation and probably killed themselves were it not for the overpowering personality, drive and brilliance of their ruthlessly ambitious leader, Becmath, who, having kidnapped and questioned the city's one remaining alchemist, knows the location of the gate and the fact that, despite common-knowledge of its destruction, it may have reconstituted itself over the intervening millennia.His gamble pays off and Becmath's rise to power begins. Klein, Becmath's right-hand man and the protagonist of the novel (if it could be said to have a protagonist) is, as my fellow reviewer points out, not especially likable.None of Bayley's characters are especially likable. They're merely products of their environments like everyone else. There's no room for heros is Bayley's universe. The writer with the hardest of all 'hard science-fiction' outlooks I have ever read, is not a feel-good writer. He looks at the world as through a precision instrument, writing with the closest I have ever seen to a purely objective point of view.While not to everyone's tastes, anyone who respects the true essence of science fiction--fiction based on SCIENCE, should not miss a word he wrote."},{"Title":"Christmas Past to Christmas Present","review":"A book that women will enjoy, love, hope, drama, intrigue can't ask for much more.I could not stop reading once I started, as I flipped each page I was in awe of what might happen next.

Good sea adventure."},{"Title":"Ship and the Storm: Hurricane Mitch and the Loss of the Fantome (Harvest Book)","review":"Within the sail training (or &quot;Tall Ship&quot;) community the loss of the FANTOME was a mixture of &quot;there but for the grace of God go I&quot; and &quot;Windjammer Barefoot Cruises were always a bit seat of the pants&quot;. As stated in the book - The American Sail Training Association annual conference heard papers regarding hurricane prediction and the margins for error soon after the loss and there was much discussion.For those in the &quot;Tall Ship&quot; industry, as opposed to the Cruise Industry, this book appears to lay to rest some myths and contains much in the way of new information. Jim Carrier has not written a scientific paper - his book would not have much appeal if he had, but at the outset he states his &quot;standard&quot; of evidence and then attempts to lay out as objectively as possible what he has learned. Conclusions are left entirely to the reader. His switching between the various authorities, locales, offices and the ship is skilfully done and keeps one aware of the background against which each group of people were working as hurricane Mitch developed.It is a little unfair to say that Carrier doesn't do justice to the ruining of the Honduras economy. Against the story - which is really about the ship - he gives the shore side plenty of coverage.The story is of high interest to a whole different audience than the &quot;Perfect Storm&quot; readers - though I am sure they will learn too.Within the industry there was much debate about Windjammer Barefoot Cruises and their operational methods. Carrier does not get drawn in, he notes the distancing by other operators, presents the facts as he has been able to determine them and leaves the readers to draw their own conclusions.As the Fantome's flag state did not carry out an inquiry this is probably as good an accident report as will ever be generated and from which you can draw your own lessons. If you are a casual reader with an interest - it is a skillfully told account of what happens when nature lets rip and is stronger than anything we can construct to resist it."},{"Title":"Ship and the Storm: Hurricane Mitch and the Loss of the Fantome (Harvest Book)","review":"We went on two Windjammer Barefoot Cruises in the Caribbean before the company went belly up (such a bummer). We weren't on the Fantome, but we knew the captain because he was the captain on our first trip. This book gives all the daunting details of how the Fantome was followed by Hurricane Mitch and after a long chase, finally taken down.

There is a lot of interesting details about the whole background of the ship, the cruise line, and lastly the wreck of the Fantome. I will no doubt read the book again and again.

But more importantly, as the mother of a young man, who with his girlfriend, weathered the storm on the Island of Utila (the western most bay island) during Hurricane Mitch, I have seen the true horror that this incredibly powerful storm wrecked on the Central American coast. I also gained some understanding of the difficulty in predicting the path of this storm and the reason that it was so difficult to get tourists evacuated from these tiny islands.The crew of the Fantome, whether led by a captian that was being directed from Miami, or one that used all of his experience and wiles to try and outwit a monster storm, were indeed brave souls. Carrier's book does something that few can. He takes us into the heart of the storm and tells a story that was truly one of man against the worst that nature can trow at us.A fabulous read, particularly if you plan on cruising the Carribean in the summer or fall. This is not the sappy 'perfect storm' with an ending that is so predictable, but a story of human suffering and emotion that cannot be duplicated."},{"Title":"Ship and the Storm: Hurricane Mitch and the Loss of the Fantome (Harvest Book)","review":"This is an extraordinary book about the loss of the Fantome in Hurricane Mitch. Jim has done an outstanding job of researching the entire story, without prejudice, and from all angles. It contains a great deal of important information about hurricane avoidance and forecasting, as well as about communication with/from the home office, and what is important in the decision making and risk assessment process.I urge every sailor to read it and learn from it.Andy Chase Author of &quot;Auxiliary Sail Vessel Operations"},{"Title":"Ship and the Storm: Hurricane Mitch and the Loss of the Fantome (Harvest Book)","review":"WOW! What a fantastic book and if you ever sailed on the Fantome, it is a must have. Mr. Carrier did an excellent job in researching this book and describing things to the point that I felt as if we were right there in the middle of everything that was going on. Jammers will remember these infamous words, \\"step on the blue, grab the crew\\".We sailed on Fantome many times and in her earlier days before they covered her well deck she gave you the impression of an old pirate ship. The hand carved rails were like pieces of art. We loved this ship, and sailed with Captain Guyan on several occasions, he was a true sailor and one of the nicest people you could ever meet. We also knew most of the crew who were also lost during this savage hurricane named Mitch. The Ship and The Storm by Jim Carrier which I highly recommend was not at all what I expected but more. He not only told of the awesome sight of seeing a tall ship for the first time to those who had never seen one but about the fun that awaited those who would enjoy the adventure of playing pirate for just a little while escaping the every day life. It is suspenseful as well as you get an inside view of what the command center in Miami is watching and how they are tracking this devil storm as she twisted and turned in directions no one would have ever imagined and what it was like not only to fly into a hurricane but being in the eye of the storm as well. Then he gave a view of how the people on land tried to protect themselves and their property. In the end it was fruitless as they were at the mercy of one the worst storms ever recorded. I found it rather eerie when he wrote about the premonitions the wives, girl friends, mothers and family members had. Down right spooky! This was a bitter sweet read for me because as I read I knew exactly what parts of the ship were being referred to. She was a magnificent lady and I mourn her loss to this day but also treasure all her memories. Sadly Fantome which means ghost ship in French really is one now and rests at the bottom of the sea with her Captain & a fantastic crew of guys who were more like family to anyone who ever sailed on this magnificent ship and never to return. May they all rest in peace and never be forgotten.Terry & Gail ~ Pennsylvania, USA"},{"Title":"Ship and the Storm: Hurricane Mitch and the Loss of the Fantome (Harvest Book)","review":"I read this book several years ago, and I just checked Amazon to see if the author had written anything else in the genre of fact-based disaster story (didn't find anything).

The story is fascinating, the book seems to be very well-researched and it is very well written. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Ship and the Storm: Hurricane Mitch and the Loss of the Fantome (Harvest Book)","review":"Exactly one year prior to Hurricane Mitch, I traveled to Belize to scuba dive. On our first day of diving we were joined by a couple sailing on the Fantome. There was also had a woman from the US State Department who was traveling around Central America gathering maps for reference in case of natural disasters. After the dives, we dropped the couple off at the ship and I had the opportunity to see the ship up close. We saw it several other times in the next few days. It was a beautiful and magnificent ship with its four masts. Little did I know how these chance meetings would haunt me 12 months later.Jim Carrier brings the horror and devastation of Mitch home. He describes the history of the ship, from its early days as a luxury yacht to its final service as a cruise ship. It's as if you've experienced a passage yourself, learning about the crew and the families they loved and supported. But it's not just about the ship and her crew. It's about many more people who went through days of hell as this massive storm tore apart the Bay Islands and deluged the mainland of Honduras with massive flooding. Villages were literally wiped out of existance. The statistics of Mitch's destruction are staggering. Carrier provides insight as to what actually happens around the eye wall of a category five.

I love these true crime and mystery books, so I have read a few, and in every single one, that is the case. I have started to call BS on those accounts. I do believe the author and/or publisher puts that stuff in to add drama. I personally think it cheapens the story, that should be riveting enough without the added bull.This book has no fewer than five stories of loved ones having the dreams and \\"signs.\\" It gets old, so old I wanted to throw the book across the room.Aside from that, the meteorological data that took up much of the book was confusing and a bit boring. The only part that I really enjoyed reading was what a slimeball company owner Michael Burke was. It made me furious how he constantly did everything he could in order to not have to keep his boats up to SOLAS standards.If I had read everything that jerk and his greedy family did to skirt the safety standards, I certainly wouldn't have taken a cruise with his company. It's too bad he lived such an opulent life, while risking his passengers and crew's safety with every trip.The wages he paid his crew was laughable too. Who can live off $325 a month. Michael Burke and his family certainly didn't. They became millionaires while taking every penny they could away from the company and it's employees."},{"Title":"Ship and the Storm: Hurricane Mitch and the Loss of the Fantome (Harvest Book)","review":"Jim Carrier's &quot;The Ship and the Storm&quot; blatantly tries to cash in on &quot;The Perfect Storm&quot; phenomena, but so what? His story is very similar, a bunch of hardworking mariners (in this case the crew of a cruise ship rather than a fishing boat) who get caught at sea by a rare freak-of-nature storm that causes them to vanish virtually without a trace. Carrier tells their stories as the tragedy unfolds. He also gives a good account of the power of Hurricane Mitch, the second deadliest storm ever in the Western Hemisphere and the fourth most powerful hurricane ever recorded. Carrier also provides a good account of the destruction of Honduras, which suffered catostrophic flooding and over 18,000 deaths. In fact, if the book has a weakness it's that the story of the cruise ship get a bit too much preference over the greater disater that occurred on shore.Carrier knows how to tell a story and his prose is riveting. He places the reader right with his unfortunate protagonists. And like &quot;The Perfect Storm,&quot; the book describes a unique seafaring way of life. Fans of the other &quot;storm&quot; will love it."},{"Title":"Ship and the Storm: Hurricane Mitch and the Loss of the Fantome (Harvest Book)","review":"This was a fairly balanced story of Catagory 5 Hurricane Mitch and the Windjammer Barefoot Cruise's schooner Fantome in October, 1998 and their horrific crossing of paths. Having sailed two of the Barefoot ships in rapid succession early in my sailing avocation-but switching to the Maine schooner fleet due to the heavy partying at WBC-I was interested in learning what errors were made that resulted in this deadly loss of crew and craft. While the author embroiders a bit too much with the dreams and portents of the crewmember's families at the time of their deaths, the cutting back and forth between the US National Hurricane Center, the Barefoot headquarters and Capt. Guiyan aboard the Fantome laid out the facts. The details of those land-based survivors in the Bay Islands and Honduras give further light to someone who may not have experienced even gale-force wind and water and how it affects your ability to cope. A cautionary tale for those who underestimate the forces of Mother Nature and overestimate man's abilities in dealing with them."},{"Title":"Ship and the Storm: Hurricane Mitch and the Loss of the Fantome (Harvest Book)","review":"This book tells the story of the Sailing Vessel Fantome, and its final encounter with Hurricane Mitch. This story is more compelling than Perfect Storm, in that much of what happened to the ship and crew is known. The majesty of tall ships adds to the dramatic atmosphere in a way a fishing boat cannot. This thoroughly researched and documented story is more meaningful and interesting than Isaac's Storm because of the timeliness and contemporary interviews.This is a story of the most basic man versus nature. It is easier to follow this storm than the one in Perfect Storm. Hurricane Mitch was followed by the modern world from its earliest moments to its predatory fury over Honduras.Jim Carrier has carefully researched and told the story of the Fantome and her history. He has recounted the last month of the ship and its aftermath without any of the sensationalism and second-guessing that was common in so much of the press and in magazine articles afterwards. And finally, he applied \\"Forensic Journalism\\" to draw some conclusions about those moments that we don't know what happened. This is a story that is a fine addition to anyone with an interest in stories of the sea and human drama. Of course, those who have been fortunate to sail on the tall ships will insist on owning this book.As I read this book, I was sailing aboard the S/V Polynesia, another ship of the Windjammer/Barefoot Fleet. To my east, two hurricanes were on the prowl. This added to the chill of reading this book. I knew the Fantome and her crew, and they have a permanent place in my heart. I followed the news closely and shared it with others. I imagined myself in Captain Guyan's place, and thought of the decisions that he would have made. And I cried with the memories as Amazing Grace was played when the sails went up.Jim Carrier had done a remarkable job with his research and this book. Once you read this book, you will understand the truth and the known details of what happened to this beautiful ship and her crew."},{"Title":"Ship and the Storm: Hurricane Mitch and the Loss of the Fantome (Harvest Book)","review":"In &quot;The Ship &amp; the Storm&quot; Jim Carrier has given us a valuable memorial to a tragic loss of life. Additionally, it is an exciting page turner which vividly describes the experience of a killer hurricane.Hurricane Mitch devastated Honduras in October 1998. As readers discover in this book, it also amazed seasoned hurricane researchers with it's unpredictability &amp; bizarre readings. In 24 hours Mitch exploded from being a tropical wave that weathermen were writing off as it weakened, into a killer Category 4 hurricane that would become one of the strongest ever recorded.Meanwhile, off the coast of Honduras, Windjammer Cruises' flag ship &quot;the Fantome&quot; was herding it's flock of vacationers thru the Bay Islands of Honduras. The Captain, Guyan Marsh, was the &quot;golden boy&quot; of Windjammer, beloved by both crew &amp; passengers. Jim Carrier introduces us to Guyan &amp; the crewmembers. We come to know them as individuals &amp; care about them. We also get to experience Fantome's last 2 cruises day by day thru the eyes of her passengers.&quot;The Ship &amp; the Storm&quot; builds suspense inexorably, alternating between the Fantome &amp; the hurricane watchers in Miami. When Mitch &amp; Fantome do meet, the descriptive passages of what the experience of a Category 5 hurricane is like will terrify you.The author is extremely fair, refusing to assign blame for the loss of the Fantome to anyone. The most valuable aspect of &quot;The Ship &amp; the Sea&quot; tho, is as a memorial to the wonderful crew of Fantome. Guyan Marsh &amp; his men sound like exceptional people, &amp; the world is a lesser place for having lost them."},{"Title":"Ship and the Storm: Hurricane Mitch and the Loss of the Fantome (Harvest Book)","review":"It's hard to be unbiased having honeymooned on the Fantome, but I think most readers will agree - this is a good book. For me, it brought some closure to the story that I have followed since first hearing that Fantome was missing. I had searched the internet, the wire services, Windjammer's chat room for news as the drama of Mitch unfolded. Like flotsam and jetsam of the wreckage, news of Fantome's demise came in incomplete pieces. This book assembles these pieces from several perspectives and does an admirable job of illuminating Fantome's storm shrouded fate. Jammers will certainly enjoy the book, but Carrier's book transcends the Windjammer audience. Carrier has crafted a compelling story illustrating the irony of judgement based on the advanced technology of hurricane forecasting to pilot an anachronistic tall ship into the eye of one of the century's most destructive storms."},{"Title":"Ship and the Storm: Hurricane Mitch and the Loss of the Fantome (Harvest Book)","review":"Carrier's book is well-written, blending the track of Hurricane Mitch with the track of the doomed Fantome. Carrier makes the Windjammer crew and company come alive, but at the same time reminds us that the larger tragedy took place on the mainland (Honduras, Nicaragua, Guatemala) where more than 20,000 lost their lives.Carrier doesn't really point fingers, nor does he totally exonerate the Windjammer company in the tragedy (old, underpowered ship, plus questionable decision-making in starting a cruise with a hurricane lurking nearby).In the manner of the best reporting, he lets readers come to their own conclusions. As a passenger on Windjammer ships myself (but not the Fantome), I realized how well he captured the essence of a Windjammer cruise without ever having been on one. This made me trust his reporting on the other matters more."},{"Title":"Ship and the Storm: Hurricane Mitch and the Loss of the Fantome (Harvest Book)","review":"The loss of the M/S Fantome was one of the most tragic and unnecessary marine disasters in years. Mr. Carrier sounds as if he is either best friends with Mike Burke or a Windjammer employee. He fails to deal with the facts, that the ship was 70 years old, had hull damage when she fell over during dry-docking in Martinique, had no watertight compartments, had less than minimum horsepower, and was totally unequipped for extreme heavy weather. The ship was equipped with minimum SOLAS (Safety Of Life At Sea) gear, and was banned by US Coast Guard to carry passengers from US ports because she was unable to meet standards for International Port State Control. Further, he fails to mention Burke's style of management, to intimidate captains and crew. When captains elect prudence and good seamanship over Burke's orders, they are usually replaced. I believe that the incident could have been avoided completely and 33 souls would still be with us today if Burke had not been micromanaging the situation from his suite in Miami Beach via satellite telephone. Many were the opportunities to seek safe harbour and evacuate the crew. This book gives an accurate account of the tragedy, but fails to discuss why the tragedy really occurred, gambling with peoples lives to protect property."},{"Title":"Ship and the Storm: Hurricane Mitch and the Loss of the Fantome (Harvest Book)","review":"I was a passenger on that last trip the Fantone made. We spent only one night on board before being evacuated from Belize City. The Windjammer Corporation took very good care of us and chartered a jet to fly all the passengers and some of the crew from Belize City when they realized the severity of hurricaine Mitch. The book is a very accurate description of the events as I know them. I was so sad when I heard the outcome, having met most of the people who died. Even for me, the book was a great read."},{"Title":"Ship and the Storm: Hurricane Mitch and the Loss of the Fantome (Harvest Book)","review":"The story of the Fantome is a complex one, the company, the ship, the crew, and ultimately the weather all adding their own elements to her loss.Mr Carrier displays a blend of investigative journalism with a true taste of history as he follows the course of this mighty vessel to her final resting place.

The statements from crew and ex-crew were true-to-life. The facts of the scenario were played out in careful succession and segments broken up so as to give the reader a broader picture of the goings-on.While I am biased where it comes to the crew, I'm also biased where it comes to weather details and having sailed with Captain Guyan during the 1997 season in Belize, the entire story is close to my heart.In the book, several rumors are put to rest, second-hand stories of goings on are discussed and a lot of blanks are filled in.

Larded with too much inane chatter saved off the Internet while the drama played out, the book is further flawed by excess padding about the storm's aftermath on the obscure western Caribbean islands where the Fantome sailed. Too long by a third, the tale needed a sharper editor. Still, what Carrier conveys about the ship and its Miami-based company is compelling enough to make up for his reporter's tendancy to include too much unnecessary flotsam about what survivors dreamed as their loved ones died, what the dead men left as their last requests, and what the howling storm sounded like to the many British and American expats who dug holes in the ground to wait out Mitch on islands devastated by the Category 5 storm. What the book makes clear is how stupid the management of Windjammer Cruises was for not canceling the boat's final cruise before the storm got out of control. Evidently, there were many opportunities for the crew to anchor and let the storm possibly damage the ornate boat, but at least their lives would have been saved. Comparisons with \\"The Perfect Storm\\" are silly. Both books are interesting reads. So what if this one followed the bigger bestseller? It is overlooked, but should not be."},{"Title":"Ship and the Storm: Hurricane Mitch and the Loss of the Fantome (Harvest Book)","review":"Many of those who are not particularly interested in ships, hurricanes, Windjammer Cruises, or things nautical will enjoy reading this book. Jim Carrier has produced a tale well told, IMHO.The only two significant shortcomings of the book from my perspective are:1) The relatively high volume of material drawn from what I consider to be the periphery of the &quot;human interest&quot; category (e.g., details of the many dreams the wives and girlfriends of the Fantome crew are said to have had prior to the sinking). That said, many readers may find such material informative and gripping (although I did not).2) The surprisingly short shrift given to the decision-making on Fantome (with the assistance by sat phone from Winjammer HQ)starting at 5 am on October 27th (the ship sank at about 4:30 PM that day). In contrast, the decisions as to where to take the ship, whether to board passengers for a scheduled cruise, whther to abandon or shift the scheduled cruise, what crew to disembark at Belize, and what specific on-board preparations to make for Mitch are well-reported and covered in detail.The options available to Fantome (limited though they were) starting at 5 AM when she gained a lee off the SW coast of Roatan Island deserved a more detailed accounting (the pros and the cons of each) IMHO.I speak particularly of the decision NOT to run East at 5:00 AM as soon as the lee off Roatan had been obtained, but rather the (actual) decision to tack back and forth on a roughly E-W track south of Roatan for over 8 hours until the shifting direction of Mitch's winds made it impossible for Fantome to continue to make good the western leg of her holding pattern a mile or two South of Roatan.As it turned out, Fantome DID run to the East, but over 8 hours in which she could have made good a speed of 7.0 - 7.5 knots to the East were, IMHO, had been (injudiciously) thrown away by the time the decision to run East was made at 1:15 PM.IMHO, it's very clear that, had Fantome run east for the additional 8+ hours, her closest distance to Mitch's center (and, more important, her minimum distnace to the eye wall) would have been increased substantially and (based upon the conditions present when the vessel DID founder) Fantome would likely NOT have sunk.Running east from 5 AM onward would also have placed Fantome in Mitch's navigable semi-circle at a much earlier time, making for easier sailing (relatively easier sailing, anyway!).Given the information known to those managing the Fantome ON THE 27th, I am not aware of any downside to turning East at 5 AM. Nor do the best data subsequently available and described in Jim Carrier's book(including the best analysis that could be done with hindsight)about Mitch's actual track indicate to me that there was a downside to turning East at 5 AM. In contrast, as indicated above, I think there were significant upsides to heading East at 5:00 AM. (even if Mitch's track and speed of advance turned out to be highly unusual -- just as they actually turned out to be).That said, I think the Fantome was lost largely due to bad luck and the unusual track of Mitch, not to any major neglicence on the part of the Captain or of Windjammer.One of the greatest ironies is that the original &quot;escape plan&quot; that involved sailing Fantome North from Belize (abandoned due to Mitch's expected track and the relatively slow speed of Fantome)would have kept her safe.Jim Carrier's book is a very good one -- I am glad I bought it (through Amazon) and greatly enjoyed reading it.Hugh Sprunt HSprunt@aol.com"},{"Title":"Ship and the Storm: Hurricane Mitch and the Loss of the Fantome (Harvest Book)","review":"Jim Carrier tells the story of The Ship and the Storm by using crew accounts, passenger interviews, surviving crew relatives and official weather related records.Anchored in the quiet waters of the Bay at Omoa, Honduras passengers excitedly board the Windjammer Cruise Ship Fantome.

It makes one think before letting go of their deposits for a cruise vacation, that's for sure. It bothers me immensely that the Fantome was not insured, and that the crew didn't have a chance to get to shore before the decision was made to try and outrun the storm. That's like trying to outrun a tornado in Oklahoma. The safety of the crew should have been at the top of the list, next to the passengers. Had that ship been insured, the human lives might have just been saved. Although those beautiful ships are works of art and pieces of history, it doesn't compare to the loss of one human life. I hope Windjammer has learned a valuable lesson from this, and that they have insured all of their ships now.

Tim LaHaye claims that what makes this book different is that rather than attempt to persuade the reader regarding a particular interpretation of prophecy, this work \\"is to help you analyze the prophetic passages of [the bible]...in such a way that you can come to your own conclusions.\\" This is a particularly disingenuous and specious claim as the entire book is a rather ponderous and poorly executed defense of Pre-Trib dispensationalism.Dr. LaHaye is a gifted wordsmith and the well crafted text hides its lack of scholarship, or at least the rigor of supporting a clear theological position with footnotes and references. To be fair this book is written for a consumer audience and therefore does not apply, nor use, the same academic standards of textbooks. However the thinly veiled attempt to make the Pre-Trib Rapture position the normal understanding of believers while claiming an objective and studious methodology was OFFENSIVE. The book exhausts the reader by the amount of work expected by the Dr. LaHaye, such as looking up over 100 scriptures.Frankly it is almost impossible to list all of the inconsistencies, theological leaps and circular logic of the text. Dr. LaHaye insists on a literal interpretation of the bible but then repeatedly uses various elements symbolically to support his positions. Dr. LaHaye, for example is perfectly comfortable allegorizing Jesus speaking to the churches at the time of the Apostolic age in the beginning of book of Revelation as also referring to \`Church Ages.' Dr. LaHaye even see's John's translation into the heavenlies where he views Revelation's events as a \\"symbol of the church when she is raptured to be with Christ \`in the air.'\\"To explain why the rapture, especially a Pre-Trib rapture, is not found in the Olivet Discourse, Dr. LaHaye makes the incredulous theological leap that Jesus' view was on Israel at the end age without any textual support, i.e. biblical support. Are we to believe that Jesus (the Incarnate Son of God, member of the God head the Christ) was intellectually and prophetically limited, perhaps even wrong? The text is ripe with such speculations foisted upon the reader as competent biblical exegesis. Dr. Hayford, for example sees the rider of Revelation 6:2 as possibly Jesus whereas Dr. LaHaye says it is Satan. While this may seem like a minor point, in Dr. Hayford's book, one that doesn't purport itself to be a independent study program, admits to various interpretations of Revelation 6:2 whereas Dr. LaHaye simply asserts his position. Dr. LaHaye even speculates on the characteristics of believer's new resurrected bodies with zero biblical information. These theological jumps are worthy of the Nemo, a character in the popular film \\"The Matrix\\" but not of serious biblical scholars.Dr. LaHaye acknowledges that prophecy is understood differently but repeatedly insists that his understanding is the only logical one. Of course this is not explicitly stated but can inferred by the rather heavy handed statements such as, \\"when the 300-plus Bible references to the Second Coming are carefully examined, it becomes clear that there are two phases to Christ's return.\\" Apparently those who don't agree are not careful about their bible studies. The same stridency used in the advocating of the Pre-Trib position is used in defense of Pre-Trib's indispensable foundation: Premillennialism and Dispensationalism. Such statements as \\"in the twentieth century, premillennialism become the dominant view of the Bible-believing church...\\" is not only antidotal and unverifiable but insinuates that not having such a position makes the church \`non-bible believing.\\" Those who disagree are characterized as \\"small but noisy\\" cabal against a doctrine that can be traced back to the Apostles, another false and misleading statement not proven by facts or the bible.What is presented as a biblical world-view is clearly more informed by C.I. Scofield, The Fundamentalist Movement, and Dallas Theological Seminary who Dr. LaHaye endorses in this text, than an independent reading of the bible. It is not that such ideas are right or wrong, the lamentable idea however is that rather than presenting a guide, such as Dr. Gordon Fee's text, New Testament Exegesis, which is how Dr. LaHaye characterizes and promotes his book, he has written a polemic and apologetical work in strident advocacy of Pre-Tribulation, Dispensationalism, and Premillennialism.If you really want to learn something about the book of Revelation I highly recommend NICNT's commentary on the book by Dr. Mounce, or Dr. Hayford's book \`E Quake.' For an actual scholarly and logical approach that agrees with the Pre-Trib Rapture position (and Dispensationalism) a much much better read would be Dr. Pentecost's work \\"Things to Come.\\" Dr. Pentecost is no less immodest than Dr. LaHaye but at least you don't have to write over half the book yourself.

It is backed up by scripture on every point. Some of the questions I have had were explained, using scripture to point the truth. One of the questions that was answered was what actually happens at the time of a person's death. Souls that belong to Jesus, in spirit, go to one side of a deep abyss, and the ones who do not belong to Him, their souls are gathered on the opposite side. No one is allowed to cross over to the opposite side. At Christ's second coming our bodies are then joined with our waiting souls.

I happen to lean toward pre-Trib and would like to honestly evaluate all the arguements. It is very complicated and no one can sum it all up conclusively in one book, or a few short verses.My other complaint is that I ordered this book thinking it was about learning how to understand Bible prophecy. This book is presented entirely as a pre-Trib apologetic. Prophecy in general is ignored and principles on interpretting it are only presented if they support pre-Trib.It also saddens me to see some of the reviews where the reviewer appears to be depending on this book, or at least on only on pre-Trib writings for his information.

They also give very helpful pro's and con's on each card and tell you which ones are worth having, and a few that you probably don't want to use in your deck.. An intersting side note: Prima also gives the origin on many of the card, that is, if they debuted in Japan or America first and when. Also, unique to the Gameboy are special cards only obtained in the Gameboy version.There are some strategies on how to build certains decks that will aid you in defeating some of the club masters, and a nice feature is Prima identifies the club master and other boss decks so you can build a great deck before you encounter them.The one drawback I see with this guide is the lack of card combinations descriptions. Though there are some, there are a lot more to be discovered that could have been written about. Also, if they can break down the decks of the club masters and bosses, they could have also done the same for other NPC's within the game, but give very vague guidelines/hints on most of the NPC'sOverall, a good buy for the price."},{"Title":"The Wind Singer (Wind of Fire)","review":"If you have read and liked The Giver or Gathering Blue, you like this better. Complete fantasy- well thought up- suspenseful and hooking- I couldn't stop reading it. This book has tons of challenges in it and the characters are always in danger- the plot moves fast and it never gets boring- I STRONGLY and HIGHLY recomend this wonderful book!!!!"},{"Title":"The Wind Singer (Wind of Fire)","review":"I checked it out of the library just because I liked the title. I wound up reading it in two days!! I couldn't put it down. This is a definate page turner.The city of Aramanth is run by a rating system. Every year the head of the family (the father) takes something called the 'high-exam'. His score on this test determines the family's rating for the next year. The first exam is done when a child is 2. Every year after that, each child is rated on how well they do in school and that contributes to the family's rating, also.The city is made up of districs, with Grey being the worst, and White being the best. Also in there you have Marron, Orange, Scarlet, White. (I believe this is correct). Your family rating depends on where you live.Now that that's over with, our heroine, Kestral Hath, doesn't like this system and she decides to rebel against it with her brother, Bowman. It starts off nice and simple. She moves to the back of the class, skipping school, and disgracing the town's sacred Wind Singer by climbing up it and yelling out profanities.The town doesn't like this at all. They decide to run her out of the town, but they don't succede. She winds up finding the emporer that no one had ever seen. He tells her that she must be the person that he and his father and his father's father (and so on) must have been looking for. He gives her a map and tells her that she must find the Wind Singer's voice.She takes the map and finds Bow and tells him about that. He volunteers to go with her, along with their class mate, Mumpo.They leave and set off on this perilous jouney. They almost drown in quick sand, almost die in the desert, almost get hanged on a ship, almost get attacked by wolves, Mumpo gets turned into an old child, Bow gets corrupted, and all in all, it's a pretty rotten trip.Meanwhile, their parents are also rebelling against the town. Their mother, who thinks she's a prophetess, starts spreading the evils of Aramanth, rebels by wearing a colour other than her designated one, and winds up getting her youngest daughter, Pinpin, taken away.Their father rebels by deciding not to take the regular High Examination. Instead, he plans on writing about things that he actually knows about. And he talks the rest of the class into that also.The parents wind up getting threatened. The powerful people tell them that if they don't make a public apology for their actions, then they'll take Pinpin and list her as a ward of the city.Yup, this is a great book. Sorry, I'm not very good at summaries. I love it. If you like books like Redwall, Tamora Pierce books, and other things like that, you'll definately love this one."},{"Title":"The Wind Singer (Wind of Fire)","review":"The Wind Singer is a wonderful book filled with adventure, suspense, and imagination. If you liked Harry Potter or The Lord of the Rings, there's a good chance you'll like this book, too. Kestrel, a strong individual, is unhappy with the perfect, orderly society she lives in. The wind singer, a peculiar structure that was supposed to at one time sing and bring happiness to the people of Aramanth, has always been a special interest of Kestrel's. The wind singer's voice was taken away long ago by the evil Morah in exchange for his army of Zars to leave Aramanth. Armed with determination and courage, Kestrel, her brother Bowman, and a classmate Mumpo, are set off on a quest to bring the wind singer's voice back and restore happiness and good will to Aramanth."},{"Title":"The Wind Singer (Wind of Fire)","review":"Wow! This book is great! It's so witty and charming, it should be a hit with both kids, as well as adults. It's storyline similar to &quot;The Giver&quot;, as well as it's sequal, &quot;Gathering Blue&quot; in the sense that people are being controlled, walled in to their city, and given no sense of freedom whatsoever. This book is about a girl, Kestrel, who dares to rebel. Along with her brother, Bowman and new &quot;friend&quot;, Mumpo, she sets off on a journey to find the voice of the Wind Singer, which will bring an end to the controlled life she and her people know.Her journey is both exciting and terrifying, and I found it difficult to put it down, once I had started to read. It has a witty and engaging style of writing. The clever imagination of the author has come up with an interesting storyline, and very well thought out characters and plot.When you are done this book, you may find yourself saying, &quot;Wow, is this it?

I belong to a weekly book club of mature readers who enjoy a deeper interpretation of style, content, multiple levels of meaning, and philosophy of all \\"classics\\" of literature. In the case of Huckleberry Finn, we all had read the book earlier in our lives, and we have enjoyed it all the more reading it now.Hearn's book will likely be a classic in itself one day.My only criticism is the numbered annotations are set side by side in the text which makes it more difficult for me to read. I would prefer that they all be listed at the end of each chapter.Charles E. Reaves, M. D."},{"Title":"The Annotated Huckleberry Finn","review":"Mark Twain's \\"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn\\" is the quintessential American novel. I have taught this novel in my classroom for more than thirty years now, and Michael Patrick Hearn's thoroughly annotated edition has been an invaluable resource.\\"The Annotated Huckleberry Finn\\" contains an extended introduction on the history of Twain's masterpiece, numerous photos, all of E.W. Kemble's illustrations, and meticulously detailed annotations that nearly double the length of the novel. Hearn also includes annotations of the \\"Jim and the Dead Man\\" episode that was deleted from chapter 9, which was never published until 1995; and the \\"Raft Episode\\" that was removed from \\"Huck Finn\\" and used instead in \\"Life on the Mississippi.\\"Hearn's annotations are thoroughly researched and provide a deeper understanding of the novel. Sometimes the annotation borders on the minuscule, other times they are insightful--but are always informative. Consider some of the following examples:\\"five-center piece\\": Nickels were not minted until AFTER the Civil War; the novel is set during Twain's childhood (1835-1845).\\"the new judge said he was going to make a man of him\\": Twain's father was a justice in Hannibal and once tried to reform Jimmy Finn (the model for pap).\\"hump yourself\\": be sharp; look alive (This line elicits all types of giggling from my students. Obviously they have misinterpreted this phrase.)\\"You take a man dat's got on'y one er two chillen\\": Jim is expressing his love for his own children.\\"humble myself to a n-----\\": Huck has performed what must have been the most degrading thing for a white man to do for a slave. Now Huck and Jim are equals.\\"but never mind the rest of his outfit, it was just wild, but it was awful funny\\": Hearn provides numerous accounts of \\"The Burning Shame,\\" one which involves a candle and a naked man's built-in candle holder!\\"All right, then, I'll go to hell.\\": Finally in this famous crisis of conscience, Huck resolves the eternal battle between temperament and training...Throughout the entire novel, Hearn shines new light on all the dark places and provides a clearer understanding of \\"Huck Finn.\\" Even if you have read the book several times, this annotated edition will give you a deeper insight and appreciation of this most American of novels.

The country it sees is still in front of our eyes. The Americans it shows, we still are, though we live nearer to highways now than rivers. Twain's tale can be read both intellectually (yuck) as symbolic of the American quest for masterlessness (see Studies in Classic American Literature by D.H. Lawrence) and as a kid-on-a-raft-let's-see-what-happens story. Art and fun. Not an easy achievement to tie those two rascals together with one rope. Master of structure and flinger of fun though he be, the most exciting reason to read Twain is the language. The book is a hundred and sixteen years old, the writing ain't --&quot;Steamboat captains is always rich, and get sixty dollars a month, and they don't care a cent what a thing costs, you know, long as they want it. Stick a candle in your pocket; I can't rest, Jim, till we give her a rummaging. Do you reckon Tom Sawyer would ever go by this thing? Not for pie, he wouldn't. He'd call it an adventure-that's what he'd call it; and he'd land on that wreck if it was his last act. And wouldn't he throw style into it?&quot; --One caveat: Be careful the illustrations don't mess up the pictures the author can put in your head with his sentences."},{"Title":"The Annotated Huckleberry Finn","review":"I purchased this book for my son, a high school student who was assigned HUCKLEBERRY FINN in an American Studies class, and promptly fell in love with it. The commentary is delightful, and the many illustrations (many taken from the original edition,) photographs, prints, cartoons, and maps give a real sense of time and place. Homey details that might not be familiar to the modern reader are explained in some detail, as are customs of the time. The author includes material from Twain's notes and details about his life, always in a manner that illuminates the passage.HUCKLEBERRY FINN frequently turns up on lists of banned books, and it's interesting to read of the controversy that dogged this story from the beginning. The particulars of readers' outraged sensibilities might change, but the response this book has always engendered suggests the timelessness of Twain's targets: ignorance, cruelty, hypocracy, racism. The story is a clear-eyed yet subversive look at a society in transition, and a relentless skewering of treasured myths concerning childhood. These themes remain as troubling today as they were in the 1840s, the supposed setting of the novel.This book is an excellent resource for students and teachers, as well as for those of us who love Mark Twain's stories. The book itself is beautiful, with high quality paper and binding. A worthy addition to every library!"},{"Title":"The Annotated Huckleberry Finn","review":"Until something better comes along, The Annotated Huckleberry Finn will be the preferred way to journey with Mark Twain through The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn. When you get an outstanding illustrated, annotated, and introduced version of an American classic, how could anyone view the result as less than five stars?The book is massive. The introduction alone is almost full-book length. There are over 175 delightful original illustrations, supplemented by dozens of photographs (including the \\"obscene\\" one), drawings, cartoons, maps, memorabilia reproductions, and prints. The annotations often overwhelm the text in their extensiveness.I found the introduction to be a joy. Although massive compared to most, the introduction is done in an interesting, illustrated style which added much to my enjoyment of the story by covering a lot of background. The introduction begins with the personal habits of Mark Twain and goes on to provide a mini-biography of him and a history of the book's creation, editing, publication, reviewer and reader reactions, bans on the book, promotion, and subsequent history. In this section, I was pleased to read what prominent African-Americans have had to say about the racist and anti-racist elements that are present here, and how the story affects young African-Americans. Most people will be amused by the attempts by Mrs. Clemens, his editors, and Mark Twain himself to eliminate his tendency to make his stories a little too colorful in their references to religion and use of swearing. These changes are well documented in both the introduction and in the annotations. Those who love to read about the process of writing will find this section to be a joy.For the average reader, the illustrations will be the most valuable addition to their enjoyment of the book. I especially liked seeing how the original Huckleberry Finn illustrations compared to the ones for Tom Sawyer. I liked the Huckleberry Finn ones much more. They have a lightness and originality that add pleasure to the reading.The annotations seemed overdone to me. But annotations should probably better be overdone than underdone. Those who are familiar with the vernacular of the mid-19th century in the United States won't need many of the explanations. Understanding how the prose was cleaned-up so as to not shock as many church-goers of that day is more of sociological interest than of literary importance. I did find several annotations that I enjoyed. I really had no idea what a huckleberry was, and that knowledge adds meaning to the choice of Huck's name. For young people who do not know this version of the vernacular well, I suspect that the annotations can make understanding the story easier in several places. The writing style of the annotations is simple, concrete, and accessible . . . rather than literary and abstract like the annotations of many European novels.For such a simple story, The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn often proves to be elusive for its readers. Here are some guideposts to look out for:This story is told by Huck, and is not in the classic shape of a novel. Rather it is a precursor to Ulysses and Remembrance of Things Past, where other great writers attempted to capture the essence of our internal dialogue.Huck is also hiding a lot from himself. You as the reader can quickly see through him, though. He is trying to put a brave and positive face on a very dangerous situation. We all do that.Huck also has to face himself before the book ends. What really is important? We can all spout a lot of moral talk, but what we do is critical.If we lived in Huck's times, we would also see that there was an enormous moral dilemma. The rules of humanity were often not applied to enslaved and free African-Americans. You could choose to go along and feel like a hypocrite (if you thought about what you were doing), or you could do the right thing. Sensitive people of that day often found it hard to do the right thing. If your neighbors were open-minded and you lived in the North, you might do one thing. If your neighbors were slaveholders and lived in the South, you might do another.Also, think about the trip down the river as an analogy for going through life. How will it turn out if you just let your direction go with the current?Who in our society is being treated like Jim today? How can you help?"},{"Title":"The Annotated Huckleberry Finn","review":"Bravo! Michael Patrick Hearn has done it again! He has done the same great honor to HUCKLEBERRY FINN as he did last year to THE WIZARD OF OZ. Here is an exquisite, sumptuous edition of the Great American Novel supplemented with a lengthy and informative introduction and countless notes on all the autobiographical, literary, and historical allusions in the story. This commentary has greatly enlightened my reading of the novel and is a treasure trove of Southwestern and Twainian lore. Is there anything about Mark Twain that Hearn has not read? He even quotes from many previously unpublished sources. He meticulously traces the book's long and often controversial history from from being &quot;the veriest trash&quot; to the cornerstone of American literature. I had no idea so much mud has been thrown at poor Huck Finn! All of the original E. W. Kemble illustrations from the first edition are included as well as several drawn later for other purposes and numerous rare contemporary prints, photographs, maps, and other pictures. Hearn takes into consideration the various revisions Twain made in the text over the years and reprints the recently discovered suppressed &quot;Jim and the Dead Man&quot; episode. And Hearn is not afraid to answer the charge of racism head on. The book will be a great help in the classroom and to anyone else interested in American literature. A superb job all around. I look forward to when my grandchildren are old enough so I can share it with them."},{"Title":"The Annotated Huckleberry Finn","review":"This is an American literature teacher's dreambook.

You will wonder how you got along without it."},{"Title":"The Annotated Huckleberry Finn","review":"Mark Twain opined that a classic is a book everyone wants to own but nobody reads!However if you want to read Twain's best book with a fullcritical apparatus, an introduction over 100 pages and excellentillustrations this is the volume for you!Anyone teaching Huckleberry Finn in high school or college should make use of Michael Patrick Hearn's well researched noteswhich make this volume required reading.I have read all of the Norton Annotated Classics and found this one (along with the Sherlock Holmes volume) the best.Huckleberry Finn deals with the tragedy of 19th century slavery as Finn helps the black slave Jim escape down the mighty Mississippi river. In Huck's odyssey down the river he also travels from boyhood to manhood.Twain's use of dialects is amazing as is his dissection of prebellum southern/southwest society rife with violence, bigotry, child abuse and cruelty.Norton is to be commended for their series of classics opening up new ground for all students of Mark Twain. Excellent!"},{"Title":"The Annotated Huckleberry Finn","review":"No repeats of the due praise by previous reviewers. If you have never read Huck Finn before, do not start here, the annotations would make it difficult to read with a curious eye to the margin notes breaking up the flow, like watching a DVD movie with the director comments turned on. But do come back when your done a non-annotated version (or even audio); travel down the river again with the annotations by your side, here as lengthy as the book over again, a whole new magical worlds awaits in the margins; you will discover the hidden depths and meanings of one of the most important literary works about America ever written. An amazing book lovingly produced."},{"Title":"The Annotated Huckleberry Finn","review":"This is an excellent edition of a controversial novel that has been both reviled and praised. As for me, I am of the opinion that the book depicts life as it was in the period \\"Huckleberry Finn\\" was set in, and the colloquialisms and vocabulary used may not be politically correct in contemporary times, but it is a historically authentic representation of the language as it was used then.The author/editor of this book, Michael Patrick Hearn, has drawn on myriad primary sources and other materials in coming up with the annotations. In addition, Hearn provides a detailed introduction dealing with Twain, his work, and background information on the novel Huckleberry Finn. This particular edition is also a gem because of the inclusion of all of the original illustrations by E.W. Kemble. The book is also filled with other drawings, photographs, cartoons, etc. that make this book a delight to peruse and read. There is also a detailed bibliography which lists works by Mark Twain, notable editions of Huckleberry Finn, titles on Mark Twain, books about Huckleberry Finn, and books about E.W. Kemble. Love it or hate it, I think author Toni Morrison best sums it up with these words, \\"...It is classic literature, which is to say, it heaves, manifests, and lasts.\\""},{"Title":"The Annotated Huckleberry Finn","review":"When I bought my 14-year-old daughter this illustrated, annotated edition for her English class, I never dreamed I would hear her laugh out loud as she read it.

He had to make up his mind on which side he stayed on. I was really thinking that he was going to stay with the rebels just because Lucy Washbourne was on that side, but I was wrong. He made friends on both sides of the army and they took him in as their own. His name had a lot to do with it. Jeff's father fought in a war with the south. His name was well known there.

One of my favorite military fiction books as a young high school sophomore in the early 1980s was \\"Rifles for Watie\\", which I probably checked out from my school library more than just about everyone combined.Young Jeff (around my age at the time) gets caught up in the Civil War, joins the Union army, and heads off to fight the Confederates. He makes some solid friends and experiences harsh combat in the infantry. However, he's soon directed to go undercover as a faux Rebel and spy on Stand Watie, something of a Nathan Bedford Forrest figure. Jeff grows to admire Watie and his comrades, and even manages to fall for a fiery young Southern woman named Lucy. We follow Jeff's adventures through the war from beginning to end along with a fine cast of supporting characters.In light of our own overexposure to war in the last eight years I suppose there are some who might criticize \\"Rifles for Watie\\" for its dearth of, say, PTSD portrayal or making war look like a grand adventure. But then again, should a romance book include a bitter divorce or flagrant adultery? Yes, Jeff does change as a result of his wartime experiences, but mostly in a positive way. What young man wouldn't want to dream about embarking on a similar heroic journey?With that in mind, \\"Rifles for Watie\\" is an entertaining adventure tale of a a boy who becomes a man as a result of his tour of duty in the military. Of course, I'd recommend that the reader balance this book with more sober and realistic books about wartime service, if only to see how things can go bad in such a context. But this book is highly recommended for the young person interested in a piece of exciting and non-nihilistic military fiction."},{"Title":"Rifles For Watie","review":"I can't believe this book is still available! This was one of the very few books I remember by title that I read when I was in the 4th Grade in 1957. It made quite an impression on a ten year old... so much so that I can recall it so vividly after forty-six years. It had to be great to leave such a positive impression for so long."},{"Title":"Rifles For Watie","review":"this book is so close to the truth about the civil war that it is a must read. I have studied the civil war for several years and when I read this book It tought me stuff I didn't know about the times and the wars that happened especially the not so famous wars.It also tought me alot about the behaviors of the officers and of the soldiers. Since i joined the army sometimes I thought I had a hard time because they didn't feed us that much and some of the punishments are alot different today than back then but alot of the horrors of war are the same like being in the infantry is still similar in some cases and the calvary is alot different in some ways but the same in other ways."},{"Title":"Rifles For Watie","review":"Jeff Bussey is only 16 when the Civil War breaks out, but he immediately leaves his home in Linn County- after two bushwhackers's break into his house - to join the Kansas volunteers. After his first battle, he discovers war isn't just glory. He sees his friends die and knows that he may be next. He has to cope with a mean officer, Captain Clardy, and his love for a rebel girl, Lucy Washbourne.Then he is sent on a scouting mission,behind enemy lines where he makes an important discovery. The rebels are just boys like him, only they are fighting for a different cause. He is left with a tough decision to make. Should he join the enemy or betray them?I loved this book because it was so suspenseful. Harold Keith does a great job describing everything. This book is difficult to read so I recommend it to 5th Grade and up."},{"Title":"Rifles For Watie","review":"\\"Rifles For Watie\\" surprised me by being much more interesting than I thought it would. I had to read it for school, and my literature teacher usually picks boring books, but \\"Rifles for Watie\\" was great throughout. It tells the story of Jeff Bussey, a Kansas kid, who enlists in the Union army to defeat the enemy Cherokee Indians and their leader Stand Watie. Jeff quickly dislikes the rough life in the army, but learns to appreciate it. Soon, he is sent by his captain to go to the rebel side as a spy and gather information and bring it back to the captain. I don't want to give away too much, but it is an exciting book. Some parts are a little slow, but about 95% of it, I thought, was exciting. Read it, definitely."},{"Title":"Rifles For Watie","review":"Rifles for Watie, by Harold Keith, is a book about a 16-year-old boy named Jeff Bussey and can't wait to leave his farm in Kansas to defend his Unionagainst the Indian leader of the Rebels(Stand Watie.

I had a very supportive librarian who understood that I was not a 3rd grade reader and she was quite pleased that I subsequently checked it out 7 more times that school year. After a lapse of 50 years, I found RFW again and gave my old friend a try.Well...50 years of reading and life do make a difference. I had not lost my love for the story, it is and will always remain one of my top five reads. However, some of the cavils from other reviewers are valid: a few lurches in time, etc.That doesn't really detract from the overall quality of this tale. The protaganist, Jeff, has a marvelous and harrowing adventure and encounters a bit of dreamy adolescent love with Lucy...what could be better than to be kissed 'neath the rosebud tree?And...one mustn't forget Jeff's crusty sergeant...a great character whom, sadly, will never be played by Victor Mclaglen.The action scenes are well written and the Jeff's journey through both sides of the warring combatants is most excellently delineated. He finds that combatants on both sides are people with more in common than not. It is not overtly stated, but I found the futility of war a profoundly somber co-reader with me...when I was 8 and now.There is sooo much in this story: young man off to war, a civil war(although the brutality of that conflict was heinous), violent encounters, the hard nosed but caring sergeant, young love, spying, the Cherokee struggle.RFW would make a tremendous movie...as long as Spielberg doesn't get hold of it. I would prefer Steven Soderburg."},{"Title":"Rifles For Watie","review":"I've never read a book about a soldier in the middle of a war until now. Jeff Bussey is just a boy, but he decides to enlist in the Union Army during the Civil War. He longs for fighting. Time after time, he gets whisked away to other duties while the other soldiers fight. Finally, he is set up against the Southern Army and he finds it is not the glorious adventure he thought it would be. He makes an enemy of his commander and has to fight not only the Southern soldiers, but his own commander. Jeff is selected to infiltrate the Southern Army and to bring back information to the Union soldiers. He ends up spending many months with the Southerners and finds they are not so different from his Union friends. My son has raved about this book for years. It was a very powerful book that I am happy to have finally read."},{"Title":"Rifles For Watie","review":"I remember reading this book when I was little and loving it so I bought it for my 11 year old brother who is really into old military stuff right now.

Since I could not remember the details of the book I decided to read it again as an adult. The book is covered in a hard, glossy cardboard cover with updated artwork. It is the perfect size to carry on an airplane, which I did as soon as I received it. It is easy reading and has an interesting fictional storyline, based on actual testimony of living Civil War veterans personally interviewed by the author (a former University of Oklahoma History Professor) back in the early 20th Century. The description of life on the Kansas-Missouri border, as well as facts about the Five Civilized Tribes in Oklahoma (and their connection with the War of Northern Agression) was of particular interest to me. \\"Rifles for Waite\\" reads similarly to \\"The Red Badge of Courage.\\" another school time book club read. Every school age child should read this book, and I highly recommend it for adults as well."},{"Title":"Rifles For Watie","review":"I personally feel that anyone studying the Civil War should read this book. \\"Good\\" and \\"bad\\" are not not easily identified by the color of a uniform. How Jeff deals with each situation provides many opportunities for discussion. Although this book could be read by and certainly enjoyed by a young reader (lots of excitment to keep them interested) much of the moral value would likely be lost without follow-up discussion."},{"Title":"Rifles For Watie","review":"332 pages long- it was in 1957, anyway- and first published in hardback in 1957 by the Thomas Y. Crowell Company, Harold Keith's \\"Rifles For Watie\\" is a kind of novel rarely ever seen. In fact, I have never seen another quite like it, before or since. I can't quite say it to be the greatest novel I've ever read- Pat Conroy's \\"The Lords of Discipline\\" retains that title with me- but it is a close second, and most of all it is the all-around best novel focusing on the American Civil War that I have ever seen.I first picked up a copy of \\"Rifles For Watie\\" when I was in elementary school. I don't recall which edition or printing it was- the copy I have now is a 1957 hardcover, second printing- but I recall that I enjoyed reading it immensely and to this day I credit \\"Rifles For Watie\\" with greatly increasing my interest in reading. It wasn't even a book we were required to read in class, which was a real shame. The Henrico County K-12 public school system ignored \\"Rifles For Watie\\" but simply couldn't get enough of rubbish like \\"The Pearl\\" and \\"Brave New World\\", both of which I loathe to this day for the mediocre-at-best works of literature that they are. I do recall being required to read one Civil War novel at one point- the lamentably bland \\"Across Five Aprils\\"- but that isn't much next to the honest, simple brilliance of Harold Keith's novel.This book's honest, simple, yet deep and complex nature is the very essence of why it's so good. It is the result of five years' work by the author, and if you know about him before reading, or learn about him after, you'll realize that Keith really knew what he was writing about. The Western front of the Civil War, much neglected by most authors, happened in the exact area of the US that Harold Keith lived, Oklahoma.Jefferson Davis Bussey, in the wake of a pro-slavery bushwhackers' attack on his family's farm, decides to head to Fort Leavenworth, Kansas and join up. Several friends living nearby follow him, and they do not return for more than three years. The storyline sees Jeff, honest, stubborn, and brave, stand up to the cruel injustice of the cowardly, self-serving Captain Asa Clardy, go from infantryman to cavalryman to scout, earn a Medal of Honor at the Battle of Prarie Grove, serve in both armies and fall completely in love with a girl whose fiery patriotism and stubborn, hard-headed manner are a perfect match for Jeff's. He survives when so many around him fall, and is lucky from beginning to end. Jeff is even luckier in that when he finally returns home, having travelled over 100 miles on foot in escaping Stand Watie's army and convinced the bloodhound sent after him to switch sides, he is not cynical, not bitter or in any lasting way mentally or spiritually harmed by war. He has learned to keep faith when nothing else remains, and to keep going when many would see no point. He single-handedly ends the illicit shipping and sale of Spencer repeating rifles to Stand Watie's troops, done by no other than the treacherous Captain Clardy. It is true justice that both Jeff and Clardy both meet the fates each of them deserves. Jeff goes home alive, while the many dark deeds Clardy has committed throughout his life finally return to visit him.Jeff is the kind of young man America and the world will never have enough of- simple, honest, and fierecely dedicated to his chosen causes and ideals. In my mind, he earned the Medal of Honor many more times than the one he was given it.I'll always wonder why books like this are not more common reading in American schools, public and private. And by the way- since I have begun reading over reviews of this book that others have posted, I feel compelled to comment on the idea of making this book into a movie. I am if anything opposed to the idea. Because \\"Rifles For Watie\\" is a brilliant, truly great work of literature. Of literature. Not of film. I have seen many books adapted to film over my 19 years, and while I've seen a few done very well I've seen more done very badly.

The reason is that Noah was very wise, a great fighter, and he always knew what to do.My favorite part was the battle of Praire Grove. It was a spectacular battle scene and it gave a great deal of details.This was a great book.

If so, then Harold Keith's book, Rifles For Watie, is the book for you. It follows th journey of a teenager named Jeff, who, in his youthful enthusiasm, joins the Union Army during the Civil War. On this journey he meets friends, makes enemies, and falls in love. He is surprised by the ferocity of the fighting and finds no glory in the victory. This book would be good for teens to young adults.Rifles For Watie is organized in an easy to read, orderly fashion. There are no jumps from here to there to confuse you. There are however, periods of time with little or no action. An example is, \\"We stayed in the fort for 3 whole months waiting to get into action.\\" The author also gives you side information about the war as a whole, which will help you keep your bearings on the years.The age group that I think would get the maximum effectivenessfrom enjoying this book would be young adults or people interested in the life of a soldier. The vocabulary is easy to read but the fact that Keith puts in the Kansas accents and spellings might make it slightly harder to read for some. The author also deals with subjects akin to young adults, changing emotions, questioned ideals, and loss.The amount of emotion in this book is astounding. The author weaves in how Jeff feels and thinks. He describes in detail his thoughts using fear, suspense, and longing, among them. He uses Jeff's emotions by telling how flustered he gets when he met Lucy, a young Rebel teenager his age.Rifles For Watie is a \\"must read\\" for young adults teens and people who like war novels."},{"Title":"Rifles For Watie","review":"I was somewhat skeptical of reading &quot;Rifles for Watie&quot; when I saw that it was originally written in the '50's, believing that any book that old must be sappy and cheap. I was certainly suprised! This book ranks very high in my favorite books.Jeff Bussey, a teenage Kansas boy, decides that he wants to join the Union army, especially after southern bushwackers come near his family's home. Jeff is sure that fighting the Confederates will be a great adventure for he and his friends, but he is soon suprised - when he sees the results of terrible battles, he begins to doubt the honor and excitement of war. When Jeff falls in love with a spirited Cherokee-Confederate girl, and also when he gets involved with some other Confederates, he learns that the other armies are just made up of boys like him, who fiercly honor their country.This was an excellent, exciting, interesting, and, at the same time, educational young adult novel on the Civil War, and I'd definitely recommend it for ages 12 and up! You may also enjoy &quot;The Journal of James Edmund Pease&quot;, &quot;The Boys' War&quot;, and &quot;Soldier's Heart&quot;, also on the Civil War, and, on the also intriguing Revolutionary War, the book &quot;Johnny Tremain&quot; and the wonderful movie &quot;The Patriot."},{"Title":"Rifles For Watie","review":"This is my absolute FAVORITE book of all time!

Also, the quick paced beginning of Jeff's enlistment is unprobable. The fact that Jeff got less than a month of training on the drill field is unlikely. It would take much more drilling and training to prepare for battle than the amount proposed in the book. If you are not interested in the Civil War, I'm sorry I had to bore you with those details.

I got it at about age nine and was not very inclined to read it... but now at thirteen it is an exciting read. Don't turn away just because of the fact that it has the word 'rifles' in the title.

Written by Harold Keith, this book takes you with Jeff Bussey as he moves from his family farm in Kansas to the forefront of the civil war theater. Keith vividly depicts Jeff's interaction with the union army and many of the battles fought. Keith does an exceptional job of adding dimension to Jeff's experiences.

Jeff joined up with high hopes of glory and romance, but quickly learns what a skewed perspective he had on war. As he loses sleep, filling meals, and friends, his perspective grows quite grim, sometimes despairing. The battles are intense and gory, the marches grueling. Never knowing what day might be his last is emotionally draining. Yet there is no turning back. The plot thickens as Jeff is appointed as a spy to gather information about the Cherokee Indians by joining their camp as one of them. What he finds in doing so not only surprises him, but gets him thinking. Suddenly, he's questioning what he's been fighting for all along. Is the Union Army's cause really the right one? And will he betray the rebels, or join their ranks?Rifles for Watie offered a unique perspective on this piece of history. The fight against Colonol Watie is not something commonly written of or discussed, so I appreciated this look into a rarer aspect of the Civil War.

And the ending is excellent."},{"Title":"Rifles For Watie","review":"I first read this delightful novel in 1968 or 1969. It continues to be one of my favorite books. Historian and former OU sports information director Harold Keith actually makes history \\"fun\\" for teenagers with this award-winning tale, as RIFLES FOR WAITIE gives readers a full account of the brutal Civil War campaign in the Indian Territories of the frontier.At the heart of Keith's story is young Jeff Bussey, who joins a regiment of Kansas volunteers as a 16-year-old, idealistic adventure seeker. Jeff's idealism is short-lived once he confronts the horrors and barbarism of war; it is replaced by disillusionment, bitterness, fear. Although written in the Fifties, Keith cuts no corners in portraying the brutality of the Civil War in Oklahoma Territory; the reader can smell the smoke, hear the deafening roar of cannon, feel the bullets whistle past. And as young Jeff matures. . .becomes a battle-hardened survivor. . .he is sent on an assignment behind enemy lines--only to discover the men he is fighting are just like him: cold, tired, hungry, and ready to go home.Wonderfully written and flawlessly paced, RIFLES FOR WAITIE is an absorbing read.

Help keep the union together and get rid of slavery or fight to help save the cherokee indians lands fighting under conel Watie of the confederete army? Sounds pretty good doesn't it?

(It won the 1958 Newberry Award for children's literature and was a hot item in my elementary school library.) In reading the book as an adult, I was disappointed in the episodic construction of Harold Keith's narrative. He makes some big leaps as he jumps along through the Civil War; in some cases, several months pass between one chapter and the next. This weakens the development of the characters, in particular the youthful focus of the book, Jeff Bussey. At the end of the novel, despite his four years of experience as a combat soldier, spy, and lover, there is little sense that this teenager matures or changes. Even without war, and even sequestered in college, most kids do a fair amount of growing up between ages 18 and 22. At the end of a terrible war, Jeff seems to be as callow and even innocent as he was in his recruit days.This failing, however, probably won't matter to the young audience for whom Keith was writing back in the 1950s. The book reflects the sensibilities of that era, especially in the equal regard in which Keith holds the supporters of both the Union and the Confederacy. Jefferson Davis Bussey, a Union soldier (named by his father after a respected Mexican War comrade from Mississippi!), learns to like and respect his Confederate adversaries, and he falls in love with a Rebel girl. The only real villain in the story is a Union officer. Even in the 21st century, younger readers (ages 8-14) will likely identify with Jeff and his perspective on the events of the 1860s. They also will enjoy Keith's colorful description of battles and soldiering, as well as the more sober scenes of the war's cruelty and destruction.When \\"Rifles for Watie\\" was first published, it revealed to many Americans, including a lot of Civil War scholars, that the conflict had been irrepressible west of the Mississippi as well as in the East. Keith doesn't really deal with all the causes and ramifications of the war in the Indian Territory, and a search of the amazon.com website reveals many more recent scholarly books about the subject. But for readers young and old, \\"Rifles for Watie\\" still can be a painless introduction to the topic -- for all of that episodic narrative, it's still a Good Read."},{"Title":"Rifles For Watie","review":"Rifles for Watie is about Jeff Bussey a sixteen year old farm boy from Kansas. This story takes place in the Ozarks region(Kansas, Missouri, Olkahoma, and Arkansas). Jeff's family gets &quot;bushwacked&quot; by Confederate bushwackers and because of it Jeff joins the Union Army. Jeff thinks war would be fun so he's excited to be in his first battle. But when friends die in the battle Jeff changes his thoughts about war. He finds out that war means destruction and killing. I think Rifles for Watie deserves a five because I think it was well written, took place in a very important American historical event, and it has a wonderful plot. I compare this book to War in the Ozarks. It takes place in the same region as Rifles for Watie, and it has about the same plot. Rifles for Watie was a extremely exciting and excellent book."},{"Title":"Rifles For Watie","review":"Keith presents the Civil War from a different viewpoint: that of a Kansas farm boy who joins the Union Army to protect the family farm from rebel Bushwackers across the Missouri border. Like Michael Shaara's THE KILLER ANGELS (Pulitzer Prize winner about the Battle of Gettysburg), this book presents a fair portrayal of conditions and mindsets on both sides of the Mason/Dixon line. There are no clearcut military antagonists--just men in opposing uniforms. Keith's detailed research offers a variety of reasons for enlisting with one side or another, plus the tragic case of displaced Native Americans who were caught in the political crossfire of a nation undergoing rebirth.Sixteen-year-old Jeff (Jefferson Davis Bussey, if you please) serves his country first in the Infantry then in the Cavalry. While on a dangerous scouting expedition (Spy mission), he is tricked into enlisting with Col. Watie's Mounted Cherokee Rifles. Poor Jeff endures more than the normal risks of battle though: he falls for a Rebel gal--part Indian too. Befriended by kind and generous Southerners, he experiences increasing guilt as he grows to respect his erstwhile enemies. He develops true bonds with the common soldiers who become his new messmates.Yet Jeff privately realizes that time is relentlessly drawing him to the brink of a fateful decision: when he must choose which ideal (Union or division) to champion. Whichever way he goes, he will be branded a traitor by former friends--either his sweetheart or his family! How can the youth maintain his honor, especially when his heart is set on his sleeve? Even worse: he knows a dangerous secret about a sadistic Union officer who might well shoot or stab him during battle--just to assure his silence.Toward the end of the war the 7-shot Spencer Repeating Rifles were phasing out the older, one-shot Springfield rifles, but if both sides possess these new weapons of destruction, will the war be strung out even longer? Can Jeff prove his loyalty by ferreting out the identity of the traitor who is selling repeating rifles to the South? Excellent details of the dilemma of the border states and the regrettable suffering endured by many Indians, who were tragically divided in their loyalties--just like countless white border families. This is a very good read (based on research for a Master's Thesis), but too long and detailed to appeal to most high school students. The plot and supense eventually capture the reader's imagination."},{"Title":"Rifles For Watie","review":"As a Civil War historian, I found this book fascinating!

It tells of friendships on both sides of the war. His love of the rebel girl Lucy, his friend Noah the tramp printer and the life of a common Union soldier and a Rebel Cavalryman. The book recounts battles and the small world within them that a soldier plays, often missing the large results that are defined with the outcome. It tells of courage, and fear and determination as Jeff is pursued for miles in his daring escape from the Confederate army.This book you must include in your home library.

Her disdain for everyone connected with it goes far beyond anything like objective analysis in its scattershot skewering of almost all the personalities on her horizon. She comes back again and again to Abraham Maslow. I am not convinced of his centrality in the issues that concern Ms. Milton. A glaring omission is her failure to address the socio-cultural envirnoment that gave birth to some of the excesses that she laments. She seems to yearn for a golden yester-year that, a more careful examination of history would reveal, existed nowhere but in the minds of those who glorify the past at the expense of the present. Many criticisms are leveled, but no solutions are offered beyond a vague hope for a return to \\"old-fashioned values\\". As a small step up from tabloid fare, it succeeds quite well; incisive analysis it is not.

The movement has and had excesses. It also has a lot of twisting and BS that has nothing at all to do with what the founders did, said or thought. That is most of what Joyce attacks.Fundamentally, the movement was and is about honesty. Honesty about what one is really about and why one does things. Honesty about the reality of relationships. This can be and is abused, no question about it. There are plenty of people who simply use the forms to perform their sadism, manipulations, excuse addictions, what have you.But so is priestly authority abused. So is political authority of almost every kind. So is the demagogic authority of talk show hosts and TV preachers who take advantage of the uneasiness and fears of others for personal gain.People are made this way, and it is part of the parcel of life.This book is full of cheap shots at great people. Everyone has problems in their lives. Einstein was not very nice and liked the ladies. Does that invalidate his physics?No. It doesn't. Poor scholarship, sloppy thinking, and cheap shots are the primary content of this book. It has some points worth making, but they could be made in a few pages.The basic thought that people have a responsibility to society as well as to themselves seems to be the theme here.

Do we really need to suffer through another Republican screed against psychology? This is an addition to the sub-genre of books by authors who hate the idea that psychlogists actually try to help people. How dare they? Don't they know that all the answers are in the bible? Does the author even understand that the psychologists she throws mud at actually promoted personal responsibility and social interest? She seems to have started her research in the library with a hatred of psychologists (who, after all, were only trying to find ways to help people) and only paid attention to whatever bits of misguided criticism she could find. Then she paraphrased other people's criticisms and called it a book. It's actually a pathography, a relentless focus on the negative. If that's how you want to spend your time, feel free.

The world is full of hurt and anger and we find it quite ironic that Joyce Milton would would write such a scathing angry mean spirited book about those who attempted to elevate humanity; whatever the outcome of those attempts.If you want a non-biased account of the greatness and the faults associated with this movement and its theories then you should not invest you time and energy into this book. If you have already spawned an anger and judgment of human potential psychology then again there is no point to read this book, it is just more of the same. You have already made a judgment and the author does not offer anything tangible since she does not give supporting documentation for very harsh accusations she makes of peoples lives."},{"Title":"The Road to Malpsychia: Humanistic Psychology and Our Discontents","review":"&quot;In her later years Mead transformed herself into a Druid-priestess figure who invariably wore earth-toned dresses, a flowing cape and Hobbit-like shoes.&quot; (Milton 16)However much I might be inclined to agree with her other assessments, I have to wonder about their value if glaring errors like this are in the text. Everybody knows that &lt;i&gt;Hobbits don't wear shoes&lt;/i&gt;!"},{"Title":"The Road to Malpsychia: Humanistic Psychology and Our Discontents","review":"Ms Milton admits to her anger at humanistic psychology, so she attacks without understanding. She does not seem to grasp even some of the basic concepts of the people's work she denigrates. Maslow's hierarchy of needs is one example. I have spent a great deal pf time studding humanistic psychology and writings. I have had the pleasure of being trained in group therapy with Carl Rogers, and William Coulson as instructors. Any one who really studies these writers will see how bad a job Ms Milton did presenting them. She should have let her anger subside before she wrote the book. Her bias is extreme and obvious. So consider this when reading the book. No doubt Ms Milton will have a new career appearing on the conservative religious programs. I am sure Pat Robinson and Jerry Falwell have or will book her to speak out against the evils of humanistic psychology."},{"Title":"The Road to Malpsychia: Humanistic Psychology and Our Discontents","review":"This book reflects on pop culture and the way it developed from the Progressive era of the late 1800's into the 60's. These poisonous theories embrace by humanistic psychology sought to undermine an Anglo-American culture that had made America the greatest and fairest nation in recorded human history. In that vein this book is like \\"Intellectuals\\" by Paul Johnson in the way it contrasts the way self anointed guru's of the last half of the 20th century live their own lives versus the way they recommend other's live theirs. By citing pseudo-intellectuals like Abe Maslow, Tim Leary, Carl Rogers, Margaret Mead, Ruth Benedict, and Richard Alpert, the author reveals what many of us thought all along, these people are frauds who have perpetrated their absurd theories of human behavior by masquerading them as science. Recall that thousands of intellectuals were gulled into believing that Marxism was scientifically determined and that its conclusions were inevitable. All of it turned out to be nonsense on stilts, but we should use it as a lesson where we never forget that we can never dismiss man's incredible capacity for self-deception.Joyce Milton outlines the central tenets of her subjects by citing their disdain for the family, religion and private property. It is interesting that Hanna Arendt, in her book \\"the Origins of Totalitarianism\\", recounts these themes as ones so destructive to what has made western culture preeminent in human history. Did this all just happen by accident? No. Joshua Muravchik covers this ground well in his book \\"Heaven on Earth; the decline and fall of socialism\\".Milton explains New-Age spirituality, radical feminism and self-esteem psychology, and its origination of the hot tub, group hug societies so in evidence in many parts of America (such as Marin County California where anti-Americanism is a virtue.) She cites an interesting example of the confusion these people might possibly feel if they take their beliefs to a logical conclusion by quoting their intellectual guru, Karl Marx, who says at the end of his life, \\"I am not a Marxist\\". Who knew?Milton posits that humanistic psychology is arrogant because it believes that a theory of the universe can be deduced from a person's own experience; and that it is socially irresponsible because it advises us to keep our eyes on the weather vane of our own conflicting feelings rather than on the lives of those around us. No society can function effectively under such a regime.This whole project of humanistic psyche is being shown as \\"the emperor who is wearing no clothes\\" and with that behind us the world might perhaps get back to the real science of why we're the way we are. This is an excellent book that should at least be read by every college freshman."},{"Title":"The Road to Malpsychia: Humanistic Psychology and Our Discontents","review":"As a psychiatrist and psychoanalyst I have been exposed to many theories about the human mind. I have had ample opportunity to see which of these theories when applied to a given situation is most likely to be of help. It has been startling to me how many elaborate models of the mind and corresponding therapies are not only obscure but disorganized, unverifiable, and unaccountable. Joyce Milton's fast paced book is clear and concise in examining the parents of Humanistic Psychology and its theories. (I had not known where all that silly stuff about encounter groups,LSD, etc. came from but now I do.) In examining this movement Ms. Milton suggests origins for many of the cultural and political aberancies which have been so antithetical to the best of American institutions and values.The Humanistic Psychology Movement seemed to assert that the highest form of human mental activity was the quest for the Ecstacy of Self-Congratulation. Ms. Milton wryly describes the resultant frenetic, self-deluded, and self-serving Flakiness which often passed for Advanced Deep Thought and which justified in the mind of the affected the wholesale overhaul of everything. The ability to discern Nonsense in our culture has been greatly enhanced by this book. Another great part of this lively book is the dark humor to be continuously found in the absurdities of popular Psycholgy. I highly recommend The Road to Malpsychia..."},{"Title":"The Road to Malpsychia: Humanistic Psychology and Our Discontents","review":"It's easy enough to find fault with this book: it's poorly organized, there is a lot of material in it (on Margaret Mead and Ruth Benedict, for instance) that does not belong, and there is a lot that belongs but is not in it (many of the lesser lights of the T-group movement, for example). It's very gossipy ways that will offend even those with a prurient interest. Much of what the author claims is not documented. And so forth. But with all that, I found it a valuable book. Its overall story is valuable and persuasive. The T-groups, the Encounter movement, EST, the Esalen crowd, they are all shown for what they are, and convincingly so. The &quot;humanistic psychology&quot; movement was ( is ?) deplorable and a bit of a menace, and Joyce Milton, with all the faults of this book, has shown how and why this is so."},{"Title":"The Road to Malpsychia: Humanistic Psychology and Our Discontents","review":"This is a wonderful book. The author tells the story of the rise and fall of the \\"human potential\\" movement of the 60s and 70s through portraits of the men and women who made it happen--Ruth Benedict and Margaret Mead who were unofficial mentors to psychologist Abraham Maslow, who was the true prophet of the movement to build \\"a religion of the self,\\" and Carl Rogers of the encounter groups and Timothy Leary, who carried the quest for selfhood into the psychedelic stratosphere after leaving Harvard to spread the good (secular) word. All of these people are given incisive portraits by Milton, who uses them to tell the story of how we got all balled up in what Lasch later called \\"a culture of narcissism.\\" Milton's book explains a lot. Reading it gives you a feeling that you're looking at American culture in a time lapse mirror over the last 30 years. A classic."},{"Title":"The Road to Malpsychia: Humanistic Psychology and Our Discontents","review":"Humanistic psychology rolled over American culture like a vast tidal wave, leaving every school awash in classes on self-esteem, and every starlet appearing on Leno babbling about how this or that made her feel better about herself. What Milton points out in The Road to Malpsychia is the cost of our national fixation with narcissim. She also reveals a lot of ugly truths about the founders of our curent culture. Margaret Mead and Kinsey are proven to be charlatans and liars. Carl Rogers, pop guru the inner self, couldn't translate his intense love for himself into caring for another person. And best of all, Milton writes well. This book deserves more than 5 stars."},{"Title":"The Road to Malpsychia: Humanistic Psychology and Our Discontents","review":"The author captures very well the ambience of the \`50s, \`60s and \`70s. She describes the extraordinary influence on American culture of such humanists as Rogers, Maslow, and Leary, documenting the harmful consequences of the drug culture that their idealism fostered and the hypocrisy that lay behind such spin-offs as the encounter movement and student revolutions. For anyone who has lived through this era, this is a good book to read.Too bad she chose such an abstruse title! Most of us never heard of the \\"eupsychia\\" it is intended to satirize."},{"Title":"The Road to Malpsychia: Humanistic Psychology and Our Discontents","review":"How many of us had to go through \\"Diversity Training\\" or \\"DARE\\" or other groups and didn't feel quite right about it?Everyone should read this book. It connects a lot of dots. The people discussed in this book may not be known by everyone, but everyone feels the effects of their ideas. Just knowing the origins of some of the revolutionary cultural influences in our society may be enough to somewhat innoculate you from the effects."},{"Title":"The Road to Malpsychia: Humanistic Psychology and Our Discontents","review":"The humanistic psychology movement was indeed populated by intellectual mediocrities peddling dubious ideas at best. And it was subjected to withering critiques by a number of scholars in political science, history, philosophy, and psychology at the time of its ascendency in the 1960s and early 1970s. By far the best of these was Russell Jacoby's \\"Social Amnesia,\\" first published around 1974 and subsequently translated into a dozen other languages and reprinted in this country more than once. But Joyce Milton cites neither Jacoby nor any of the other contemporaray critics of the movement. I think it's safe to assume that the reason for Milton's silence on these earlier works is partly a matter of self-promotion and partly a matter of political emnity. Most of the earlier works in this area--and certainly Jacoby's--were written from a left Freudian point of view by men and women who had been students of such figures as Theodor Adorno and Herbert Marcuse, precisely the sorts of individuals Milton would like to lump together with the likes of Maslow, Rogers, et al.Milton's book on the case of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg was unfairly and rather stupidly attacked by many left-wing intellectuals--die-hards who can't seem to accept the fact that the American left had been (at least partly) wrong about the Rosenberg trial. The attack against Milton was based more on politics than on scholarly consideration and debate. In her latest book, Milton has returned the favor, producing a thinly disguised political screed masquerading as intellectual history. This book is simply the latest neocon effort to discredit the entire history of radical thought, from Hegel through the 1960s and on to the present, as a cauldron of metaphysical nonsense and irrationalism that inevitably results in moral relativism at best and, at worst, totalitarianism. Fans of Bill Bennett and Lynn Cheney will love this book. Anyone looking for an accurate and balanced history of the rise and fall of humanistic psychology should look elsewhere."},{"Title":"The Road to Malpsychia: Humanistic Psychology and Our Discontents","review":"I read this book with an interest in the Human Potenial Movement. I had vague doubts about the movement and wanted to know more about its history and development. This was the book. It is not only a wonderful history of the culture of the 60's and 70's but an intellectual history of the 20th century. It also offers a wonderful biography of multiple personalities involved in its history and shows how the movement influenced present day concepts of psychology and the self. I have read this book three times over and have handed out copies to others who report reading it more than once.I love this book. I wish I could rate this book 10 stars."},{"Title":"The Road to Malpsychia: Humanistic Psychology and Our Discontents","review":"For decades, I wondered where the strange ideas were coming from. Who on earth started the first encounter group where we were told to bare our souls in front of people we scarcely knew? Whatever happened to that Tim O'Leary who handed out LSD to his students? What moved Charles Manson and his cronies to do the things they did? How did this notion of \\"unconditional love\\" manage to knock all the \\"buts\\" and \\"ifs\\" out of the Bible? Who decided that we should call everyone by his first name, even if we had never seen him before and would never see him again?Two weeks ago, I read a review of Joyce Milton's carefully documented \\"Road to Malpsychia,\\" ordered a copy, and read it. There I found answers to many of my questions. Consequently, I am ordering a copy to give to a young woman who will be going to college this fall with the intention of majoring in psychology.

Ms. Willard's, HTML A Beginner's Guide, is a refreshing change. Not only does Ms. Willard know what she is talking about but articulates her topic in a down to earth manner, interlaced with a bit of humor. In fact in Module 6, I'll just bet that she incorporated images of her daughter Corinna. Ms. Willard takes her readers into the HTML world as a Graphic Designer/Artist and guides us thought real hard core text editing (real programming) instead of attempting to teach us how to use a software application. As a Web Master, I found her book to be a very refreshing reference guide. Especially, during those long evenings and early morning deadline hours of programming when code is hard to come by, I find her words a breath of fresh air and as I turn the pages... there in front of me are the answers I needed or just a little different twist of an idea. I see this evening that Ms. Willard has a new book due at Amazon this June... I'll own that one also. Thank you, Windy!Tom Rogers NorthMountainWeb"},{"Title":"HTML: A Beginner's Guide","review":"This is a competent introduction to web page authoring. I think it would enable a relative novice to get started.Sometimes, as when she introduces XHTML early in chapter 2, Willard gets into theory that I imagine would go over the head of a beginner. But her examples are clear enough so that I think most people should be able to plow ahead anyway.Here is where I am coming from. I am an experienced Web programmer who will be teaching a high school course in Web design. In general, I am finding that I want to write my own lectures--and put them on line--rather than use a book.I'm thinking that this is 2001. But most introductory Web authoring books include a mishmash of material, some of which is state of the art in 1996, and some of which is more current.Compared to what is out there in general, Willard's book is incrementally better. She talks about the .png format for graphics. Her chapter on cascading style sheets is longer than that in competing books, but not nearly long enough.What I am asking for is a book that throws out or downplays all the hacks we learned four years ago (font tags, table-driven layouts, frames) and instead takes style sheets as the core design tool. In 2001, you'd think that there would be a beginner's book that takes such an approach. Maybe Willard will take that on as her next project."},{"Title":"HTML: A Beginner's Guide","review":"This book is Fantastic! It is informative, easy-to-read, and great for an html beginner.

I can't begin to explain how confusing it is for a person who sets out to learn something, when the &quot;example&quot; isn't there. Next time I'll buy from another publishing house.

Just as the title implied, this book is for beginners so if you know about html this is not for you. The book is fairly thorough in explaining and the categorizaton of importance is very good: big bold titles, italicized, indentations with bullets, highlighted texts in gray boxes, etc. It even has a chapter (it's called Module and I don't know why) on Javascript and Cascading Style Sheet but short though, because it's intended for newbies. However, the section on making frames (Module 10) is somewhat confusing and I think the author didn't give enough examples. Trying to click on a link on one page and another page changes is what I'm referring to. I had to get help from my intructor at our school. If you don't use frames in your pages then this is no big deal to you. But it's nice to know how to do it in case later on you might decide to use frames. Another thing I wish this book has more is the special characters or entities. It has the basic section that has &aacute;,, and such but needs more (&aacute; by the way in html codes). English is not the only language in the world and I'm sure some web designers are making pages so they can be viewed anywhere in the world. I've found out a few more with trials and errors.

I'm afraid that if they discover the book by themselves, they may opt to skip our class and teach themselves the topic!

Module two is very confusing with very few examples for the beginner. I have been designing pretty decent web pages (www.pacificlittleleague.org) with MS Frontpage 2002 and wanted to learn HTML so I could advance to using javascript &amp; flash. This book was a mistake purchase. It is not for the beginner. I have read all of the other comments that convinced me to buy this book, and all I can say is that maybe this would be a good book if you have already dabbled in some HTML. If you look at some of the test questions at the end of module 2, such as #9 which asks about the proper XHTML format for closing the hr tag, you will find that she hasn't even covered the tag hr yet. In # 11 it asks to rewrite &quot;the text below&quot; so that it doesn't show up on a web page - and then there is no text shown that could be rewritten.

There are even useful introductions to javascript, cascading style sheets and stuff about actually putting your website on the web, and, at the beginning, stuff about web site design (e.g. for potential customers, etc.). There is a reference section for all the stuff you've learnt and a resources section both at the back. A BIG feature is the project running throughout the book, which gets you to create your own web site and build it up, gradually adding more and more stuff to it as you learn it. This consolidates your learning.This book is EXCELLENT for beginners, who know nothing, and takes you through to, I would say, at least intermediate level. There is also stuff on how to make pages ready for the up-and-coming XHTML. Everything is fully,and very well explained, with useful short tests throughout.

The book would interest anyone who enjoys books about the great personalites of the 20's and 30's. Reminded me a bit of the Rubenstein 2 volume biography."},{"Title":"Tamara de Lempicka: A Life of Deco and Decadence","review":"Over the many years spent in research for this book, ProfessorLaura Claridge acquired extraordinarily detailed knowledge of thecultural, moral, and intellectual atmosphere of early 20th century European aristocracy and avant guard high society. Then, with penetrating wit and spellbinding ingenuity, she wove this Zeitgeist into every relevant passage of this scholarly book. The uniqueness of Professor Claridge's biography is that she has been able to show that just as De Lempicka's paintings represented more than a mere accumulation of colors on canvas, her bewitching life represented more than the simple sum of its parts. Claridge has managed to capture the &quot;gestalt&quot; of the &quot;brave new woman&quot;. With compassion and humor, flawless prose and delicate discrimination, impeccable elegance and style, affection, grace, and savoir faire, Professor Claridge has shown how it is possible for a woman to have it all! This book is an education in history, art history, anthropology, sociology, politics, civics, and European culture and aristocracy at the height of its decadent best. I loved this gripping book and read it with the excitement and absorption usually reserved for suspence novels. Bravo."},{"Title":"Tamara de Lempicka: A Life of Deco and Decadence","review":"Many things have, and will be said about Tamara de Lempicka. Relentless research, numerous personal interviews, and newly uncovered resources, never accessed before by any individual person, have allowed Laura Claridge to piece together a consummate documentary of the \\"Total Tamara\\". Laura transfers the powerful emotions of Tamara's private, public, and artistic life to the reader with her artful use of the English language and vividly detailed descriptions of places and events. These images make reading Tamara's remarkable story as if you were living every day with her in person. Other volumes have been written documenting her artwork, and her life as an artist. This work goes beyond all those attempts to paint a personal picture of the talent, dedication, aspiration, and undying will that catapulted Tamara into the limelight. It also takes you inside the private times to show you the frustration, disappointment, and loneliness of a perfectionist who always had to have, and be, the ultimate. From a historical standpoint, it allows the reader to view the impact the world had on Tamara, and the incredible impact she had on the world. Always fresh and fascinating, from cover to cover, this is the most enjoyable critical biography I have ever read."},{"Title":"Tamara de Lempicka: A Life of Deco and Decadence","review":"This book is vivid with details and descriptions of Tamara's fascinating life. A sumptuous bite into the life of an artist; this story is simmered in vibrant retellings of Tamara's historical tribulations, her numerous tumultuous relationships (both male & female), her eccentricities along with an almost infamous ego, and the constant tribulations of trying to express oneself via pigment & canvas. Even if you are not currently familiar with Tamara's work (audible gasp) this book is guaranteed to enrich your view of artists and vibrant women alike."},{"Title":"Tamara de Lempicka: A Life of Deco and Decadence","review":"A long time Lempicka fan, I read Claridge's biography as part of the research for my master's thesis on the artist. This book provided so much information not only on events in Lempicka's life, but also her sexual habits and personal characteristics. I also found this book a great source on life in 1920s and 30s Paris. But be warned, this book does not provide many images of Lempicka's unique paintings, although many of the illustrations are full-color reproductions.This book reads easily and is entertaining as well as informative. I highly recommend it for Lempicka and Art Deco fans!"},{"Title":"Tamara de Lempicka: A Life of Deco and Decadence","review":"....and it still fills a void in Tamara scholarship, but in trying to be so many things...biography, art history, art criticism, psychological profile, social history...this book weaves a somewhat arbitrary and bumpy trail through De Lempicka's life, times, and art. It mixes gossipy trivia with modernist theory in a way that often doesn't mix very well. The book, as a whole, feels sort of welded together...if it were a meal, it would be a big bowl in which appetizer, main course, desert, and midnight snack would have all be thrown in and mixed together under the dubious rationale, \\"it's all going to the same place.\\"Nonetheless, in the absence of many authoritative books that might better take one or another aspect of De Lempicka's life and art and make a real study of them, this book is well worth reading for an overall look at this still underrated and under-appreciated artist. That said, even after 375 pages, I didn't feel that the author really grasped the \\"mystery\\" of de Lempicka. Something about the various aspects of her life and personality, as presented here, didn't quite add up. I cant help but wonder if the author, who seemed to rely a good deal on De Lempicka's daughter for information, insights, and documents, didn't compromise her objectivity too much in securing this cooperation.As it is, the De Lempicka who comes through on these pages isn't all that likable a woman. In fact, I found myself really shuddering at the idea of being in contact with such a selfish, shrewish, manipulative, hysterical, insensitive, self-dramatizing person. She isn't really any worse than the misbehaving male artists we're all familiar with--its just that she misbehaves in an entirely different--in some senses, distinctly \\"feminine\\" way that we may not be as familiar with in artist biographies dominated as they are by male subjects. Here we see De Lempicka at her worst, and often, playing the emotionally abusive and psychologically overbearing wife, mother--and grandmother--wielding her financial clout as family matriarch like a club to beat down all opposition to her wishes. At other times, her abuse is more subtle, insinuating in ways that'll make your skin crawl.Technically an aristocrat, De Lempicka thought it something to be proud of, something that conferred upon her a privileged natural superiority over and above her fellow mortals. It's hard for Americans, in particular, to swallow this sort of class arrogance. But perhaps worst of all is that De Lempicka didnt seem to have much of a sense of self-irony. She could be just as outrageously flamboyant as Dali in appearance and behavior, but where Dali seemed to do it with a wink and a nod, De Lempicka doesn't seem to get the joke whatsoever. In fact, she doesnt seem to think there is a joke to be gotten. She's as serious, at least as she's portrayed in this biography, as a root canal over nine miles of bad road.Even giving her the benefit of every doubt, I certainly didn't come away from this book liking De Lempicka, nor even sympathizing with her, and I'm not sure the author did either, although she seems to do her best to get the reader to do both. Basically, this is the story of a not-very-nice person who turned out some very great art...a story not quite unfamiliar to any reader of artist biographies.If I go on at some length about DeLempicka's character it's because this book seems to focus on that more than anything else. While the author makes the necessary effort to trace De Lempicka's art career, the book falls short in this regard. Mention is made of other artists of the era, and even of De Lempicka's acquaintance with some of them, but little of real substance is offered of her interaction with them. She seems to exist side-by-side with them in a bubble. When the author talks about art history or art theory, her comments seem somewhat perfunctory, almost canned, as if gleaned from another source or reliant upon authority not her own. I'm not saying they are...but thats how they read to me. This impression may be a consequence of the aforementioned attempt to make this one book serve too many functions, which, as also aforementioned, makes it useful, given the paucity of quality De Lempicka studies.And that paucity of alternative studies is what makes this book a worthwhile and generally rewarding, if at more times than one might have wished, tedious read."},{"Title":"Tamara de Lempicka: A Life of Deco and Decadence","review":"Claridge has done her homework here to an astonishing degree. The amount of research put into pealing back the layers of time and mystery that have surrounded the life of one of the 20th century's most fascinating painters is incredible. This book should be on the shelf of any Lempicka fan if for no other reason than it debunks the most popular myths of the others books by so called \\"scholars\\" littering the same shelf left and right.The writing in this is incredibly dense. There's just so much material to cover here that there's no other way this book could be written even semi-competently without even half of the information present here. And what information there is! I knew Tamara lived the high life in Paris but the ammount of drugs, alcohol and sex present in this book are insane. Couple this with heart wrenching affairs, royal bumfoolery and daring political escapes and you have only one tenth of what the life of this woman was about.One thing more that I wish to address is the statement by another reviewer on here that this is more of an art history book than I biography. I would say the the truth lies somewhere between the two. While this is a very in depth biography there were times that I did find myself having to pause time and time again to look up certain names, dates and places to see what the author referenced off handedly throughout the book. Some names are easier to pick up than others - Lhote, Denis and Marinetti are easy to pick out, but some of the more obscure ones took away a lot of time from reading this. So yes, not exactly a book you can blow through in a matter of days unless you're willing to make some sacrifices as you go."},{"Title":"Tamara de Lempicka: A Life of Deco and Decadence","review":"I like a million other people, had never heard of Tamara De Lempicka (how sad!!) until I heard Madonna in an interview mention how incredible she is.

Building Your Church on Faith and Knowledge","review":"The fear referred to in the title of this book is the fear of failure. Alarmed by volumes of prediction of the impending doom of mainline Protestant congregations, our churches are increasingly tempted to apply worldly (corporate/business) measures of success when looking to the future. \\"Why aren't we growing?\\" \\"How will we pay the mortgage?\\" \\"What are our goals?\\" Our fears about those questions can cause us to concentrate upon solutions for \\"growing\\" our membership, as if swelling membership rolls and larger operating budgets have become ends rather than means.Dr. Roberts provides a welcome antidote. His message is that first you must learn who you are, what you believe and how you serve. Then, by emphasizing its strengths and gifts and its uniqueness as a counter-cultural institution, your congregation may, regardless of its size or influence, become a vibrant community of praise, prayer and caring."},{"Title":"Be Not Afraid!

The book succeeds in teaching a lot about the solar system: I now have a better and more visceral understanding of Saturns rings than I ever had before (one of the adventures is entering the rings in a special space suit); same goes for Titan, Triton, and various locales on the Moon. A few of the \\"adventures\\" are intriguing such as climbing Olympus Mons on Mars. This first adventure in the book features a map of the route up the volcano, but unfortunatley this is the last time such a map appears in the book.My main criticism of the book is the author's constant comments about how exciting each adventure is going to be, and his constant reminder to leave time to photograph and collect samples. This conversational tone doesn't work. A few times I found myself looking ahead to see if the next \\"adventure\\" would recapture my interest.If you are interested in the solar system this book will be instructive.

It is a workbook format which presents a understanding of why plantar fasciitis occurs -the tendons and ligaments are strained because they are doing work meant to be done by muscles. The &quot;foot arch muscle&quot; gets weak and so the foot arch collapses causing plantar faciitis and other conditons. So you strengthen the &quot;foot arch muscle&quot;. The &quot;foot arch muscle&quot; is not in the foot but in the calf and you are supposed to keep it tense and &quot;walk the right way&quot; - toes pointing straight ahead. oh and you can do calf raises - up on your toes and down. that's about it."},{"Title":"A New Foot Health Solution: How to Help Heel Spurs, Plantar Fasciitis, Achilles Tendon, Flat Feet, Shin Splints and Foot Pain","review":"This book is a complete waste of your money.

The 1st chapter which can be downloaded from the author's website is fairly well written making you believe the book may have some intrinsic value however, it is a total let down once you view the rest of this book. There is better, (if better can even be suggested?) more accurrate information for free on the internet if you simply search. I would have returned my copy but it was not worth the time or effort. I threw it in the trash so dissappointed. If you are suffering from arch pain as I am, this book will not solve your problem. It does not even provide enough education to justify selling it. This book is nothing more than an explotation of one person's realization 15 years ago that arch pain can often stem from having flat feet. There is not much more to the book than that.

This is an old book created by an architect/engineer who used shoddy analysis to derive a couple overly simple techniques. His engineering background evidently didn't help him much, as Mr. Denlinger makes a number of gross biomechanical mistakes in this book. He attributes flat feet to \\"under pronation\\" and a \\"high arch\\" to \\"over pronation\\". Quite the opposite is true - flat feet are pronated too much and high arches do not pronate much. Denlinger does not understand the very *definition* of foot pronation, which is fundamental to the it's role in plantar fasciitis and it's function of the arch. He also attributes the \\"main arch muscle\\" to the peroneal tendon and related muscles, which is also grossly incorrect. Tightening the peroneal tendon everts the foot which relates to pronation and flattening of the arch - it does not support the arch.In 84 pages, he wastes a lot of time describing how he \\"discovered\\" his technique and gives very simplistic descriptions of bones, muscles and tendons that would be appropriate for a 5 year old. In his \\"workbook\\" section, he states \\"Muscles move the body around and can move other things around...\\" Then he asks, \\"give three examples of things muscles do (like running, lifting, etc.).\\" Unfortunately (or fortunately) he does not give answers to his questions, so I guess I'll never know if I answered this correctly.What is his \\"secret\\"? In a neutral position with toes pointing straight ahead, you press with the ball of the foot to the floor in such a way that you \\"create an arch with your foot\\". And the only exercise he suggests is \\"toe raises\\" to strengthen the \\"arch muscle\\". He does not provide any stretching exercises.Denlinger gives an inexcusably misleading lesson in functional anatomy and only offers a couple simplistic exercises. Exercise and stretching can be beneficial to foot problems, but you won't find quality information in this book. Plantar fasciitis is caused by many different things, and a podiatrist can provide you with stretching and strengthening exercises custom for your situation. All of the plantar fasciitis exercises are also easily found for free on the web.Regards,Louis S."},{"Title":"A New Foot Health Solution: How to Help Heel Spurs, Plantar Fasciitis, Achilles Tendon, Flat Feet, Shin Splints and Foot Pain","review":"This book was short and to the point. Which is perfect. It was written by an engineer with foot problems that the medical establishment had been unable to resolve. Using his knowledge of engineering, he studied the foot, discovered the simple mechanics that lead to foot pain, and the simple ways to fix them.He teaches you a couple of simple exercises, and then teaches you how to walk and stand properly so that physics works to the benefit of your feet, instead of against it.I had plantar fasciitis when started reading this book. 15 minutes later, I had relief, and a week later it was completely gone.

Thank you Marilyn for writing such and improtant book to help us all be more knowledgeable with the laws that affect all of our lives."},{"Title":"Failure Analysis Case Studies II","review":"This is the second compilation of papers dealing with product failures, and taken directly from the journal Engineering Failure Analysis. The pattern was established with the first book, and covers a broad range of both products and failure modes. The widespread dissemination of such original works must only be to the good because it shows that engineers are capable of addressing users and colleagues about their own experience of product failure using investigative tools to their full potential. The book includes such cases as the bursting of a silo, the failure of a firewall in the Piper , Alpha disaster, torsional failure of a steel mooring rope, and the detailed investigation of the MV Kurdistan casualty. This reviewer must confess that he has three papers reprinted in the book, two dealing with the sudden failure of an under-designed plastic storage tank, and another describing the failure of a nylon car radiator tank. A detailed analysis of these and many more failures is discussed in our booksForensic Materials Engineering: Case StudiesandForensic Polymer Engineering. There is, as one might expect, a large section dealing with fatigue failures, such as the classic study of the several Comet aircraft failures, and sudden fractures of bolts and even surgical tools. Further sections examine failures caused by environmental attack, especially though corrosion cracking of one kind or another. But isn't it time for a more generic approach to describe those methods using case studies as exemplars and so help a new generation of engineers? Such books as this and a small handful of others, should be required reading for engineering students at all levels so that product design can be improved to lessen the chances of sudden failure. The only drawback of the book is its extremely high price, a publisher policy which is to be deplored given the need to spread the messages it presents as far and as wide as possible. Another quibble is that there are no colour plates at all in the book, reflecting the Victorian standards that publishers still adhere to, despite the almost universal use of colour on the world wide web."},{"Title":"Dark Age of Camelot: Catacombs (Prima's Official Strategy Guide)","review":"This book is INDISPENSABLE in using the expansion pack of Catacombs. You can play without it fine, but with this book, you can play Outstandingly. Maps are out of this world!!! Explanations of changes are marvelous. I highly recommend this to any DAoC player ! :)"},{"Title":"Dark Age of Camelot: Catacombs (Prima's Official Strategy Guide)","review":"I found this helpful in that most of what I needed to learn about Catacombs is in one place. Much less time spent searching for new merchants,other NPCs, mobs and drops. The maps are a lot nicer than the ones found in earlier DAOC Prima guides and in color. As stated in earlier reviews you also get maps for the New Frontiers.The downside is that as the game continues to evolve some of the info will be out of date."},{"Title":"Dark Age of Camelot: Catacombs (Prima's Official Strategy Guide)","review":"loved the game and was a fun experience and offered lots of interactive play with my friends. I would sugest this"},{"Title":"Dark Age of Camelot: Catacombs (Prima's Official Strategy Guide)","review":"I must say that I am extremely pleased with how this book has turned out. Deadlines prevented us from getting everything 100% nailed down, but we did manage to get this book looking really good! The maps by Kallisti and Brasse alone make the book worth the price. These maps are far superior to any maps previously published in a Prima Guide (those familiar with Kallisti's maps know what I am talking about).Not only are the maps extremely well done, but the listing of items and monsters is very comprehencise, and has the sort of information that a player will need.The new character classes are amazingly detailed in this book as well. There is the added bonus that each class has a section written by the developer hiimself! This way you get an inside view into the class, as well as getting a player's perspective on the class.And the additional material included makes for very enjoyable reading! There is a lot of background lore on Catacombs included as well as some RvR strategies, information on housing, and the ever popular humour from Kwip!"},{"Title":"A COURSE OF PURE MATHEMATICS, STUDENT EDITION","review":"This book is simply beyond any rating whatsoever. Giving 5 stars is to undermine the value of this classic.The first time I got this book, I was neither aware of it not of its author. I just picked it up randomly from school library. From the contents I figured it was a book on calculus. I immediately searched for the proof that &quot;every continuous function is integrable.&quot; This was the first book I encountered which had a rigorous proof of this.Then I began reading the chapters sequentially thinking that this seems to be a good book on calculus. The book went much beyond my expectation and it satisfied all my mathematical curiousities. All the mysteries of calculus were revelaed. Hardy demystified calculus in the first chapter itself by creating reals out ot rationals.The Dedekind's construction of reals as presented in this book is the best I have seen. The properties of reals were not stated as axioms (common approach in books on analysis) but rather deduced from those of rationals.The concepts of functions, limits, continuity, derivative etc. were explained in a prosaic style which has no parallel. This was also my first book on maths which had far more english words than mathematical symbols.After finishing the entire book I was wondering who was this guy G. H. Hardy who has written such a masterpiece.Only a few months later I came to know that he was one of the greatest British mathematicians of the century and was responsible for making our Indian Ramanujan famous. After that I read most of his books including &quot;A Mathematician's Apology&quot; and &quot;An Introduction to Theory of Numbers&quot;Any persons who thinks maths is dull should just read few pages from this book and I bet his old beliefs would be shattered."},{"Title":"A COURSE OF PURE MATHEMATICS, STUDENT EDITION","review":"This book is a classic, and deservedly so. It is comprehensive but not overloaded (like so many modern textbooks), crystal clear, well organized, rigorous. A wonderful text for teaching yourself higher math, which is how I am using it. But there is something beyond its didactic effectiveness that makes Hardy's work a must-have for anyone interested in math: This is a truly beautiful book, and working through it, while by no means easy, is an intellectual and aesthetic delight of the first order. Hardy is a genuinely elegant, subtle, incisive thinker, and his unbounded enthusiasm for his subject, duly controlled by British understatement, shines through every page. He conveys the irresistible, almost addictive quality of math."},{"Title":"A COURSE OF PURE MATHEMATICS, STUDENT EDITION","review":"This book may be a little quaint. The terminology is a little out of date, e.g. &quot;sequences&quot; are &quot;functions of a positive integral variable.&quot; It is marked by great organization and copious examples. What I appreciate most is the clarity and simplicity of the proofs. This is a great book for any serious student of real analysis prior to the Lebesque integral."},{"Title":"A COURSE OF PURE MATHEMATICS, STUDENT EDITION","review":"We didn't know who Hardy was... I learned much later the great mathematician (and type) he was. This book is an introduction to calculus written by this great master. The treatment is very rigorous and the reading is pleasant because everything is clearly written and motivated. When I started I was good at college algebra but didn't have any idea of what a derivative is. Hardy taught me from these basic things up to uniform convergence, etc, in a remote island in southern Brazil. Well, I had Courant too, but this I found, at that time, rather difficult. Thousands of mathematicians started with Hardy. It would be a good thing for you to do it too."},{"Title":"A COURSE OF PURE MATHEMATICS, STUDENT EDITION","review":"This edition (Rough Draft Printing, (October 5, 2007), # ISBN-10: 1603860495# ISBN-13: 978-1603860499) is not the 3rd edition of the text. It is a copy of the first edition, which has entered the public domain. There is no indication of this on the product description page. If you want the final edition that Hardy revised, look elsewhere."},{"Title":"A COURSE OF PURE MATHEMATICS, STUDENT EDITION","review":"G H Hardy's book is the pioneer in the field of introducing the formal and rigorous principles of Mathematical Analysis. By Hardy's own admission, the book sprang from the void that existed prior to its publication in 1907.In a word, the hallmark of this book is &quot;style&quot;, and Hardy must be the original style guru as far as Pure Mathematics goes.The book covers all the essential elements one would expect to see in an introductory course in the subject, namely the notion of a limit and its application to sequences, series, a comprehensive yet elementary exposition of convergence and its use in the definition of functions, differentiation and integration. All of the main theorems of the calculus of the real variable are covered. The latter chapters address the general theory of logarithmic, exponential and circular functions.Despite the glut of books on the subject of Real Analysis that are on the market, and there are some VERY GOOD ones, this is the classic text that every serious student of Pure Mathematics should begin with. Texts with more general coverage of real analysis such as Tom Apostol's Mathematical Analysis can follow thereafter.This book is nearly 100 years old. You can bet that it will still be around 100 years from now!"},{"Title":"A COURSE OF PURE MATHEMATICS, STUDENT EDITION","review":"This book is to pure maths what Knuth's Art of Computer Programming is to computer science or Feynman's lectures are to physics. If I was to be a castaway on a desert island, and was permitted to take only one book on mathematics, this is the one I would choose. I cannot recomend it too highly."},{"Title":"A COURSE OF PURE MATHEMATICS, STUDENT EDITION","review":"...people will look at this like we look at Euclid's Elements today, it's just one of those immortal books. Hardy starts by constructing the real numbers &amp; then doing all the calculus you'd ever want to know, and with a bunch of math 'trivia' that can't be found anywhere. I can't add much to what the other reviewers have said, except this book has some evil integrals from old Cambridge Tripos exams that would make some Putnam problems look easy. lol At least, if you're only allowed to use real variables (&amp; not complex variables &amp; residues). Get this book for an excellent reference no matter what level you're at."},{"Title":"A COURSE OF PURE MATHEMATICS, STUDENT EDITION","review":"G. H. Hardy was one of the greatest mathematicians of the 20th century. When the first edition of this book appeared in 1908, it was the only comprehensive introduction to analysis in the English language. Nearly a century later, it remains unsurpassed in that genre in any language.Elegant, detailed and precise, with perfect prose and proofs, and numerous examples, it reveals the talents of a master mathematician and pedagogue.I weep in frustration when I see the ridiculous number of poorly conceived and hideously expensive freshman calculus texts whose only claim to modernity are coloured boxes surrounding the equations. The reader patient enough to work through the many exercises in this magnificent volume will have a firm grounding in elementary analysis and feel the immense joy of pure mathematics.P.S. If you are a first year mathematics student and your faculty expects you to squander your money on one of those \\"paper weight\\" calculus books, you should complain loudly!"},{"Title":"A COURSE OF PURE MATHEMATICS, STUDENT EDITION","review":"This book is a gem of the introductory calculus classics. However, in recent years, there exist a lot of other excellent calculus texts. I would recommend you to use this classic as a reference rather than a formal text."},{"Title":"A COURSE OF PURE MATHEMATICS, STUDENT EDITION","review":"First, this is very nice book that was first published in 1908. It is EXTREMELY well written BUT what Hardy does in around 500 pages Rudin does in around 100 and with a more rigor (but, admittedly, very terse). You also have to remember that if you are studying analysis from a book 100 years old there are a few things that have happened since then - like the \\"Incompleteness Theorem\\" and the development of forcing, along with a much more rigorous development of set theory, topology, complex and real analysis (I'm not even sure the idea of Lp measures was fully accepted then). Still, this is great book to have - if you can get a really good used copy for $20, please buy it and seriously look it over. But don't study it and think you can attack many of the problems which are now routinely assigned in advanced calculus/real analysis. Even grandpa had to keep up with the times."},{"Title":"A COURSE OF PURE MATHEMATICS, STUDENT EDITION","review":"If you want to know and share what is math, you have to read books like this. You have to know that math is about thinking and solving problems. But that's not all there is to it, you have to know that she's like a beautiful woman, she's about beauty, art and love. That's what a man who is in love would 'think' about his beloved one. That's what you'll say the moment you begin to understand math. You'll fall in love with her.Federico TejadaPS: You can change the pronouns to adapt it to your personal gender or orientation.One thing else: Math is about doing it for yourself, not only reading what others did."},{"Title":"A COURSE OF PURE MATHEMATICS, STUDENT EDITION","review":"The work of G.H.

This book is one of the great classics of mathematics. The Kindle edition gets only one star, because it is virtually unreadable.

Most children are afraid of the dark at one time or another, and Monster Run is about a little girl whose night was full of monsters. The minute the lights are out there are wigglies and squirmies and scaries coming out of the closet and out from under the bed, and Nicole is frightened. (The illustrations are colorful, and not at all scary.) Nicole's beloved grandpa saves her from her fears by banishing the monsters forever, but you have to read the book to find out his magic formula.I began reading Monster Run to my youngest granddaugther when she was three, and two years later it's still her favorite book. She always asks for \\"The Monster Book\\".If your child or grandchild or even just a child you know, is afraid of the dark get this book. Donate a copy to the library or child care center.Some little one will be grateful."},{"Title":"The Monster Run","review":"\\"Plan your own monster run. Check every corner and dark place, make lots of noise, and then really chase them out of the child's room, down the hall and out the door. Don't forget to slam it closed.\\" ~MyLinda ButterworthNicole is frightened of the dark and has a great imagination. She is terribly afraid of all the monsters crawling out from under her bed. Her mother buys a nightlight, but after the lights are turned out, Nicole notices that some of the clothes on the floor look scary. Are they clothes or monsters?MyLinda Butterworth is a professional storyteller and loves to visit schools, libraries, festivals and bookstores. She is also the author of \\"Frogazoom.\\" I love her writing style and here is an example:\\"Carefully she peeked out from under her covers to see if they had gone, but there were even more of them. They were opening doors and slinking out from under her bed. Even her toys were dancing.\\"One night Nicole's grandma and grandfather arrive for a visit. Nicole goes to bed but later cries about monsters being in her bedroom. Her grandfather tells her they can get rid of the monsters and then proceeds to yell: \\"Any monsters under the bed, you better get out!\\" Soon Nicole joins in and helps to chase the monsters out the door. Soon Nicole is happily asleep in a room full of love.I remember still being afraid of the dark in my 20s, so I can completely understand the fear of the dark especially after watching a scary movie. Now I see night as even more beautiful than the day and actually enjoy walking around my house with the lights off because it is so peaceful as the moonlight filters through the windows.Most children do experience a fear of the dark or a fear of monsters in a closet. Let us not even talk about monsters under the bed or why I now have a bed that is flat on the floor. For my entire life, since I can remember I used to walk near a bed and imagine someone reaching out and grabbing my ankle. This must have resulted from some childhood incident and may have involved my naughty younger brother.Matthew Mercer's art fills the pages with beautiful creative interpretations of monsters and little Nicole. The picture of her in the room filled with monsters is not overly frightening and may even make children giggle. He worked at Disney as a caricature artist and almost made me feel sorry for the poor little monsters that had to leave the house.A Delightful and Comforting story that will help children fall asleep faster, especially if you chase the monsters out too.~The Rebecca Review"},{"Title":"The Monster Run","review":"Nicole is afraid of the dark, but her father knows just how to get rid of night monsters and leave her feeling safe and loved. In The Monster Run, author MyLinda Butterworth draws upon her experience as the mother of two children to write a superbly crafted children's book about being scared of the dark in the middle of the night. This engaging and reassuring story for young readers is perfectly illustrated by Matthew Mercer. The Monster Run is a welcome addition to family and community library collections for children -- especially children needing a little help at coping with night time anxieties."},{"Title":"Life Is a Game... and You Can Play It","review":"Nancy B walks her talk and in this book she has in a beautiful and heart felt way explained how we can go from thinker to a person who KNOWS.

White Folks breaks down the mentality of a Player/Pimp down from A to Z. He runs down the basics of the Pimp Game, the Confidence Game and the art of Forgery. It is not just a profession but a way of life and a lifestyle governed by rules, regulations and ethics. It is a honor to be a Player/Pimp in The Life and The Game! He also exposes the new generation of wanna-be thugs and dope dealers who try to claim fame to the Game but are just imposters who have no real Game and are just tricks and suckers who think using a gun or selling drugs is slick and most when arrested will snitch almost instantly.

It also let's the general public know that these clowns, caricature's, child molesters, rapist, and violent extortionist are not Pimps or Player's. True Pimp's & Player's are ultimate gentlemen who play game to separate lames from their money without the use of violence. They deal with, and help, woman whom choose to be in that life style. Real P's don't abuse woman and children, or force anyone to participate in that arena. Parts don't reflect the whole. A bad police officer or politician is just that.

This book clearly gives the reader a look into street hustles at its best! Lots of game for you in this book to soak up. Alot of the game may not be for everyone but for those who are about that life, get educated here first before you make your next move.I was kind of skeptical at first when I started reading the book because it didn't start off as I thought it would, but boy was I fooled later on. I grew up around many players, hustlers, macks and all sorts of guys and women with game but I realized, I can always learn something new. I learned quite a bit more from this book!"},{"Title":"Original Game: Interview with an Old School Player","review":"I ENJOYED READING THIS BOOK, VERY WELL WRITTEN.

Once I received my package, I was thrilled to know that my book has arrived. As I read from page one to the last (Yes, I finished the book in one sitting it was that GOOD)I was impressed by the detailed description of the \\"game\\" explained by The Original White Folks. I won't give to much in depth details of the book, but I can assure you that when you read the book you will be blown away by his charismatic and witty ways. A true Player who holds nothing back, you may even have a few laughs at his commentary of the game as you start to understand his world. Great man with a lot of knowledge on his belt. THIS BOOK IS WORTH IT, BUY IT YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED."},{"Title":"Original Game: Interview with an Old School Player","review":"White Folks ties up shoe laces with the game dropped in his book.

This story, as awesome as it sounds is a page turner. You won't be able to put it down. Any woman who has breast cancer or knows someone who has had it, should read this book. There is some excellent advice in it. And in the end, it's actually UPLIFTING!"},{"Title":"A Matter of Heart: One Woman's Story of Triumph Over Breast Cancer and a Heart Transplant","review":"This is human interest story that will move you to tears of joy and make you marvel at Nancy's indomitable will to live. Reading this story made me realize how lucky I am to have the health that I do. Nancy Pedder is a phenomenally strong woman who has never let her health issues cloud her positivity and zest for life. She has dealt with challenges that would make a lesser human crumble, in a way that is to be admired and respected. Nancy should be an inspiration to all that are organ recipients and the families of organ donors. I admire how she continues to make the most of the second shot at life that she got through her donated heart and how she is determined to lead the charge to promote organ donation."},{"Title":"A Matter of Heart: One Woman's Story of Triumph Over Breast Cancer and a Heart Transplant","review":"Once I began reading, I couldn't put the book down until the I finished it! This book has numerous endorsements from the medical profession, but like Nancy Pedder, I too am a cancer survivor, and this book is an INCREDIBLE account of the author's ordeal. Pedder truly has a knack for telling her story; one which will keep you on the edge of your seat until the very last page. Not only will the reader be amazed and astonished at the incredible odds Nancy overcame and SURVIVED, but also this book tugs at your heart (no pun intended) and will hopefully be a positive impact on organ donation. Nancy's story makes you not only want to stand and cheer that you are allive, but also makes you want to thank God each day for the many blessings we sometimes overlook. This is the MOST positive book I have ever read on surviving cancer - and as a 17 year cancer suvivor, I should know. Everyone should read this book!"},{"Title":"A Matter of Heart: One Woman's Story of Triumph Over Breast Cancer and a Heart Transplant","review":"IF YOU WANT TO SPEND AN EVENING READING A MOST INTERESTING LIFE STORY THIS BOOK IS FOR YOU.

Read this book for a good time!"},{"Title":"Chains of Command","review":"If you like action, suspense, and well developped characters, you'll love Chains of Command. It features the RF-111G bomber and a new series of characters (if you're wondering, YES this novel is linked to the &quot;McLanahan Timeline&quot;, though you don't get very many character crossovers). Some of the characters, like Lt.Colonel Daren Mace, you just got to love, and there's also an assortmant of characters that I hate even if they're only fictional, such as the White House's First Lady who doesn't know when to shut up. This novel also features stunning technology such as the AGM-131 Short Range Attack Missile (SRAM). This is the third Dale Brown Novel to go nuclear, and it also features a short but spectacular appearance by the top-secret&quot;Aurora&quot; spyplane. Essential reading!"},{"Title":"Chains of Command","review":"God save us all from avenging Americans and flawed but strong at heart female characters.

I finished it in a couple of days and then experienced some kind of blackness. I didn't have another of his books. So I simply went to Brussels and visited an English bookshop. They had all of his titles in their racks. In one day, I bought all other books. I now savour them. I read other authors like Tom Clancy, Harold Coyle, Richard Herman, etc. They are good but no one comes close to Dale Brown. I just hope he continues to write in this way for years to come."},{"Title":"Chains of Command","review":"&quot;Chains of Command&quot; presents an interesting situation: the tactical use of nukes without the whole world going ape. Brown develops the story well, but his detail in the operations of the Vampire sometimes leave me anticipating the next chapter, and not in the good way. This minor flaw aside, this one's definitely worth it. Being a person who roots for the underdog, the attack on Ukraine leaves me aching for revenge, and the President and her husband (hah!) are truly evil. I'd recommend this book to most people, but true military nuts will enjoy it most."},{"Title":"Chains of Command","review":"A GREAT BOOK, BUT I THOUGHT IT COULD HAVE BEEN LESS IN THE TECHNO AREA. IN FACT THIS WAS MY FIRST DALE BROWN BOOK. I WOULD SAY THAT I WILL NOT BUY ANOTHER ONE UNLESS IT JUST GRABS ME. THE CHARCTER FURNESS AND MACE WAS THE BOMB IN THE STORY. AND THATS IN A GOOD WAY. IT STILL GETS 3 STARS. WOW ALREADY"},{"Title":"Chains of Command","review":"I had been a casual fan of Brown's work until I paid money for this monstrosity. The plot is dull- a lame rehash of the countless &quot;rise of the old USSR&quot; that have flooded the genre since the events of 1991. The characters are weak, and the plot twists are weaker. Worst of all is Brown's disgusting Clinton-bashing, so naked in its hostility that it makes Brown look foolish and petty. Maybe Brown should have spent less time whining about Clinton than writing a better story. Better yet- he could give me my money back."},{"Title":"Chains of Command","review":"Dale Brown has much technical information about the F-111, and he batters his reader with the most insignificant, irrelevant detail. And while his irrelevant details about the aircraft might be at least accurate, most of the other basic machinery of his plots is not. He'd like to champion the liberal treatment on the part of the all-wise US military in general and Dale Brown in particular of the female warrior in contrast with the backward Turks. Fact is, however, that Turkish military forces have long had women in combat positions. His geography is often just plain wrong. But it is Brown's incessant, hysterical, and thoroughly irrelevant bashing of the Clintons that completely destroys any claim CHAINS OF COMMAND might have of being a novel. In his hate-filled brain, military officers, both junior and senior, curse their commander-in-chief and the First Lady with great frequency. Good military personnel in fact do no such thing. Whatever they may think, a good military woman or man understands the way the United States chain of command works. And in this same hate-filled imagination of his, Brown creates wholly unbelievable situations that make the Clintons, and folks from Arkansas generally, look and act like clowns. No matter whether one voted for Bill or Hillary Clinton or ever would, the pure venom spewed by Brown ruins what could have been a passible novel. I can't read Brown anymore. I can't bring myself to wade through the pettiness of his political and technical irrelevancies and incorrectness to get at the one or two solid elements of his story."},{"Title":"Chains of Command","review":"Great book! It keeps the reader glued as to how the invasion of the Ukraine and Moldova is happening and how the Soviet Union is rising again. Col. Tychina, Lt. Col Mace and Maj. Furness are in-depth characters. I personally had the privledge of actually meeting Dale Brown and getting my copy of this book autographed by him. Great author and another great work!"},{"Title":"Chains of Command","review":"Another great thriller from DB. In this one you have a bit of a change from the normal Patrick McClannahan story and you meet Mace as well as the &quot;Iron Maiden&quot;. The world has changed and many of the fighter pilots are now part of the reserves, and a huge percentage of them are women. See what they have to do to become fighter pilots.You will also learn a lot about photon bombs and their destruction of life etc. In this story you will cover a lot of ground from the Ukraine, Turkey to Plattsburgh NY as well as Iraq. It is a fast paced story with the normal plethora of detail on military actions as well as equipment from DB. I really enjoyed this story but I think Fatal Terrain is my favorite so far..."},{"Title":"Chains of Command","review":"Like all military books. Plots are always good and fast moving. Always am looking for his next book. More. More."},{"Title":"Chains of Command","review":"The overall book is good. However the end is not as good as the rest of it. It is not as convincing as the beginning and feels like it was written in a rush to print. Too much Technical data that will appeal to those who like airplanes only."},{"Title":"Chains of Command","review":"I haven't read many of these war/espionage novels, but this one I picked up before a long flight and I stayed glued until the finish. I thought that the F-111 flying narratives and the techno-aviation stuff were terrific (maybe because I'm a pilot). The political intrigue was well constructed, and perhaps even scary because it seemed too close to reality. The clash between the Turkish, and the US Air Force's use of women combat pilots, was also an intriguing element for me and I thought that Brown did an astute job in portraying the depth of cultural mismatch. Fast moving and easy to read, yet tense and exciting."},{"Title":"Chains of Command","review":"Another first-rate military aviation thriller from Dale Brown which is next to impossible to put down. The scenario of Boris Yeltsin being ousted from power and being replaced by a hardline communist best on war is a highly feasible one considering how unstable Russia can be in real life. When Russia tries to invade the Ukraine, Moldova and Romania using tactical nuclear weapons and the neutron bomb, the US President(a southern hillbilly draft-dodger who has a passion for M&amp;Ms, Coke and Fritos . . . guess who . . .) and his dominatrix(!!!!) First Lady (who is more evil than the Russian communist leader!) dallies over a miliary response and sends in a reserve F-111 fighter-bomber squadron to deal with the situation. The characters are well crafted, especially Daren Mace and Rebecca Furness and the chemistry both in the air and in bed betwen them! General Freeman is a worthy gung-ho Chairman of the Joint Chiefs and a flyer by the name of Fogelman is full of macho insecurity when it comes to real combat . . . The flying and war scenes are highly realistic and compelling; the first third of the book centres around Mace's secret mission in Desert Storm of nuking Saddam Hussein and his harassment by the military when he is forced to abort. The second part deals with the F-111 crew training and the build-up to the war in Turkey and the Ukraine, and the final half has intense action that's so brilliant you feel you're there. BUY THIS BOOK NOW!"},{"Title":"Chains of Command","review":"I kind of like many of Dale's books, although I would rate them consistently lower than Clancy or Bond. This one is however below average. The first half is decent, especially the Desert Storm mission, although the top brass' reaction to the latter is unrealistic. The second half is a let-down, with totally unbelievable actions. And the Clinton bashing alone takes at least two points of the rating. By the way, maybe Mr Brown could buy a decent map of the world? The Hong-Kong gaff in Fatal Terrain has been highlighted before, but here he manages to mix up Slovakia (formed from the former Czechoslovakia) with Slovenia (formed from the former Yugoslavia), even in the map included in the book."},{"Title":"Chains of Command","review":"I have read several books by Brown and he seems to suffer from Tom Clancey's urge to describe in minute detail the entire operations of a submarine. Only Brown's forte is airplanes and in the course of his plot he wants you to know as much about the operations of an airplane as he does. This creates many pages which I just gloss over hoping that something else in the overall plot will surface which will hold my attention. I did not even finish this book."},{"Title":"Chains of Command","review":"Petty politics undermines what otherwise might have been a passable action novel. Brown's grudge against the Clintons gets the better of him and skews the novel away from its otherwise interesting plotline, toward the author's apparently bottomless hatred of the First Family. One gets the feeling that only the intervention of his publisher prevented Brown from using even cruder language, particularly in his depiction of the First Lady. I respect the fact that Brown may have strong feelings agains the Clintons, but other authors I have read do a much better job of keeping their novels from having such a vindictive tone -- next to Brown, Tom Clancy seems downright even-handed. Unless he only wants to appeal to the most bitter of Clinton-haters, Brown should consider toning down the rhetoric and focusing on fiction in the future."},{"Title":"Chains of Command","review":"This is my fourth book by Dale Brown.Although i am a fan, i can not say this is the best novel of him.Again this time the aviation stuff and scenario was very good but i think Mr.Brown did not do his homework well.He should have made a better research about the countries and armies he is telling in the book.He reflects that women are treated as second class people in Turkey and even a Turkish Squadron Commander insults an allied female officer because he thinks women can not fight.Things seem quite acceptaple when you look from 8000 miles away.But when you get closer and do a good research you see the fact that women are serving in the Turkish Army ,Air Force and Navy for 75 years.With the most sophisticated weapons, well trained personnel and modern commanders Turkish Army is not the one described in this book.Other than this matter i can say i missed ol'McLanahan whom i got used to see in 3 out of 5 Dale Brown book.Anyway Mr. Brown is a good storyteller so you will definitely enjoy this novel."},{"Title":"The Assault on Equality (Praeger Series in Political Economy)","review":"In many ways, this is a disappointing book. Predictable in its attempt to create a 'scathing' rebuttal to the hideous 'Bell Curve', this book offers little to anyone versed in the incredible variety of contemporary feminist discourse. For those prepared for some *real* thinking, try more transgressive/radical voices, such as Patricia Williams, bell hooks, Mary Daly, and many others; also, see various radical works related to Lacan. The Assault on Equality is simply too simple, a statement of the obvious racism and stupidity of Charles Murray et al., and it cannot be said to contribute orginial thinking on the issue of race. Feminists in particular will find this book a bit simple-minded. Well intentioned, but dull, even as the authors are trying to sound angry."},{"Title":"Angry (How I feel)","review":"This is a great little book for working with young children, who have a hard time talking about their feelings. The removeable stickers allow for the child to interact and express their own feelings over and over again. I also have enjoyed other books in this series that deal with other emotions."},{"Title":"Angry (How I feel)","review":"\\"How I feel\\" series is great! What a shame they are out of print. We already have the \\"How I feel Scared\\" which, so far, is the best one. We have Happy and Angry and would like the whole collection. This series uses simple and clear scenarios followed by ways to handle the feelings. My toddler, 2yrs old asks me to read this to him over and over again."},{"Title":"Kirkpatrick Mission (Diplomacy Wo Apology Ame at the United Nations 1981 to 85","review":"This book does an excellent job of exposing the UN's support for terror and antisemitism. And we discover how difficult it was for even Jeane Kirkpatrick to counter some of it. However, I think the main issue of the book is not Kirkpatrick, but the UN.I thought it was strange how difficult it was for our administration to counter requests to bring Arab terrorists into the country on the grounds of them being UN observers. Or refuse to accept wacky UN braying about the Fourth Geneva Convention applying to Israelis living in the West Bank.Still, the most moving part of the book is on Abu Eain, a flat-out terrorist and murderer who was made a hero by the UN. The General Assembly vote was 75 to 21 in favor of condemning the United States for being willing to extradite this killer so he could face murder charges. That convinced me how utterly the UN supported terrorism.Next, there is a section on an incident in which a loony Israeli killed two Arabs and wounded about 40 others at the Dome of the Rock. This impressed me. We're at the UN, which is supposed to deal with the entire world, and it is spending more than half of its time on Israel. And it's doing so not because Israel demands any attention, but just to avoid dealing with anything important.After an interlude on the Falkland Islands, we go back to Israel again, and the successful attempts to rescue Arafat by sea from Lebanon. The author is proud of this, pointing out that a failure to do this (or, say, letting Arafat be executed by the Israelis) would have jeopardized the peace between Israel and Egypt. I think it simply shows how difficult it was even for Kirkpatrick to obtain the political strength to stand up to a pure terrorist such as Arafat.Guess what we get next? More Israel, as it gets threatened with expulsion by the UN. And as members of the US team are accused of having contacts with Arab terrorists.Finally, there is something the UN gets to discuss besides Israel or the Falklands, namely the shooting down of a Korean airliner by the Soviets. And the US invasion of Grenada.But after that, we're back to terrorism, with the infamous 1977 Protocols to revise the 1949 Geneva Convention. These Protocols were basically what even the New York Times called them, namely a \\"pro-terrorist document.\\" And the United States came close to endorsing them.Maybe the most important part of the book is at the end, where we discover how the International Court of Justice has started to treat UN General Assembly resolutions as international law. This depressed me a little, as I pondered the prospects of spending eternity as an international outlaw.Before I read this book, I felt that the conservatives in this country were a little too eager to demand special favors for ourselves at the expense of other nations. But whether that's a valid complaint or not, I now think that a bigger problem is a UN that demands special favors for terrorists."},{"Title":"Voices Cast Out to Talk Us In (Iowa Poetry Prize)","review":"Roberson weaves his poems out of any number of different voices, all compelling, and with the sort of compelling rhythms that too often seem foreign to contemporary poetry. Frequently his poems play a kind of &quot;touch-and-go&quot; game with the reader, where a voice will make its appearance just long enough for the reader to acknowledge its presence, and then the poem is off again into some other voice, some other perspective. Which makes for exciting reading. And when was the last time you actually Sandpile&quot; and &quot;Elegy for a White Cock.&quot;"},{"Title":"A Likeness","review":"I read the prologue, and hated it. The prose was unintelligible and clumsily written. However, I decided that I should give the book more of a chance, and attempted to read the next several chapters. The novel only became more painful, both stylistically and with its utter lack of coherent plot.The \\"protaganist\\" is pleased that his betrothed is killed in a horrible accident, so he is free to pursue his \\"higher purpose\\" of being an artist. He also appears to view everything by color, which is described in horrendously bland articulation by Overall.This was absolutley the worst book that I have attempted to read since 'Lucrezia Borgia: A Novel' by John Faunce. In fact, it is possibly worse, as I could not even manage to get past the third chapter."},{"Title":"A Family Business","review":"This is a true account of a series of crimes you would think never even existed. The bad guys were seemingly well respected business people who unfortunately saw a golden opportunity to make a lot of money cremating bodies after harvesting them of their organs and gold fillings. The fact that they got away from it for so long is amazing. The fact that many of their apparant crimes still go unsolved is even more chilling."},{"Title":"A Family Business","review":"I read this book when it first came out, years ago. I've never forgotten it. Ken Englade has brought the remote and esoteric business of cremation up close where one can almost feel the fine dust in his nostrils.This is a true story of a heartless, greedy family , entrusted with the remains of countless loved ones, who broke that trust without compunction. If you want to read an expose' on what can happen in an industry without proper independent auditing and supervision, this book will give you chills.Congratulations to Ken Englade on his wonderfully written and researched book."},{"Title":"A Family Business","review":"I read this book several years ago only to eventually meet a person who's grandfather was one of the creamated bodies! I had passed it on to a friend,regretably,and all I can say is if you come across it purchase it immediately and get ready to be entertained and educated in the arena thatis the mortuary business. A business we all know too little about! Thanks Ken Englade for such a compelling and thought provoking book, my only regret is that there are not more available, how 'bout another printing, please, I'll be the first to buy!"},{"Title":"A Family Business","review":"Ken Englade's A FAMILY BUSINESS is the saga - and it's definitely a saga - of the Lamb/Sconce family conglomeration of funeral homes and cremation facilities in southern California. Other than some family history, the time period is from the mid-80s through 1991 and features allegations of more than a few ugly and unethical practices against owners Jerry and Laurianne Sconce and their allegedly evil spawn, David, as well as against numerous of their employees. The list of charges was so lengthy as to resemble, in Englade's words, an Amtrak schedule.These included, among others, illegally harvesting and selling organs from the dead bodies; cremation of multiple bodies at one time (the record attempt of 38 clogged the chimneys and created a fire that burned down a crematorium) as opposed to the prescribed one per burn and distributing random ashes to the families; assault; conspiracy to commit murder; and murder. And in an especially whimsical note, David, who ran one of the crematoriums, was accused by the law as well as by his employees of yanking out any teeth of the newly deceased that contained gold, breaking jaws if necessary, and making multi-weekly runs to a gold dealer.The long but interesting trial section, actually more a legal wrangling section, flows smoothly with some, but not excessive, repetition. Much of the outcome is infuriating as, as of the date of publication, 5 years after the original charges were filed, many had not yet been resolved. So there is in that regard a sense of incompleteness.The book is well researched and professionally written. The style is reportorial and the author's own personality never intrudes. There is some fabricated dialogue, which Englade acknowledges, but it is well done, and with a few rare exceptions (the presentation of a dead man's thoughts come to mind) contains no false notes.A FAMILY BUSINESS is a really captivating read, and an added benefit is that there are a few pages dealing with various kinds of poisons found in plants, and I had the pleasure of making my wife nervous by discussing this section with her. I also now wonder how many other crematoriums simply burn bodies at random and then provide the families with who knows what ashes. I'd assume many, the world being full of grasping and unethical people and one urn of ashes looking pretty much like the next and all.I highly recommended this book to fans of true crime as interesting, entertaining, and thought provoking."},{"Title":"Frost on my Moustache: The Arctic Exploits of a Lord and a Loafer","review":"Tim Moore has written one of the best travel books I've read in the last five years. His humour is contagious and one finds oneself urging him on as he battles across the northern seas in the footsteps of a 19th Century British aristocrat. Icelanders with a sense of humour about their own country's idiosyncrasies will find the book a delight. The remaining 98% of the population will demand the author is detained and given the full bottom inspection treatment next time he passes through Reykjavik airport. If you enjoy Bill Bryson then you will enjoy Moore. Moore is as funny but is significantly more insightful and ruder! As a regular traveler to Europe this is one of those books I would recommend packing to read as you zip over the pond to the UK (or even Iceland!)"},{"Title":"Frost on my Moustache: The Arctic Exploits of a Lord and a Loafer","review":"You will enjoy this fumbling traveller's tribute to a personal hero. Tim Moore's trials and tribulations are too comic to be tragic. His dogged determination to complete a journey in the footsteps of Lord Dufferin keeps him going through graphic sea sickness and prolific pronunciation problems (try Icelandic &amp; Norwegian on the same trip!). The heavy dose of British references means some jokes will be wasted if you don't know much about the UK, but literary slapstick a la Jerry Lewis will keep you giggling anyway.This is a great book to read as you embark on any journey that looks a bit daunting. If he can survive, anyone can (don't worry, he knows this, too!)."},{"Title":"Frost on my Moustache: The Arctic Exploits of a Lord and a Loafer","review":"It says everything about this book, really, that the title comes from an intensely colloquial joke that is too obscene to repeat here. Frost on My Moustache is a travel humor book that focuses far more on humor and cursing than it does on the travel. But what it lacks in actual information it more than makes up for in laughter - the kind of oh-god-just-let-me-take-another-breath laughter that can lead to hospitalization, insanity, and inexplicable joy. However, Moore - and his book - aren't for everyone.Moore is very colloquially British - he uses lots of pop culture references that will not be obvious to most Americans (or Europeans or Australians or...). He's also very much like a certain kind of aging college student: perpetually intoxicated, foul-mouthed, inclined to rant and whine. But despite it all, he's lots of fun, and while you might not like him, you'll love reading about his travels.The word that most often gets used in Tim Moore book reviews is &quot;Bryson.&quot; The comparisons between Tim Moore and Bill Bryson are apparently unavoidable. And, to a certain extent, they hold true: both writers are very funny, both are extremely tightfisted, both spend an awful lot of time complaining. But Moore is not Bryson. At most, he could be described as an embryo Bryson - he hasn't yet learned the secrets of a wide appeal, a cultivated air, or a dignified approach to life. Moore curses, he wails, he throws regular temper tantrums, he's sulky and lazy and fixated. And he eats a lot of hot dogs. Don't expect thoughtful cultural exposition, insightful observations, or descriptions of the local cuisine from him.But I promise you: if you pick up Frost on My Moustache, you will experience frequent bouts of all-out hysteria. This book is well worth buying and reading, not once, but again and again."},{"Title":"Frost on my Moustache: The Arctic Exploits of a Lord and a Loafer","review":"This is one of the funniest books I've read in years. I'm not normally a lover of travel writing, but I couldn't put this down and was sorry when I got to the end. The style of Frost on My Moustache is witty and unpretentious and the content unusual and extremely amusing. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Frost on my Moustache: The Arctic Exploits of a Lord and a Loafer","review":"To be considered more than just a good book, any travelogue has to show more than simply intelligence, humour or stylish writing. It requires a good theme - the writer needs to have an original and clearly defined purpose. In all of these criterion (and more presumably)Moore has surpassed all of my own expectations that I had before I bought it. The humour is, in places very English, but that should not deter anyone else from reading it. The only real reason why Tim can't be regarded as an equal to Bill Bryson is because unlike Bill, who has lived in Britain and America for vast periods of time, Moore only knows life in Britain. This alone is probably enough to put lots of Americans, Canadians, Australians etc. off but the fact that many people cant understand the jokes must be very frustrating. Personally, I understood it all but that's firstly because of where I'm from and secondly because I'm a cynic and enjoy reading books where the writer is self-depreciating. The book is informative and witty but something tells me that an attempt at another travel book might prove foolish on his part. He would need at least as good a theme and would need to sustain his humour over an even longer period.

No mess-ups here."},{"Title":"Frost on my Moustache: The Arctic Exploits of a Lord and a Loafer","review":"In this book, Moore attempts to retrace the derring-do of Victorian maverick diplomat/aristocrat Lord Dufferin as he explores Iceland, the coast of Norway, the 32-mile-wide, rising-from-the-sea Arctic volcano Jan Mayen and the barrens of Spitzbergen in the Greenland Sea. Despite more modern travel transport systems, Moore is hilariously unable to achieve the same milestones, and strives then to emulate the gloomy suffering of Dufferin's servant, Wilson. Dry and droll. Not recommended by the Spitzbergen Chamber of Commerce."},{"Title":"Frost on my Moustache: The Arctic Exploits of a Lord and a Loafer","review":"Impossible to read sober, impossibly complex to be reading drunk, I'm still not sure what the author does for a living, but I know it's one of the funniest, most complex travelogues I've ever read.If you are interested in the North --as in the far north including Iceland and the like-- then this is the way to go.What does the title mean? I can't ruin it, but it's fantastic. The best ...... of all!The rest of the book? A classic \\"made up\\" travelog in the sense that the author simply creates a journey, goes on it, and writes about it.With style. And big words/sentences/paragraphs. And laughter. Much laughter.The title does give a hint of his style: \\"Exploits of a Lord & Loafer.\\" Accurate.In the same way that Bill Bryson uses 3 words to conjure up the most vivid picture in my mind, Tim Moore uses complex, nearly poetic language to the same effect -- and the same laugh-out-loud guffaws of pure joy at such fantastic wit.Cheers to Tim. Next time, I'd just like it if he used shorter sentences to keep my brain from blowing."},{"Title":"Frost on my Moustache: The Arctic Exploits of a Lord and a Loafer","review":"I actually read Frost on my Mustache about six months back, and have since lost count of the number of friends I've loaned it out to.

Tim goes around Iceland and parts of Norway. Tim Moore does not travel well. He does not like some of the places he travels to. He doesn't even get to some he plans on. Real travelling. Great writing. Easy reading with several belly-laughs thrown in. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Frost on my Moustache: The Arctic Exploits of a Lord and a Loafer","review":"Subtitled, &quot;The Arctic Exploits of a Lord and Loafer,&quot; this seemed right up my alley because I just can't resist books about the frozen north. The author, Tim Moore, is an Englishman, and he makes sure that the reader doesn't forget it. His trip is patterned on that of a British aristocrat, Lord Dufferin, who sailed his yacht to from Iceland to Norway and eventually to the town of Spitzbergen near the Arctic Circle in 1856. Moore uses a copy of the travelogue that Dufferin wrote at the time for reference, and did some additional research by paying a visit to Dufferin's royal descendents for more background information.All this makes for an interesting premise, especially since the author is well acquainted with Iceland since his wife is Icelandic and he is able to provide some interesting insights and observations about that place. He can't exactly replicate Lord Dufferin's travels though. After all, Tim Moore doesn't have his own ship and is making his pilgrimage alone. And so he books passage on a number of commercial Norwegian vessels to get where he wants to go. Also, instead of transversing Iceland with a team of horses, he opts for a bicycle.The whole book is intended to be humorous as the self-effacing hero sets out on his travels. Perhaps it is humorous to a British audience. But, as an American, I missed all of the jokes and even though I read some passages several times, I still was not able to understand some of the incidents he described. This surprised me because I have no trouble with Charles Dickens. But his modern-day witticisms were completely lost on me and I soon found myself getting annoyed. Mr. Moore presents himself as an out-of-shape curmudgeon and proud of it. He complains throughout about everything, and mostly about his physical discomfort. The reader is treated to long and detailed descriptions of his constant seasickness as well as every muscle ache. Most of the people he meets are disagreeable, the meals awful and the prices exorbitant. He keeps going though, trying to prove that if Lord Dufferin could do it, Tim Moore could do it too.Along with way the I did learn a bit of history and geography about this area of the world as well as more than I ever wanted to know about Lord Dufferin. The author also did take me to a part of the Arctic I know little about, although he made it seem so bleak and cold and inhospitable that I have little interest in ever going there myself. It's too bad I didn't understand his humor because it might have brightened the bleak landscape he painted. Not recommended, especially for American readers."},{"Title":"Frost on my Moustache: The Arctic Exploits of a Lord and a Loafer","review":"I didn't finish this book, because I didn't like the author's style. It was difficult to follow his &#34;train of thought&#34;, I guess. The information about the arctic and Iceland was interesting, but not enough for me to continue reading to the end."},{"Title":"Frost on my Moustache: The Arctic Exploits of a Lord and a Loafer","review":"The story is wonderfully interesting- a slapdash attempt at recreating the Arctic journey of an almost too-good-to-be-true Victorian peer, Lord Dufferin. The descriptions are vivid (sometimes too vivid, in the case of seasickness), and the locations fascinating. Moore meets host of eccentric and endearing people on this voyage (most of whom are astonishingly patient with and tolerant of him), and h's lively prose brings them to full life. There are some laugh-out-loud moments, many of which involve Moore's hallucinations brought on by overdosing on anti-seasickness pills.The reader is very good- he has a fine way with accents and pronunciation (even with Icelandic, which is notoriously difficult), a good sense of emotion and pacing, and smooth and clear delivery.I usually love this kind of \\"adventure travel\\" narrative... in other cases, I might have given it 4 or even 5 stars. However, so much about this kind of book depends on the author. And Moore is really a let-down. He's aggressively self-deprecating, almost as misanthropic as Paul Theroux, petty and mean spirited, penny-pinching but full of entitlement, cowardly yet overconfident- a sort of shambling, blithering caricature. As he whinges, cringes, stinges and binges on a route that approximates the original 1856 voyage, I constantly felt like slapping him. Lord Dufferin, wherever he is, could only be disappointed by this book- even without the various cheap shots that Moore takes at him throughout. \\"What a loser!\\" was my constant thought.Worth a listen, but not a keeper. But at least it got me to pick up the book that inspired Moore- \\"Letters from High Latitudes\\"- which I'm expecting to enjoy far more."},{"Title":"Frost on my Moustache: The Arctic Exploits of a Lord and a Loafer","review":"As you can see from other reviews, this book isn't for everyone. But if you like quirky humor; give it a try. This was the funniest book I have read in years even though my wife thought I was crazy as I often laughed so much that it hurt! If you have not traveled in Britain or read a bit of contemporary British writing, you will miss some of his humor but it is still well worth reading. Enjoy."},{"Title":"Frost on my Moustache: The Arctic Exploits of a Lord and a Loafer","review":"I love travel books and so picked this up to do my vicarious summer vacation. I thought his observations about Iceland were wonderful, and made it seem somewhere reasonable to visit. However, the graphic scenes of seasickness made me glad not to be on that part of the voyage! Some of the British slang was beyond me, but all in all a good summer read."},{"Title":"Frost on my Moustache: The Arctic Exploits of a Lord and a Loafer","review":"This book had the ingredients of a great travel book. First, the author is very witty at times. Second, he chose Iceland, which is one of Europe's more intriguing nations, and the fact that his wife is Icelandic gives him some bicultural insights. Third, travel books need some sort of 'hook' or theme, and Moore's theme is to retrace the travels of Lord Dufferin, a 19th-century adventurer. Moore starts with an overview of life in Iceland (the best part), discusses a cross-Iceland bicycle journey (too many pages dedicated to a fairly uneventful trip), then describes a boat trip from Iceland to Norway (during which he's incapacitated by seasickness), and eventually works his way north to the Norwegian island of Svalbard. One of the reasons this book didn't 'work' for me is that the author comes across as a disagreeable person. He tries to be funny and entertaining, but refers to his outbursts of temper directed at others often enough that one is left wondering how disagreeable Tim Moore really is in real life."},{"Title":"Frost on my Moustache: The Arctic Exploits of a Lord and a Loafer","review":"... I could only suffer through 17 pages before putting it down for good. The prose seemed deliberately obfuscated and gossipy, and the way it was presented was so far from compelling that I had to read the back cover to figure out what he was droning on about.Now if the book delivered what the back cover promised, that would have been great. And maybe it did. But I found myself easily distracted and completely without any understanding of what he was talking about.Maybe if I was English, some of the names and places would have been more familiar.

I used it to increase the SQL level of my employees. We did two puzzles a week, and compared our answers. And it sure helped. But there are some buts in this story. First, the puzzles are not always defined well, so you do not know what to do before you see the discussion in the answer part. Second, a lot of the solutions are not very good. Whenever I found a better one, I mailed Joe Celko. Every time he replied to me (very nice!) that somebody else also pointed it out and that there were even better solutions that mine. This means that the solutions are not always that good in the book. But still, it has alo of good brainteasers.

It takes the concepts in Celko's seminal work, SQL for Smarties, and illustrates how to apply them to solve real-world problems. As always, the book is rife with tales from Celko's long and varied career in the SQL trenches, as well as the subtle witticism for which he is famous. Like all great technical books - it's timeless - the techniques you learn today will work tomorrow because Celko follows the ANSI/ISO standard to the letter.

So I eagerly bought SQL Puzzles and Answers a few weeks ago and read it from cover to cover.The book essentially introduces the reader to the \\"thinking out of the box\\" approach to solving difficult SQL problems. The author walks us through the logic behind solutions of a collection of SQL puzzles that were submitted by readers of his magazine columns over the years. He demonstrates that there are numerous ways to solve SQL problems and that sometimes the solution lies right in the design of the base tables. But more importantly he helps the reader see that you can often solve seemingly unsolvable sql problems if you approach the problem with the right technique.My one complaint is that the book does not come with turnkey source code files and they are not available for download.

Some puzzles took hours to solve and some were straight forward. This book teaches you some basic principles and patterns as well satisfy your need for brain teasers.Detail Review:This book for all the SQL programmers regardless of database language you prefer. Book contains examples in different languages (SQL Server, Oracle, Sybase, Informix etc). If reader is absolute beginner this book is not what reader needs to start. This book is perfect for someone who has industry experience or has deep understanding of different SQL concepts.This book contains 75 different puzzles. Each puzzle starts with puzzle definition or question and follows by multiple answers. Answers vary by either techniques or programming languages, in many cases both. Puzzles contained in this book are like typical day to day work problems, many time any developer can find the solution if they spend some time on it. However, some problems are quite unique in their own way and reading them gives broader idea of database programming.One thing I will note about book is the quality of the puzzle, as other reviewer has noted some puzzles are just not puzzle but simple problems which can be solved easily by experienced developer. Not all developers are on same level and I am sure every reader has their own opinion and choice.The idea on which the book is written is very simple - \\"Think out of the box\\". The problems are real, the solutions are real and multiple answers from wide verity of participants - this makes this book worth the time. Every solution has its own flair and taste. If any problem is attempted with right technique and sound theory it is always easy to reach resolution.There is no source code available to download for this book so reader will have to write everything by their own. It is good in one way as ideally all readers should try to solve each puzzles by their own, however, source code will sure help many ways.Rating: 4 StarsSummary: I think this book should be there available for every database developer who has reached advanced level. If developer can solve most of the puzzles from this book he sure is advanced level developer, if not while trying to solve them he will reach advanced level.Pinal DavePrincipal Database Administrator(blog.sqlauthority.com)"},{"Title":"Joe Celko's SQL Puzzles and Answers (The Morgan Kaufmann Series in Data Management Systems)","review":"I agree with \\"online shopper\\"; these puzzles do not present anything out of the ordinary for a day-to-day SQL programmer.

For this reason, if you did a lot of SQL work, you won't find anything useful in this book.If I am presented a puzzle, I expect it to look impossible to solve at first, and once you get on track of finding a solution, solving it would turn out to be a lot of fun.

I read a lot and this is one of the worst presentations I have seen. The other students in the class who I talked with about this textbook also had the same comment.

I had not done simulations for years, and this book walks you through the process of learning Arena. It starts out simple--even without actual computer models, just a manual process. It moves through simple high-level, pre-coded models, and then adds complexity. All told, if you work your way through the book, you will understand Arena, a widely used programming language. Note, however, that the student version of the software in this book can only manipulate 15 entities. That's okay for learning, but for real production simulations to answer real questions, then you would need the professional version. That, of course, costs thousands of dollars. Your company would buy this.

Let me put it this way, I guess I really wouldn't want to be without this book. On the other hand, I found it frustrating to use when I needed quick answers, as these authors love getting right into the details. For example, when I wanted to add a conveyor to a process I was modeling, there wasn't a simple introduction at the beginning of the conveyer section to provide a quick, adequate overview. The book doesn't use effective formatting to help one quickly find specific things needed (i.e., Entities Entering Along Conveyor; Entity Proceeds if There is Space; Power and Free Conveyor; Synchronous Movement of Entities; Basic Accumulating; Basic Nonaccumulating; Processing on a Conveyor; Selecting Based on Inspection; Varying Entity Sizes on Accumulating; Failures for Conveyors; Two Merging to One; Choosing Alternate Conveyors; Merging Conveyors; Shrinking Parts on a Conveyor; etc.).

There are several books that discuss tactics, for example, explaining what a pin is, what a fork is, yadda yadda yadda, and yet those \\"basic\\" books (i.e. Beginning Chess Players Bible, for example) don't really have many practice problems. Sierwan's popular book \\"Winning Chess Tactics\\" had a similar problem for me.From there you have hard-hitting, heavy books on tactics that were simply too advanced for me. Combination Challenge was one of those books, too complicated for me at times, too difficult. It took me a long time to find that kind middle-ground books for relative beginners trying to work on their tactics.In the end, I've been working out of two main puzzle books to practice my tactics: Polgar's monstrous CHESS (5355ish problems...) and then this little gem of a book. When I discuss Winning Chess Tactics for Juniors, understand then that I've seen a few of the harder books but the other book I've mostly worked with is Polgar.For starters, Winning Chess Tactics for Juniors is a derivative work. Hays took some problems from Combination Challenge and put them together in this book. For me, that's not a complaint because the full fledged CC was too difficult for me. One immediate plus when I got this book was that it is TINY. Tiny is not a bad thing -- it's fantastic! 128 pages of mostly diagrams is a solid chunk of problems, and it fits anywhere!I admit, I was concerned how long it would take to get through the book. I've plowed through about 700 of Polgar's problems in only a few weeks, so I was concerned that Winning Chess Tactics would be silly.No. Don't let \\"For Juniors\\" fool you. For beginners, this book will kick your face in. It is an EXCELLENT tactical workout. There's a few reasons for this. For one, the diagrams are relatively complicated, so you have to consider a variety of potential moves. Secondly, you are only given the clue of who's turn it is to move. That means you might be winning a piece with a tactical strike, or you may be playing for mate. The only clue aside from who's turn it is would be the section grouping (i.e. \\"discovered attacks\\" section will contain many variations of a discovered check, discovered attack, double dhecks, etc).This lack of hints makes it an extremely useful workout. In Polgar, and several other books I looked at, you're given \\"White to play, Mate in 3\\", or \\"Find the Fork\\", etc. That kind of mental prompting is very nice, actually, but in some ways it is illusory. During a game you will not know there is mate in two, unless you yourself can SEE, in fact, there is a threat of mate in two. Winning Chess Tactics for Juniors is an excellent book because it makes a much more realistic simulation of what you might find glancing at the board in your own games.Out of the puzzle books I've worked with (Sierwan's being the other prominent one), this book strikes a nice balance of difficulty and variety, and it's format makes it very useful. Though this is technically a derivative product, it is a very useful product and the fact that it is derivative doesn't really matter to me. If you're advanced enough to be taking on the full Combination Challenge, of course, you don't want this book, but if you're relatively new to club / tournament chess and you want to practice your tactics, I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Winning Chess Tactics for Juniors","review":"You are better off buying the author's larger book, Combination Challenge. This one is fine, but if you plan to buy the larger one eventually, you are better off finding a different book of simple tactics.

It resembles other combination books like Reinfeld's 1001 Winning Sacrifices and Combinations (and Hays's own Combination Challenge, of course), but all of the combinations here are within the reach of the beginner who understands the ideas behind the various combinations. (That can't be said of Reinfeld's book, which is great but which contains combinations that vary widely in their difficulty.) You can start with this book, enjoy every page of it, and then be ready to move on to more advanced study. The price is right, I might add."},{"Title":"Winning Chess Tactics for Juniors","review":"This book has quite a few mistakes,andin the answers section it sometimes failsto mention other possible answers if there ismore than one.It also has someof the worst puzzles ever.A few of themare based on traps,so theydon't have definite answers tothem,they rely on the opponenttaking the bait.Puzzles should havedefinite answers(variations),whether it'sone answer or more,they must be definite,and the opponent should be forced bycheck or have no greater option but tomake the expected/forced moves.This is notthe case with some of the puzzles in this book.But I must admit,after finishing it,my game hasimproved."},{"Title":"Winning Chess Tactics for Juniors","review":"This is not just a tactics workbook for juniors!

This is in a work book style. I also learned a lot of good opening tactics from \\"Winning Chess Traps\\" that i also recommend. If you learn tactics you will win a lot more games."},{"Title":"Winning Chess Tactics for Juniors","review":"Ever see those chess diagrams in the newspaper? Well, essentially this book has 534 of those type of problems for you to solve. I'm going through this book for my 3rd time now, which is what Hayes recommends. My tactical ability has improved greatly--not so much being able to pull one over on others, but in being able to AVOID allowing others to pull one over on me. In the end, that is just as good for me.The book covers the major tactical themes: discovered attacks, Queen sacrifices, pins, Knight forks, double attacks, attraction, overloading, removal of the guard, and back rank mates. If you don't know what each of these is, Hayes explains it to you. Additionally, there is a section that mixes all of the above and leaves it to you to figure out which tactic is at play-just like in real over-the-board play.Each problem diagram is solved either in one, two, or three moves. Generally there are 6 diagrams to solve on each page. The print quality is not as sharp as I would like, but its not so bad as to make the book unpleasant to use. On the whole, this is a good book for those who have some basic knowledge beyond the rules, and who want to take the next step to improve their play.I often keep my copy in the car, and also take it to appointments. Is not a large book, so can fit into a large coat pocket. Its amazing how many diagrams you can go through when waiting at the physician's office or for an oil change. My copy has taken a great deal of abuse from day to day use, and I found that for a paperback it really takes a beating without losing pages."},{"Title":"Winning Chess Tactics for Juniors","review":"I don't really disagree with the other reviewer, but you have to understand what this book is. Hays basically just took a bunch of the easier tactical diagrams from other books -- mostly Reinfeld's 1001 Winning Chess Sacs, and Chernev &amp; Reinfeld's Winning Chess -- and put them into one thinner book for novices. That's not a complaint; the result is useful. But if you have those other two books you don't need this one (it adds no discussion or other new value)."},{"Title":"Winning Chess Tactics for Juniors","review":"I own a pretty large collection of chess books, but I've always been partial to this one. There are some things that a reader must know first hand. Yes, it is part of the larger \\"Combination Challenge\\" and yes, it is simply a workbook, not an instruction book. But as far as helping you learn tactics, I loved it. It's full of simpler problems so it's obviously better suited to beginners or intermediates. (Maybe 1000-1600) I agree with other readers that it has very few errors and I really liked it's sense of pattern recognition. There are times when it will have 3 or 4 very similar puzzles within 2 pages so that when you don't get it the first time, by the 3rd or 4th time you think to you yourself \\"I see, I get it now.\\" I've gone through it 5 times and my copy is worn and dog-eared but definitely cherished. Plus its only 8 bucks, how can you beat that? Watch out for those small diagrams though, they'll hurt your eyes after a few hours of reading."},{"Title":"Winning Chess Tactics for Juniors","review":"This book is wonderful for helping you see patterns that can occur in your games. The positions are very practical. The best thing I like about this book is that there are hardly any errors (that I can find!). Secondly, the puzzles are made so that there is usually only one correct solution, not a billion other possible ones. This is a major plus. I've heard that many of the positions in this book were taken from Combination Challenge, and many of the positions from Combination Challenge were taken from Reinfeld's 1001 book. THis makes me want to look into Reinfeld's books more.My suggestion would be that, if you are class D or C you should buy this book because it's a great value (only $10 and it has 534 problems), the organization by theme is great, the positions are very practical, there are no errors (I only found 1 and I am almost done with the book) and most puzzles have only one solution. If you are a better chess player than this, I recommend 1001 Chess Sacrafices and Combinations. This is the type of book who's patterns you would want to drill in your head because they are so practical and recurring. I've been through the book once and plan to go through it 3 or 4 or 5 times. Overall, a great book."},{"Title":"Winning Chess Tactics for Juniors","review":"Tactical problems are presented for the reader. No verbal explaition, so therefore this is to simply be considered a workbook. As such, it has a good number of problems for the money organized by theme."},{"Title":"Winning Chess Tactics for Juniors","review":"Excellent tactics book for beginners and improving players. Start with this one before moving on to \\"Combination Challenge\\" also by Hays or other tactics and puzzle books. Good for players up to USCF 1500."},{"Title":"Winning Chess Tactics for Juniors","review":"Let me make one thing clear: I am going to use this book, solve all the problems and do so several times. I will recommend it because of the price tag, which may matter for more people now than before the economic crisis.I write this review for two reasons. One is that I don't think it is the best choice at this level. The other reason is that I think it might be useful to compare its level of difficulty to some other books.Well, this is good, still not the best book on tactics on this level.The solutions are not checked by computer and you might find correct solutions not mentioned in the Solutions.That the bulk of the problems are taken from Reinfeld and perhaps Reinfeld/Chernev is no complaint for me, since I don't have those books.The book is organized by theme, i.e. by tactical motif employed, 1. Discovery, 2. Queen Sacrifice, 3. Pin and so on, i.e. you will know what to look for. At my level, knowing what tactic to look for, doesn't make finding the solutions much easier, these giveaways are no problem for me (for reasons I don't know; I've tried both ways).There is no progression of difficulty, there is rather a chaos, a mix of very easy problems and a little more difficult ones, but you have to solve the problems to find out which are the easy ones, perhaps the too easy ones.The diagrams are normal size. All this is OK, but there are better books on the same level, but to a higher price tag.This book can be compared to Sharpen your Tactics, which has a few more problems, many as easy as the ones in this book, some even more easy, some much more difficult, but in which you find a progression of difficulty, from one star to four stars. That book has no hints to the type of tactic. Some problems in Sharpen Your Tactics are way too easy, which diminishes the value.I have found one much better book on this level,Manual of Chess Combinations 1b. It is part of a series called Chess School and it follows a plan for improvement. The first book, Manual of Chess Combinations 1a is for beginners only, the first level is easier than Winning Chess Tactics for Juniors.The one I link to has no disappointingly easy problems, except that the first half of it has the same level of difficulty as Winning Chess Tactics. It is made up of 579 problems and divided in to parts, level 4 and 5 (the first three levels are in the Manual 1a, of course). Level 4 is more or less the same level as the present book, level 5 takes you to the next step in difficulty.Diagrams are much bigger and much more pleasing to the eye. There are no mistakes as far as I know. The problems seem to be selected with a didactic aim and I feel that by going through it. There are no hints to the type of tactic, and the actual hints, like win a queen doesn't help so much. There are sections with no hints at all. Often you find more tactical elements employed simultaniously in the problems.But the book is more expensive.If I were using the book in order to improve my play, I would have found it even more superior than I do, but I am using these books as brain gymnastics and enjoyment and that's all.Some juniors may need a beginners book before Winning Chess Tactics for Juniors. So which books are more easy? From my experience now I would probably have chosen the Manual of Combinations 1a as an introduction. I didn't know about that however, so I purchased the very simple Beginning Chess by Pandolfini and the slightly less simple Susan Polgar's first tactics book, A World Champion's Guide to Chess.The Manual of Chess Combinations 1b and the present book and Sharpen your Tactics and Susan Polgar's second book are going to keep me busy for some months now, if not for more than one year. Sharpen your Tactics ends with problems that are more difficult, how much more difficult I don't know yet.Then how to proceed? I have read a lot of reviews on the web, looking for assumed level of difficulty, but I don't have any personal experience. There is no doubt that the next step for me will be The Manual of Chess Combinations 2, which is more difficult, perhaps much more difficult; what I know for sure is that the edition is good. And after that? Well, I don't know how much I am able to improve, of course, but in case I would probably go for The Complete Chess Workout and Chess Gems: 1000 Combinations you Should Know after that the Manual of Chess Combinations 3. But frankly, I doubt that I ever reach that far.I am not disappointed with Winning Chess Tactics for Juniors, I need to exercise with many problems and this one will surely increase my ability to solve problems."},{"Title":"Winning Chess Tactics for Juniors","review":"This book is simply amazing.This book had 534 problems-that's alot!(not even comparable to Polgar's 5334, but that's a little too much...isn't it?)Very thin and light. Easy to carry to anywhere-trains, subs, cars, etc.Diagrams are easy to see, not like some which have weird diagrams that's not even understandable.The diagrams may be a little small, but they are enough to see the combinations.Bottom Line: If you're struggling with tactics and under Class A(1800~1999)....THIS IS IT!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"Title":"Witness of Gor","review":"I recently bought the kindle and when trying to decide what my first money purchase should be I went with John Norman one of my favorite writers and his three most recent gor novels. I had read Witness awhile ago and did not remember much about the book but on a second reading I found Witness to be a truly great book with enough action and romance to equal the classic Gor books of old. JN has an ability to bring locals to life and Treve is a fine example, a city deep in the mountains that is only accessable through the air. The sense of wonder that JN brings to his Gor novels has kept me coming back for 25 years and I hope that there will still be a few more Gor books to be published in the future."},{"Title":"Witness of Gor","review":"Short and sweet then gang. Over 30 years ago I entered the world of Gor. Collecting every book up to and including Magicians. Wrote my one and only ever fan letter to John Norman. Actually received a prompt reply. From someone that stated he was the Author. Encouraging me to write, and I wasn't a writer at that time in the mid 80s. During a long bout with illness. 25 Gor books read back to back was my greatest comfort. Gor has entered my RPG worlds.Had no idea there was this amount of a fan base. And as for this book, been waiting 20 years for it, I am not disappointed in the least.Lord Ronin from Q-Link"},{"Title":"Witness of Gor","review":"Personally i did not care for the book at all. I found it very slow and tedious. It was written from the slave's point of view and went on and on about the same thing over and over again. It lacked action and interest. I would not recommend it at all."},{"Title":"Witness of Gor","review":"Like other reviewers I didn't like the contents.I'm a great fan of the whole Gor Plot line.The author's musings upon female slavery are very rose coloured.Back in Ancient times slavery existed for economic reasons,and I find it hard to believe that sexual slavery would be so significant on Gor as the Author portrays. The life of any slave would be pure drudgery, and hard work. And if anybody \\"enjoyed\\"their slave status, they'd be nuts.Of course the fantasy of it all appeals to the male in me!Though I'm sure the White slavery operating today; its victims would deny any apprciation of their status.The whole Priest Kings, rival cities, alien invasion etc is what hooked me. And the love scenes !But the philosophy I always skipped, especially when regurgitated from novel to novel.Most other novels I'd skip maybe 1/3 at the most.But this novel I reckon only had about 20 pages of plot development and action. The rest was basically a Sado-Slavery \\"how-to_manual\\". Chains, postures, etc etc.And to top it all off, most of that slender plot story has already been covered and passed in preceeding novels - just a differing aspect to events already described.This novel is basically rubbish & best obtained 2nd hand or such.Even the sex scenes weren't really stirring ! I think the word nipple only featured perhaps thrice !Its like Norman gathered up every page of his philosophy from earlier novels & put them back to back - with a token new slave girl linking it all together as it vomits forth...."},{"Title":"Witness of Gor","review":"I have read all of the Gor books. When he writes about the action he is great but when he writes about the male female relationships it gets boring. I mean we have read the same thing in all of the books, we get it already. He has dragged this story out for 5 books as is. To not progress the story line at least a little further was stupid. I waited 14 years for this crap!!!!! Just end the story already. If he thinks the reason he got another chance to complete the story was because of the slave/master relationships in the book he is wrong. I admit there are some devoted readers that love that(based on the sale prices for Slave Girl) but most of us like the political plotting and sword play. Oh well. Maybe the next book will take place in AR."},{"Title":"Witness of Gor","review":"Most people only see what they are looking for in books, so I suppose it isn't all that strange that some of the previous reviewers did not find the story in 'Witness' to be all they wanted it to be.John Norman isn't writing about BDSM - he isn't writing Erotica (anyone notice just how little he dwells on the sexual events in the stories?) - he isn't advocating slavery for all women - in short he isn't writing about any of the usual suspects thrown back at him and Gor aficionados.John Norman, learned in both classical history and philosophy, has written an entire series responding to the outlandish claims and demands of the more strident radical feminists dating back to the 1960's, throwing each of their often nonsensical claims back in their teeth by having his characters take diametrically opposed viewpoints. For instance, a claim that every time a woman has an orgasm during sex she is being oppressed (yes, that is but one viewpoint that really has been published!) is answered by having women surrendering to the oppression of slavery and begging for orgasms. He does the job better than I am able to explain it in so short a review though.I won't go into long-winded detail on the other points - the information is available to anyone who cares to search for it, those who are prepared to look beyond their own preconceived ideas, that is - but there is plenty more there.John Norman has taken an ERB-like theme and made it his own. But his stories have depth and multiple layers of meaning that are entirely within keeping of his academic background, with no single one of his earlier books demonstrating this more than this one, Witness of Gor. Above and beyond this though, the information found in this one book just about the basic storyline for the series - something that holds many of his reader's total attention I might add - is phenomenal, the story taking place at the time of the combined Cosian/Tyros invasion force's initial landing when they decide to take the war to their bitter enemy, Ar. The failure of Ar to respond against this invasion, the failure of Marlenus, Ar's charismatic and militarily brilliant leader, to take to the field against a strong foe that are, never the less, island warriors rather than land forces. Politics within the city of Ar, special interests of the religious authorities that had lost influence under the rule of the now missing Marlenus, Talena - the one time only love of the once naive central story character Tarl Cabot - dispossessed and disowned by her father Marlenus, now exacting her revenge.As has already been mentioned, the main theme that underpins this book is one of honour - even in opposition to the political decisions of superiors. The fact that it is told by a slavegirl only enhances the reader's gradual understanding of the issue of honour, and yes, pride - the reader coming to understand as the initially bewildered slavegirl reveals each step along the way. Even the story's switching back and forth in time is important in this respect; much as many, even ardent Gor fans have voiced their dislike of the grammatical artifice.I have read the book several times, as I have all of the rest. As I will Prize of Gor when it comes out, and any other tales that John Norman is supposed to have written during the long wait after Magicians of Gor. I would highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys adventure. I would highly recommend it to anyone with knowledge of classical history. I would highly recommend it to anyone able to differentiate between extremist rhetoric and philosophical satire.Overlong? Possibly. Worth it? Absolutely!"},{"Title":"Witness of Gor","review":"I am amazed at how many peeps here who gave Witness poor ratings can even consider themselves qualified to give a rating, if they have skipped hundreds of pages! Yes, John Norman is repetitive in several aspects, but he has been that way through-out the series, so why complain about it now?To me, JN's philosophies of the Love Master/love slave relationship are learning tools which, in addition to other literary works, can be applied to a real life Love Master-love slave relationship: \\"Boring\\"? Not even! \\"Slave gibberish\\"? Perhaps, if owning a loving & pleasing slave is only something you dream about...And yes, to those who do not understand such, there truly is freedom in slavery & I for one am honored to wear my Masters collar. I'm also appreciative that my Master is strong enough & intelligent enough to read the books with his thoughts on the philosophies found therein, and is not just focused on the fighting/action.Although Witness is not my favorite of Professor Normans' works, it was surely well worth the read: I highly disagree with the 1 star reviews!"},{"Title":"Witness of Gor","review":"Starts out slow and then drags it out,however the the plot all comes together in the end"},{"Title":"Witness of Gor","review":"it is everything I thaught it would be and more, the book was in great condition and reading through it norman has done it again, very excellent read if your into the gorean novels. now if he will just get the next one published so we can all read it."},{"Title":"Witness of Gor","review":"This last book in the Gor series follows the usual formula of daring deeds performed on the Counter-Earth world of Gor. Told from the perspective of a unsuspecting slavegirl, it explores yet another arena in the John Norman world of Masters and their helplessly beautiful captives against a backdrop of politics and heroism.The book arrived in new condition , excellently packaged, in extremely quick time.A must have for those interested in the Gor series by John Norman, or for those interested in science fantasy style novels."},{"Title":"Witness of Gor","review":"To any long-time reader of the Gor series who expected something new, fresh and mature after all the years the author was out of print, this book is a huge disappointment.Why a caveat? What many do not know, however, is that this is NOT a NEW Gor book. Most of this book was written many years ago, right after his last book, Magicians. This then accounts for the same stale, heavy-handed prose and narrow (\\"Oh! Look at me! I am struggling with my slavery! Whatever shall I do?\\") focus that plagued the last third of the series.Yeah, Dr. Lange. We get it. Woman. Slavery. Struggle. Submission.Now, in the next book (if there is one) can we get back to the story?Note that this book was \\"published\\" originally a few years ago by some fly-by-night print on demand outfit and was a spectacular failure, causing that company to go out of business. That company promised author \\"updated\\" versions of *all* the Gor books, however, their idea of \\"updating\\" in the first reprints consisted of simply cleaning up syntax and spelling and hiking the price of a simple paperback to $15-20. Here we go again, as another company is offering for @$16 what basically can be had in a used bookstore for $1. Never underestimate the ability of some to try to cash in on gullibility of the Gor fans."},{"Title":"Witness of Gor","review":"Early John Norman novels were clever. The characters were contrived and the sex highly improbable but the stories often had clever narrative structure and wonderful pace. Witness of Gor has none of this. It's long and most of the first three quarters is given over to the sexual politics for which John Norman is famous. The repetition is dismal and would be comical if it weren't for the constant claim to be taken seriously. It's strange to have these novels turning up in lists of sado masochistic writing; they are more slerotic than erotic - except, I guess, for the John Norman tragics who can't get enough of the one thin message repeated again and again.And then, suddenly, the novel comes to life and it is genuinely riveting. The action is powerful enough to save the dismal sex and while it lacks the lapidary finish of many of the earlier novels, it is still worth the read."},{"Title":"Witness of Gor","review":"this book looks at the events in the series from the perspective of an earthborn slave girl and does not therefore have as much action as his Tarl cabot stories"},{"Title":"Witness of Gor","review":"First things first. It is patently clear that this book wasn't recently written, but probably written a decade and a half ago, on the heals of the previous book, and has been simply been laying around collecting dust all these years, until the current publisher picked it up, packaged int and distributed it. Well, it probably should have collected dust a while longer, because it is just bad. a shadow of the former glory that was this series.Anyway, I finally purchased and read this volume of Gor, and Let me say that having acquired all of the previous paperbacks the $25.00 hardbound price was something of a sticker shock for me and yes, the inflated price tag that kept me away. When I finally did buy and read it, I wondered why I had even bothered. First of all the book was about two or three hundred pages too long. Second, the main character, Tarl Cabot, had been written out (not the first time, but generally a bad idea, as the books sans-Tarl are generally a poorer read). Third, the book's main character was an Earth woman who was kidnapped and brought to Gor to perform a very specific task (yeah, that, but something actually relating to the story as well).Still the worst part of this book was that Norman was still stuck in his \\"A women's job is to be sexually dominated by a man, and that she is only truly fulfilled when she comes to accept this role and surrenders to the slave that is in every woman's soul\\" rap. Seriously, I not only got that in the first book (though it was way less apart of the story than it was in the most recent book), but anyone who never read that book would have picked up on that in the second chapter of this new book.The real problem with this book was not its price-point, nor its length, nor even its subject matter. The problem is that Norman needed an editor. Someone that would have told him, \\"Look John, all the T&A; is fine, but you really have to let someone kill someone soon, or you are going to lose your audience.\\" Believe me when I tell you that nothing (nothing) happens in the first third of the book. then a little something happens, but all of the real action (which is still drawn out and boring) happens in the final 100 pages. Plus, all of Norman's characters speak in the same voice, they all have the same speech patterns, and all make the same observations. He never makes any attempt to differentiate one from another.To make matters worse, there were truly shoddy production values utilized in the production of this book. Not only were there were a number of typos, but throughout the book (much of which is people talking to each other) utilizes dumb (or straight) quotes. This makes me crazy, as all you need to do to get smart (or curly) quotes, it to turn that functionality on in your word processor. Something the publisher of this book simply didn't understand. Personally it kept bringing me out of the story, which helped ruin it for me.Ultimately, the book was way better when I was a teen and there was more violence than sex (as opposed to this version that had more implied, if not actual sex than violence). Truth-to-be-told, Norman is still writing around the sex, rather than about it. He describes the motions leading up to it, and hints that it is actually taking place, but he is like a prude when it comes to writing the naughty bits themselves. (It is like he has a \\"M for Mature\\" rather than an actual \\"R\\" rating in is writing ability). According to the book jacket's interior (and the new website) there was supposed to have been a 27th book out by now. Seeing as it didn't appear, I have to guess that Norman's style of gender politics has finally jumped the shark, and no one cares any more.Mores the pity, as I really liked those books, and really wouldn't have minded to have gotten one of those, rather than the one that I wound up getting. One can only hope that if there is another book, that Norman returns to the earlier books, and the political intrigue what made this series interesting in the first place."},{"Title":"Witness of Gor","review":"Witness of Gor was another of the slave girl novels. It focuses on a captured Earth woman who is captured and enslaved on Gor. After her initial slave training she is sold to Treve as a prison slave. She is selected because of her almost complete ignorance of Gor, its geography and politics. Her job is to feed and care for a prisoner who was once the Ubar of Ar, and her ignorance prevents her from telling him anything of his current location or the political situation. What she doesn't know, she can't tell. Personally, I get tired of the mindless and seemingly endless repetitious, \\"I'm glad I'm a slave,\\" conversations. About three fourths of the way through the book something happens. There is an attempt to free Marlenus. Some assassins are sent from Cos to eliminate the prisoner, but they underestimate his skill and cunning. Finally our slave girl is sold to Ar and then finds out that as a witness to the identity of the prisoner she has been marked for death. Tarl Cabot is mentioned only once in the book, in passing in a conversation about who might be the best swordsman on Gor, perhaps equal to the prisoner. We learn nothing more of space aliens or Priest Kings. Our view is that of an Earth girl made slave, one who might be the least politically knowledgeable woman on Gor. If you particularly enjoy the slave girls in Norman's novels you may like this one. Its not an action thriller."},{"Title":"Witness of Gor","review":"While capturing some of the magic that made the first 8 Gor books great reads, it spends too much time going into the private thoughts of the main character as she &quot;revels in her bonds&quot;. I found myself skipping over pages at a time to get to the meat of the story, which I found to be underdeveloped in favor of the philosophical aspects of women being submissive to a strong man.The author is clearly stuck in the '70s and '80s as he has yet to acknowledge that militant, anti-male, PC feminism peaked well over a decade ago and is largely regarded as the machinations of psychotic man-hating/envying lesbians (Andrea Dworkin comes to mind) by nearly everyone. As this sort of psychotic garbage exists mainly in hyper-liberal university campuses, his stories don't resound the way they used to as he pointed out the obvious fallacies of such political viewpoints of society. No longer do his books exists as roadmaps to claiming your masculinity in the face of oppressive &quot;feminism&quot; that sought to emasculate men and created such whining losers as the &quot;sensitive new age guy&quot; persona.The story should have delved much deeper into the political landscape of the conquest of Ar by Lurious of Jad, the effects this had on Treve and the actions of Rask &amp; Terence and other important figures. Also needing to be developed was the back story of Dorna the Proud, now the personal slave of Rask, Ubar of Treve. More insights into the society and history of Treve would have been appreciated as this has always been one of the more mysterious cities that he referred to in his previous novels. Finally, the story should have delved into Marlenus more than it did. Marlenus is one of the great underwritten characters of Gor, and this would have been a prime opportunity to develop him more and bring more insight into they character."},{"Title":"Witness of Gor","review":"This will officialy be the 30th review of Witness of Gor. Like all the other One Star Reviews I will attempt to get to the crux of the problem.The book's length was 716 pages. However, with proper editing and more concise writing, the novel should have been half as long, if not shorter. The repetitious philosophy esposed by his view-point characters (Really Norman's Opinions) did absolutely nothing to drive along the plot. That and the fact that the characters all speak in the same voice (Another Reviewer's Shrewd Obseervation)did little to ingratiate me to the story. This book also may have been better had certain supporting characters been named earlier in the book. Some were never named, which only leaves the reader wondering what and who the story and people really are. We don't even get to know \\"Janice's\\" backstory throughout the 716-paged book. Where was she from in America? What was her original birth name? We learn of her friends' names and the nation she hails from, that is all.Let's talk about sex. Norman went and on in a monotnous monotone about how \\"a woman must be owned to learn her sexuality and how it is a woman's place to please a man, etc, etc.\\" For literally hundreds upon hundreds of pages it is the same thing--repetitious, verbose prose that only bores the reader. I never felt challenged by this book. I'd expected so much and in the end I and the other 10 negative reviewers feel that the book is a disappointment. As I've said in other comments on this book I know it would have been a better book had authors such as Chris Bunch, Brian Daley or Robert Jordan wrote it. Alas, sadly those greats have passed away. GRR Martin and Christopher Rowley come to mind as men who write fantastic fantasy and would be able to add life to Norman's tired old universe. An infusion of talent could and would benefit the Gor saga.In the end, I cannot recommend this book to anyone. The cover art is excellent, and like ZA Khan said, it is bound quite well. It's the inside text (Rife With Typos And Gaps In Text) that are severely lacking. Save your money and don't buy the book. Borrow it from the library.A.

There could not have been more than 10 or 15 pages of intrigue and action; the remainder is a bunch of slave girl garbage.My problem isn't that it is politically incorrect; my problem is that it is profoundly boring. Norman must be living out his fantasies by writing the same repetitive thoughts ... he is clearly not thinking of entertaining his readers.

Was it worth it? Yes. And, no. Yes. No. Okay, yes. Blast. Yes!Apparently, as my surveillance has revealed, I need to suffer one more time to be similarly rewarded with 'Prize Of Gor.' Very well. The sacrifices I make for this series. First, though, I think that I'll refresh my mind by starting over at the beginning of the series and enjoy the first 13 or so adventures, to remember the glory days - skipping the slave girl-narrated editions, and maybe bypassing the 'Jason' editions (yawn).

She has been enslaved and trained to the collar. She is then sold to the City of Treve, which is secretly located in the Voltai mountains. Terrence of Treve assigns her to duties in the sub-terranean prison pits deep beneath the city. There she befriends the Lady Constanzia who is being held for ransom. Janice has been bought for special duties. She is to look after a mysterious prisoner who is chained alone in one of the deepest and most isolated cells in the pits. The prisoner is Marlenus, Ubar of Ar, the largest city on Gor. He has lost his memory and believes himself to be one of the caste of peasants. Every day he asks the pit master, a deformed ugly monster of a man with honor and kindness in his heart, if is it time for planting. On Gor the harvest can mean life or death for peasants. Every day the pit master says \\"No\\".One day 200 warriors arrive from Ar in a surprise tarn attack to try to free Marlenus. All are killed in the attempt. The Ubar of Cos the enemy of Ar decides not to risk further attempts to free Marlenus. He pays a team of assassins to come to Treve and execute Marlenus. They have permission from the rulers of Treve for this but Terrence and the pit master do not think that being murdered while chained in an underground cell is an honorable way for any man to die. When the assassins enter the cell, Marlenus once more asks the pit master if it is time for planting. This time the answer is \\"Yes\\". A primeval urge is awaked in Marlenus and he must do whatever is necessary to escape.I cannot tell you what happens next without spoiling the book for you. If you are a John Norman fan, this book is for you. It is over 700 pages long and some would argue that it should have been shorter. After a 14-year wait, I was glad for every page."},{"Title":"Witness of Gor","review":"Perhaps John Norman needed to warm up after his 14-year hiatus from the world of Gor, because the first 400 pages of Witness are nearly interminably dull. Whether the talk of the \\"natural domination\\" of men over women thrills or offends you, 400 pages of it is certain to bore you to tears.However, once you hit that 400 page mark, the book becomes classic Gorean adventure, with all of the skill, daring, courage, and honor Gor fans have come to love. The slave girl Janice, from whose point of view the book is written, is caught up in intrigues in the prison pits of Treve. There, she is given the task of administering to a mysterious prisoner, Marlenus of Ar, who is suffering from amnesia and believes himself to be only a peasant. A Cosian team of assassins is sent to find and murder him, and the adventure begins when Janice's master, the deformed pit master, finds the assassins' task to be less than honorable."},{"Title":"Witness of Gor","review":"If you have read all 25 of the previous Gor books (in which case you will probably read this one whatever the reviews say) you will get something out of \\"Witness of Gor\\".If you have not read any, or even most, of the previous books in John Norman's Gor series, do not touch this one with the proverbial barge-pole.And if you like those books in the lengthy \\"Gor\\" series which feature the anti-hero Tarl Cabot, but have had enough of Kajira (e.g. slave girl) books, skip this one and the following book, \\"Prize of Gor\\" and go straight to number 28, \\"Kur of Gor\\" in which Tarl Cabot makes his return.This story is set on the planet Gor, which supposedly shares the orbit of Earth but on the other side of the Sun so that our astronomers cannot detect it. Most of the action takes place in the Gorean cities of Treve and Ar, and appears to overlap several of the previous five books. Tarl Cabot does not appear \\"onstage\\" at any time, though he is mentioned once or twice.The narrator is a slave girl from earth, who at various times of the book is given the names Janice or Gail, or at other times is not allowed a name at all.The narrator has been planted in Treve in the hope that she will be able to identify whether a particularly important prisoner is there. She has no idea who the prisoner is, and it turns out that he appears to have lost his memory and doesn't know himself. Norman obviously intends the reader to work out the prisoner's identity for yourself: he is not named at any stage in the book. However, most of those readers who have previously seen the rest of the series may begin to form an idea what is going on.There are some quite good parts of the book: one is the development of the pit master character, who is horribly ugly but also honorable and intelligent and about as kind as Norman allows a Gorean male to be (which after about book eight has meant \\"not very\\"). You meet again an old enemy, Doorna the Proud, who attempted to usurp the throne of Tharna in book two, Outlaw of Gor. Naturally she has never forgiven Tarl Cabot for frustrating her ambitions, and Norman may be setting up something here for a future book.The most nerve-wracking scene comes towards the end of the book when an entire hit squad of assassins comes to dispose of the prisoner, only to find that he is still much more dangerous than anyone had imagined.No mention at all of the Kurri or \\"Others\\" in this book - those of us who have been wondering to what extent they were behind the Cosian invasion and war which raged from book 20 to book 25 are still wondering.The heroine & narrator of this book gets a brief cameo in book 27, \\"Prize of Gor\\" when she will meet the heroine & narrator of that book at Ar's equivalent of the public laundrette, where both slave girls have been sent by their masters to wash the household's dirty clothes. By that time her new master will have renamed her Corinne.Norman's greatest strength is not that he is a particularly good writer, and the prose in this work is sometimes quite impenetrable. It is his ability to set your own imagination off, and at times this book does do that.The catch is that to get to those moments you have to wade through reams of very undistinguished filler, and particularly the most turgid \\"women should be slaves\\" tosh. It is one thing to fantasise about things which you would never want to do in your real life, but the endless repetition of arguments for enslaving women eventually gets quite boring and almost makes you wonder if Norman actually means it. There was rather too much of this sort of thing in books 14 to 25 and Witness of Gor is worse. From this 700 page book you could cut out at least 250 pages of male supremacist lectures without losing any of the essential plot or action, and still have quite enough left to annoy any feminists or politically correct people who for some strange reason are reading it. And it would be a much better book."},{"Title":"Witness of Gor","review":"Witness of Gor, is in my opinion, the best Gor book to date. It constitutes a return to Norman's early adventure style of writing (which, to me, is lost in the middle chapters of Magicians of Gor), a more clearheaded and judicious representation of his own philosophy of human nature, and the introduction of both a new setting and a new slate of characters, while bringing back earlier ones and letting the reader know of their fates. The treatment of the protagonist, an earth woman brought to Gor as a slave girl, as having no name, and for all practical purposes, no earth identity, accomplishes a stroke of genius. That is, this device lets even the male reader see through her eyes as the \\"witness of Gor\\". The reader shares her navet&eacute; in this new world precisely because he or she lacks her history and is thus unable to see her from a distance, critically. Instead, the reader must view things and learn things as she sees them and learns them.Further, Norman goes beyond the usual philosophic discourses on dominance-submission as the paradigm, which governs male-female relationships, and uses instead a critical ethical dilemma to present honor as an ethical issue. And indeed, the story itself turns upon this ethical issue, in a day when soft politicians, diplomats, public servants and the philosophical ethicists who advise them renounce the very concept of honor, precisely because honor is not negotiable. In this book, Norman emerges not only as a first-rate storyteller-once again-but as the deeply insightful philosopher of human nature and morality that he is.This latest offering in the Gor series has several further characteristics that make it exquisite. First, he sets the story in the Voltai Range, in the impregnable city of the robber-Ubar, Rask of Treve, a part of Gor of which readers have heard, but never experienced. Second, he pulls the series out of the morass that was \\"Magicians of Gor\\", and sets it once again on the road of heightened suspense and adventure to an epic climax in the struggle for dominance of the great city of Ar by the Island Ubarates, Tyros and Cos. Setting the story against that backdrop itself ties up a major loose end from Magicians of Gor and brings the series back to life for those who suffered through the loss of Ar's legions in the delta of the Vosk, the disappearance of its mighty Ubar, Marlenus, and the crass and treacherous rule of his daughter, Talena, as the proxy of Cos. Third, Norman shows here the best character development of any of the books. The figure of \\"The Tarsk\\"-the \\"depth warden\\" or pit master, he who governs Treve's deep and cavernous prisons-is the deepest, most thoughtful, and most sensitively developed character of the entire series. This massive twisted figure, deformed from birth, but of high intelligence and great cunning and strength, a master of the board game Kaissa as well, becomes the most sympathetic character of the story. Thus the reader suffers with the depth warden when he violates his oath of honor to preserve his integrity in another matter of honor. One actually finds oneself hoping long before the possibility arises in the plot that this great and grave figure does not commit suicide over his actions in the midst of this dilemma. And I note: only someone who himself has a profound sense of honor recognizes that violations of honor necessarily result in one's death, even if that means at one's own hand. Fourth, only an exciting and improbable twist of fate brings the heroine (and the reader) from the dank and dangerous depths of Treve's fortress prison to a surprise, nail-biting conclusion far from that setting. I cannot wait for Prize of Gor, the finale, or at least the sequel.To sum up, this Gorean tale contains the greatest depth of character development and philosophic thought to which the author has yet risen. He also tells a great story, one that I could barely put down."},{"Title":"Witness of Gor","review":"John Norman as his best when he is romantic. The romance was done badly in this most recent Gor book.Please don't be surprised if I class these BDSM books as romances. What makes a book a &quot;romance&quot; is that the girl always, by contrivance of the author, ends up in the arms (and the chains) of the one man in the world who is Meant For Her.In Norman's earlier books, the girl would at first hate and resist, flee or betray, be caught by, and surrender to, the man Meant For Her.Despite the sick and savage elements of whips and chains, there is still a version of romance in Norman's writing, a true love that conquers all obstacles.But in WITNESS, the viewpoint character, a slave-girl kidnapped from Earth, doesn't fall in love, does not flee or betray or hate, and is not found and conquered again by her one and only True Love.Instead, as an afterthought, in a very late chapter, she does end up with the clerk or guard that first opened the crate she was shipped in and stamped her papers, but this fellow is clearly a nobody.He is never given a name or a description, and has nothing to do in the plots or adventures of the planet Gor.My impression is that Norman was near the end of his manuscript, decided he needed a love interest, flipped through the pages near the beginning, and picked a male character by closing his eyes and stabbing a page with a pin. It was a slap-dash and careless ending.She could have fallen in love with someone else. In one scene, the main character was supposed to be sent to torment the mysterious prisoner of the Pits of Treve with her allure, a half-mad creature whom she fears and hates. I anticipated scenes where the girl would come to pity the prisoner, hate yielding to human sympathy; pity then yielding to admiration as she detected his hidden strengths. This would culminate in a love affair (which, on Gor, involves utter surrender on the part of the girl). Ah! That would have been a satisfying scene, showing that love can be found even by a brain-damaged mad peasant in the deepest dungeon (or is he a peasant, really?).I was disappointed that nothing of the relation between the slave-girl and the prisoner she is supposed to be serving (and tempting) ever takes place. She spends weeks or months in the cell with this guy, but not a single line of dialog between them, not a single onstage scene, is shown.Had she been the love-interest of the mysterious prisoner, her (and our) interest would have been engaged during the action and intrigue surrounding his escape attempt. As it was, the whole book seemed a little flat and detached.It would have been easy to convince me that the slave-girl was pretty damn impressed with the brain-damaged peasant after he offs half a dozen trained killers. Or I might have been convinced she was impressed with the hideously deformed Master of the Pit, once she saw his humanity and wisdom behind his gruesome face. I might have even been convinced she could fall for the Warlord of Treve, a kingly figure whose troubled inner nature she glimpses. These were the characters that were onstage, doing mighty deeds, and these should have been the ones attracting the heroine's reluctant love. I was not convinced that she could have fallen in love with the receiving clerk in the slaver's warehouse.This welcome formula (girl hates guy, girl caught by guy, girl falls for guy) is followed in the secondary characters, told with the proper Dickensonian coincidences and plot twists. The ghastly and deformed Master Of Pit finds love, as does the haughty captive free woman the main character is sent to guard. But the main character's tale has neither romance nor passion in it.What is the point of writing about a love slave if she doesn't fall in love?Also missing from this book were descriptions. Earlier books had vivid visual descriptions of the wild and strange world of Gor, her peoples and their civilization. The writing here lacked that vividness.This is not to say there is not a good scene in the book once in a while. My favorite was one where the secret prisoner, apparently brain-damaged, turns out to be tougher than he looks, and is trying to escape from a squad of Assassins sent to kill him. This is exciting action and well done (particularly well done is that bit of business with the dead urt in the water).I can give it two stars for the occasional action scene."},{"Title":"Witness of Gor","review":"Nicely bound hardcover, an acceptable cover illustration, and expedited shipping (paid for of course). I finally had it in my hands after all these years! Unfortunately, that's where the good news ends.What a disappointment on a grand scale! Vintage Gor? Hardly. Norman has gone in a direction that only his most ardent critics would readily accept, and that too with glee. 15 years after \`Magicians' and this is what he gives us? Over 700 pages of which more than 70% are devoted to his warped, inaccurate, downright false view of human relations. A male fantasy gone horribly wrong? From an initially marginal (and appealing) presence of scantily clad females to a progressively deepening obsession with female slavery, Norman has brought this series to a tragic demise through his now obsessive focus on his bizarre 'female dominance' philosophy that I don't know how he can believe so fervently. Has he become delusional after all these years? What has he been doing since 1988? Doesn't he realize that what he now so feverishly promulgates is not only absurd but is just plain factually, biologically, and socially in the wrong?What do we do? BDSM cheers, feminist outcry, publication mainstream ostracism, true sci-fi lover groans...this is the way I see it. What happened to the Gor I love? Where is the absolute masterful adventure writing that made Norman famous? From a world so exacting in its detail, so exotic yet realistic, so alive you could almost taste it with longing... from an immensely appealing cultural presentation to the overwhelming thrill of some of the best action writing I have ever read, Norman's characters were alive with a depth and vitality that one rarely sees elsewhere. The thrill, the adventure, the imagery, it was neurotic to an extreme; warring city states, political intrigue, tall towers, exquisite swordplay, screaming tarns, exciting beautiful women, thrilling and bold warriors. From the rolling hills of Ko-ro-ba to a dusty side lane in Ar, from the deck of a galley on green Thassa to standing outside the walls of lofty Turia. I wanted to be everywhere. Honor, masculinity, action, combat, beauty, it was absolutely awesome. Along with that a digestible amount of fantasy in the form of luscious women, all of whom were initially or eventually, willing. Exciting...I just never told my Dad about it, that's all.To my mind, this decline began to take serious shape from the 14th novel onwards I think, getting progressively worse as we went on (and as Norman got older by the way) it seems. Luckily though, even the 25th novel, \`Magicians' had a lot to keep one going, temporarily climaxing (i.e., for 15 years) the heightening global war for political dominance with Tarl's meeting with Talena in Ar...what a culmination of a drama begun long years back in the \`Tarnsman'!What 'Witness' gives us is precious little of the above. Page after page of monotonous and nauseating slave gibberish. It became insulting, boring, even laughable. Seemingly every effort is being made by the author to desperately force this nonsense down our throats, as if his impending mortality at the age of 72 (sorry no stabilization serums here) is staring him in the face. I was left (as a lover of Gor's essence), confused and frustrated. I actually began skipping pages (in a new Gor Book...aaargh!!!) to try and find some morsel, some semblance of the old magic. There are a few glimpses, of underground adventure and previous character reunion, which I desperately clung to, but even they are a shadow of the classic Norman as seen in \`Nomads', \`Raiders', or \`Hunters'.He has faded, and with him, in his spiraling descent into the abnormal and delusional world of female dominance, he has taken what was truly a jewel in the world of science fiction."},{"Title":"Witness of Gor","review":"After the long, meandering detour through Magicians of Gor, Witness of Gor is the best Gor book to date.

Yes, they should probably come with warning lables: 'caution, known to brainwash', but, I couldn't put it down. Yes, John does tend to repeat himself, but (again) the story has it all: mystery, intrigue, honor, love, hate, sex. It's told from a woman's point of view, like several others in the series. I miss Tarl, I'm not sure who 'prisoner #41' is..but then it's been a long time since I read the rest of the series, maybe it is Marlenus....I really thought it was Tarl/Bosk of Port Kar. (ouch, showing ignorance here...huh)(hence anonymous-sorry). Read some of the other books reviews, you'll get a good idea of the controversy and the emotions attached to the books and yes, they do change, they evolve, maybe he does go 'too gorean', you have to make that call for yourself... But, again, Hello! this is sci-fi, maybe he did start out with an idea from ERB...maybe it was a joke...but you don't get 26 (27-'Prize...' is in the works now) books printed without the demand, interest, passion to possess, now do you. John has an eye for detail and an ability to express emotion, the peoples of Gor are varied, vastly different, but also familiar, the creatures complex and strong. I wish we lived as one with our world as they do...wish there were not the lies we live with everyday."},{"Title":"Witness of Gor","review":"After finally reading this book I was somewhat disappointed by Mr. Norman's writing. He had \\"Janice\\" repeating things numerous times throughout the entire book. I own every single Gor book in the series and have to say that this was the worst one as far as keeping the readers attention to what happens next. I can normally finish one of his books in 2-3 days but this one took me a month! I certainly hope the next one is much better written. One neat thing that is in the book is the Gor website. Definately for the Gor fan wether you are the master or kajira."},{"Title":"Witness of Gor","review":"I have been a fan of the Gor series since the beginning. I have all original paperbacks with dustcovers intact.

Then one day, email arrived: Witness of Gor is available for purchase. Woot! Book 26...Boy o boy was I ever disappointed. The female slavery-bondage, ok, fine. toss it in, but this book is so similar to the other one: Slave Girl of Gor. I wanted to see what happened to Tarl and his one true love Talena, his adventure with Marcus, Vela his 2nd true love..I was disgusted with this book. It sits on the shelf beside the other 25, but I won't read it again. Once was enough. Actually, once was one time too much."},{"Title":"SAMPAN SAILOR: A Navy Man's Adventures in WWII China","review":"I concur with the previous reviews and found this book to be engaging and informative. Mishler presents an interesting account of his experience &quot;behind the lines&quot; with the US Navy in wartime China, a theatre of WWII that was both unique and little-known. He displays an enthusiastic, culturally-sensitive, and optimistic attitude throughout the book. My father also fought with the US Navy in China during WWII and shared many of Mishler's opinions. My only (slight) criticism is that, rather than a story, Mishler's book is more like a series of observations, sometimes with little continuity. Nevertheless, it is very interesting.Other books about this theatre include Horton's &quot;90 Day Wonder&quot; (a well-written account, although with a bit darker and more cynical perspective), and the definitive book, &quot;A Different Kind of War&quot; by Admiral Milton Miles, who led Naval Group China during WWII. Miles' fascinating and exceptionally-written book is out-of-print, unfortunately, but is a &quot;must-read&quot; for anyone interested in wartime China."},{"Title":"SAMPAN SAILOR: A Navy Man's Adventures in WWII China","review":"I shall not repeat the information above. Mischler's book is well-written and worth the reading. In order to get from Chungking where he flew in over the Hunp to his duty station he had to walk almost all the way.His experiences with the locals were amusing. We have few narratives of his caliber about the everyday life of a field intelligence operative. If you find this one interesting you will also certainly like John Ryder Horton's \\"Ninety-Day Wonder:Flight to Guerrilla War.\\" (q.v.)"},{"Title":"SAMPAN SAILOR: A Navy Man's Adventures in WWII China","review":"This is the best account I've read so far about the Scouts and Raiders in China behind enemy lines.

Patrick Lewis is the Draig-Uisge, an enforcer of sorts for the Druids. He is late to a meeting and thus arrives in time to hear his mother's dying words. Both of Patrick's parents, along with many other Druids, have been slaughtered by the demonic Bak-Farus who are entering Earth through an open gate. Patrick's mother instructs him to find the Phoenix Tear and close the gate permanently. Xiao Fei is the last Phoenix Tear, a woman whose power is the very blood that runs through her veins. Xiao witnessed a gate being closed in Cambodia when she was 8 years old; she was the lone survivor as over 30 monks and Phoenix Tears died for that closure. Los Angeles has truly become the Crimson City as it is rapidly being overrun by demons while werewolves, vampires, and humans are forced to fight together against the demonic onslaught. Patrick finds Xiao and informs her of his plan to close the gate; an ancient text indicates that the gate can be closed using Xiao's blood and Patrick's ability to bend and shape energy. Xiao is initially resistant to the idea as she believes Patrick is crazy. That is, until she accidentally poisons a child werewolf with her blood and cures a vampire! This book is action-packed and has several interesting twists along the way. Jade Lee has revived my interest in this series as the last book was definitely weaker than the earlier books and had me worried that the series was losing steam. Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Seduced by Crimson","review":"I read all the others in this series and enjoyed them, thoroughly. Yet, this one left me wanting. The characters were flat and steriotypical. The action seemed forced. The entire book is of running, running, running. Same scenes over and over, just in a different location. There are brief injections of the vampires and werewolves, but only very, very brief. The demons are also flat and are left with the impression of them being completely evil. Which we learned in \\"A Darker Crimson\\" was not the case.Overall, I found it a disappointment. I even had to force myself to finish the book, just so I would know what was going on in the next. Hopefully, the next author picks up the strings and delivers something with more action and more well rounded characters."},{"Title":"Seduced by Crimson","review":"Courtesy of CK2S Kwips and KritiquesAs the war between the species heats up in Crimson City, a common enemy has all kinds banding together to fight.\\"Find her... the Phoenix Tear. Close the gate. Permanently.\\" These were the last words of Patrick's mother as she lay dying and there was no way he could possibly refuse her last wish. Thus begins Patrick's adventure.Patrick is the Draig-Uisge, leader of the Druids, who has the power to shape energy to his magical needs. When the demon Bak-Farus invade Earth through a gate from Orcus, death and destruction follow in their wake and the world will die if they are not stopped. Being so closely linked to the Earth, Patrick can feel the vitality of the world seeping out the loner the gate remains open. Following his mother's plea, he goes in search of the only one who can help him, the Phoenix Tear.Xiao Fei is a survivor, but barely. She is the last remaining Phoenix Tear, a hemophiliac whose strength and gift lies in her blood. Her blood has the ability to heal the gravest of injuries, it can even make a vampire human again. She came to Crimson City years ago, after helping to close a demon gate in Cambodia at the tender age of eight years old, and being the only one to survive. Now, hiding out in Crimson City, she's about to confront the horrors of her childhood once more.Patrick is convinced that a ritual sex act pairing him and Xiao Fei will enhance their respective powers and bring about the closing of the gate. Xiao Fei has her doubts, after all it took 30 monks and Phoenix Tears to close a gate last time. But allied with the vampires and werewolves and all the Druids, they may very well have a chance. Too bad love has to interfere with Patrick's plans.This is only my second read of the Crimson City series but it was most definitely more sensual than the previous book in the series I read. This is due to the nature of the plot. Patrick believes they need sex to conquer evil and Xiao Fei is resistant initially. The attraction between them however overcomes all doubt on more than one occasion. The sexual pull is increased even more though as something interferes every time they are close to succumbing to their desires. Initially, the two star-crossed love birds fight the feelings between them, convinced their emotions will only weaken their dedication to the plan. It certainly doesn't help matters any that Patrick will do whatever it takes to complete the ritual and close the gate, even knowing this course of action could very well be the death of the woman he has come to love.In spite of the nature of Patrick and Xiao Fei's gifts and the dedication to the cause, they never lose their humanity, which is one aspect I especially loved about Seduced by Crimson. Patrick has many inner battles to face, stemming from events unfolding in his childhood. We are made privy to his history through entries in a journal he kept through his teen years. These entries give us a lot of insight into him and why it is so very important he win this battle. Xiao Fei lived a horrific life as a child and the incidents surrounding the closing of the demon gate so many years ago has left her traumatized. This adds to her fear in present day as no one can truly understand what it means to have that gate open unless they lived through it before. We are given a look into her life through flashbacks and her telling of the story. This made her previous experiences have that much greater of an impact on how we viewed current events.Seduced by Crimson by Jade Lee starts with a bang and doesn't let up until the final page is turned. The opening scene sets the tone for the rest of the book. On a bloody battlefield, Patrick sees what havoc the demons have wrought and must close the gate and defeat the Bak-Farus before they destroy the entire city and possibly the world. The frenzied pace of the story and the desperation to close the gate before it's too late make for a very tension-laden story. I was on the edge of my seat and biting my nails as I waited to see what would happen next. Add in the fact you have rival species like werewolves and vampires being forced to work together to help fend off the demons and the pressure builds still more, knowing their animosity towards one another could come to the forefront at any given moment.Kelley A.

The story felt very shallow and the characters were very weak and wishy-washy. I have read all of the other crimson city books so far and felt that this book was the weakest. I have really been enjoying this series."},{"Title":"Seduced by Crimson","review":"I really enjoyed this book. It reminded me of the Anita Blake series but not as dark and sexual. Once I picked this book up, I could not put it down. If you love the were's, vamps and all things goth, you will love this book and this series."},{"Title":"Seduced by Crimson","review":"Ok, Ok I'm a big girl and can take a furturistic, paranormal delectible love story as good as the next girl. But WOW! this author goes very deep into not only \\"regular\\" paranormal complications but throws a very well developed paralell universewhere the sentient, senstive and eventually sacrificial doppleganger of the lead character makes deals with demons and dragons. Her characters are so specific and \\"believeable\\" as little personalities and her descriptions are so vivid that you can feel the heat and desolation of her paralell worlds. The only negative component is towards the last 2/3 of the book you really have to pay attention because the complexity of two universes, rules and regs of world building are done with such detail that you need to hang on tight to enjoy the ride. Is it worth the attention--oh yeah--but not a relaxing read. Gives a meaty bone of cultural differences, love and passion throws it in our Crimson City stew pot of familiar setting, stir well, take a deep breath and let the fervid imagination of this talented author create a dishy reading adventure."},{"Title":"Seduced by Crimson","review":"I've enjoyed the previous \\"Crimson City\\" books, but this one is not a good one. While I like that the protagonists are unique and not your typical romance hero or heroine, they were a bit stereotypical in their own right. But really my major dislike about this book was that it included a rape scene where the woman eventually enjoyed it. Without giving too much away to the reader who still wishes to read this book, the rape is ignored and turns into a positive plot characteristic. This isn't BDSM or even the old \\"dominant man/submissive woman\\" sex reminiscent of old romances; this is *clearly* a rape scene, named so by the victim. It's the real thing. Enough said."},{"Title":"Seduced by Crimson","review":"I found this book enjoyable to read, but it lacked the \\"punch\\" the other books in the series had. It was difficult for me to constantly have to try and wrap my tongue around the heroine's name, Xiao Fei. Otherwise it was good. I'm still looking forward to the next and final installment, \\"Crimson Rogue.\\""},{"Title":"Seduced by Crimson","review":"This whole series has me spellbound. I hope to see more from this paranormal romance. I do enjoy how the different authors create a sound story through different categories.."},{"Title":"Seduced by Crimson","review":"I've liked every book in the series so far leading me to have high expectations of this book as well. Unfortunately I felt this story fell flat. I couldn't get into the main characters at all. They didnt seem to have any substance. Also became somewhat offended by the American slams peppered throughout the book written as thoughts from the main character Xiao Fei. If these are reflections about our culture from the author then I really dont care to help her paycheck by buying another of her books or giving her a second chance to see if she writes anything better. Overall this book was boring and I couldnt wait for it to end. The only reasons I read it through was to see if got better and so I didnt miss any potential setup for the next in the series. Very dissatisfied with this one."},{"Title":"Seduced by Crimson","review":"Long ago Los Angeles became Crimson City, a glittering metropolis and sometime-battleground-sometime-home for humans, werewolves and vampires.

There was definitely more background on Xiao Fei, but you still don't get the entire story. How did she become a Phoenix Tear? You get more details of what she did as a Tear as a child, and the huge battle that she had faced, but you still don't get the how or why before it. And that was the way of it for all the characters in this series. I certainly hope the next book touches base more on the characters pasts.The same with Patrick. His family are druids. Okay, got that, but where did they come from? How did they get to be in San Bernardino? All questions that you never get answers for. While the story does touch base on Patrick's past - as a kid, a teen, a young adult, you still don't get all of it.Meanwhile, I liked both Xiao Fei and Patrick. I thought both strong characters, they act well together and learn about themselves and each other along the way.The action was great, descriptions terrific. Very hard to put down, contantly wanting to know what's next."},{"Title":"Seduced by Crimson","review":"I love the crimson series, there a great read. This book on the other hand started with a bang. It was funny and had all the characters in place and then it went down hill. The vamp and werewolves where barely mentioned and the demon world was the only thing really mention about the demons except the fight sceens. It was mostly about the two main character, which is ok but some of the dialoge was very tiring to read. I found myself wanting the book to end quick. The chapters seemed long and drawn out. I was tired of reading it by the end."},{"Title":"Seduced by Crimson","review":"A gate has been opened between Earth and the demon world of Orcus. Not only does the gate allow the demons free access to Crimson City, it sucks the life out of the Earth; if it isn't closed everyone on Earth will die.Patrick has been raised as a druid and as the Draig-Uisge it is his responsibility to close the open gate. Thanks to the studies of his mother, he knows he needs to find the last Phoenix Tear - an adopted Cambodian waif who years previously, was the soul survivor the last time a demon gate was closed.Xiao Fei may have been raised by Americans, but as the Phoenix Tear, knows she isn't just an ordinary girl. As a hemophiliac, a cut could kill her; instead because of her physic abilities she can self heal. More importantly, her blood can change a turned vampire or werewolf human again and it is her blood that can close a demon gate.Wow! This is an excellent series! Jade Lee has written a totally engrossing story that makes me want the next installment and I really enjoy her writing style. SEDUCED BY CRIMSON, I think, lives up to its title as Patrick and Xiao Fei have a very seductive as well as sensual story. I think more so than with some of the other action paranormals I've read.I found Patricks and Xiao Feis' relationship very interesting. Both are immediately drawn to one another for different reasons. However both have a very hard time acknowledging the bond that is forming between them because their relationship should be strictly business and is doomed.Except I found it very funny that Patrick was positive that clinical sex would close the gate; as well as Xiao Fei's blood. How could he dare get his heart involved when he knew that her blood would close the gate? Add to this - the last time she was involved in closing a gate twenty-nine Phoenix Tears died. Xaio Fei is only one Phoenix Tear...who was loosing a lot of blood just trying to stay alive.I have only finished reading one other book in this series. There are so many characters I don't know how they over-lap, however I think I might have \\"noticed\\" characters from three other books. I'm going to have to continue reading to find out if I'm correct! I don't know if it would be better to read them in order or not. SEDUCED BY CRIMSON is more sensual than the other story I read but just as action packed. (I think this whole story encompasses three days.) I highly recommend this series and can hardly wait to read the next book!"},{"Title":"Seduced by Crimson","review":"I loved this book! I just kept reading. I couldn't put it down.

Now with the Crimson Veil devastated, a fourth race has begun to emerge; the demons are on their way back from Orcus and once they arrive little can be done to stop them even if the other three races set aside their difference in an alliance.Hope resides with the Draig-Uisge the Druid Patrick Lewis, who knows first hand how deadly demons are as they murdered his parents years ago. Before she died his mother told him to find the Cambodian Xiao Fei, the Phoenix Tear, because she believed the hemophiliac blood of the Asian combined with her son's powers can repair the rip in the mystical gate. Xiao Fei knows the demons are coming to kill her, but rejects Patrick's assertion that together they can stop the horde as she once did with many others, all dead, two decades ago.The fifth Crimson City romantic fantasy thriller (each by different authors) is an exhilarating fast-paced tale from start to finish yet still insures that the two lead protagonists are fully developed. Especially critical to the engrossing plot is the key respective traumatic incident from each of the lead protagonist's past that shaped much of their lives since is understood enough to know what motivates each of them. Fans of the series have already been SEDUCED BY CRIMSON; newcomers once they have a TASTE OF CRIMSON will want to see more THROUGH A CRIMSON VEIL to CRIMSON CITY where A DARKER CRIMSON is fun to read.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Seduced by Crimson","review":"Read all the Crimson Series books and couldn't put them down."},{"Title":"Seduced by Crimson","review":"Seduced by Crimson -by Jade LeeLong ago Los Angeles became Crimson City, a glittering metropolis and sometime-battleground-sometime-home for humans, werewolves and vampires.

Keep that in mind as you read the book because the author uses many of his agency's clients as his examples of brands that evoke emotion. Even with the self-promoting, there are some great messages within this book. The message throughout is that for brands to grow, people need to fall in love with the brands. Not like the brands, LOVE the brands and products. As I write this review, the Chicago White Sox are in the American League Division playoffs. Why do I tell you this? Because no matter what happens with the White Sox, the fact of the matter is that Chicago will always LOVE the Cubs, and they will really, really like the White Sox. And because of this, the Cubs will always draw more fans than the White Sox. Here is one of my favorite take aways from the book; \\"Human beings are powered by emotion, not by reason.\\" Brands need to generate emotions, and the more the brand is loved, the longer life it will have. Let's face it, a lot of people love Starbucks, but there is no rational reason to spend $2.00 for a cup of black coffee. It is the emotion that sustains Starbucks."},{"Title":"Lovemarks","review":"I have met Kevin Roberts and had a chance to chat with him about the \\"Lovemark\\" concept when he was giving a speech in Istanbul. I think he is a colorful and brilliant individual who has managed to package some great marketing principles that age back to Bernbach into a great new concept. Though many principles in the book are not fresh to those who are not a novice in marketing literature, I think the term \\"Lovemark\\" is brilliant in itself. The design of the book is great with lots of colorful pictures and helpful examples. You sometimes feel that many of the examples are overused and the book is self serving, but it is worth to spend some time with the Lovemark concept.I have seen an interview with Kevin in Ad Age about how they launched this book to recruit new business into their agency. I think it is a great new business tool and brilliant strategy to lure customers to their shop.

It's not that I had any major disagreement with anything it says, it's just that there is really nothing new in this book, nothing that I have read or lived through a hundred times before.

If you're like me, and have read many, many marketing and branding books, you will learn nothing new. When you're the CEO of Saatchi & Saatchi, your book is going to get published; if I had written this book and taken it to a publisher, they would have laughed at me and my incoherent writing style. Some of the concepts in this book, by the way, are also found in the old book \\"Raving Fans\\", which I think is more useful.

At 200+ pages, its been distilled down to its essence...which means it won't take long to read...but you'll want to read it several times, cause each time you'll see it from a fresh perspective.With a glowing passion red cover and hard-binding it makes a great gift and showcase addition to any coffeetable, desk, or shelf.

Go check www.lovemarks.com and see for your self.I love my brands, and I'm not afraid to say it."},{"Title":"Lovemarks","review":"Roberts is eager to portray Lovemarks as a highly innovative concept that represents \\"the future beyond brands\\" and possesses the power to transform businesses. Despite the apparent ease with which this assertion can be knocked down - the shibboleth that brands need to touch on human emotion has been rehashed time and again by popular management writers (see, for example, Barlow & Maul, 2000; Duffy & Hopper, 2003; Feig, 1997; 2006; Gob&eacute; & Zyman, 2002; Gumesson, 2000; Robinette & Brand, 2001) -, critical scholars cannot escape the fact that the book has been widely read by practitioners and so might influence their actions. Granting that circulation does not automatically imply adoption (Bender & van Veen, 2001: 42), the question emerges in what ways and to which extent Lovemarks has the capacity to catch on with managers and induce a lasting change of organizational practice.In his socio-economic analysis of the management fashion market, Abrahamson (1996) maintained that for a management technique to find sufficient followers, it needs to appear both rational and progressive, i.e. efficient to attain important organizational goals legitimated by stakeholders (see also Meyer and Rowan, 1977) as well as new and improved relative to older techniques. As a consequence, fashion setters must use carefully devised rhetoric to convincereaders that they have a problem to which the proposed concept is the solution, and convey an impression of it being novel and efficient.This does not imply, however, that managers may simply be viewed as gullible victims on whom guru rhetoric plays its tricks. Rather, as Bender and van Veen (2001: 40) and others (Clark & Salaman, 1998; Fincham; 1995; Jackson, 1996; Kieser, 1997; Watson, 1994) have pointed out, the decision to adopt a particular management fashion will largely be governed by managers' personal interest in how they want to use the fashion and which of its notions appear useful in their particular circumstance. In other words, managers may or may not actually believe in a management fashion, but they may use its fashionability to reassure themselves that they know what they are doing and effectually perform their roles as managers within the organization (Watson, 1994: 216). In this sense, management fashions serve as symbolic \\"myths for managers who are experiencing loss of control and fear, replacing the unfamiliar with the familiar, the explanation for the inexplicable\\" (Kieser, 1997: 61). This might to a certain degree explain why only those fashions seem to catch on which \\"convey the illusion of a predictable and certainworld\\" (Fincham, 1995: 702).In the ensuing section, I will assess the extent to which Roberts' book can be said to be fulfilling the suppositions outlined above. The analysis will take into account both Abrahamson's (1996) socio-economic framework as well as the psychological / managerial needs account put forth by Bender and van Veen (2001: 40) and others.To fuel his readers' interest in Lovemarks, Roberts employs a rhetoric often found in the books of the guru genre - he structures his text around a pattern of presence and absence in which his ideas are offered to narrow a performance gap currently unaccounted for by organizations. The rhetorical strategy starts immediately on the first page where, in a foreword by A. G. Lafley, chairman of the American consumer giant Proctor & Gamble, the latter asserts that Lovemarks \\"will provide even the most experienced marketers with fresh new ways to think aboutbranding.\\" With a leaning on scientific terminology, Lafley goes on to pretend that the book \\"provides proven case studies that bring the Lovemark concept to life\\" [italics added], thereby putting further emphasis on the book's alleged novelty and status differential. Yet, academic theorizing and methodological rigour are nowhere to be found by the reader. Rather, the book is replete with personal stories and anecdotal information by means of whichthe author highlights his role as a hero brand-builder, within a firm that is at the forefront of management knowledge, a firm that has gone \\"beyond marketing\\" (Roberts, 2005: 78). In one such case, for example, Roberts describes how Tide, a washing powder brand owned by Procter & Gamble, was turned into a premium-profit generator thanks to his and Saatchi & Saatchi's intervention:\\"When I was with Procter & Gamble, I was convinced that it had a magnificent visual identity, the yellow-andorangebull's-eye. But back then we only sold Tide on performance. The Tide bull's-eye was firmly in the background. And then I saw Neil Young in a recording studio wearing a sleeveless T-shirt with the Tide logo, and it just screamed possibilities. I thought, \\"Hey that's not right. The Coca-Cola logo is everywhere, and Tide is nowhere to be seen.\\" Didn't make sense. Coca-Cola slakes thirst. Tide cleans dirt. And there is dirt everywhere there is thirst. Tide should be at the point of dirt\\" (2005: 104).Based on Roberts' sudden inspiration, Saatchi & Saatchi developed the \\"Point of Dirt\\" advertising campaign for its customer where\\"The strategy was to have Tide speak to mothers at the Point of Dirt - and to reassure her in that instant, Tidewould be right alongside her to clean up the mess. The advertisement that Saatchi & Saatchi created were lighthearted. Optimistic. Amusing. Ads that brought smiles to the faces of mothers and everyone else who identifiedtheir own personal sticky situations with the stories on the billboards. As one consumer told us \`Everybody's beenthere. It so appropriate.'\\" (2005: 222).As a result,\\"Sales showed an immediate leap, and continued to grow year on year, in some markets up to 25 percent. Nowthat's a dramatic turnaround for a brand that was running out of energy.\\"Here we see at work what Fincham (1995: 711) calls a \\"nave exemplar\\": the organization or brand is identified, some initial problems are outlined, Lovemarks is applied and the problem is solved - with some substantial improvement in performance being made. The inclusion of verbatim interviews lends the story a gloss of methodological rigour and veracity. Both Roberts and his firm are mysticized in an inspiring and easily accessible story about a loved brand which Tide became, leaving little doubt about the cause-and-effect sequence that led to the \\"dramatic turnaround.\\" Altemative accounts of the impact of the campaign are not provided.Roberts' supply of case material of the above kind is abundant. It helps maintain the impression that Lovemarks has proved its worth for well-known and high-performing organizations. By adopting the concept, managers can gain security of membership of the follower group, and simultaneously appear progressive by using state-of-the-art managerial techniques (Fincham, 1995). At a deeper psychological level, they may find its accessibility useful to satisfy their complexity reduction and personal sense-making needs (Watson, 1994).Despite case examples in great profusion, the newly proposed concept remains ambiguous and vague. While it is held up as a panacea - \\"it can transform the most insignificant product into a must-have\\" (Roberts, 2005: 142) - Roberts shuns the discussion of details and questions on how to actually put the concept into practice. Instead, he provides his reader with a list, usually to be found at the end of a chapter, setting out the \\"Five things to do tomorrow.\\" For example:a. \\"Find three businesses you admire in your own category and study how they form emotionalconnections with their consumers.\\" (Roberts, 2005: 80)b. \\"Establish the sensory priorities of your brand. Where are you strong? Where do you have work to do?Create a visual representation of your plan.\\" (ibid, 126)c. \\"Be an Inspirational Consumer yourself. Get into an emotional relationship with a brand or product youlove. See what happens from the other side.\\" (ibid, 206)Far from being specific, these prescriptions are ambiguous and vague. Who are \\"they\\" and how can the formation of \\"emotional connections\\" be studied? (a); what is a visual representation of \\"sensory priorities?\\" (b); and how exactly does one \\"get into an emotional relationship\\" with a loved product (- by becoming a fetishist and kissing it?!) (c)? When putting these recipes under the microscope, one can see how absurd they really are and how action is grossly simplified.To summarize it in a less academic way: the book is rubbish."},{"Title":"Lovemarks","review":"I would not recommend buying this book. As the other reviewers have already stated; the writing is over zealous and self promoting. If you can manage to get passed that you will find the ideas presented in this book insulting; the foundation for the promotion of lovemarks is, \\"human beings are powered by emotion, not by reason,\\" which if you have ever seen a skyscraper, flushed a toilet, flipped a switch to turn on a light or used any other product of man's reason you would find this assertion wholly false.Kevin Roberts does not succeed in this book because he treats consumers as mindless kids in a candy store who have no volitional control of their consciousness. If you believe that, then you will find this book entertaining and reassuring. If you value reason and sound advertising, then you will find this book daunting and outright irresponsible."},{"Title":"Lovemarks","review":"A slapdash mix of jibberish, jargon, common sense, contrived inspiration and a 20 lb bag of manure...welcome to Lovemarks by Kevin Roberts, A.G. Lafley.In today's world, your product or service had better be more than just hype and clever technique. Even better, it ought to come with a market-changing innovation-this book falls extremely short of these baselines. In fact, this book has all the substance of an Ikea coffee table: It looks good on the surface, but underneath it all, it is just cheap filler.The authors of this book are admen, professional hucksters. Somehow, they managed to convince a group of pseudo-intellectuals to publish this drivel. If you want to learn about branding, then read a marketing textbook by Kotler. It will cover marketing and branding in an objective and honest way. If you want to read the scatological, phony insight of an adman then buy this book.This book is, in a word, AWFUL!!!"},{"Title":"Lovemarks","review":"I agree with tom peters and seth godin & now kevin roberts that design is exquisitely important in just about every area of our lives.This book is not only filled with wonderful content, it is beautifully designed. Some may say so what, this is a book, give me content. But a book that is a joy to read sinks so much deeper into the grey matter...As for the book itself - the main idea is that a lovemark is more (far more) than just a trademark. Is it a brand that produces loyalty beyond reason in it's customers/clients/users. And to do that one has to consider the love vs respect axis.Check out http://www.lovemarks.com/about/loverespect.php (if this is allowed)Low love & low respect = productsLow love, high respect = brandsHigh love, low respects = fadsHigh love, high respect = lovemarkSimple, but oh so effective.And of course only the customer/client/user gets to decide if your offering is worthy of lovemark status.Read it."},{"Title":"Lovemarks","review":"It's interesting that some otherwise bright people don't understand this book - because the premise is very simple: you can't force a consumer to buy into your brand - you have to first earn their respect, build their trust, and then develop a relationship with them as individuals - not just statistics. You either get it or you don't."},{"Title":"Lovemarks","review":"This book came to me bent in the corners on the back and slightly damaged. The description says \\"new\\" but that was definitely not the case!"},{"Title":"Lovemarks","review":"Is that what you want? Perhaps not.In criticism of this book is is to some extent the chest thumping of Saatchi & Saatchi's CEO Kevin Roberts.He is very full of himself and I went on the watch a number of videos and to track the lovemarks website.At this point I've not read the sequel.So what did I think of the book? It was awesome.The books is just so well put together. It's a pleasure to read and it include lots of examples. Storytelling at its best.I loved the fact he lives in a man made cave in New York.I'd been reading the following books so I was into researching changes in our economy.A Whole New MindThe Deviant's AdvantageThe Attention EconomyThe world is flatThe Dream Society (Jensen)I'd also been reading a bunch of branding books.This book totally connected with me and my experiences and the other books I'd been reading."},{"Title":"Lovemarks","review":"Lovemarks is a wonderful creation of Kevin Roberts. It allows us to tell the world what and who inspires us to have \\"loyalty beyond reason\\" for them. In the words of Mr. Roberts, \\"Lovemarks reach your heart as well as your mind, creating an intimate, emotional connection that you just can't live without. Ever. A Lovemark shows Commitment, Empathy and Passion.\\" Kudos to Mr. Roberts for the creative, innovative idea of Lovemarks, which has done and is just that - A Lovemark!"},{"Title":"Lovemarks","review":"I really enjoyed this book, building emotion based links with your customers it's a necessary task in the competitive business scenario of nowadays, and Kevin Roberts explains a framework of this, with examples of how many successful brands have done it and he explains the principles that drives his personal view of the future of brands too.Reading the book it's a stunning visual experience, almost every page has a lot of pictures that makes you understand clearly what it's talking about (a picture is a thousand words worth).I believe that every category needs a very specific combination of the values shown in the book, but that it's not deepened in the book and I missed, because it can make you understand the emotion that drives every product in every category. Well, I think that the latter it's our work!"},{"Title":"Don't Tell the Grown-Ups: The Subversive Power of Children's Literature","review":"In this excellent overview, Lurie points out the subtle ways that many classic children's authors such as Barrie, Burnett, Milne, Nesbit, and Carroll embedded social criticism within their stories. Lurie has a smooth, intelligent style, and a refreshing dry wit that sets this book apart from much literary criticism. My only complaint is that I would have preferred a bit more focus on the subversive texts themselves, rather than on the life stories of their authors; but then, I'm not too fond of biographical criticism as a whole. All in all, highly recommended."},{"Title":"Don't Tell the Grown-Ups: The Subversive Power of Children's Literature","review":"After reading this book, one might think that to be a good children book writer, one needs to be somewhat disfunctional in adult society!All the chapters in the book are very interesting, with biographical data about the authors themselves. This book also introduces many classic children book titles, some of which I read later and enjoyed.Lurie's remarks are always very intelligent and realistic, and it is a pleasure to read her commentary. The purpose of the book is not to tell which books are subversive, nor which books you should buy for your children. Instead it says which titles have survived through the ages and continue to be popular among children, even if they are somewhat dated, and some of the author's explanations as for why."},{"Title":"Don't Tell the Grown-Ups: The Subversive Power of Children's Literature","review":"Good book for introducing you, and your kids, to the kinds of authors that should be read by both you and your kids. While the book suggests attention to subversive literature (and in many ways it is), it delves in more depth in the lives of the authors, in terms of what shaped them to write their classics, than in the nature of the literature itself. Nevertheless, this remains an important, and terribly interesting, book that will shed light on some classic tales (as well as, perhaps, question some of our basic assumptions about these stories). Worth the read."},{"Title":"Don't Tell the Grown-Ups: The Subversive Power of Children's Literature","review":"A collection of essays - in some ways uneven - covering a wide range of children's literature and so-called children's authors. The biographies are intriguing and combined with Ms Luries's wit and scholarship, the book makes for an excellent introduction to the theme.The word &quot;subversive&quot; in the title may be a little misleading - &quot;the great books that bridge the gap between infant reading and adult reading&quot; might be a better title but not nearly as catchy!"},{"Title":"Price and volume effects of a devaluation in developing countries (IMF working paper)","review":"I read this book when I was younger, and I absolutley loved it. I'm 15 now, and I still have to say this is probably the best book I have ever read. I love all the titles by Jaqueline Wilson, but this one is my favourite. Probably because this story covers all emotion. It is at times sad, but others very funny. The main character is great, and Jaqueline Wilson captures the emotion perfectly. You can see the character clearly in your head. If this is an adult reading this review, considering buying it for a child, do! This is an excellent book, and even if your child does not like reading they will find it very hard to put this book down!"},{"Title":"Price and volume effects of a devaluation in developing countries (IMF working paper)","review":"I read this book at age 9 and couldn't put it down. This book is perfect for girls ages 7-10 who still have yet to master the art of reading. The story is about a girl who's parents are separated and she moves around very often. She is so witty and good- natured that she finds an adventure in every move she makes. The illistrations are simple and yet unique and I would recommend this book to any girl, around the age of 7-10."},{"Title":"Price and volume effects of a devaluation in developing countries (IMF working paper)","review":"I am 24 now, but I read this book when I was 10. I absolutely loved it! I also got a chance to meet Jacqueline Wilson and she is wonderful! She read an excerpt from her book \\"Cliff hanger\\". That is what made me want to buy the book. It has a lot of situations that many young girls and boys have gone through, including myself. The book shows a girl that becomes a heroine however, there is one small detail that impresses me more. It shows a girl trying to make the most of what her family has at the moment. It certainly opened up my eyes and appreciate what I had. I wouldn't recommend it for anyone younger than 10 because of certain situations they may not understand at that age. Great read!
